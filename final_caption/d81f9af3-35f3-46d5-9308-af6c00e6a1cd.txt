1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,270
I always felt like he was tired.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:14,550
Yeah, I know. I don't like covering a lot of people.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:29,670
Think I know. So did you know?

4
00:00:34,550 --> 00:01:10,020
I know. I know what it's like to try not to do what I did to my family before the three.

5
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:25,990
So, yeah, I was just like, so really I want to hear, you know, I was just thinking, oh.

6
00:01:28,380 --> 00:02:00,410
Yeah, I know. I don't like I was like, oh, I, I can't watch.

7
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:55,200
And I was like, I was like, no, you don't understand what it's like, you know, just going out and doing things that don't deserve to be, you know?

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:05,190
So I don't know what it is.

9
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:22,890
So it's not going to have a positive result on Christmas Day.

10
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:44,310
Doesn't make you wonder if you can't respond.

11
00:03:44,530 --> 00:04:01,010
I've got to remember, I think this was the only one because I really don't.

12
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,720
Good afternoon. All right.

13
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,010
How's the hearing levels? Should I put on the mic? So.

14
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,960
Welcome, everyone. It's good to see some familiar faces and a lot of new faces.

15
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm Dana. How Illinois. I now understand we have a class right before us.

16
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,979
I came down here already to be set up, so we get to see everyone.

17
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,559
This is the largest this class has ever been. I was afraid to see what 40 something people looked like in this room.

18
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,020
But so far, so good. Although I haven't counted everybody, I'm not quite sure.

19
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,870
At 45 I am checking to see if 1755 right below us is not available.

20
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:51,500
That's where we were last year. Okay, here's our schedule of events today.

21
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm going to start with a little bit more of an introduction of myself and how we find

22
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,920
ourselves here in the nutritional sciences 660 Environmental Epigenetics and Public Health.

23
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,639
And then we'll do a quick icebreaker to get to know each other.

24
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,120
Welcome. We just started. Sorry. No, no concern for us.

25
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,160
It's no problem. See, now we see. I thought there wasn't quite enough people there.

26
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,340
We see we're going to be a little bit exposed in this room.

27
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:29,870
But see see about the other room of DuPont icebreaker to try to get to know each other and then talk a little bit about one of my side projects,

28
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,719
which is examples of epigenetics in the media.

29
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:42,290
So if any of you guys know about those now or even by the end of the semester, I offer extra credit for new examples of epigenetics in the media.

30
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,850
And this is, I think, the 12th offering of this class.

31
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:59,300
All of the initial examples came from things like TV shows and movies, but we have had examples from novels, from books, from songs.

32
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,630
There's one Eminem song in particular. So it's really fun to sort of use this as a as a side hobby,

33
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,470
and then we'll get into a little bit of the nitty gritty of the next 14 weeks, our course syllabus and logistics.

34
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:19,670
And then we'll finish up by watching one short video lecture on introduction to this topic.

35
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:28,670
I'm pretty informal, so if you have questions or want to start any discussion, I'll feel free to raise your hand and we will in that stop and talk.

36
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,260
All right. So I'm really pleased to meet all of you.

37
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,079
As I mentioned, I know some of you this is environmental epigenetics.

38
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,720
And I'm Dana, Illinois. I am a professor in environmental sciences and in nutritional sciences.

39
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,489
And I know there are members from both departments here as well as across campus.

40
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:56,090
We'll get to know each other soon. I have a lab that's on the seventh floor of the other speech, one over there.

41
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:06,780
Really beautiful views from up there. We call ourselves do gooders pie and that do the do is me for Illinois good is for Jacqui Goodrich.

42
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,220
She is going to give a guest lecture later in the semester in this course.

43
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,560
And the SE is Laurie Sloboda, who is assistant professor of environmental health sciences.

44
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,129
And then the pie is for Penny PEREIRA.

45
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,620
So it doesn't match your last name, which is PR.

46
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:29,629
But PI is not only the beginning of Kenny's first name, but also a really interesting RNA that we study called PI RNA.

47
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:37,160
So we've banded together, the four of us, into a lab up on the seventh floor, and we study epigenetics.

48
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,300
So it's so great to be able to teach a whole class on something that we study.

49
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,870
And we generally focus on this as a mechanism of the developmental origins of health and disease.

50
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:59,450
So things that we are exposed to in utero or even perhaps pre conceptually can imprint on our epigenome and affect health status later in life.

51
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,580
Sometimes that can be good. Most of the times we're focusing on how that can be not good.

52
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,159
So it's a really hopeful field epigenetics because unlike our genome, which is static and not modifiable,

53
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,620
and so we have things like CRISPR and gene editing, but there's a lot of controversy and side effects.

54
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:26,569
The epigenome is somewhat hopeful, and that's why you, as public health students and a couple from outside of public health are likely

55
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,020
here today because we want to understand how we can harness this hopeful science.

56
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,749
Can we use it as a preventive approach?

57
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,470
Is it an appropriate mechanism to consider for precision environmental health, the precision environmental medicine?

58
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,120
Can we offer our epigenome through lifestyle changes, through pharmacological approaches and things like that?

59
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,580
A lot of our research upon the seventh floor focuses on diet, nutrient toxicant, nutrient toxin interactions.

60
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:04,100
So right now, John Pan, who's a third year student in nutritional sciences, he's working on a really cool study that looks at lead exposure.

61
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,780
But what happens is the moms also have exposure to an antioxidant diet.

62
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,600
So the work is being done here is. Public health is using an animal model, a mouse.

63
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,610
But we also have access to cohorts and through collaborations with the Element Mexico City based cohort,

64
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,010
he's also able to ask that question in an epidemiological fashion as well.

65
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:35,500
And then the endpoints that we typically study are metabolic syndrome, obesity and neuropathology like Alzheimer's disease and autism.

66
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,310
But when you think about the developmental origins of disease,

67
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,400
you actually have to be a little agnostic to what the health endpoint might be because we don't necessarily know.

68
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,459
We don't know what developmental exposure to P,

69
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,440
Phos or fluorinated substances might do to our epigenome and what disease it might inflict later in life.

70
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,510
So a little bit more about me. Anyone from the West Coast.

71
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,329
I know they're having like a huge amount of rain right now,

72
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,110
but this is Southern California and it's now it's never supposed to rain in southern California.

73
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,969
That's where I grew up. The top pictures, the Huntington Beach Pier, the picture here, which I don't recommend,

74
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,250
it doesn't look so safe, is the wedge in Newport Beach, California.

75
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:28,750
I remember growing up as a child there, you know, just being in the the outside, in the environment all the time.

76
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,009
Now, I've been here now this is my 15th winter. I really like Michigan, too.

77
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,379
I like having four seasons. I like being able to figure out how to do things outside in the snow.

78
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:45,970
But this was my lens back then. And, you know, we spent a lot of time in these estuaries with the grasses and the birds and the slugs,

79
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,590
just my sister and I walking around getting to know this.

80
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,280
And so then when I went to Duke University for undergrad, I began to hear about all of these deformed frogs.

81
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,290
These frogs had extra limbs, they had less limbs.

82
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:15,760
And there was this big debate about what was causing this. Was it sort of natural changes in the environment or was it human induced changes?

83
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,900
So this is when I decided to major in environmental health sciences and policy,

84
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,320
and that led me to get a master's of public health in Environmental Health at Harvard School of Public Health,

85
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:36,190
where I began to learn about geographic information systems and how we use mapping to predict individuals who are at risk of disease.

86
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,270
But I still hadn't done anything in the laboratory yet, so then I had the opportunity to go back to Duke University.

87
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,559
It was like my parents saddest day in the world when I left Harvard to go back to Duke.

88
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,280
But that was a really good decision on my part because that's where I met my spouse.

89
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,490
But nonetheless, at Duke,

90
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:03,910
I was going to go work for this famous professor and geographic information systems and predict household level risk of childhood lead poisoning.

91
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,200
But that year they made each new student do a rotation.

92
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,750
And I said, I don't want to do a rotation.

93
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,430
And I said, Well, who would I work with and write on the cover of the science section of the New York Times?

94
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,620
Was this new study that had come out about epigenetics, and it happened to be from a Duke lab.

95
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,130
So I emailed the professor and I said, I'm looking for a rotation.

96
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,709
And he emailed me back and says, Do you have a phone? And I said, Do you have a phone at your desk?

97
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,450
And I was like, No. And he said, Well, come up to the lab so that the rest is history.

98
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:43,419
I ended up doing a rotation in radio journals lab after he was in the cover of the science section of New York Times and discovered epigenetics.

99
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,400
And that's that's how my lens changed. And when I went back to Southern California, I saw it with this viewpoint.

100
00:12:51,640 --> 00:13:00,340
Instead of thinking about the outside as a safe haven, I began to think about all of the things that that we're doing.

101
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,810
So this is the island that I lived in. I was probably right about here.

102
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,740
I was thinking about this and just the density of people.

103
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,390
And there was this beach over here we used to always swim over to when I was little and now it's like

104
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,390
coated in tar and other trash and other things from from all of the boating and things that go around.

105
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:28,809
And then some of you might remember to falls ago there was yet another oil spill and this closed that Huntington Beach,

106
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,130
which is which is basically right here for several weeks.

107
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,180
So you know, this has been a little bit of a long story, but I'm getting back to epigenetics and that's because you'll find it everywhere.

108
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:49,329
So Huntington Beach oil spill. There have actually been previous to that several studies that have looked at the

109
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:56,709
epigenetics of seagrass or other things that have been exposed after oil spills.

110
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,860
So this was after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf, looking at these flora,

111
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,590
but also they looked at which workers who cleaned up the the Gulf there.

112
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:19,920
And then you can see here in Korea. There was a epidemiological study that looked at exposures following one of the related incidences there.

113
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,020
So this is also another challenge to you. You take that thing that you're worried about in your life,

114
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,690
that thing that wakes you up in the middle of the night and find out if there's been an epigenetic study.

115
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:42,990
One of my most favorite ones is after there was a in Montreal, there was a ice storm and people were out of power for many months.

116
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:50,280
And so there was a epigenetics study that looked at the offspring of individuals who were conceived

117
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,190
during the ice storm to see if the stress on the parents affected the epigenome of the offspring.

118
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:03,750
So it's a pretty, pretty dynamic. And when we say environmental epigenetics, we mean many, many, many different types of environments.

119
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,900
Any questions or comments so far? So we go back to the to a triangle.

120
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,870
And then you guys spent any time thinking about the three forces in this triangle.

121
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:26,480
So how genetics and the environment in time, how these impact health and disease.

122
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,520
So what anyone like to give an example of one of these these three forces and how we think about it from as a public health professional.

123
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,460
Yes. My name is Zoey. Thank you for bringing a little.

124
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:54,220
Yes. Last semester I did a project on Agent Orange and how it kind of integrated into DNA and also breast milk.

125
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:04,209
So that happens actually three generations later. It's still impacting tumors and different kinds of people being born with different deformities.

126
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:12,520
Our eye is not there or anything like that. So. So it's the direct mutagenic or genetic effects of Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam,

127
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,250
not only to the soldiers who were in Vietnam, but to the Vietnamese population.

128
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,639
That's a really great example. I, I will share that.

129
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,430
I actually had the opportunity to join the National Academies Committee on Agent Orange a few years ago.

130
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,169
And it was and of course, it's sponsored by the U.S. VA.

131
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,540
So it was thinking about the soldiers effects,

132
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:44,800
but they had me join for the particular reason to think about epigenetics and whether we might be able to show that exposures, too.

133
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,790
And of course, this was also limited to only males, even though there were 8000 female veterans from Vietnam.

134
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,859
The idea was to show if Agent Orange exposure to the male soldiers could impact their epigenome down to their grandchildren's generation.

135
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,090
And we definitely see or hear lots of effects in the grandchildren.

136
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,979
Interestingly,

137
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,549
the way laws are written in the United States and we don't really talk about epigenetics and law and ethics until the end of the semester,

138
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:21,640
but the way that this laws as work is written for compensation for the veterans is you have to be able to show the effects in humans.

139
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,620
And so even though there is very solid toxicological effects in the animal models of this multi-generational effect,

140
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,670
there still is no compensation for the grandchildren based on epigenetic effects.

141
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,670
And in Vietnam, so great examples.

142
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,130
So that's a good example of genetics and the environment.

143
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,690
What about time? Are there any twins in the class?

144
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,510
No. The biggest class. We don't have any twins. Oh, your time, you all.

145
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,140
Do you mind sharing your paternal. I have a brother.

146
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:11,809
Yeah. Fraternal twins. My sister married a identical twin, Armin, and his brother is Corey and was really crazy about him.

147
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,410
And. And Corey is that they have one year old identical twin brothers.

148
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:22,430
So there were four boys under one years old in this Irish family name and Corey, Seamus and Dylan.

149
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,720
And the only way you can tell him and and Corey apart is from the length of their hair.

150
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:38,990
So this is like interesting because as twins, you know, as twins grow, they presumably have different environments,

151
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,280
but they also have different environments in utero depending on when the twinning occurred.

152
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,489
But for Armin and Corey, these two boys were like, joined at the hip.

153
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,360
Not literally, but they played baseball together. They went to Penn State.

154
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,530
They were the pitcher and the catcher on the baseball team. They now both live in Texas together.

155
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,640
So they adopted to experience our Michigan winters. But.

156
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:12,270
As twins age. We do see differences in the presentation of certain disease types and you'll see this in the movie that will watch.

157
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:21,030
Next week, you'll meet Anna and Clotilde. They're two twins from Barcelona, Spain, who have different presentations of diseases.

158
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,379
So, you know, over time we have both like sort of spontaneous genetic mutations,

159
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,560
but also environmental effects that can interact with our disease susceptibility.

160
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,950
So this is sort of moot now.

161
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:44,100
But, you know, many times in order to like sort of investigate this triangle, we've traditionally tried to hold one of the forces constant.

162
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,090
Right. So with twins, we can hold genetics constant to get at this environmental variability.

163
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,749
And lots of studies have come out showing things like that,

164
00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,200
like workplace or lifestyle choices are particularly important predictors of disease presentation.

165
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,370
Now it's a little bit harder, but on the flip side of the coin,

166
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:13,490
we can try to hold environment constant to get a better idea of how genetic variability affects health and disease.

167
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,379
An interesting case here is childhood lead poisoning when even after controlling for age of housing,

168
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:32,030
which lead based paint the state of the housing stock, we still see African-American race as an independent predictor of elevated blood levels.

169
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,870
And this may be due to differences in genetic polymorphisms that are in the absorption,

170
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,620
distribution and elimination pathway for lead, which vary by race.

171
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:53,599
But over the years, it's become clear that even after carefully controlling for environmental factors, genetics and twin's educational status,

172
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:02,660
everything that we can control for there's a third factor at work that we can even see this so eloquently in these two mice,

173
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,670
which are genetically identical sisters reared from the same mother.

174
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,000
So if they're genetically identical and they have the same environment,

175
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,150
how do they look so different both in their coat color as well as in their obesity status?

176
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,410
And that's when this third factor began to be investigated, which is epigenetics.

177
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,030
And I'm simply putting one of the most shortest definitions for epigenetics in this box here.

178
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:38,060
So we're going to talk about it for a second, which is heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changing the underlying DNA sequence.

179
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,060
So are any of the words in the short definition of interest to any of you?

180
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,760
Yes. I guess heritable is your name? Taylor. Heritable.

181
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,030
Okay, great. That. That's one I want to pick, too. What do you think the short definition means when it talks about heritable?

182
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:13,890
Almost seems to suggest that these changes can be passed down, which I wouldn't have thought was amazing.

183
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:21,510
I think it's just I want to see them changing. So I just think that just a plus.

184
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,410
It's vague, right? We don't know. So that's why this field is relatively new.

185
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,370
Environmental epigenetics is only just about to turn 20.

186
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:44,760
Sort of the first seminal paper that came out in 2003 by Journal and Waterland showing that folic acid can alter the color of these mice.

187
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,209
This is one of the problems that we still, still exist that people can't really hone in on.

188
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:57,930
The definitions of heritable is completely confusing because you said passed down the pass down from what?

189
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,830
So are you talking about passed down from some parents to children, right?

190
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,450
Like generationally or maybe even to grand offspring.

191
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,399
But what most people interpret the heritability mean, and that's because we have the scientific understanding,

192
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,420
the scientific foundation for it is we interpret heritability as mitotic heritability from cell to cell.

193
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:32,220
So when a cell divides its DNA on twins from it itself and two strands of DNA, and these DNA have their epigenetic marks on them.

194
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,260
And a newly synthesized strand comes along. And that's the strand is naked,

195
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:45,089
except the cell has these enzymes that recognize this having methylated DNA and it

196
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,399
comes in and faithfully writes the epigenetic marks on the newly synthesized strand.

197
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,820
And we understand that from a biochemical from a cell biology way.

198
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:04,270
Now there have been some reports of multiple or even transgenerational effects, especially in toxicology,

199
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,550
animal studies, some anecdotal ones that are coming through from long range epidemiological studies.

200
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,719
But those are probably rare.

201
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,760
And what happens is they do not they there's a mistake.

202
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,090
And that mistake is not corrected in the reprograming of the effects.

203
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,350
So it's important to sort of think about these two different things in our mind.

204
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,579
What gets on the cover of Time magazine, which I showed in my first slide,

205
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,739
is usually that multi-generational effects across humans because that's just what that's crazy.

206
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:43,520
What I eat when I am pregnant might affect my great grandchildren in 80 years.

207
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,750
That's crazy to think about. All right.

208
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,390
So we're going to take a second. Everybody has a device out, so that's okay.

209
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,500
You can shout it out. I've got a little Google form here.

210
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:07,140
Which. All right.

211
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,150
So if you have your computers open and can get to the form, we have a few a few words.

212
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,670
Just work on one, one, one, two, three, four now.

213
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:26,940
So I'd like to know where everyone's from, what your undergraduate degree is in, or what your undergraduate degree is that you're working for.

214
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,680
Because we do have a fair amount of undergraduates enrolled today.

215
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,220
And then what program where do you come from on campus?

216
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,090
So when I started out, I can type it in maybe.

217
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes, no. Sign in or you guys can sign into.

218
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:06,630
Yeah. Now. All right, you guys type in, huh?

219
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,660
It's you on its Web view only. So you got to fix this last night, huh?

220
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,060
Editable. Sounds like you're eating it home. Yes.

221
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,840
So how do I do that? You go down to the viewer above where you get to and thank you.

222
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:35,590
Right. You want to shout out?

223
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:43,450
I type in for you. Texas.

224
00:26:45,220 --> 00:27:09,370
Texas. Texas. So it's not going to get it you.

225
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:25,660
I'm just guessing that a lot of states and some countries.

226
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,560
I know, David, because I think I did start watching Yellowstone over break.

227
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,330
So I got the part where they're going to Texas. I don't see Montana, Wyoming.

228
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,720
You know, anyone can find an example of epigenetics in Yellowstone.

229
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:00,130
I haven't seen one yet, but you can be very creative sometimes. I bet there is something to do with livestock genetics we could bring up.

230
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:12,610
All right. So we can begin to see that we have a lot of Michigan, not a lot, but maybe six or seven out of the stars.

231
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,240
California, Texas, Seattle, the West Coast.

232
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,650
Couple. Country. Bangladesh. Ghana. China.

233
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,880
Oman. Just anybody's first winter in Michigan.

234
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,300
It's very typical. Thank you for bringing us the warm weather.

235
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:46,209
It was a couple of years ago, I think it was in 2018 when we had to cancel two days of class because it was -30 degrees,

236
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,490
real temperature, and then puts a real wrench in the plans.

237
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,889
But then cold it came and we're used to adjusting to things. All right.

238
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,060
So undergraduate degrees for lots of sciences.

239
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:19,859
Nutrition, public health. And then we can begin to see, as I alluded to, we do have a lot of I think four or five of the six departments in school,

240
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:26,540
public health, representative, nutrition, EPI, DHS, I think some VCE.

241
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:36,210
Then we also have a number of public health undergraduates and then genetic counseling.

242
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,370
Welcome. I haven't had a student in from genetic counseling in a few years, but we have in the past.

243
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:51,810
Is there anyone from pharmacology? CS Welcome to Social Work.

244
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,240
Oh, I think you might be one of the first one.

245
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:05,520
Social work. All right. So if you haven't started on the how we work, are you a more productive in the morning or night?

246
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,090
And then a hold over because we're still we're still trying to figure this out.

247
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,300
Right. Do you prefer in-person hybrid or remote learning?

248
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:22,340
And then after graduation, where do you want to work? You hold on to that and.

249
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:38,360
It's. There's a high degree of variability there.

250
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,370
I might take this and make a chart for later.

251
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:56,330
Does anybody want to share after graduation where they're thinking of working and are going to government?

252
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:06,800
What kind of government we're talking about, like running for office, the Environmental Protection Agency and good judgment.

253
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,060
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

254
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,430
And then the final set, you know, get to know each other would be complete without a pet.

255
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,880
Well, you know your pet, you can look other things.

256
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:33,550
Other things that you share your household with. So I have a pandemic puppy.

257
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:44,980
We waited until December of 20 to get him. His name is Captain Jack and he's ah, he's a mountain cur, which is a hunting type of dog from Appalachia.

258
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:53,049
And he is must have been a failed hunting dog because of his third family name and its name.

259
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:59,379
That from the rescue was Captain Jack. And we decided to keep it and we didn't know because we adopted him in December.

260
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,350
But come that year, March was quite warm.

261
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,040
So we have a lake by our house. It was completely frozen.

262
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,810
And a frozen lake is like a dog's paradise, right?

263
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,260
Because they can just run on the lake. It's like there the walls are gone, right?

264
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,860
And so then March comes and he runs out to the lake.

265
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,980
And he sees a goose and he's like, What's that? And he jumps in the water.

266
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:30,300
And we realize that Captain Jack does not like the water at all.

267
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,440
I mean, we had to jump in and rescue our dog in the water from that.

268
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,700
So then a few months later, when it's warmer out and we're out on a boat or a kayak,

269
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,710
the dog will always climb on you if you're in the kayak on the boat.

270
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:52,260
So now we realize he was aptly named Captain Jack because he loves being on top of the water.

271
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,050
So my children are very happy to have a dog again. All right.

272
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,140
And what sport would you do if you were in the Olympics? A lot of soccer.

273
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:15,600
I think that's because we're coming off the World Cup. And then finally, if you had a time machine,

274
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,080
would you rather travel and travel back in time to meet your ancestors or the future to meet your descendants?

275
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,710
Now that I think about when you find yourself stressed out about classes in a few weeks, let's think about that.

276
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:37,080
This is a missed opportunity if you think of it this way.

277
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,280
So now, more seriously, I'm going to put you guys on the spot a little bit.

278
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,180
Anyone want to share their reason for enrolling in environmental epigenetics?

279
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:56,200
I know some of you are probably here because it's one of the electives for the Public Health Genetic Certificate.

280
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:06,650
Anybody have experience in epigenetics or sort of an interesting motivator they'd like to share with us self.

281
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,790
I guess my advisors, Dr. Mikulski and I do epigenetic accelerated epigenetic aging with her.

282
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:22,510
Wonder my own I don't think that's doing. So your second year a I've student what's your name?

283
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,620
Molly. Molly. Nice to meet you. I think I've seen you on some of the emails.

284
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,270
So Kelly Borkowski is a graduate of this class and undergraduate.

285
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,309
So I've been professor in epidemiology now. So I'm glad you mentioned that.

286
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:44,290
I'm glad we have an epigenetic aging or clock expert here because this tool and there are many different

287
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:52,180
epigenetic clocks has become wildly popular in public health research just in the past couple of years.

288
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,350
And I noted this because like last year we were in person.

289
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:03,790
Lots of people brought up examples of clocks. Two years ago we were online and we started hearing about clocks.

290
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:09,819
But before that, hardly any of the papers that we discussed or things we discussed on Yellow Dog,

291
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,560
which I'll introduce to you in a minute, were about these clocks.

292
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,680
And I'm my opinion is still out on them because at first there was only one clock, the houseman clock, and it was very great.

293
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,209
And it would predict accelerated aging depending on whatever environmental exposure you wanted.

294
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,060
But now we have like five different clocks and these are based on sort of statistical algorithms.

295
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,440
And when you write, you can run all five clocks really easily, but you get different results.

296
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,380
And so I'll be interested to hear about how you think about that as you encounter some of these papers with the clocks,

297
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,630
which are just they're just really great tools to use and epigenetic epidemiology.

298
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,490
Anybody else want to share the reason why they're taking the course?

299
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,920
In the back. Did you have your hand? Oh, no, said Taylor.

300
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,690
I'm from the school environment and sustainability, but I'm interested in the environmental exposure aspect,

301
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:17,570
especially in terms of like environmental justice. I always really like genetics, so I'm just happy to take it as far as you can.

302
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:26,510
Fast forward and there is one video lecture on campus on environmental justice and I'd love to talk to you

303
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,550
about that because that was my first my first passion was environmental justice in childhood lead poisoning.

304
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:39,470
So it is it is really interesting to think about to add an epigenetic.

305
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,300
And there's also genetic components underlying that epigenetic component on top of this.

306
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:54,260
Also, there's some really cool research that's done with just sort of wildlife epigenetics to the.

307
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,470
Anyone else. We go back to this last.

308
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,880
All right. Let's go back to the beginning. Right.

309
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:21,400
Okay, so here we are. All right. So I wanted to share this story with you that I always like.

310
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,890
Work on this class over break.

311
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:31,709
And one of the things that I do is sort of, well, this is I Google epigenetics and see what's what's interesting these days.

312
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:39,450
But on this particular day, I was reading the New York Times science section and was intrigued by this article

313
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,540
that Peikoff wrote that she had her DNA picture taken with varying results.

314
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,270
So you have to remember, this article is almost ten years old now.

315
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,780
So some of us in this room may have sent our our bubble DNA off to one of these companies,

316
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:01,020
like 23 and me, and gotten our predictors back for, you know, certain things.

317
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:07,469
Then, you know, about three or four, four or five years ago now they put an injunction on certain things these companies could do.

318
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,580
But this was interesting.

319
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:16,890
She she took her DNA and she sent it off to three different direct to consumer marketing companies, and she got three different results.

320
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:26,430
So there's not a lot of seats. I mean, we could probably pull that out to perfect, but we're seeing about a bigger classroom, too.

321
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:33,540
And so I started reading the article and there's was a long articles, New York Times Science.

322
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:43,650
But as you get down here, it says, but the major issue is that genes account for just 5% of the whole picture.

323
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:54,840
And so this, Dr. Wendy Chung argues that they've ignored the vast majority of other risk factors, a dark matter for genetics.

324
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:02,680
This is one of my other pet projects is like how people used to describe epigenetics, like junk DNA.

325
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:09,930
Here we have dark matters and we then it goes on to say, environmental factors play a role.

326
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,820
I'm like, yes, finally the environment.

327
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:19,530
And I was like a study published in 2007 demonstrated this like so I'm just here the day before New Year's Eve reading this article

328
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:27,550
and I'm like a study published into End 2007 demonstrated this link after pregnant mice were exposed to various levels of a chemical,

329
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,780
all their genetically identical offspring were born obese. And yellow or small or brown.

330
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:39,470
I already showed you that picture. I didn't tell you. That picture was taken by my boyfriend at Duke University, who is now my husband.

331
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,830
And and so I clicked on this link and I was like, oh, my gosh, they're linking to my study.

332
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,980
So this was very cool. I was sort of indirectly in the New York Times, and so this was like this.

333
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,919
This was my rotation project. I told you that.

334
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,430
I called him up and said, I want to do a rotation project and ended up being at a publication that the National Academies of Sciences.

335
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:08,900
And what we simply did was looked at whether the Mountain Mother was exposed to bisphenol A,

336
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,190
which is this toxins, this endocrine disruptor that's found in hard, clear plastic.

337
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:20,330
And what we saw was that the color of the offspring with the mice shifted not 100%, but statistically.

338
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,560
And then ANOVA, the Chi Chi Square test towards yellow.

339
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,290
And of course, in this mouse model, being yellow leads to adult onset obesity.

340
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,320
Now, we have this is because of an epigenetically labial agouti gene.

341
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,129
Now we have an agouti gene in the human genome, but it doesn't act like this.

342
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,550
So it's not directly translatable to humans, but it's a great tool.

343
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:50,180
It's a great biosensor for whether a maternal environmental exposure can impact the offspring epigenome.

344
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:56,120
And so what we did next was say, well, if the mom was exposed to bisphenol A,

345
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,670
but given a really good diet in this case was either a diet high folic acid betaine vitamin B12,

346
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:07,010
these methyl donors or a diet that was high in phytoestrogens like Justine.

347
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:15,520
When we gave the mother the diet, but also bisphenol A, it shifted the color distribution back to the normal modeled distribution.

348
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:26,140
And so this was an interesting study because at an epigenetic level we could, through nutrition, counteract the effects of the toxin on its own.

349
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,750
And so it was a really fun study to participate in and then sort of led to my career

350
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,220
staying in epigenetics and in being sort of indirectly in The New York Times.

351
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:48,100
And so it's this is just another this is the actual article, I think links to a news piece about our piece.

352
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:57,820
There's also been a fair amount of epigenetics in the news because of the Kelly Brothers.

353
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,490
I'm sure you all may be familiar with Mark Kelly, who is now the senator from Arizona,

354
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:09,040
but Mark is an identical twin and Mark is also a retired astronaut.

355
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,149
But his brother Scott at this time was an active astronaut.

356
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,830
And he Scott was going to go to the International Space Station for a year and ended up being just shy of a year, which I'm still annoyed with.

357
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,240
I don't know why they couldn't kept him up there for a whole year, but anyway,

358
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:28,780
so I got an email from NASA back and this was Australia back in 2000 1415 and said,

359
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,149
We're going to do this study, we're going to send a twin pair to space and we want to study the epigenome.

360
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:40,090
And would you come like review grants? We're going to allow people to to submit grants on what they want to do.

361
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:47,830
And so we all convened in Washington, D.C. and we were like, But wait, how can you do any study with an RN of one twins?

362
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,760
But they did.

363
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:58,180
So both Marc, when he was down on earth and Scott when he was up on the International Space Station, donated biological samples to this effort.

364
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,170
And when they came back, they measured their epigenome.

365
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,850
And in fact, Scott's epigenome changed while he was in space.

366
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:15,340
Interestingly, it didn't. It permanently changed. It reverted back eventually to be more like his twin brother.

367
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:25,120
So that's another example. And then interestingly, in the for 2017 offering, when I was researching this,

368
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:34,530
there was this big controversy that played out on Twitter and it had to do with this new book, The Gene by Dr. Mukherjee.

369
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:39,610
Jerry, who you may have been familiar with from his original book, The Emperor of All Maladies.

370
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:46,270
And what this book was at first was a series of publications in The New Yorker,

371
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,000
and certainly each month along one of the chapters of the book would be published in The New Yorker and on Twitter.

372
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,630
These scientists from Columbia, Albert Einstein, all over,

373
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:13,990
started criticizing the book because of the way that this very well-respected doctor and writer about science described the epigenome.

374
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:23,920
So much so that in the in the next publication, the next printing of the book, they edited the epigenetic chapter and changed it.

375
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,600
So a very interesting point playing out on Twitter. Speaking of Twitter, there's lots of fun things.

376
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:36,850
I don't even switch over to the new ones yet. But so these are examples from from Twitter.

377
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,810
I like this environmental exposures difference.

378
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,120
One And then there are just strange things that you can find.

379
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:52,810
I found this to be very interesting that this person is having a good time and they weren't thinking about epigenetics, but his mom said goodbye.

380
00:44:52,810 --> 00:45:00,400
HAMILTON And then this is like one of the real reasons you might want to follow epigenetics

381
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,480
on Twitter is you get pinged on a lot of the really good publications that come out.

382
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:15,040
And so this is a publication that came out of USC on short and long term exposures to ambient air pollution and effects on the epigenome.

383
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,809
Okay. So we'll just take a second here and revisit our triangle now that we're thinking about, okay,

384
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:28,719
there aren't only these three forces of genetics environment and how time influences these.

385
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,230
We can think of like the epigenome as sort of hugging this whole triangle in all of these three forces.

386
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:44,950
And so there's examples of how epigenetic influences directly with these three forces, but also sort of at the nodes of the force.

387
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:50,940
So for genetics, you can think about that.

388
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,040
We need our genes to produce proteins that then affect our epigenome.

389
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:07,480
If we have a mutation or a single nucleotide polymorphism in a gene, that's really important for epigenetic machinery that can lead to.

390
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,810
Problems. And you've heard of these types of diseases like Rett Syndrome?

391
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,140
As an example, that's a genetic epigenetic disease.

392
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:22,299
And then we also have this like huge repetitive content in our genome, which people used to call junk DNA.

393
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:31,740
The dark matter of DNA. The repetitive elements in our genome are particularly important and concerning.

394
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,579
And one of the reasons we're here at Go Blue for Maize and Blue is that that corn.

395
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:45,970
The maize corn. Right. Barbara McClintock discovered that there were jumping genes by looking at the different colors of the corn kernels.

396
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:55,840
And what happens is we need epigenetic mechanisms to shut down these the ability for our genes to jump.

397
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,449
And so the vast majority of our epigenetic content is what we call DNA methylated.

398
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,029
And in two weeks, we're going to have a whole lecture on DNA methylation.

399
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:10,190
But we want this DNA methylation in place because we want our genes known to be stable.

400
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:16,090
And once you lose DNA methylation, the epigenetic mark, your genome becomes instable in stable.

401
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,680
And that's why cancer is mostly a disease of aging,

402
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,850
is because over years we build up this genome instability because we lose the DNA methylation

403
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:33,130
at this repetitive content and our genes are more likely to jump around and cause mutations.

404
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,420
So those are two like really important epigenetic genetic interactions.

405
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,790
I've already alluded to the fact that the environment has been studied extensively.

406
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,290
So we have examples of diet I've already talked about, like methyl donor and phytoestrogens,

407
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:59,230
but there's really interesting examples of famine even in human populations affecting the epigenome.

408
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:05,830
We're now moving to thinking more about over nutrition, lots of different chemical exposures.

409
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:11,800
I mentioned bisphenol A, lead pages, P force arsenic.

410
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:20,200
You can keep going down the list. Almost any toxicant that you can think of has been now investigated for an epigenetic effect.

411
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,870
The influence of social stressors is really gaining a lot of traction.

412
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,760
The NIH actually has grant funding right now for social epi genomics.

413
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,550
There's been a lot of long term work in animal models about maternal care that then has been translated to human populations.

414
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,880
There's been things like like the physical stress of C-sections.

415
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,460
Can that impact the infant epigenome?

416
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:59,560
And then other things like like physical interactions, low dose radiation as well as child abuse have also been associated with epigenetic effects.

417
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:09,730
And then, as I've alluded to, twins can undergo obviously spontaneous mutations that over time,

418
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:17,500
but they also might just have divergent epigenome over time that can lead to differences in disease presentation or other things in life.

419
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:29,230
And then this may take some time for us all to wrap our heads around, but we actually need epigenetics to be normal to age normally, right?

420
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,930
So one of the things epigenetics does is control the repertoire of genes that are expressed and how much they're expressed and when.

421
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:42,820
So we don't want the same sets of genes expressed when we're four years old as when we're 40 years old or when we're 80 years old.

422
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,300
And so there's this normal programed, age related epigenetic change in time.

423
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:56,410
And then there's also this sort of other thing that's just like the stochastic change that's not that's random.

424
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,750
And that's why it gets a little bit difficult.

425
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:08,860
That's also why it's really difficult to study epigenetic epidemiology in humans is because our epigenome varies by age,

426
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:15,190
and so you have to control for so many things, not only genetics environment, but also controlling for the age.

427
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:28,570
We did a study in Egyptian girls looking at bisphenol A and we looked at their saliva DNA and we found about like 2500 changes with bisphenol A,

428
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:34,599
but we found about 250 changes that were just related to age.

429
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,010
And these were girls that were very close in age. They were eight years old to 12 years old.

430
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,300
So between eight and 12 years old, we found about 250 changes.

431
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:49,900
And then even things like body mass index, there were 500 changes by the body mass index of the girls.

432
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:54,040
And so it becomes a really complicated thing to study in humans.

433
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,520
All right. Any questions or comments so far?

434
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:09,610
All right. So we will take just a quick five minute break, because I know 2 hours is a long time to sit.

435
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,930
And then we'll come back and talk about the syllabus and assignments.

436
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,470
And in the meantime, if anybody has any questions, I'll be up here. If you if you're new to this.

437
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,380
So, yes, finding this room is difficult. Congratulations to those of you who found it for the first time today.

438
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,569
There is a way to get to it from an elevator. But you're coming up.

439
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:35,200
That's the stairway to stairs. Ways is how most people come.

440
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:40,180
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer that. But the bathrooms are down here in the water fountain.

441
00:51:45,220 --> 00:52:06,980
So. So my point is.

442
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,910
It's funny that I watch it every day. I know.

443
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,360
I mean, it's just.

444
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,730
I mean, you see a scary story.

445
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:37,510
Yeah. It's like my hands in my hands.

446
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,670
I like that.

447
00:52:43,840 --> 00:53:04,160
And I was like, Oh, I know.

448
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:15,970
And I was like, What do you think?

449
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,530
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:41,010
Where did you get it?

451
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:54,280
Yeah, I know.

452
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm going after that. These are like the things that I would like to have it.

453
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:26,940
I don't know.

454
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,100
Maybe I should be okay. It was scary.

455
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:46,390
It was really, you know.

456
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:53,670
I don't know.

457
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:20,380
I wish it was like, oh, you know, that might be, like, more vital, but it was how I got it right there.

458
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,860
So no matter how hard. Like.

459
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,820
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:44,960
Oh, yeah.

461
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,460
But it's just like. I know. Yeah.

462
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,550
Oh, my God. Stop.

463
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:09,350
Got for than advanced. Okay, fair enough.

464
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:32,480
Really? I want to talk about the other rates.

465
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,700
I almost everyone is back in the U.S.

466
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:47,640
So I didn't see too many people get up. So if there are some feelings about break or no breaks, let me know.

467
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,370
I know in the past there was a strong feeling for a break.

468
00:56:52,080 --> 00:57:01,200
Next week, we're going to be watching an hour movie and then we'll have a natural break in a couple of a couple of things.

469
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:08,040
So I'll probably send out a quick poll later this week or early next week.

470
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,490
We might have the opportunity to move downstairs. That's this two floor lecture hall.

471
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,639
It doesn't have tables like this, but it has the individual seats with the desks that flip over.

472
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:25,580
So there's some pros and cons, but it's a bigger room. So let me know if you have strong feelings about that, because I had someone check.

473
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:30,899
There's nobody in it right now. All right. So bear with me for a few minutes.

474
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:36,000
We'll go over the syllabus and the expectations for the course.

475
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:45,240
As you can see, it's a lecture format class, but I try to interweave an activity each day and you'll see those on the syllabus.

476
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,500
I don't have formal office hours, but I'm happy to meet with anyone in person or zoom the email.

477
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,570
The best way is just to send me an email. If I don't respond, then you can send Kelly an email.

478
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:06,210
But for those of you who know me, I am a chronic email responder, so you don't get a response back if you start to worry about me.

479
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,290
I don't need to worry trying. I'm trying. Better for work life balance.

480
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,820
You can read the course description. We talked about it. There are these seven learning objectives.

481
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,820
There is the prerequisite for college level biology, genetics or biochemistry.

482
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:30,450
I know that there's a huge variability of backgrounds and if you have concerns, just let me know.

483
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,320
Most people have been very successful in this course because we're trying to teach

484
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,200
it from a perspective of using this knowledge to advance whatever public health,

485
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:50,070
practice or research that you're interested in. If you would want to know exactly how the DNA methyltransferase enzyme works,

486
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:54,989
then that's a course that's over in molecular cell biology or in the med school.

487
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,590
This is more about translating this science into public health.

488
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:07,050
There are again, there are some background textbooks that you can use, but all of the reading materials are on canvas.

489
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,340
And then so these are the corresponding competencies that I hope you guys will take away from the course.

490
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:21,330
We do have the campus site for the course. I can show it to you in a little bit more detail.

491
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,020
If you have any troubles with it, let me know. Like I didn't know that document wasn't editable.

492
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:32,670
Probably another document you need to fill out is an editable, thick set as well.

493
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,870
So these are the background textbooks that you could use.

494
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:44,939
I have a couple that you could check out for me. Most people find that they don't they don't need them.

495
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,760
I've actually been able to provide a lot of the chapters on canvas without violating copyright.

496
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:59,309
But if you feel like you need a little bit more, do let me know. I try to use a combination of these like textbook chapters as background,

497
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:07,080
but we use more of the primary literature to get to know what's exactly going on and what's what's being found out in the field today,

498
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:13,800
and then how will we be graded? So this is a graduate level course.

499
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:19,680
I do know that we have about nine or ten undergraduates in the course.

500
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,610
You are very welcome. Let me know if you have any issues.

501
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:29,940
I moved the course a few years ago from having an in-person exam to having these three quizzes.

502
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,750
I think you will like that. Change gives us more time together,

503
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:42,840
but also there's an unlimited amount of time to take the quizzes and they're open right after we've reviewed the material.

504
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:47,309
So you'll find them on campus and all of the due dates there.

505
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:54,990
I think they're about 5 to 8 questions per quiz and sometimes they're like multiple part questions,

506
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:59,250
like you might have a brief paragraph like an amended abstract from a paper

507
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,940
and then asked a couple of questions about that based on the lecture content.

508
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:09,420
So everything comes from the lecture. It will be reinforced in these video lectures that are on campus.

509
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,390
I'll tell you about those in a minute. And nothing in the readings can help you.

510
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:22,020
But I'm not going to like reach deep down into a reading and pick out an esoteric question from that reading for your quiz.

511
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,720
Then the second evaluation is, I hope something that you'll find to be fun.

512
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,170
We are at the University of Michigan. Right.

513
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:39,270
And there are so many opportunities to go to seminars or webinars and we could almost make this our career.

514
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,630
Right. And so I ask you to go to one epigenetic.

515
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:51,510
Glee themed seminar throughout the semester, and I will let you know when those are the bigger campus announcements.

516
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,130
And then you write up a one page synopsis of that and turn and turn that in for me.

517
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:06,430
If for some reason, I've never had this to be a big problem, for some reason we don't end up having a lot of epigenetics seminars.

518
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:16,650
I do have a whole list of recorded seminars that you guys can watch instead, but it's always more fun to go live in person or on Zoom.

519
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:20,580
Yes. I'm going to talk about Yellow Dog in a minute.

520
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,360
And who is familiar with Yellow Dick. Only about a third.

521
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:30,840
Less than a third. Okay. We'll talk about that and I'll show it to you in a minute. All right.

522
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:38,249
Any questions about these two? Then the 40% so the bulk of the grade.

523
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,920
But this is really two different things is a journal club, an article critique.

524
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:48,830
And so the first one is a group project and the second one is an individual project worth 20% each.

525
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:55,709
And so you'll notice at the end of the syllabus we have four different class meetings that are journal clubs and this is really fun.

526
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:00,750
This is like you've taken everything you've learned in the first two thirds of the class and you're going

527
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:10,120
to do it in the second and the last third of the class who has participated in the little club before it?

528
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:15,410
Probably like lab meetings. Anyone want to describe what a journal club is each?

529
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:25,620
I'll have a little bit more more lecture on the go ahead. Someone usually has read a paper and they're going to basically explain it to

530
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,580
everybody else and then everyone's going to ask questions about the paper.

531
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:37,500
You're you're so very even headed about it. You ask. It ends up being like this, like tear the paper apart.

532
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,510
And I had to participate in a journal club at USC when I was a student.

533
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:47,489
And they picked my paper and they invited me and my advisor to come over and it was like, Oh my gosh,

534
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,180
it all ended up being a criticism of You should have done this, you should have done that.

535
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,399
So we're going to talk about how we don't do a human nature doesn't become too negative,

536
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,629
but this is a way for us to all get to know about the current literature and also to pick a topic of your interest.

537
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:07,080
And so I'll go over the different topics in a minute.

538
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,950
And then so these will probably be groups of 3 to 4, maybe five.

539
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:16,950
This is a really big class. So you'll also learn about group dynamics and group presentations.

540
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,360
And then at in lieu of a final exam, we have this article critique.

541
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:29,669
This is where you pick a different paper, one that we haven't discussed in class, and you do an individual article critique,

542
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:35,370
which is sort of like a written journal club instead of a presentation for the final project.

543
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:43,520
And then that's participation. And this is where Yellow Day comes into play.

544
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,900
So Yellow Digg is sort of like an academic Facebook.

545
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,640
And I, I don't like to use that analogy because it's like a love hate relationship,

546
01:04:53,970 --> 01:05:02,550
but basically it's a way for us to continue our six60 community between Thursday at three and the next Thursday at one.

547
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:09,030
And people have various different levels of comfort in participating in person.

548
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,900
I know we're all going to get sick or not be able to come. We're going to various different reasons.

549
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,910
So Yellow Digg is our space to connect while we're not here.

550
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,720
And so the way you find it is this is our campus site.

551
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,740
This is the opening our opening site, this beautiful epigenetic chromatin structure there.

552
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:38,130
It's in a weird place, but you have to go down to. Um, it's not that far to go to assignments.

553
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:44,880
And then these are all the things I've just discussed here. The yellow dog is down here at the beginning.

554
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,680
At the end. When you first do this, you're going to have to, like, sign up.

555
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,910
And so there'll be a little bit of a you won't go directly to it like, like mine just did.

556
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:01,850
So I started posting in our yellow Digg already. So there's a nice welcome to yellow Digg.

557
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,750
It tells you a little bit about how it works. And then I post an example of epigenetics in fiction already.

558
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,930
You know, I don't need extra credit. So this is this is the one in Law and Order Special Victims Unit.

559
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:26,060
Does anybody watch the show? This is from like 2009 episode, I believe, where they were able to exonerate Detective Benson.

560
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:34,190
Her DNA for DNA was on the weapon, and so it looks like she was going down for this crime.

561
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,820
I don't remember what the crime was. This is the heroine, right? She didn't do it.

562
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,530
So the medical examiner and this medical examiner must have taking an epigenetics class.

563
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:51,530
What she discovered was that the DNA that was on the murder weapon was completely devoid of any DNA methylation,

564
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:55,940
and that's just not biologically possible. Which means that it was faked DNA.

565
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:00,500
And so she got off on that. So that was a great example.

566
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,730
I remember watching that class live. I mean, like that show live and be like, Oh, my gosh.

567
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,740
And then earlier today, I posted about of epigenetics in the news,

568
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:19,200
you begin to see that there's a lot of interest in COVID 19 and epigenetic mechanisms as well.

569
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,149
And so this one is an interesting one because it's focusing on histone modifications,

570
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:30,470
which we'll talk about in three weeks rather than DNA methylation, which is what most everyone talks about when they talk about epigenetics.

571
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,990
So I see a handful. Yeah. You say what is required to write a paper?

572
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,560
Oh, if you want to do the epigenetic, the extra credit,

573
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:51,169
you can either post it on yellow Digg or most often what we do is hold like 3 to 5 minutes and claps and do a short,

574
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:58,459
really short presentation because sometimes it's fun to do it in person and show a clip or whatever you want, and I can do that.

575
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,830
I can accommodate that throughout the semester.

576
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:08,510
Oftentimes we're doing them all at the very end and at the end of the semester I'll have some examples of We haven't had any volunteer students.

577
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:15,260
So there is a point system here. And I'll go back to the PowerPoint for this.

578
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,420
This is this is the third year we're using yellow dog in this class.

579
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:34,180
Just go back to the beginning of it. Okay.

580
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:37,510
So there's a a weekly point system.

581
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:43,510
And it actually started at 1:00 today because when I posted my post at 1210 today, it told me I was not getting any points for it.

582
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:54,340
Um, so we're at 1:00 on Thursday and then the following Thursday you should be trying to get about 600 points per week.

583
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,170
I will monitor this each week. If it's like excessive, I can change it.

584
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,279
But the idea is to sort of is to be active on there.

585
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,790
And you can earn points by making it your own post.

586
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:19,030
You can just comment on a post and you can earn a comment on your own post or you can even form points about emoji reactions.

587
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:31,630
So this has worked out in the past two years, but if you guys feel anxiety over it, I understand it's a it's a relatively new learning tool.

588
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:38,020
So I will be monitoring it. I know Amber used it last semester in my other course, which is a very small course.

589
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,190
And it was it worked out well. We only had, what, eight, nine people in that course.

590
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:51,130
So with 45, I'm not sure it might become a little bit overwhelming for me to respond to everything, but I will try any questions.

591
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:07,050
Okay. So this is our line up. Barring, like, snow days, cold days, whatever else the world will throw at us days.

592
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:14,200
I've had to adjust the syllabus the past couple of years, so will adapt. David Regarding questions of the old dig a little.

593
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:17,870
It's the criteria for posts. Oh, okay.

594
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:26,130
So I can go back to the. Well, I you I gave you two examples of fiction and medium fiction and news,

595
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:36,720
but I find it really nice when someone like reads an article and like says, I found this article on time.

596
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:45,030
Let's just say I got an amber from p fast and in the fish up in tho Scott River.

597
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:49,079
And like what do you think that this is doing for humans, right?

598
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:55,559
So like, it's just it's really sort of an open ended question and it's and then you'll find that probably like three or four people

599
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:01,200
will start interacting with you over that question and you'll just sort of delve that into the paper a little bit more.

600
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:11,969
So there are topics on the side if you dig like I think there's one on like nutrition, toxicology, behavior, so things like that.

601
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:15,720
So you can use those as prompts for things that that you might want to discuss with the class.

602
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:21,500
You can also ask questions about course content, but it's more,

603
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:27,330
more like a of a way to extend our community beyond the 2 hours that we have each week that make sense.

604
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,510
We picked on Amber because they know she likes to think about us.

605
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,560
I don't like to think about how to fix it.

606
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:47,760
All right. So we're here today in week one of epigenetics for Phenomenon Field.

607
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,750
And there are some readings here which I know you probably have a chance to do,

608
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:55,860
but we don't have any readings next week, so you have a week to catch up on them.

609
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:05,189
And you'll see here this is sort of like our adaption of coming out of of remote learning, right?

610
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,090
So I actually teach a version of this class.

611
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:15,899
It's not exactly the same pre-pandemic on Coursera, it's part of the nutritional sciences elective series.

612
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,640
It's a class I teach with Erica Janson on child growth and development and epigenetics.

613
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:25,620
And so I had some videos developed for that class, and when the pandemic hit,

614
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:30,270
we were able to augment them to be able to like have this whole course online.

615
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:35,190
And so now like we're in person, but we have this whole great repertoire of videos.

616
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:40,410
And so I put these videos here that you can watch ahead of time.

617
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:48,329
Most of the material will be covered in class. They're only like 7 to 10 minutes each, so they're not really long.

618
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,470
And so you could use them ahead of time or you could use them after class.

619
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:59,490
To go back and reiterate what we talked about, you can even like watch them into the 1.5 times,

620
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,700
which like speeds up the amount of time that you want to watch.

621
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:07,920
So we're going to watch one at the in the class today. So you get to know it the next week.

622
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:15,450
We're going to watch this. It's now over ten years old, but this no, the PDS show, Ghost in Your Jeans.

623
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:19,980
I know you do, but you have to do. Has seen it. Has anyone else seen it already?

624
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,640
I think you'll be in for a treat, even though it's over ten years old now.

625
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,010
It's it really shows the beginning of this field and then we can reflect and where we're going to go from there.

626
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:40,860
The thing that is listed here is this link to fill out your journal preference or swing back to that in a minute.

627
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:49,139
Week three is we start our series of lectures on actual epigenetic mechanisms because that can be a little bit dry.

628
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:54,210
We couple that sort of we got to get to know the biology, right?

629
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,950
But we're going to couple that with a journal club on a particular topic.

630
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,700
And so this is Catherine Hoyos paper.

631
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,930
It's in a cohort of children from Durham, North Carolina.

632
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,610
And so we'll do a class discussion on that paper.

633
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:15,630
And so as we'll learn when you guys get up and do your own journal clubs,

634
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:20,970
journal clubs are only fun and effective if you read the paper ahead of time.

635
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:24,089
And so you don't need to read every line and understand every line,

636
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:29,730
but make sure that you've read it enough to be able to contribute to conversation during the journal club.

637
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:37,600
Then we go on and we talk about the histone code or histone modifications,

638
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:46,810
and we begin to start on how we as public health researchers and practices might see the epigenome in all the various different ways for that.

639
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:52,360
And then we have another journal comes up in week five.

640
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:56,170
We talk about how the epigenome is inherited and this is like really cool.

641
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:01,120
It's, it's reprogramed very early in development, like in human pregnancy.

642
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:08,100
Our epigenome is Reprogramed in the first four days prior to when most people know that they are pregnant.

643
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:14,680
Right. And so that's why like things like folic acid is recommended prenatally like preconception because

644
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:19,770
we need that on board for this reprograming of the epigenome or it doesn't quite go correctly.

645
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:28,210
So we'll talk about that. And then we have this fun activity about what we would do with $1,000,000, which sounds like a lot of money.

646
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:35,380
What is next week? Six. This is when I would normally give a lecture on journal clubs,

647
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:43,149
but I have to go to an I study section that day and I just couldn't make it work to be back in time.

648
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:52,330
So I'm going to record the lecture ahead of time. You guys can watch it on your own and then this will be a great time for you to meet together

649
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,780
in your journal club groups because the paper selection will be due the following week.

650
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:07,840
Then we go from talking about individual epigenetic mechanisms to talking about epigenetic phenomena,

651
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:12,160
and these are two of my most favorite topics in the world in lectures.

652
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:19,450
So we're going to talk about genomic imprinting. It's maybe a term you haven't heard of, don't worry.

653
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,139
And then we'll talk about metastable epithelial is probably definitely in term you've never heard of like met a stable

654
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:34,570
epithelial is just the like scientific term for those viable yellow agouti mice that you saw this variable that we see.

655
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:42,760
So we'll talk about that. And then we have a group activity about clinical test to evaluate epigenetics.

656
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:52,310
Right. Then, right before our journal clubs, we will talk about epigenetic epidemiology and some special considerations.

657
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,660
Even I have already alluded to the fact that epidemiology is difficult for epigenetics,

658
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:03,290
and then we'll have a fun discussion about different media perspectives on epigenetics.

659
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:09,620
So then we enter a period where we're going to be talking, doing our journal clubs.

660
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:15,919
And so this is, in an ideal world, what they might look like, but I will tailor it for your interests when you guys pull that out.

661
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,600
So typically we like to do two journal clubs in a day,

662
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,490
but I think we're going to have to do three guys because there are so many people in the course.

663
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:31,130
That means we're going to have to be really efficient on our time, be about 25 minutes for each journal club.

664
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,330
So typically we start with a journal club about twins.

665
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:41,600
Then we'll do a different journal clubs about diet or nutrition.

666
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:47,840
One tends to be like a human based study, and then another one tends to be either a cell or animal based study.

667
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:54,210
I'll go to the. These documents, you can see.

668
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,940
So the way we will figure this out is there is a preference sheet to fill out.

669
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,420
And so you can put under this preference sheet your first, second and third choice.

670
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,960
And usually people get everyone into their first or second choice.

671
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,960
And so you see there's twins and the date of twins, the nutrition and the date of nutrition.

672
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:20,910
And then we move to the next set, which is environmental exposures.

673
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:27,090
And typically, we have a more toxicology based environment or some more environmental epidemiology based.

674
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:31,860
And then this will sort of serve as an overflow topic.

675
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:34,350
So if you prefer this date, that's great.

676
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,980
But usually we have a fair amount of people interested in the environment, so we'll have a third environmental group.

677
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:45,450
Then on the sixth, we have.

678
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:54,410
We have lot of we have behavior and stress social factors and then the less.

679
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:00,739
And then epigenetic editing. So sometimes I don't have a lot of big interest in epigenetic editing.

680
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:05,240
It's one of my favorite topics. But if that's the case, we'll use it as an overflow topic.

681
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:16,920
And then the the last day is if you have a preference for the state, definitely pick that preference, but we'll use it to see.

682
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:20,450
Sometimes I have a classic like there's a lot of people who want to talk about behavior and stress.

683
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:24,380
We'll break that into two groups. So that's how I work that that out.

684
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:32,229
What's that? That's on canvas. It's not editable right now. Let me just fix it right now.

685
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:35,940
Well, I'm here, Sam. Yes.

686
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:42,300
I just wanted to point out, I don't know if you noticed this, but we got 11 falls right on t.

687
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:55,480
Yes, I have noticed that because I had to book my flight. So for that day, if we're still in Nashville on Thursday, should we tune in virtually?

688
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:00,160
Should we? Oh, yeah. I'm a dissident, so I'm this this owl thing is recording us right now.

689
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:05,469
It's set to just record every day from 1 to 3. So we just don't show up one day.

690
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:12,580
It's going to, like, we just record nothing. I don't know. So I'm probably not going to do Zoom as well.

691
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:18,400
Like Zoom unless there's like a big need. But perhaps that day might be a good one.

692
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:27,730
I'll be back. I'm going to fly back at 6 a.m. that day. So unless the weather doesn't work out, I'll be back for that day.

693
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:33,370
But if you're not here, you can watch the lecture on Zoom. Is that a set of journal club dates?

694
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,210
Yeah, that's how I want it to be.

695
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:42,780
So just don't Amber, don't pick that day for your job.

696
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:51,430
Is is is it the environment day? Yeah, it is. It's the can't.

697
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:59,910
Well, we may have to have an overflow topic online or the other environment on one of the other days.

698
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:12,410
I'll work it out. Every.

699
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:20,880
Yeah. This this week is what you're talking about. Yeah.

700
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So it's is a week later. Usually it's this week. The nutrition week.

701
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,090
Yeah. Okay. Well, word that things are pretty good,

702
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:39,840
but then we have a pause and journal clips for week 12 and that's when Jackie Goodrich is going to come in and talk about cabbage and action.

703
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:49,350
And she's going to talk about her work with firefighters and firefighting foam, which has people in it,

704
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:55,710
and they have discovered epigenetic alterations and firefighters who've been exposed to people.

705
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:01,170
So one of our few projects that's not a DOE head project, but an occupational exposure,

706
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:10,049
and then we'll finish up the semester if you guys can even think about April today with our

707
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:15,810
last five journal clubs and then a lecture on risk assessment and ethical implications,

708
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:21,660
and then our article critiquing do the following week during exam week.

709
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:30,020
Any other questions? It's getting hot in here, right?

710
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:35,870
My office is really cold today. It's like there's air conditioning overnight to told Kelly when I was coming down.

711
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:40,280
It's going to be really hot or really cold down there. So it's like, no. Okay.

712
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:49,790
Let's take a positive look at this. This was a this is a cartoon that was going around in the mid 2000 because I know I put it my dissertation.

713
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,980
If they ask you anything you don't know, just say due to epigenetics.

714
01:22:55,310 --> 01:23:01,040
And this was like actually really true back around 2000 to 2004.

715
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:07,910
Now it's not so much irrelevant, but I still like to keep it here thinking about how fast things change.

716
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,100
Any questions I know I've thrown a lot into?

717
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,290
Yes. I don't think you made that document. I know it wasn't.

718
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:28,170
Okay. I wasn't sure if you were doing it just now and then. It was fine. Look, you're right.

719
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,310
Ed Henry. Yes.

720
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:50,580
This is becoming outdated. I figured this out is editable now.

721
01:23:50,710 --> 01:24:02,220
Yeah. Eric's like, go back to campus.

722
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:09,780
So what you guys will see in campus is we have these modules that are set up for each week.

723
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:15,270
And so here's our week one.

724
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:22,740
And it basically replicates the syllabus and shows you what videos you can watch before class.

725
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:31,050
The PowerPoint will be put up there. You can have icebreaker questions and if there are any other activities, they'll be linked here.

726
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,930
And so the way that you get to the Panopto to get to these recordings is under Panopto,

727
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:42,270
which I know is usually how we like record class, but this is where they put all the, the videos.

728
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,749
So like today's recording will end up being under here eventually.

729
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:53,610
But for now we have this for now, this is where you can come find the ones that you watch ahead of time.

730
01:24:54,420 --> 01:25:05,960
You. This one, seven seats, only six, 6 minutes and 50 seconds.

731
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:18,320
Welcome back to Nutrition 519. In this unit, we're going to examine epigenetic mechanisms and phenomenon.

732
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:23,640
I've ever wondered why twins look so different, especially as they get older.

733
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,680
So it sounds like they have the same exact DNA. So what is causing it?

734
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:28,729
Well,

735
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:37,340
it turns out there's a whole molecular universe down with the DNA that is modifying its chemical structure or how our genetic material is happening.

736
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,540
These chemical and structural changes are called the happy genome.

737
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:48,470
And in this course, we're going to explore the influences of the epigenome and how it affects human health.

738
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:55,490
In the second part of our DOE headquarters, we will learn how early life experiences affecter epigenome.

739
01:25:55,970 --> 01:26:00,230
This is the collection of molecular markers that control our genes expression.

740
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:06,230
You'll be exposed to research involving animal and cell models as well as human birth cohort studies.

741
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:15,540
This work has already revealed key developmental periods that are important for epigenetic programing and vulnerable to environmental results.

742
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,530
In this minute, we will examine the principles and applications of epigenetics as they relate to human nutrition,

743
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:26,810
toxicology, health, behavior and disease ecology.

744
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:33,590
Throughout this course, you will use examples drawn by literature to reinforce the concepts.

745
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:41,630
You'll be introduced to current laboratory methods and emerging technologies for examining childbirth and the effects of the mountain.

746
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:49,570
Already twins in the class. Well, it turns out the twins raised apart have the greatest ethnic genetic differences.

747
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:58,540
What about calico? Cat owners with different color patches of these cats are due to the epigenetic phenomenon called exit activation.

748
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:07,460
Gardening enthusiasts. Well, it turns out the timing and the color of azalea plants are due to different epigenetic mechanisms.

749
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,559
Finally, what about Michigan maize and blues fans? What remains?

750
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:21,560
Corn has a large and complex genome, which includes abundant, repetitive sequences that need to be silenced through epigenetic mechanisms.

751
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:28,010
Before we begin to understand, you know, when identical twins develop differently?

752
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:35,390
Well, it must be due to different environments or different behaviors, such as diet or smoking or even exercise.

753
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:41,640
But the evaluation of the epigenome. So is that a third factor besides nature and nurture?

754
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:49,700
The genome plays a huge role, too. And what's so powerful about the epigenome is although it's stable, it can be improved,

755
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,720
for example, to make us less vulnerable to the harmful things in our environments.

756
01:27:55,310 --> 01:28:00,020
And this slide, I want to begin to introduce modern day public health practitioners.

757
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:05,330
Apply the relatively short history of what we know about the epigenome in order

758
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:09,380
to improve human health and reduce the developmental origins of disease.

759
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:13,770
There's the work of David Barker, and Collins is now widely,

760
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:20,669
if not universally accepted that early conditions can affect later in life disease and that this is a source

761
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:27,060
of great concern for societies that are undergoing a transition from disease sparks to better nutrition,

762
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:36,120
both epidemiology and animal models. Studies. We can now understand that a well characterized initiating events.

763
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:43,140
This is an exposure to end up a disrupting chemical can have a well-characterized health outcome.

764
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,080
But what is relatively unknown is the process that gets from point A to point B,

765
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:53,690
and this miracle that we'll focus on in this unit is epigenetic from there.

766
01:28:55,710 --> 01:29:02,520
I also spent a few minutes why we as public health practitioners might want to care about these phenomena in health.

767
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:07,950
And the first example I'll talk about these changes over time.

768
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:15,000
We do not want the same sets of genes expressed by a four year old or four year olds or even 85 year olds.

769
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:22,320
And even more importantly, the things that make ones early in life can deflect these age related changes.

770
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:28,650
In fact, in the field of developmental origins of disease, we need to do three things really well.

771
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:33,030
First, you have to have a really well characterized early environments.

772
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:39,270
Then you need to follow individuals. And these can be humans in cohorts or animals in the animal.

773
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:44,580
Studies need to follow individuals over time and measure different outcomes.

774
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,150
And then finally, down at the molecular level,

775
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:56,580
we need to measure epigenetics at baseline and over time to understand how early environmental exposures affect any set of mechanisms.

776
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:05,830
And in terms of the levels of diseases, you can see an example here in the individual who has a bow and arrow.

777
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,920
When you're beginning to pull back, that arrow is a certain phenomena,

778
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:18,270
such as a change in wind or someone taps on the shoulder the skin to flex the arrow away from its target.

779
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:25,680
And the same thing can happen when an early environmental influences change the epigenetic programing of an individual.

780
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,520
You may end up at a very different place across a 70 year lifespan.

781
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,500
At the top of this figure, you're seeing this example at the individual level.

782
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:35,759
And at the bottom,

783
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:44,790
you're seeing this at the population level or an environment diet or toxic gated mediated shift away from the baseline rate of the epigenetic.

784
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:50,730
Changes can occur and affect individuals health risk across lines.

785
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,800
In this unit, we have two broad competencies.

786
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:02,100
The first is to assess health implications of epigenetic gene regulation across lives and generations.

787
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,140
We will define key epigenetic mechanisms in biological phenomena.

788
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,550
We will examine how dietary and environmental factors influence epigenetic mechanisms to affect health status.

789
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,710
And finally, we will critically assess epigenetic research in the primary literature.

790
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:27,780
The second competency will be to evaluate population health implications of environmental and nutritional epigenetics.

791
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:33,480
We will begin by explaining the complexity of incorporating epigenetics into population health.

792
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:40,650
We will continue by articulating potential ethical policy and risk assessment ramifications of genetics.

793
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:41,850
And finally,

794
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:50,220
we will conceptualize the hypothesis and design and experiment to evaluate epigenetic mechanisms of the developmental origins and compromises.

795
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,960
Sort of strange parts of yourself. So there is another.

796
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,870
So there is one there. They're not in the correct chronological order,

797
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:13,270
but there is another video that you can watch after class today that is more of an introductory video, this 3.2.

798
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,890
All right. So I heard some nods. There are some calico cat owners.

799
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,560
Yeah. So at least two. I see two couple of nods.

800
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:25,970
Did you know that the patches were related to x and activation?

801
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,080
I think I've heard that. Is that are they the ones that can only be females?

802
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:42,120
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And so in in sort of in female male, we have two copies of the X chromosome, but we don't want both copies expressed.

803
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:52,319
So we have call X and activation where one is turned off. And so depending on how that happens, you have different there's also a gene for Culp,

804
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,210
for the cats color on those and it can amplify it in the clonal sense.

805
01:32:57,630 --> 01:33:01,330
So that's pretty cool too. And an all girls right there.

806
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:05,530
Are they all? They are girls. Yes. Because. Because boys wouldn't have the.

807
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:11,110
They don't have one to be turned off because they X in the Y. So it's a genetic epigenetic interaction.

808
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:19,540
And there is an example of epigenetics in Calico Cats, in fiction, the Wicked Book series.

809
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:23,139
I haven't read it, but my son had it, brought it home.

810
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:28,750
I think it was last summer and it was from the library. It was on and I like flipped out and I was like, That's it.

811
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:35,170
And he was like, Mom, I don't think you've finished the book because I was so crazy about it.

812
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:43,250
Any questions about the. The lecture, the video.

813
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,940
Did you guys understand the concepts of of the three things you need to do for the development origins of health and disease?

814
01:33:54,810 --> 01:34:00,090
So I want you to think about those three things when ever we're doing like a journal club or you're picking your

815
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:06,600
journal club because finding those three things all together in one study is like a little bit of a unicorn.

816
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:12,870
And it's not a criticism. It's it's just really hard to do all of those things even in an animal study, right?

817
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:16,680
So you have to have a really well-characterized early environment.

818
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:23,610
And I'm sure some of you have taken like exposure assessment from Africa Ranch or Dr. Meeker.

819
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:29,910
Like just the characterization of the environment, even if we're only talking about chemicals, is difficult.

820
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,550
We can't go back in time.

821
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:39,770
So if you have like a cohort of individuals now, how do you who are like 12 years old, how are you going to know what their in utero environment was?

822
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:46,440
So there's different ways we might be able to do that. So having a well-characterized early environment and then if you want to extend that

823
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,299
to like thinking about early nutritional environment or social stress environment,

824
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:56,580
it becomes really complex. And then you have to follow individuals across time.

825
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:03,540
So even most like animal models, you pay per page per day, like over a dollar now.

826
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:11,219
Right. And so most even animal studies are following across time and then think about doing

827
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,790
this with human cohorts and then thinking about doing that across human generations.

828
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:19,950
And then you have to actually measure the epigenome.

829
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:26,879
And oftentimes studies weren't designed to look at things like DNA or RNA or protein.

830
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,820
And so you might be limited in what you could look at.

831
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:37,080
And you'll see a great example at the beginning of class next week when we watched this Ghost in Your Genome, PBS show Your Field.

832
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:46,170
One of the story arcs is about over Calix, Sweden, which is I love sometimes just going on Google Maps with my kids and like,

833
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:56,070
look, it's so beautiful up there in northern Sweden. There were populations back in the 1800s that were only sufficient on what they could grow.

834
01:35:56,580 --> 01:36:00,809
And if they had a really great weather season with bountiful crops,

835
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:08,790
they ate a lot because they knew next year they might not have crops and they might have a famine.

836
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:17,489
And so what individuals and in the documentary will show is that they can trace the weather.

837
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:24,870
The great grandmother or the great grandfather were in puberty or in utero during a time of bountiful crops.

838
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:25,890
So they are eating more.

839
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:34,710
They can trace that back to increased incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic syndrome morbidity in the third and fourth generation.

840
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:42,270
So that's an amazing DOE head story, right? We have this sort of well-characterized environmental exposure by crop records

841
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,720
like all the care as we we followed individual generations across 100 year,

842
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:55,260
over 100 years. And then they say that this is an epigenetic phenomenon, but we don't know.

843
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:59,819
They don't have any DNA for many people from the 1800s or even anybody from the

844
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:04,440
mid 1900s to actually complete that third paradigm of what you need to show.

845
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:10,020
Epigenetics is a mechanism with DOE head. So it's not a criticism, a still a great study.

846
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:20,940
I think we'll end just a little early today. There might be some questions afterwards.

847
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:25,990
I appreciate all of your attention to reach out.

848
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:38,920
And know we are looking out for you next week. So.

849
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:50,860
It's battle over there.

850
01:37:55,340 --> 01:38:05,480
But we're going to try to. What happened to my soul mate?

851
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:21,910
It's like, Oh, yeah, I have to be this.

852
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:34,890
Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's also because you guys are part of your family.

853
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:44,430
And I think we try and say if it doesn't work or work, if it doesn't work, I dunno.

854
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:57,239
I just think like I don't know, I just somebody I like.

855
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:01,950
So I feel like it's like.

856
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:16,550
I try not to put that on the block.

857
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:30,160
And just a few weeks later, you have me and your lottery ticket.

858
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:35,620
I think it would be nice. I like what you say.

859
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:41,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

860
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,710
Are you looking for a way to create a company?

861
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:55,910
Yeah. I feel like I have sort of had to make sure they have money to give me.

862
01:39:56,090 --> 01:40:00,950
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So it wasn't like something like, would you do it or not do certain things?

863
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:07,460
Like, I was writing on the wall.

864
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,520
Oh, I'm. I'm actually taking off work study.

865
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:20,380
And maybe that's what I missed.

866
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:26,030
I had no, no, no, it's short and you'll see it'll start coming down.

867
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:33,750
I think you have to get to know.

868
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:36,820
It's like one sentence. Yeah.

869
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,560
I don't know why that is. Oh, yeah, I was there, but.

870
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:53,230
Yeah, I know. I mean, you have to look like you like.

871
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:57,650
Yeah, I think that.

872
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:07,580
I mean, I think, you know. Nice to everybody.

873
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:32,780
So I was like, oh, I really want to public school and elementary school.

874
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:36,830
I got like five separate music classes at the same time.

875
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:48,120
I think he has he's going to have to go on to another.

876
01:41:48,950 --> 01:42:09,060
Right. So if you were the person I know, I was like I was doing something.

877
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:21,090
Well, I think that's I think there might be something like that.

878
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:25,890
So I literally run an overview of it.

879
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,040
Oh, yeah. That way. Oh, yeah. Oh.

880
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:39,540
Have you talked to like ah that. Cause I know I what was talking about my.

881
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:53,310
Yeah. And over there was like if you're not in the window, it was like it was the opposite for us.

882
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,830
If she was. Oh, no.

883
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:16,500
I think it's good, because with that cost, though, it's just like you send me in this part for me to discuss it with you and you see, like, yeah.

884
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:28,200
So I think it's like, I think if you have to go to listen, I don't think either.

885
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:32,190
But I'm still, I'm still stuff, you know. Yeah.

886
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:39,550
I'm sorry about this. I knew there was something to 969.

887
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:45,510
Oh, I thought I just thought I saw the class.

888
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:49,919
I was actually on 21st. Thought I was like 60 somewhere.

889
01:43:49,920 --> 01:44:01,300
It's kind of a struggle, but I know something like 31,000, I think maybe a few months.

890
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:14,620
So I just wanted to tell you that this topic is worse because we're thinking about classifying it as this place.

891
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:18,570
Where are you from at school? Are you.

892
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:21,870
Are you undergraduate majors? Yes.

893
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:24,780
Cool. Who helps to classify those things?

894
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:34,670
Is it is it NYU it or is it technically German Association of Friends and it like has overall what they are doing.

895
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,840
This has nothing to do with the survey and things like that.

896
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:49,500
Yeah, I think it probably could count one, but are you trying to find it as your biology thing or just as a but?

897
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:55,880
Yeah. Because I'm not sure how hard to make adamant biologically made it.

898
01:44:55,980 --> 01:45:08,030
Yeah. And and I and I think we would count this as a biology for so I think I think yes if we don't use like our biological right.

899
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:11,580
Like, which we wouldn't find classified as more of just like.

900
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:16,260
Yeah, I think, I think it's fine to leave the textbook.

901
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:19,260
Some primary limits are something, you know.

902
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:30,750
So I think because I think it would be fine if Jillian wants to reach out to a window in the syllabus, I think that says it would be fine.

903
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:43,250
What's the criteria? Is that 80% I really thought it was a lot, but I don't know because of anything that was say anything.

904
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:52,829
Yeah. So I was like, I mean some and I think that's fine because some of it is clearly policy that we'll talk about that it's policy based on science.

905
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:57,090
So that's still science. But I think, you know most of that.

906
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,740
Yeah, I think you'll skip it's 80%. No problem.

907
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:08,460
Yeah. Except maybe that last lecture, eternal journal, I think, without the science says, is everything from different areas.

908
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,320
Right. I'm going to use a little bit more. Oh, really?

909
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:16,170
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I know, I.

910
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:25,130
I just. I think that that's okay.

911
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:32,010
You feel like you have some of the scientific foundation for the course?

912
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,270
Last year was the first time I had a fair amount of undergrad.

913
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:41,790
Usually it was like two or three or four, and last year I think I had nine or ten too, and everyone did [INAUDIBLE] okay.

914
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:49,260
And I tried to like spread out like in the groups to sort of make sure that we have undergrads and grads in there.

915
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,690
And it hasn't been a problem for us. All right.

916
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:55,890
Thanks for asking. Yeah, I think that's just like a hold it probably news.

917
01:46:55,890 --> 01:47:00,810
Just update that. I think that's probably something before. Are you both public health majors or different majors?

918
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,510
Yeah, I think it's probably from that.

919
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:10,469
From before we had so many public health majors as a public health major, you guys have a good background to be in this course.

920
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:19,590
So sometimes we'd get people from. Other majors, like pre-law and stuff like comedy, didn't have any science, and it would be a little bit harder.

921
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,770
Yeah, no, that's fine. Well, thank you. Thank you so much for being here.

922
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:28,890
It's a wonderful day. Yeah. Engineering something for sure.

923
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:45,700
You. I schedules next my next class in the same room two sites kind of thinking I think he was in the class there.

924
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,170
So there's a lot of people trying to get to know here.

925
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:54,870
Yeah. What's your name? So? So what's Majorie from?

926
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:58,439
IBS. Yes. Senior year.

927
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:09,030
Yeah, senior year for. My oldest is a freshman in high school, so it's like a whole new era for us.

928
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:12,960
What's class next? It's 314.

929
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:19,569
It's with Emily. Oh, the baby.

930
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:23,590
The beat. No, not the big. Must be her smaller class to go to popular culture.

931
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:28,360
Public school? Yeah. And if we end up moving in, I'll just be downstairs.

932
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:32,260
So you just come up for a walk? Yeah. Yeah.

933
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:38,500
I need to do one more thing. You think that they automatically log you out of things they don't?

934
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:53,050
Do you know what you're going to do after graduation yet? Honey, go to med school.

935
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:59,950
In the application process. That's what two of the classmates were asking you about.

936
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:03,640
If you could classify this course as a science course for medicine.

937
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:16,010
Yes. It'll be interesting to see the data.

938
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:20,300
Now that we've had several cohorts of undergraduates, public health majors,

939
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:25,430
how med school applications are going, it seems like it would be a good major.

940
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:28,870
Yeah, I think it establishes a good background. Yeah.

941
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:35,560
I think last time I checked, like, freshmen or something was like 30% to go to med school.

942
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:43,240
Yeah. Like, half of the classes are like pre-med kids.

943
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:53,360
