1
00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:06,017
Okay, so I want to talk to you about what mindfulness is, and this is something we probably hear a lot about.

2
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:14,547
There's probably a variety of different experience levels with it. But I want to break it down and make it as simple and easy to do as possible.

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,967
And I also want to give you a little bit of the why.

4
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:27,317
So a basic definition for mindfulness is that it is paying attention, on purpose to the present moment

5
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:31,247
without judgement. Seems simple enough, right?

6
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:35,087
But often we are thinking about the past,

7
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:42,137
what happened yesterday, what we did or didn't do, the last conversation that we just had, or we are thinking about the future.

8
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:47,567
What's coming up next? What do we need to do? And we actually don't spend

9
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:52,817
nearly as much time as we think just this moment.

10
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:59,627
And actually, if we were spending more time in our present moment, we would find probably less stress there,

11
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:08,357
more enjoyment there and collecting more of the information there that helps us to figure out how to move forward.

12
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:14,597
So if we think about our usual way of being, is kind of being in our head all over the place, past, present,

13
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:21,017
future, mindfulness is just setting aside time to say, okay, for right now, I'm going to be right here,

14
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:30,797
in the hear and now. One reason why this is important, is that it improves our relationships when we're actually present and listening,

15
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:35,897
we get more enjoyment out of them, because we're kind of like soaking it in and savoring the moment.

16
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:42,677
But it also tends to reduce anxiety, depression, it gives us more clarity and mental efficiency.

17
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:44,927
And when we're trying to think about changing,

18
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:55,007
so if you think back to the module on self help, if we want to insert new behaviors, we have to pause long enough to even notice what we're doing.

19
00:01:55,007 --> 00:02:02,867
So mindfulness is a great tool for building self awareness, which is one of our key characteristics, helps us know how we're doing,

20
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:13,447
what we're doing, and it helps us shift and pivot and insert new things, because we paused long enough to just notice what's happening.

21
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:19,757
A lot of people, when they think of mindfulness, they think about meditation. And some people think that it has a religious component to it,

22
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:27,577
and I want to be clear that there are religious orientations that include meditation and mindfulness,

23
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:34,227
but mindfulness can be done without any religious affiliation or orientation at all.

24
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:42,117
I'm also talking about mindfulness on the go or mindfulness in motion, because I tend to find that that's the easiest place to start.

25
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:45,717
So if you're thinking about meditation, where people meditate for 20 minutes,

26
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:50,157
you do that if you have a yoga practice or a meditation practice like that, that's great.

27
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:53,997
A lot of people can build to that.

28
00:02:53,997 --> 00:03:00,477
But sometimes people do that, and then they leave their mindfulness practice and they are not mindful throughout the whole day.

29
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:08,097
We're talking about little bits and pieces of mindfulness throughout our day that help us to move to our day better.

30
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:12,807
The other thing that it also gets confused with. So meditation is one way to be mindful,

31
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,957
it's not the only way, we're going to learn lots of different ways.

32
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:22,497
I actually find, like if you're anything like me, that's the one that is maybe the most kind of foreign and difficult to learn.

33
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:28,907
But as you're doing these other bite-sized pieces, you can build up to those bigger levels if you want.

34
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:37,787
It's also not mindlessness. So when we Netflix binge for hours, play video games for hours, scroll social media for hours,

35
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:43,397
we're usually kind of mindless, like we're like what? We can lose time, like where did the time go?

36
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:50,557
Mindfulness is more like being fully checked into the moment, and really kind of savoring it.

37
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:59,187
So there's some distinction there, mindlessness does relax us sometimes, but it's not the same thing as being mindful.

38
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:04,957
So, I think the key thing with starting a mindfulness practice is number one,

39
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:12,147
you know, I'm big on my two minutes twice a day, pick a practice, try out some in these little short increments, and see what you like best,

40
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:18,367
I'll give you some ideas there. The other thing is that you've got to figure out what works for you.

41
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,407
I know I was trying to do what other people were doing for mindfulness,

42
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:29,167
and it wasn't working until one day somebody showed me an eating mindfulness exercise where you just slow down and savor food.

43
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:35,757
I love food and as soon as I felt what it was like to just be in the moment, savoring, slowing down, enjoying,

44
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:43,837
I was like, oh, this is what mindfulness feels like. Now I can bring that way of being, that vibe, that mood to other things.

45
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:48,127
So I'm gonna give you some ideas and then you're going to try them out,

46
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:52,957
hopefully in like a little two minute increments and you're gonna kind of find like what's your mindfulness?

47
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:56,977
Like how people love languages, that you're going to find kind of what's your what's your thing,

48
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:05,437
what what works best for you? One way, and the simplest way is just taking a few deep breaths,

49
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:10,097
and noticing what it feels like. Easy peasy, simple mindfulness.

50
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:16,467
We've also talked about, you know, checking in with ourselves and asking ourselves what am I feeling, what's floating around right now?

51
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:20,607
That's mindfulness. But some of us get a little fidgety

52
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:27,987
and we need things to do with our mindfulness. So you're going to get a lot of different little break out activities that you can do and try.

53
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:35,737
But think about some of the things that you do every day, that you could do mindfully. You can run mindfully or walk mindfully.

54
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:41,437
You're out and you're noticing what your body feels like, you're noticing what the air feels like,

55
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:46,207
and you're just kind of breathing and being in the moment. What we're not doing is thinking about what's happened before,

56
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:50,287
what happened that was going to happen next, we're just

57
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:55,757
running. Noticing what it feels like. We're not labeling our form good or bad,

58
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:59,767
we're just doing it. If we're walking, we might even be noticing like

59
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:09,707
what does it feel like every time my feet contact the ground? What does it feel like to be supported and in contact with the ground?

60
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:15,367
You can dance mindfully. You can just listen to music mindfully.

61
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:22,207
Think about what is it that you do in your day-to-day life where for a moment everything kind of just falls back, and

62
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,627
you're just being? That's probably going to give you a little bit of a hint of where to start with your mindfulness.

63
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:35,587
Another easy place is with basic self care stuff, like showers, showers are mindfulness magic.

64
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:41,017
If when you're in there, you're not thinking about yesterday, and what's coming up next in the day. Your best noticing,

65
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:47,347
what does water feel like on my scalp? What does it feel like on my back? What does it feel like on the back on my knee?

66
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:54,487
What is this soap smell like? And you're just letting yourself, you're noticing the temperature of the water,

67
00:06:54,487 --> 00:07:01,097
you're noticing what the water sounds like. So mindfulness often brings in our five senses, noticing what it looks like

68
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,347
as it rolls down the walls.

69
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:12,637
You're just kind of letting yourself be in that moment and knowing once it's over, you can go back to all the things floating around in your mind.

70
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:16,867
You can cook and clean mindfully. You can eat and drink mindfully.

71
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:25,557
So if you make tea or a smoothie, just noticed  the flavors, textures, temperatures, the smells.

72
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:32,467
Let yourself savor it, enjoy it. Other things you can do, activities, crafts.

73
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:37,237
I love fingerpainting, because we don't worry about making it perfect. Just get some paint out,

74
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:40,417
squeeze it. You can just draw circles or something simple and breath.

75
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:47,227
You can write a word like breath and just trace it with your fingers and just see what colors are getting you life.

76
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:52,377
Blow bubbles. That gets you breathing, and also just watching them float away.

77
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:54,897
So try some of these different activities.

78
00:07:54,897 --> 00:08:04,747
Think of mindfulness as a time where it's almost like when you're you're shutting down your computer, letting it reboot. You're pausing,

79
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:13,327
breathing, checking in and know when you come out of that moment, you're typically going to have a little bit more clarity and efficiency.

80
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:18,947
But our goal is just to be more present for ourselves and for our life day-to-day. So try it out,

81
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:27,137
practice it, see what happens. I always tell people two minutes itself, may not make a world of difference, but two minutes, twice a day for two weeks,

82
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,847
you'll probably really start noticing that.
