1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:16,080
There's all this stuff to show for the model and ask you a couple questions after class.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,280
Okay. Of course I tried that.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:32,790
You know, I don't know what it's like and.

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:56,720
One of the qualities being every device with that big sell to the customer.

5
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,110
This maneuver is just about right.

6
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,130
Yes, it is.

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,210
Okay. So today is just our project Workday. So I wanted to give you some free time to work on your projects.

8
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,540
And I'm happy to just wander around the room and answer any questions you have as you work on your projects.

9
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,140
I did make a few changes. We will have Lisa Fraser as a guest lecturer on Wednesday, so I thought we'd do the Hammer Brain kind of case study.

10
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:43,290
I'd like for you to each do the kind of main reading here, which is talks about this kind of example,

11
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,310
and it's a set of articles from the journal Health Affairs from about ten years ago.

12
00:01:48,150 --> 00:02:00,480
But it has this kind of case study here about some medications designed to or a fictitious medication suit designed to work on migraines.

13
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,520
And it talks about various types of evidence out there in in and various studies.

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,989
And then there are kind of several different perspectives that you can take to interpreting

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,150
this evidence or using this evidence about how the FDA might use this information.

16
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:30,390
Patients that are outcomes research institute or quarry, insurance companies, ethicists, consumer patient advocates, so forth.

17
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,340
So there are a bunch of other readings here. And based on your last name, I'd like for you to read just one or two of these.

18
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:47,580
So you're welcome to read them all, but you might not want to. So I'd like you to read one or two of these, depending on your your last name.

19
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,810
So Cath Abrahams first and you read the couple on FDA and then come to class discussing

20
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,740
this campaign hypothetical kind of case study example about how the FDA might

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,600
think about using or not using this evidence or who who should be using this evidence

22
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,780
and how should they interpret this evidence for their their decision making?

23
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:19,060
Any questions? So we read the first one and then take a couple three.

24
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,010
Yeah. So so you read the first one which kind of describes this case study here, Hammer,

25
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,370
Crane and the trials that are done to evaluate how effective it is for preventing migraines.

26
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:41,070
And then then, you know, if you're doing the FDA, you read this Griffin article, for example, that talks about how.

27
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,660
Yeah. And so they're already kind of.

28
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,860
So they'll give you some of their perspective perspective here.

29
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,490
So like the Griffin here is an associate director of policy development at FDA.

30
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:06,600
And, you know, anyway, so these people wrote an article on their perspectives on how they think FDA should interpret or use this evidence.

31
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,420
Now, you can kind of go along with that or you can have slightly different perspectives on it as well.

32
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,770
That's that's fine. Yeah.

33
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:27,450
So but this might be, you know, useful background for you to read to to discuss how the FDA might, might think about using this data.

34
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,230
And I guess, you know, a big thing about this is discussing, you know,

35
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,840
were thinking about evidence from randomized trials versus observational data and and how

36
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,100
should we or should we not use data from those different kinds of study types because.

37
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,810
And one of the things that kind of strengths and limitations and concerns with the various studies.

38
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,590
So that'll be Wednesday. So we'll do that on Wednesday. Yeah.

39
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,250
And then because I kind of that was originally going to be next Tuesday we'll have another primer.

40
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:18,089
Sorry, next Monday we'll have another project work down next Monday and a couple of other classes that Thanksgiving and another project work day.

41
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,260
And then I've got a different guest speaker who's coming in of our last day of class on November 30th.

42
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,370
Ellen can identify in December anyway, so I wanted to have a few.

43
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,360
We've got a Project Workday today, we've got one next Monday and then another one near the end of November.

44
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,270
So hopefully in addition, all the time you're working on this is be, you know, additional time for you to kind of work on these other projects.

45
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,110
Also, I'd like to meet on the four for our assignments.

46
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,470
We have this assignment I've called.

47
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:04,489
The model review. And this is just I want to make sure that I meet with each group and discuss your analysis,

48
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,350
how you're, you know, kind of go through the methods and the methods actually proposed the methods.

49
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,319
And I just like to meet with the groups and see how it's coming along, make sure you're actually able to get some numbers out of your analysis.

50
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,710
That's kind of what this model review is all about. Happy to do that.

51
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,530
If you schedule a time to do that or we could, I'm happy to do that during one of these project work days as well, if that's if that makes sense,

52
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:39,440
although I'd like to have you do this sometime in mid-November as opposed to like a week or two before your your final presentations.

53
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:49,290
Any questions or any other stress? Well, with that, I'll stop talking and just let you guys work on your projects and just raise your hand.

54
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,220
Let me know if you have any questions. Want me to answer anything for you? Yeah.

55
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,190
I was hoping I could show you something. The general question.

56
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:05,940
No, no, no. Sorry. This is for my project. Sure. So my team is having a hard time today.

57
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:14,190
Apparently. Say something. So I'm here for this part and we'll win it for the final draft.

58
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,250
People. People. Just cause I know we have the same.

59
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,800
So I needed to show you, like, where we ended up.

60
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,880
Oh, yeah, I'm doing it today. Analysis.

61
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:35,340
And so. So we have like the class and qualities for each of the outcomes.

62
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,400
So since it's my last day then I wasn't sure I was doing these calculations right.

63
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,200
So the cost of all these again come from other other studies and like government data already.

64
00:07:49,560 --> 00:08:08,430
So I have like what I'm going to use, for example, you said so here you see your band, you have one half of 1% chance of becoming a smoker this year.

65
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,600
That's for your smoker.

66
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,920
So what are these numbers for? 5.5?

67
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,200
So these costs are though, like $20,000.

68
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,250
I think you get the first four register plus like a ten is the thing and the budget for it.

69
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,430
But non ATF and I aware of the resistance you get equal for other net that the cost like

70
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,320
under the status quo scenario it's just the 20 something thousand dollars for smoker.

71
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,110
Yeah I mean this is the business.

72
00:08:48,240 --> 00:09:02,580
Oh okay this is based on oh I said I do more to pay somebody and you get those technicians somewhere where your estimates for France or Germany,

73
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:13,260
this is the population of people who are going to turn 21 times like 20 something thousand dollars health care costs.

74
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,320
We do budget increase and budget increase.

75
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:32,440
Okay, so you got me in the okay, so that's a 3.40 and then this is just going to go first.

76
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,479
Okay. So then for the we plug in like the actual numbers from the study.

77
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,400
So I think it's like for insertion smokers and then 35 for smokers.

78
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:51,960
So that's where we got the qualities from. So then I did it.

79
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,430
I did. I came for the I e r analysis.

80
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,120
I think I put this in the wrong. So ordinarily it should be the bigger one on top.

81
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:11,670
But I just like added up all the cause and all the qualities for each scenario and that's like what is in here?

82
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:21,870
Because it shows these values added together. And the difference in each by course over all is skip.

83
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,170
So I think, I think this looks good and just have one.

84
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,110
So this started to do that sense that we should look at.

85
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:46,170
So one is the I searched for the effectiveness of patients the cost of the intervention you have there see this challenge you see the about budget.

86
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,860
So that is, if I understand correctly your.

87
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,570
Yeah. So I started to search, which is what you were.

88
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,080
I do so many things, but she's so broken down in specific.

89
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,640
If you want to read the contents of three letters, you're just a kid.

90
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,760
We just think it's great to be with you.

91
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,370
She's 30 estimates,

92
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:34,990
which is we'll just have to say this for each of them because because the initial estimate of the mortality rate is 1 to 1 that we can monitor.

93
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,660
So do you want me to explain? I can associated with to.

94
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,830
In order to actually. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

95
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:54,070
I just have placeholders. I'm really close by where you can see inquiries for each intervention.

96
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,800
That's right. For so yeah.

97
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:16,839
I was concerned that if you're going to work with a of it is this possibility you may have to pull out to the person.

98
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,300
This project is not ready yet. Where it is a table is for prevention and try to look for data.

99
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:33,490
And then I also have the document for feedback from September. So I think I just I think that looks good.

100
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:40,870
You've got to do that. But then the sheet, I also want to set up like a sort of sensitivity analysis, like the health care cost,

101
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:53,510
not intervention costs, something that's something that smokers, the nonsmokers nonsmokers is controlling so much.

102
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,200
So this work we also have like the Markov models as well,

103
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,880
but like this for this principle suggest that the ministry for this would first cohort as people people this is.

104
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:17,770
Okay so my next question is like growing up as that we need to to expand on this or is this good

105
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,139
as a sample in the markup model can kind of show like the cumulative like over the 75 years.

106
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,110
And so I think this is and this is this is good for six months or something about this.

107
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,819
It's a bit challenging.

108
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:40,060
Here is there's a little prevention mismatch because we have the ATF and prisons across for one year to spend on benefits for a lifetime.

109
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,260
And so that's something where the decision to treat this,

110
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:56,290
it says presumably your head knows it's the number of people for the next year around every year by expanding.

111
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:05,090
But if you're if you're doing that you're getting benefits not only for the cohort turning out.

112
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,809
Actually we found out that during COVID the government raised the smoking age to 21,

113
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,880
but like it didn't get that much news because like, you know, it's like a huge economy.

114
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,530
So you don't think that, okay, so don't get paid.

115
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:32,830
So couple months. 38.31 so when you have to the those benefits,

116
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,580
but I think I think you could actually do that I just kind of think replicating

117
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:46,330
sort of over or someone else is too smart for this kind of analysis we have here.

118
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:57,760
So this is so logically how we're doing it or in October 2012 here, there's you know,

119
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,140
I'm not saying you have to replicate this worksheet several times.

120
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:12,850
I think if you kind of reorganize some of the key calculations in your treatments, we're like, the hardest thing to do is just trying to think error.

121
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:22,080
So it's really changing from year to year. Is that over 30 years, especially with the trial or sentencing program?

122
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,950
Yeah, I have that for projections. Yeah.

123
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,990
Like in that article said something like just so you're curious, doesn't population presumably your, you know,

124
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:44,980
ATF in prison in which states which you took away the people you just have you difference going 21 or 1% or become smokers.

125
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:57,970
I'm going to pretend that there is a nice presentation of people there, but I can tell you something.

126
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,730
Okay. So she's right. And do it for all 75 years.

127
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,660
That's what we've lost.

128
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:15,040
You ask me what I would do. I would try to work out 1030 full costume awards.

129
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,420
And I do all the calculations you've discussed.

130
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:29,440
And like my friends are up in the air mattress and they're like, you know, like, hey, obviously at this moment, like 3:45 p.m. Thursday night.

131
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,280
Right. The status quo.

132
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,910
So basically U.S. interest increases or one of your before this element of euro population size.

133
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,590
Those guys get all the calculations and want to do both.

134
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,300
Want drag them down. Yes. Oh, that's why it's 12,000 here.

135
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,020
Like you split up. You just want to sell on the road to the population in that particular year.

136
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,120
It's okay. I'm a world traveler.

137
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,110
Couple trying to forget that makes it so.

138
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:20,940
I want my population burbs each year to be like and then the calculators will be like yes.

139
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:34,160
So yeah. So in the end I have some information for intervention across from each other.

140
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:43,990
Like let's start doing something that's and you'll recalculating or in three years because we do system

141
00:17:44,020 --> 00:18:02,379
for the rest of your life you can do you think we could do that because they're pretty close to

142
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:14,080
give us some room so I have to my population how long do I know for like there was over like with the

143
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:26,970
border going lots to art it's almost impossible to articulate as I think you know he's like like,

144
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:36,670
oh my God. And I thought to be like so I came up with Tony.

145
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:48,270
You indicated for your studies and this is going to be like, listen to the Kalamazoo if I please.

146
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,090
Yeah. You've said, who do we want to do it by each category.

147
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:04,690
He was in Kalamazoo, takes me away and you're like, Yeah, you know, over services.

148
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,380
One year old. I like, I don't want to monopolize our time.

149
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,520
I think I know what I need to do for smokers, non smokers.

150
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,690
So for intervention inspiration intervention focused on how to the intervention was necessary

151
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:37,120
for me and it's more and then all of us would be understood probably grandchildren.

152
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,330
It's not a pill for 20, 30, 30 somethings.

153
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:50,200
So of course you're going to get sick because it's going to be the same remains

154
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,530
because they become pretty conservative towards cost and shakedown will be different.

155
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:06,850
Okay, look, you are like Superman for the independence of the questions, okay?

156
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:14,859
Sorry. I just get want to stick with, what, ten years?

157
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,190
It's going to be something that can be pretty squared, but I think we can put.

158
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,030
That was our language refresher. Yeah.

159
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:33,360
It hasn't got on here. He's got an idea.

160
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,080
He was very getting quickly.

161
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,200
So you have opinions I guess like there's no more influence than that.

162
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:55,860
You can say that. Yeah. So so I mean, I understand what you're saying, but you have to be an incumbent.

163
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,510
You go to some final between countermeasures.

164
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,720
Yes. Does that mean? Yes. We'll have to start with you.

165
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,950
And then I guess I'll show you the termination and license for the termination.

166
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,280
14 over 21 loss of her. You.

167
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,670
That's something I have to give marks with my phone. Okay.

168
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:26,700
So the ones that occur so that I can sense where you occurred before,

169
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,870
you would like to speak to the company so you can say you are going to say that what you're really concerned about is okay.

170
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,650
So it's very much like I genetic screening tool here.

171
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,120
It's like, yes, yeah, for sure.

172
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:49,020
And most things you do not all the time. So, so it really gives you a run of it.

173
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:57,510
So three months have passed or whatever your time and this is might have an appointee or do I get worried

174
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:08,530
and there's a problem in applying that serving and then I come on and you do genetic screening as well.

175
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,080
So what's your excuse?

176
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:22,019
Five. The first thing is you have a decision about eugenics screening or not and that and then it's then you have uncertainty.

177
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,490
Is it is there an appointee or genetic standard and then you guys to be screening, you know, sensitivity and specificity.

178
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:39,600
So am I going to detect under an appointed 80% of kind of true true status is there is an appointee and then does my test detected or not?

179
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,810
And then following that is what? So let's say it detects an appointee.

180
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,270
What do you do about that? And then so that's where I think, you know, termination, worry about responsibility,

181
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:59,190
feel like that those kind of things happen that you libraries birth like I looked

182
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,350
at for this so if you have an employee age group in genetic screening I say with

183
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:15,690
separate could be genetic screening outcome that's wrong decision because that happens

184
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,470
first and then as a rate of recovery in line with cell free DNA or quad screen.

185
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:30,410
I just it seems to really high if you have an appointee so that you do something does it give you a positive result up to nine years?

186
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,830
And then if it's positive, what happens and if it's negative, so.

187
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,280
So because it would be a true positive or negative be a false negative.

188
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,920
See, they say if someone is genetically if the news is genetically standard, what's the probability that'll be positive or negative?

189
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,430
Are there any false positives with with these tests?

190
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,690
And then what happens with those two negative by five?

191
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:02,220
I have two numbers on one divided by one minus if we want to know the number that's backed up with.

192
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:08,610
So you want to just try to draw that out and virtually don't agree with the number?

193
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:19,190
I feel like that's very high. Yes. But on the status of that, for the sake of having a read, is there anything you want to be sure about?

194
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,310
And you want to make sure that one for favorable outcomes,

195
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,979
when you make the decision based 70% on screening or not to the power is that I think cell

196
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,860
free DNA is this your choice of screening test is always to recover from that standpoint.

197
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,350
Right. Always challenging the prevalence of employees prisoners.

198
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:46,320
Yeah, for sure. And they are using at least things as interventions need to be coupled under same resources.

199
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:52,680
Yeah. You have your, your square, your decision itself. That's just one statistic I did write for.

200
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,760
And then after that we know the truth state of the fetus as an appointee or not.

201
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,090
And that's why a mirror wrote in our survey of drug use.

202
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,309
She found that that's the same decision that we would find it.

203
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:16,460
And then as he just said so and then your test will either detect or not and I'll give you to define.

204
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,450
It's a really good test. Are we say recovery positive if they have an employee positive?

205
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,880
And most of the time I think it's really good. That's your sensitivity.

206
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,960
I think the fetus is like a 21 year.

207
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,290
Yeah. Yes.

208
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,320
And so that will give you a negative test that's specificity patients.

209
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:54,510
And then you want to think, oh, those test results, I know how to really get to know for what they do to, you know, for your kind of policy question.

210
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,669
That's how. Yes, that's a that's a decision. You know, the parents come in toxic out.

211
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:07,320
But that's your perspective. So that's sort of getting to, you know, 30% of people will come through pregnancy and 70% or whatever.

212
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,690
That's that's an uncertainty you seem to have.

213
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:20,300
What's the probability that it's actually going to be okay to get a positive test for other jobs for recovered from some deep impact,

214
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:31,650
as you do find out? No, although I think if I read correctly in your methods, there was 210 out of like five or six different types of employees.

215
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,410
Right. And there's like different sensitivity to those, I guess.

216
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:44,460
So one other thing you could potentially have here is as well, right now you have an employee and you could maybe do that kind of an employee.

217
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:51,180
You could say the same. There's a 5% chance that there's a 10%, 20% or better break down for different types.

218
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:58,230
And then then you have different sensitivity, specificity while doing sensitivity for each of those different.

219
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,120
I would have to say, after the six month period, they still have to.

220
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,580
So these are this could be one. You got to make it off it.

221
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,430
But actually, don't worry too much about it because you can start to draw on here,

222
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,010
too, but you can always kind of break entry into several different parts.

223
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,910
I mean, you could you can say here's here's this, and then there's a nasty branch.

224
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,840
It's hard to say something.

225
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,270
Okay. Which shows you that nasty? All Albright.

226
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:39,780
This is it. We're looking at the people who returned to us during that six month period or are really going to work after or actually before.

227
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,520
I that you have a question. Maybe this is a thing to get organized around this.

228
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:56,900
Yeah. Okay. You know what? Too much further, but how would you be able to calculate the just after they were trying to figure something out.

229
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,180
So acquisition or not probably had sometimes we look at trying to find rape,

230
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,480
for instance, and then we were talking about how we're going to define recovery.

231
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:17,960
So let's say we use recovery as people, whoever it is, in terms of its use for six months prior to receiving the treatment.

232
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,910
Okay. And you get six months cycles there. Yeah.

233
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:27,500
So to show them that they are actually, you know, legitimately associated with that six month period or anything.

234
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,680
Yeah. Drew Griffin, you grew up in and so prominently on these markup models is particular kind of what happens over

235
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,900
kind of continuous time when we're breaking into each of these discrete short in about six months.

236
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:50,720
So yeah, we also you do have to make some assumptions about what's happened and contextually

237
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,400
model what's happened is that by the time you're in this pocket in six months and again,

238
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,350
this is mostly figures in the meetings that this has, which are three different people.

239
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,080
And so that's that's kind of how you like the time that someone is absent for six months.

240
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,270
But what's the chance that the next six months period they'll be they'll be in a different category?

241
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,440
Okay. So this is the following six month time period after this.

242
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:25,910
Well, so you have you have you have we have the holes in the arrows.

243
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,110
So we have recovered disorder at death.

244
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:39,330
Thank you for your help. We decided not to put the mortality you recovered in subsidies.

245
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,440
So you have to think about how many people are here.

246
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,640
In here. This is sort of a snapshot on November 7th.

247
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:01,380
2022 this year and this year, let's say 20% of the incidents in the state up 20% here, 80% here from the activity.

248
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:08,430
Oh, okay. So you are doing it during the same time period. So we're seeing like some snapshot of like how many people are here in here.

249
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:19,970
And then someone ask ourselves, I just I chose most of them on May 7th, 2023, how many will be here and here?

250
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,260
And so you need to know here and here, people here.

251
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:31,640
How many people moved here? I know. Like, so that's just like what?

252
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,700
That's about the bathtub metaphor. We have flow in only one business.

253
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,960
People do not do that.

254
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,180
So just, you know, and then, of course, it is a flow.

255
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,780
So between November and May, going to say.

256
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:59,310
So these are just like 10% of the like we have no conflict. What's the what's the rate of change?

257
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,590
Okay. And this is right here. I don't understand. And I change.

258
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,160
If someone have so much today, what's the chance to be absent six months from termination?

259
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,460
It's just a very simple, false quantified.

260
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,340
It's getting confusing, but it's not like 99%. It's done wonders for someone.

261
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:29,130
So we can use the 50% percent, just like 50% has the result six months, the long term, 2% essentially.

262
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:40,230
And then six months later, is the child alive? 80, 20% with regards disregard equivalent, you know this joke on the last two bar.

263
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,730
So we have to recover. How likely are you to stay?

264
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,680
You know, tempting to be used to catch.

265
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,240
How do you want to establish the chance to do it with your elders in terms of concerns and for the people who are substance use,

266
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,480
have substance disorder, there's a chance that they will recover in any other category.

267
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,570
Illegal substances are today.

268
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:12,420
What's the chance that six months from now here in six months after a much longer than six months.

269
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:24,900
If you if to find that, we have to. So what the Markov model assumes may or may not be our model is that it doesn't matter how long you've been here.

270
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:37,790
The average cost of the is always the same probability of, you know, let's say it's like six months old uniqueness of microservices.

271
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:47,520
Forget about the ones that are about the percent chance of going to recovery, the mobile phone.

272
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,150
He doesn't have all the other activities that they do.

273
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:58,550
But similarly, if I would suffer today, I'm saying I have, you know, 20% chance of recovery.

274
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:09,179
But if I'm still recovered, I still have 20% chance as the assumption that these more reality now might change,

275
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,270
like if someone's been recovered for years. So the emergence of relapse is lower.

276
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:24,780
You can go have different time trends and that's more complicated and you have to know that time consuming to yourself.

277
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:35,220
This is a and that's what I want to put specifically to data for that.

278
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,850
And yeah, well now you can change it for different interventions.

279
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:48,690
You can say, okay, my new intervention is this, is this from 10% to 30% or something, or maybe it's really going to keep you own recovery.

280
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:59,220
So from 20% of your time, we have to measure you different like a totally different model in the model structure to be the same or different?

281
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,110
Both. Yes. So better. I mean, and that's that's kind of what you're doing in the end is you're building one model for

282
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,450
the status quo and then a different model for the intervention that we're averaging.

283
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:18,600
I mean, what what a markup model is useful for changes in rates into long term.

284
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,820
Probably it might be today. The long term proposition is for, you know, what you say.

285
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:30,660
I have I think I've got a new intervention to increase this recovery rate and decrease the relapse rate.

286
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:38,370
And you can see that in the long run, maybe we get 50 different instead of 28 based on what,

287
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,610
over the ten year period overall, you know, like a five year plan.

288
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,410
But, you know, it's technically like a real life change.

289
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:53,960
So I was like all time period goes by the. It changes of how many people go to relapsing.

290
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,100
So the game changes, right?

291
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:04,890
It's sort of the the the the kind of level of an outcome would change earlier because you're changing the flow in the flow out.

292
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:12,330
So originally the level of this would increase is increase in flow in occurs is decreasing the sense of like that

293
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,420
what you're getting at or now the flow rate also the region it's the flow rate is not what I'm talking about.

294
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:26,310
Yeah. Like that would maybe change over time. You think maybe over time we get better at counseling and so yeah.

295
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,700
Or lowering the level of at some point I think.

296
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:38,339
Right. Or like the longer it gets maybe it's harder to obtain is hungry versus like really, really early in the way, you know.

297
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,579
So it's like how you take that into account. Yeah.

298
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,310
So basically I'm now going to recommend this for your project.

299
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,820
But you know, another thing you could do is you could have you could maybe have two different

300
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:59,430
types of populations you could have of recovered willing to use disorder,

301
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:07,260
willing, and then you have recovered unwell substance use disorder, maybe get two different types of people.

302
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:16,320
If people are willing to spread the word like, and I love cocaine, I never want to quit using it and let me use it like I'm using cocaine.

303
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,980
But I really hate what it does to being, you know,

304
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,630
maybe your intervention only works on these people and these people just it's never going to work on them anyway.

305
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,889
So then you would see like a lot of people moving at the beginning,

306
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,490
but then over the long run these people are just resistant and they're never going to change.

307
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,630
So you could use them, right? Yeah.

308
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:42,270
Also, you could use if you think the population is like different populations, other intervention works differently on different people.

309
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:48,840
And I think you could also have I mean, we organize a substance use disorder for recovery.

310
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:05,980
So maybe you have a subscription or sort of, let's say, like I can search for each month 10% of the month.

311
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,080
But if someone's only for one month, they have like 80% challenge ups.

312
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,330
And but the other 20% chance says, okay, I've been two months.

313
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,610
Now, if I it two months, maybe I only have a 60% chance of relapse.

314
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:28,340
And then if I make it that it's 30% or was right, 40% make it to three months.

315
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,889
And then if I made it three months, maybe I only have a 30% chance of relapse making.

316
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,950
And then if I go to 70% bookings and remember, you know, so you could.

317
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,590
That's one way to monitor.

318
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:49,850
You might have a really high rate of getting in that or and have like a longer or assuming

319
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:56,140
that if you don't have these people down for one or you have less likely to transition.

320
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:05,500
And with that said, now this is more comprehensive, one or two hour, three hour interview that has characterized.

321
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:12,769
Yes. Right. For each of those months. Now, one thing that happens is often people say, well, you made about three months.

322
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:21,229
That's what it levels off. And then these people just go back to the same business three or four or five months.

323
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:34,410
It's all the same as month three. It's still you know, it is more complicated than you have to like, but you can going back to your roots of that.

324
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,450
Then why do you send me a follow up here?

325
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:46,040
How are you thinking about intervention impacting your relapse, substance use disorder and costs when you're using the market?

326
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,640
I like this. You have to think about, okay, what's why we've reached these bubbles.

327
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,690
Typically you want to figure out what's the cost mean.

328
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:59,930
There's a quality of life associated to this is of costs and quality of life associated with this.

329
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,689
That's the part we have the cost based on one study we've been following.

330
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,839
But you can't find anything about quality of life like it's so dependent on other things to do.

331
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:20,690
Not just that. There's nothing that I mean, of course, like certain cities will require a certain success rate,

332
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:32,870
but potentially you might like to use a relapse as to recovery.

333
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,790
This is some kind of circle because based on this,

334
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:47,989
they have a target to treat a certain amount every year and their cost to calculate it based on this idea,

335
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,640
I should say actually, yeah, you guys are the cost is usually 3.0.

336
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:58,970
Yeah, this comes to the street.

337
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:14,310
So yeah. So how would you think about. Yeah. So quality of life working with every student because they have to like you want to be good.

338
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,330
It's been like, yeah, how do I look?

339
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:32,770
After expanding their coverage and the models and deciding to rate and based on the effectiveness of the treatment center,

340
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:42,350
you talked about how many more people get a relapse and also so many people recovered.

341
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:50,629
So this is we can calculate the content content just to have more use, for example, this and for next two periods.

342
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:57,440
Yes, we want you to consider people who care at this stage can get treated and treated on the side

343
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,090
of you need to we decide to add certain markets get that country to the guest and to make it.

344
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:11,299
Yes okay get treated. I'll go to this this population.

345
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,610
What is your what is that number treated 2320 doing this.

346
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,960
Yeah. This is the number provided by each of the cost of these.

347
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:27,979
Okay. So they said if we expand this, we can treat an additional 2000 and we expand in terms of outpatient services.

348
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,250
They estimated treating 12,000 users that.

349
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,590
Oh yeah, you're right. We were just going to stick with that number over the course of ten years or ten years,

350
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:44,120
which so already is that they are treatments for over the numbers.

351
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,040
Okay so for some people who get a.

352
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:02,690
Excuse me. These boots are considered out there in Khartoum, just like you use in this country.

353
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,700
Yes. Are you going to cancel or are not going to continue?

354
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,280
That's what I think that they are going to pursue no treatment for.

355
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,780
We don't care that we're not going to get it.

356
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,700
We're just struggling. I'm in front of people all the time.

357
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,160
That's what's so awful. And they see the drug.

358
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,540
So if you relapse and there's a slot open, you will be treated.

359
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:41,950
Maybe you can't get treatment, get treated. And then this utility decided to just let me stay on this topic.

360
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:55,810
Not sure if this is another question because you have to go to 12,000 and then I'll do the I guess you think the demand is great like that.

361
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,600
You have kind of a constant number of people being treated.

362
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:07,080
And so what if I mean, what if the treatment is great and everyone's kind of cured and it would be less than three?

363
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,130
I think it's going to be that this is a problem. But is that the cause of this thing?

364
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:18,020
Yes. And that's going to be you know, we are telling patients,

365
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:31,120
so we consider that I wouldn't it would be hard for us to come in and I guess in the end to get a lot of things like,

366
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,350
you know, what is the what does this look like? Yeah. So, yes, without the interaction, then we're still with you.

367
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,860
So this is this is really with the interaction you or treating additional 12,000.

368
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,960
I'm just assuming it's just going to be something like just like like a receipt.

369
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:52,940
Oh, sorry. So. So in the 12,000 with 116 times, I have this.

370
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,300
So you're on the cutting edge. Do people receive the treatment every year?

371
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,570
Yes. So, yes.

372
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:12,750
Well, that was your analysis. So really, I guess what you want your research is going to come from somewhere.

373
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:25,850
You think what you want in the end is very similar to this is your house is going to be easier.

374
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:35,570
So in this case, if someone has substitute disorder, it would just be conflated, I guess,

375
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:49,490
and treatment is for six months or so and then when they leave treatment, they can be either recovered or they can relapse or it's not successful.

376
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,010
And so this is where the treatment center says you have 70% success.

377
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,390
That's our success rate. That means 70% are recovered. 30% are not.

378
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,000
Is that right? And don't just.

379
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:15,520
And so you're saying no, it was the intervention of 10,000 helps contributed to the costs of the six month period of the intervention.

380
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,520
That's 180,000 a year. Did you agree?

381
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,430
And then, by the way, covered it. They can still be considered.

382
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:35,400
But actually even that substitution treatment to explain to 1360 something like that and I'm just like how how are we defining recoveries with that?

383
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:45,790
I thought we were going to figure out really a great tension so we can example of care.

384
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:55,060
We have like have a study of C Section six, I think it's 6.3 and absent from the U.S., right.

385
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:03,770
That one probably is just doing what is required for in the pumping up this treatment reimbursement.

386
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,530
And presumably this success rate is once again, this is like 5% or something.

387
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:19,880
Yeah. And then this and so with your intervention, you're pumping up this rate because of our current rate, which will be more alarming for the.

388
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,420
So that will be if you choose to model it this way. It's all right.

389
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:34,550
It sounds like 12 hours you would have to figure out, you know, what's the lower quality of life.

390
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:44,180
So this is, you know, what's the health related? I think that's kind of the key things is not enough.

391
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,240
There's not enough research to know. Yeah.

392
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:54,770
I'm someone out here is I think I mean for this class and that's yeah I think you make an estimate and say okay quality of life here is,

393
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,540
you know, it's 0.85 of it.

394
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,870
So if the data about can't get one.

395
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:14,050
So that's the other thing is we do have that other study that has quality like genomes of these treatments.

396
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:24,800
And so you could I mean, you can be in these numbers such that it is realistic and we have to insist that these are just other sections of programs.

397
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:35,490
Okay. So if it says quality gained or is like six, we would match with that for us.

398
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,160
Yeah. And actually, that study didn't give you quality of life without treatment.

399
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,510
Right. So was on life itself.

400
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:50,180
And I think there is something to like lay out like the baseline and what specific tree

401
00:47:50,420 --> 00:48:01,249
quality improvement president or are you able to reconstruct the so this one quality of

402
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:10,700
life from how they decline screenings and either they have they either have it or they

403
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:18,530
don't have it so just simply prevention is it's part of life with or without treatment.

404
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,580
I think the red line it says is the red line is the eight parts of its red button that it made.

405
00:48:35,150 --> 00:49:05,270
Right. Baseline.

406
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,000
Baseline quality. This table has the baseline information.

407
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,610
Right. How can we calculate baseline 45.5?

408
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:17,490
Right. Maybe without treatment in it.

409
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:25,940
Well, presumably baseline rates before treatment. So they say, you know, 0.5.

410
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:40,040
And then they say afterwards. In the entire cohort, it was 0.6 or 0.6 or so.

411
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:53,090
And that was like six months later or a year later. So it wasn't your point five plus 0.06.

412
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:00,350
Average. After all of life.

413
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:11,720
So I think what that SRT doesn't tell you is how many recovered versus went back to substance use disorder right now.

414
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,530
And so let's call this success.

415
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:27,970
And then. Right. This is recovered.

416
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:50,530
And then this is the substance. Substance. So we know that 0.56 is equal to the maximum one minus X failure rate times 0.5.

417
00:50:50,540 --> 00:51:04,810
If they got 0.5 sucks. If we assume it's based on baseline plus x times isolated, I was already covered.

418
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:12,480
Wednesday, right at his point, it's always guesswork.

419
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:18,440
So we don't know. We do what we don't .56 is the average for people that didn't succeed in work.

420
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:25,510
That's right. And so if if the success rate is with the U.S. at this point,

421
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:38,460
this event and this quality of life is going to be six to I think the success rate is 20% then this is a higher quality life.

422
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:51,260
So, you know, if you wanted to use the mark about this, you could use other literature to get a sense of what that success rate was like.

423
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,130
Now again, I'm going back to thinking about this in general.

424
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:31,880
I think. If you already know there is another way to do this would be substitution disorder.

425
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:36,400
And then you can just have. Host That's true.

426
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:47,480
We have some data this and this is 0.5 is a 0.56 in 100% of people.

427
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,780
Well, yeah, if you get treatment, you're going here.

428
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,120
And then what you're uncertain about is how many people realize 16.

429
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,600
So you get some or or go back to their bad quality of life interviews every six months.

430
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:09,980
And you see this reactivity. I mean, this is the simplest.

431
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:23,299
Yeah, yeah. Well, there's always some people will just call newspapers, the newspaper, and then this is just it's either 12,000 or whatever it is,

432
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:37,130
or it's 18,000 people moving across treatment each year in the Middle East for the purposes I proposed to say, is this do I get this point five,

433
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,700
six benefits or if it's like 100% of people go back,

434
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:50,870
I can spend for six months and then everyone goes back to baseline or if this is 0% and I get a lifetime of 0.56 for less money,

435
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:59,749
it's kind of like in the south region they'll st more like your heart and in fact you know that's certainly the more commodities.

436
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:18,620
Okay you know do that too much. I mean you could you could just say, you know, kind of all these gains per person because of the contingency.

437
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:30,580
I mean, those are just like population. It's and then one year, I don't know, 0.06, two years, we just put it at like 5050 again.

438
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:45,200
It said the benefits two years and it's 0.1 to 3 years interest to 0.8 and do some kind of sensitivity analysis, then it's more likely to occur.

439
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,600
Sometimes the additional hundred thousand people are meant to contribute.

440
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:53,480
We would do that for each treatment. That's a good point.

441
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,540
So this is for in-patient. Yeah, but yeah. You don't know how good you know and then you could it.

442
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:04,120
Yeah. Any of our procedure could now vary this for the different types of treatment I guess.

443
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:10,480
But that would have to make an assumption about. Which is, of course.

444
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:19,490
Coast to coast treatment to US unity. I want you to consider your first two periods.

445
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:26,900
Second periods. This. [INAUDIBLE].

446
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:33,190
Yeah. So that I mean, this is this is what I was saying and this is kind of your duration of effectiveness.

447
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,570
Is it just one year of effectiveness? If it actually if it if it's if it's six months.

448
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,810
Then you're only gaining 0.03 qualities because only for six months, half a year of this.

449
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:56,170
But if it's if it's like ten years, then you're gaining, you know, 0.6 points if it's from that treatment that you got ten years ago.

450
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:03,879
Yeah. I mean, if that person stays substance free then for ten years at this point.

451
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:11,530
Six. Yeah. And it would do, they can attribute the increase to that specific treatment that person changed their life and they.

452
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,210
It just seems so unrealistic. Like one thing I think it actually could be dramatic for for a person who it's affected on.

453
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,899
Yeah. But I feel like the quality of life would increase because the other things they were

454
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,830
doing during that ten year period like it can't be attributed to that treatment,

455
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:39,380
the increase. I mean, if they have a bad quality of life and the treatment, you know,

456
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:46,240
gives them better quality of life, and then they and it teaches them skills to avoid relapse.

457
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,030
And they so they live for another ten years without substance use disorder.

458
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,890
These potential think.

459
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:04,210
There could be substantial quality of life gains, but I don't think it would like I think is it all just the treatment or is it other things?

460
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:10,830
Yeah, like I think it would be the same amount of quality of life days one year after the treatment and five years after the.

461
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:16,000
Oh yeah. No, I mean, I, I agree. I think it is, but it just cumulatively adds up.

462
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:23,170
Okay. Yeah. So it doesn't, it doesn't get like, I mean, maybe you could argue it doesn't matter.

463
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:28,570
But, you know, I think it just linearly kind of adds up to 0.06 the first year.

464
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,520
And then if you two years, 6.06 months from 6.1 to 3 years, 2.6% and six months.

465
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:39,200
Five, six years is fine. Oh. Okay.

466
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,480
So do we. Thank you for this.

467
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:54,180
Yes, thank you. It's so much easier to me out and speaking to a lot of the things that we have here.

468
00:57:54,270 --> 00:58:03,240
I think you can simplify it. So it's focuses on C section pointers, see or not.

469
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:10,190
That shows it. Right. Right. So I think it's very complicated and we'll do that for each one as well.

470
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:21,250
If we were to turn this out. But I don't want to be that person.

471
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:28,080
But and we can also take a look at this data.

472
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:34,290
So, like after we answer treatment, I'm interested in pictures of those rates.

473
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:48,250
Yeah. I mean, I was angry that in particular studies, to use your judgment about how it was a second trimester or third trimester,

474
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,149
you know, and so it's exactly the same, you know, judgment on how close is it.

475
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:59,229
And and if you feel like you have to make some adjustments that are reasonable, just go ahead and do those.

476
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:06,430
Just talking. Okay. So thinking if we think we have it's for cancer treatments like.

477
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:21,520
Then we find one kind of cabinet mobilization exercise so they determine the baseline qualities like these required first thing.

478
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,380
Okay, so let's play three weeks. Yeah. If you think they're reasonable.

479
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,930
Oh, okay. I thought we were going again. So we want to know.

480
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,070
So the first question is, what's the difference? Let's say this is a study from the General Migration Persons.

481
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:44,360
There has been a study age 65 and up. Our response to that versus course is that we're going to the intervention.

482
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,899
You can say, okay, we took the general number from over, including one study.

483
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:54,370
So that doesn't mean higher or lower or 21 medication, higher or lower baseline.

484
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,170
And then we did find some that were like prior to differences.

485
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,259
Well, in determining match point based on the 100% threshold.

486
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:13,230
So yes, something like that because so that's for older people.

487
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:23,260
Yeah. So we use all the data and this diagram is in irony, but we also transition to some very fine stories.

488
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:24,860
Yes.

489
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:34,790
I think you're you're going to your do your analysis in imagery discussions and I'll bring that sort of error with what other people actually wrote.

490
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:42,710
So it's going to reach out into toward the bank that essentially you can pay up to 1500 per year and still be cost effective.

491
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,870
This other study, the general population that was 13.

492
01:00:45,380 --> 01:01:02,120
Okay, I was surprised if you're not close and if you're very different than maybe I just made it and try to say,

493
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:09,950
well, you think that if we included that sort of it's not the of these.

494
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:17,730
And then. Okay, so here it says we don't want to be done.

495
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,330
With what? Is that in reference to the tree or is that.

496
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,430
Yeah. And so is that.

497
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:33,389
So here you're saying we're going to try to understand if and when the care begins.

498
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:38,880
First thing is infrastructure. So I would say, yeah, there might be ten here.

499
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:45,060
But I think for your analysis, I think it should be done in first trimester.

500
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,780
Then then you should evaluate. Okay. What's the difference between having to do a first transfer versus no doing drugs decreases here.

501
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,690
You go to look first versus second. But that's probably more complicated.

502
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:03,230
So I would just if you think that would be like the best place to intervene, or maybe you say,

503
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,230
hey, first trimester, but that's not really as much as, you know, effective.

504
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:11,130
I could just give another transposition through in third trimester versus not.

505
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,570
I don't know, but it's for Valentine's.

506
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:19,350
So it's it's I mean, that's the biggest challenge with a lot of these things is,

507
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:26,280
you know, very rarely where it would have been randomized to get into whether or not.

508
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:36,140
So it's there are people who as a group might be systematically different and quality of life as we're saying

509
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:44,459
how you place the value versus you're sure had you know three other children who were born with really high

510
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,890
risk and you had a bunch of C-section and you feel like that might be maybe you'd want to get it dollar when

511
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:56,610
you're probably going to go into the hospital and have a bunch of doctors hovering over you anyway and so you.

512
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,050
Anyway, so, and actually your doctor might say, don't you just do a lot?

513
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,080
You're going to have all of us doctors in the room with you because you're being high risk.

514
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:12,300
But if you if you've had two or three pregnancies before and they're all low risk and went smoothly, maybe anyway,

515
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:20,480
so that the people can actually get from work or higher income people choose to lower that moment of performance or they might be more distant.

516
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:29,880
And so, you know, the observed C-section rates would those might be lower in schools or also partially because

517
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:35,640
I think people with access to a lot of the prenatal care and stuff like that get to us.

518
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,200
So. So you might you might not be able to tease that all out.

519
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,870
But but what you can do is some sensitivity analysis.

520
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:51,689
So, you know, we say, okay, the observational data says only 1% rate of C-section and the rest is 20% C-section rates.

521
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:55,950
Well, what if it's 21? What if it's 28 out of ten?

522
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:03,509
Okay. And then the last thing Sheldon's is that he's like, Yeah.

523
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:09,809
So I would I would start creating a table where you have all of your if you're using that,

524
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:17,639
maybe you're just inches a little bit in your decision tree and three pieces of general kind of groups.

525
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:29,459
The types of information and probabilities, the cost of some sort have been lowered as an enumerated person is one of the piece of regression,

526
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,970
which is the probability of C-sections where they do a lot. When you compare C-section, trying to just the cost of the C-sections,

527
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:44,490
risk for mortality, the things that come with C-section and how you have a C-section.

528
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:50,610
And and again, to kind of figure in the way the fetal maternal mortality with each of those things

529
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:56,700
and then and at the end of the at the end of branch of the treated inequalities.

530
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:04,290
And for your case, if you if you choose do so you probably call for the mother and the child.

531
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:11,320
And so if you answered more questions, how many of these happen if mother she lives or dies?

532
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:17,830
Child. Well, I think you have to think about what's life expectancy for mother, what's called natural.

533
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:29,310
Let's assume, apart from one point other maybe has 40 more years of life or something that were 51 child, maybe 70 or 80 years of life.

534
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,380
And so you use those things to calculate inequalities. It was all the numbers you would need to calculate.

535
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:40,230
So would you like would for the paper for this table.

536
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:49,500
Just you just showed aggregate. Well, I would I would create a table with all the numbers you need to do the calculations.

537
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:56,130
And then when the results, you show the results. So let's show the results at the very bottom.

538
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,970
I would like. So I would I would show this I would show the shelf.

539
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,249
Well, for for this assignment,

540
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:08,560
I was hoping you'd have just a structure for your table would look at and the types of information you need for the final paper in this country.

541
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:16,620
We should have a table with all the parameters and then the parameter values and are and arrange to and ideally of where it came from.

542
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:30,800
So you say okay, probably C section with a dollar, it's 5% and it came from Jones et al and then probability of C section at 13% and also controls.

543
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:39,030
And so and life is happens on the aggregate of all these so well yeah.

544
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,159
And each thing and so well yeah.

545
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:49,800
So that's a key question or comment I guess I would put in your the aggregate or the number you chose to use in your model.

546
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:55,890
And then also the range and the range might be informed by the other studies. And then and then for the citation you could have said, hey, you know,

547
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:04,560
Jones Smith doesn't remember answers as your study that were the numbers came from okay sometimes you will see and thus often

548
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:12,390
times in an appendix you might have a bigger table which lists every single study and then maybe have some comment on,

549
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:17,220
you know, we like Jones because it was African-American, but it was a small sample size.

550
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:20,850
So Smith was good because it had a large sample size, but it wasn't.

551
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,860
Okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:37,260
In the end, the most important thing is, is the table showing here is the number that we kept from test results for the actual paper.

553
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:42,479
If we put it in there and then appendix, you can list all the specific points.

554
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,780
If you if you have specific comments, thoughts about why you like studying versus the TV audience.

555
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:56,300
Okay. And you don't I don't think know.

556
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:04,750
I think got it to work. I was hoping you could just check it.

557
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,620
Yeah. So you got the year?

558
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,980
The number of people whose.

559
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:19,660
Sensitive qualities. The same thing for the band.

560
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,310
And this. And this. This is qualities for both groups. All together.

561
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:27,680
Yeah. And the band?

562
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:32,720
That's right. And that's poker's quality. Yeah.

563
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:37,540
Yeah. No. That's fine.

564
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:46,480
Uniforms, usually. So once you've done this, for whatever reasons you're here, you have all of this.

565
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:51,130
I would add one more column in here, which is the intervention cost.

566
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:56,410
Maybe you already have that insurance detection. So we made the assumption that there was an intervention.

567
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:03,550
This is the ATF and that that's already here. Okay. Two, that under the band costs.

568
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:06,280
Okay, band costs. Okay. This this disease costs.

569
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:18,040
And one of my duties I might be considering also being so informative to applicant to to report that the cost of intervention costs.

570
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:33,720
Yeah. So you can say look we think this is we think the health system would save $10 billion, but we have to sort of, you know, just ignore it anyway.

571
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,420
Yes. Let's go.

572
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:47,670
And then but then I guess what I would what I would do next is I would kind of add up all of these costs over ten or 20 years, get through 2100.

573
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:54,920
So it's like 71 years. Yeah. There was no estimates past 2100, which seems fair.

574
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,480
But what I don't have in here is discounting.

575
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:08,320
Yeah. Five. But I think why I think you should, especially since some of those things are happening 75 years in the future, whatever.

576
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:23,470
So I would I would just count those things to think about it and ask yourself, is the the concept always that you're using so you can take.

577
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,370
So you have the extra whatever it was, the extra lifetime cost of smoking.

578
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,350
Yeah. Is that did those authors discount that nine.

579
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:39,850
And so that estimate is like the number that gets used over and over again in all of these studies.

580
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:43,350
And it's actually from the eighties that things have got to have to.

581
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:49,650
You felt like even like studies from like the late 20 tens like even a few years ago like so know that happens.

582
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:59,290
So I inflated it to 20, $22 already of 65, but like I also like 2029.

583
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:06,390
So like I haven't, I wasn't even like I haven't dealt with like I wouldn't worry about that I guess, but um, yeah, well, that's,

584
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,820
I guess that's an important thing to just acknowledge though, is this, is,

585
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:23,330
this is a number of people want to possibly help us or more work to get out and you count $10 million.

586
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:32,650
It's like I was like, well, you know, so potentially the costs, I guess that's what the quality is.

587
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:39,790
So how many calls you gain? I don't know where that came from. That's more that's from a reason you go to Advanced Search.

588
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:50,850
I think it's post 2020. So I guess if those numbers, the $20,000 in the game you're not smoking, if you think those are discounted,

589
01:11:51,100 --> 01:12:00,130
then all you have to do is you try and work with these and these numbers are so high.

590
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:09,460
I feel like this is one thing that I missed, but like, how do I get the formula to like automatically do the discounting for each linked to change?

591
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:16,750
So there are a couple of things you can do. One is you could use this number there in glue, and that's just a summary of the sums.

592
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:20,010
So what you can do here is you can just do a copy.

593
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:29,740
First of all, as we can, we just need a discount rate of this percentage or whatever.

594
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,860
So just like to compare and then I think we should just like for you to compare and

595
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:41,559
it's all the equivalent cash flow and the cash flow is just this entire tone of data.

596
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:48,879
So you just select, you know, the whole thing just six new like June 29, second 15.

597
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,980
You can do the last 16. Okay. Yeah.

598
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:02,589
So they don't need to discount that it'll be substantially smaller and that's actually just yeah, that's yeah.

599
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:13,419
But that's, yeah, that's, um, yeah. So, so that's yeah, it's substantially but it's still a very big right.

600
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,840
It's $97 billion.

601
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:23,709
Yeah. Okay, so that's a lot. And if you wanted to, you could do the same with quality.

602
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:31,650
So discourage but it's still going to be a big plus. And if you want to, you know,

603
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:41,980
even give you 2 billion to give me I think you know you can you can stuff going on of several things here I mean

604
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:49,989
this is on home and crime management is more important for even if we only did manager for one year but depending

605
01:13:49,990 --> 01:14:01,360
on what I was you save $3 billion over the next seven years so that you can you can because I like it again

606
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:13,470
pressure is broken down into I work at 839 and I wanted to make sure I'm just on my car across whatever it is.

607
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:21,390
Okay. So this I mean, I remember we went over this because of my college work and she's like, that's what I don't like.

608
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:25,520
Change Confidential. I was going to like the problem.

609
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,970
The shots in the house, is it constant?

610
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,430
It's not like that or is it doing it?

611
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:39,040
Like, technically what it's doing here is let's do this.

612
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:58,420
So we'd like to have 3 minutes.

613
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:15,670
Yeah. On it. What it's doing is it's taking its value and then dividing by three, agreeing to just a certain power.

614
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:23,170
To the power of one. Or we can do to bring those two. Citizens.

615
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:34,600
A certain. Some specify by one year the use of rural farming.

616
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:45,760
So but then there's not like numbers this would describe this land is divided by one point of three squared.

617
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,400
So that's why not two years. This is this kind of three or four years time.

618
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:57,550
And so forth like this, all the way up to convergence, 71 year after year.

619
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:07,389
And so this this is the present value because it would be like a $3 billion harmony in 2100 different.

620
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:12,130
Everything is actually only worth $389 million in today's dollars.

621
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,370
Okay. Because it's happening. So a way, way for the future.

622
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,550
And actually, if we. And then basically that should be some of the through.

623
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,940
I think these numbers should be. Why people disagree.

624
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:32,470
It's really invasive. Yeah. So this number is symbolic.

625
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:38,629
So that's doing that's what that's doing is it's just going be the first one by a little announcement each subsequent year.

626
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:43,220
It's exponential. You just have to look at it real simple.

627
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,820
And this is going to do screening. You just go higher and higher power.

628
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,490
I mean, also what you could do is you could so that that is the value.

629
01:16:54,110 --> 01:17:00,499
In 2020, you could then discount that back to an additional six years, Robert, today.

630
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:12,290
But in the meantime, I think my last question is, does our group feel that we we've already met with you a few times,

631
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,710
so this is good me, but I'm happy to be together.

632
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:21,589
Okay. But like, for the like assignment like this, you can consider this.

633
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:31,210
This is a non ability met with you about the point of this module and they had 60 divided and conquered.

634
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:38,030
They have the models. James Yeah, and I guess one thing I would do is try to think,

635
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:46,250
I guess to compare these results to the microbiome results are similar and I'm happy to help you makes you look at that.

636
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:57,680
It's doing something wildly as well with something like psychedelics and I guess sexual function.

637
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:02,240
Just one more. I kind of neglected you guys. How are you doing? What do you do?

638
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:12,229
Any particular situations or how do you like to determine your client experience for you

639
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:17,660
as they have to give the commercial input value of that arranged associate themselves?

640
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:24,970
Yeah, I was curious because it's almost as if I can estimate the mortality rates per year in each

641
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:30,080
urban because there's sensory data on how things go through rates with curative care care.

642
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:37,970
Then I suppose I do find a study that looked at the survival and average survival time of those with a

643
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:44,339
group and then I mean the ratios between those and apply that to the average survival rate that I can get.

644
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:49,219
But I got a lot of series and so I wasn't going to be 100% representative.

645
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,580
I was just know what I estimate around that.

646
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:56,959
Yeah. Yeah. So if they give you a measure of the roles, you can use those.

647
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:04,250
Of course in this case I'm just grateful to, you know, also understand the parameters.

648
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:08,590
Go into your calculations. You could say, okay, what if this time this is no screening, what's the result?

649
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:14,990
Again, this is longer, which I go ahead. And then finally I think much your judgment about this last round.

650
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:23,140
By my only advice there is is you're probably more severe than those that cannot be in the final.

651
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:28,400
So and also I was taken in with something no one has written 95% confidence intervals.

652
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:31,309
Three, it's not written in stone. That's right.

653
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:38,000
Because they might have been looking at people in Ohio and Michigan and there's slight differences in what they found in the class.

654
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,290
I wanted to know. Yeah, so it's a judgment call.

655
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:52,330
I don't do that kind of analyst. And, you know, if if you found several studies you may use this one is not provided in this column.

656
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:58,400
Yeah but there's there's some judgment involved meeting that's one different.
