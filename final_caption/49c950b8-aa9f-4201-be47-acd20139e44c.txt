1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,910
Hey. This is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,350
Here to talk about testing for

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,740
group effects using linear
mixed effect models.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,325
Let's recall our goals for
longitudinal data analysis.

5
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,050
First, we wanted to determine if

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,510
our outcome of interest
changes over time.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,360
We've showed how mixed models
can accomplish this goal by

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,430
accounting for within subject
correlation of the outcome.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,360
The second goal was to identify

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,280
factors that affect the outcome.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,930
Up to now, we've only included

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,640
one explanatory variable in

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,690
our mixed model to explain
the outcome, time.

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,460
But a longitudinal
analysis will usually

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,025
also collect data on
additional variables,

16
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:47,990
and we want to determine
if differences in

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,700
these variables are associated

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,340
with differences in the outcome.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,910
A common example is
group membership.

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,750
For example, the yellow
lines in the plot could be

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,075
patients that received a
novel medical treatment

22
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,365
in a clinical trial,

23
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:02,030
and the purple lines are patients

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,455
that received the placebo.

25
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:04,790
This would correspond to

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,995
a group variable
based on treatment.

27
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:09,380
In this lecture, we will
see how to formally

28
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,515
test group effects in the
mixed model framework.

29
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,450
Let's think about how we approach

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,150
this problem in previous
regression modeling.

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,300
Given two groups, we
would add to the model a

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,400
binary variable
that distinguishes

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,475
subjects in the groups.

34
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,615
For example, in standard
linear regression,

35
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:30,500
the beta two term shown
here differentiates

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,150
the regression lines
for subjects and

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,765
group one for subjects
in group two.

38
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:38,060
Beta zero is the intercept
for the group one line.

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,195
Beta one is the shared
slope between the groups,

40
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,000
and beta two is the group
effects or difference in

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,410
intercepts between the group

42
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,065
two and group one
regression lines.

43
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,645
This standard linear
regression model,

44
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,390
of course, ignores the
with-in subject correlation.

45
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,100
We want to account for that,

46
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,720
but the general concept of

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,520
a group effect parameter easily

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,175
translates over to the
mixed model framework.

49
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:04,055
Starting with a standard
linear regression model

50
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:06,665
containing time
and group effects,

51
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:08,750
we can add random intercept and

52
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,160
random slope terms to

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,865
model subject-specific
regression lines.

54
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,560
The model now has
three population

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,870
level fixed effect parameters,

56
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,615
which define two population
regression lines,

57
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,295
one for each group.

58
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:26,030
The random intercept and random
slope terms model between

59
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,420
subjects variation in intercept
and slope respectively.

60
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,540
Like before, inclusion of
just the random intercepts in

61
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,875
the model may be sufficient

62
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,095
depending on the
pattern of the data.

63
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,560
The population regression
line for the first group is

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,710
defined by the fixed effect
terms beta zero and beta one.

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,700
Subject-specific lines for group

66
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,950
one subjects are
distributed about

67
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,855
the group one population line

68
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,460
based on the subject-specific
random effect terms.

69
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,460
The group two population line
is defined by beta zero,

70
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,775
beta one, and the group
effect term, beta two.

71
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,010
Subject-specific lines for group

72
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,660
two subjects are randomly

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,550
distributed about this group

74
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,865
two population regression line.

75
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,625
The group effect term, beta two,

76
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,170
is the difference in intercept
between the two groups.

77
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,990
A value of zero
indicates no difference,

78
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,280
meaning the groups have the same

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,410
predicted outcome over time.

80
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,615
A positive value for beta two

81
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,270
indicates larger mean
outcomes for group two,

82
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,010
and a negative value indicates

83
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,320
smaller mean outcomes
for group two.

84
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,480
These interpretations
are the same as

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,335
group effects in standard
linear regression.

86
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:37,790
Once a model is fit to the data,

87
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,610
we will want to consider
evidence for a group effect by

88
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,215
performing a hypothesis test

89
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:44,665
of the beta two
regression parameter.

90
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:46,400
Just like when we looked at

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,710
the time effect parameter
for mixed models,

92
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,945
we can examine the
Wald test statistic

93
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,250
to understand how inference

94
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,140
might change for the
group effect term

95
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,650
as compared to the standard
linear regression.

96
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,910
Again, the effect
size will be nearly

97
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,580
identical to that of
standard regression,

98
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,569
but the standard error can
change sometimes dramatically,

99
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:07,130
leading to changes in inference

100
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,485
regarding the group effect.

101
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:10,430
As a reminder, the
Wald statistic is

102
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,695
a useful tool for this
crude comparison,

103
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:14,015
but because it's sampling

104
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,325
distribution is not
well-known for mixed models,

105
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:19,765
it is not recommended for
the computation of p-values.

106
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,580
In this lecture, we
introduced the concept of

107
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,965
group effects to
mixed effect models.

108
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,380
It shouldn't come as too
much of a surprise though,

109
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,300
because it's identical
to how we handled

110
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,350
group effects in previous
regression settings.

111
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,490
Importantly, we can now model

112
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,270
differences in outcomes
between groups,

113
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,305
a major goal for
longitudinal data analysis.

114
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:42,020
A fixed effect term
distinguishing groups in

115
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,160
the data was easily

116
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,485
incorporated in the
mixed model framework.

117
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,419
Like standard linear regression,

118
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,190
the concept is easily extended to

119
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,920
scenarios in which there
are more than two groups.

120
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,125
The group effect mixed model

121
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
retain the random
effect terms that

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,040
properly model the
correlation among

123
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,355
repeated measurements
in longitudinal data.
