1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:22,680
And. Are you not?

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,000
Not. Good morning, everyone. Have you had a nice weekend?

3
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,360
Some Halloween festivities? The downside of policy is that the next day is always November.

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,090
Always like this year. Really. So here we are in November.

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,590
First, I thought it might be a good time to just kind of reconnect on the class schedule,

6
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,920
make sure we're all on the same page, and importantly to see if there's any questions that folks might have.

7
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:07,640
Yeah. So here we are today. We'll talk a little bit about exposure and risk assessment and then we'll move into later

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,040
this week and next week talking about finally about how to control some of these exposures.

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,239
What are some of the mitigation opportunities to actually reduce the exposures?

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,569
Right. We spend a lot of time on classifying how exposed what the adverse impacts might be, what can we actually do about it.

11
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,260
So we'll get into that over the next couple of class periods.

12
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,560
I wanted to point out that I rearranged the schedule a little bit a couple of weeks out,

13
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,720
and it was actually in response to a question that Kate posed. I think it was last class session.

14
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,930
If you recall, when we when I signed the proposal, I said that I moved it back,

15
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,640
the due date back a couple of days because it otherwise would have fallen on Election Day of the due date.

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,240
And whatever the dean and others had suggested, you know, Election Day is important for many reasons,

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,809
maybe not high on assignments or certainly exams on that day.

18
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,730
So I pushed it back a couple of days and Kate pointed out, well, hey, now it overlaps with our S and the news assignment.

19
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,810
It was it was originally scheduled for this 10th.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,170
So I looked at the calendar and I couldn't find a reason for, you know, there's no harm in putting that back.

21
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:24,710
So I went ahead and did that. So now that s and the news assignment is well, days later, not until November 22nd.

22
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,400
It rearranges things a little bit, but it was of no consequence.

23
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:37,280
The worst thing is that now you're stuck listening to me lecture four one, two, three, four class periods in our so apologies for that.

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,460
But in total, hopefully it's a benefit to most, if not all of you.

25
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:58,550
I did want to circle back on the portfolio assignment and kind of prompts specifically whether there are any questions that folks have at this point.

26
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:06,560
Hopefully, you've had a chance to to dig in a little bit, if not actively writing, you know, thinking pretty,

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,100
pretty hard about what you might be trying to chase down in terms of your your exposure assessment approach.

28
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,219
Are there any questions that folks have come up with so far? Couple.

29
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,580
I saw this and first. Oh, did you ever mention what kind of situation?

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,790
I don't recall. But good question. Let's see.

31
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,710
What can I say about citations? I did say that they're not included in the page limit.

32
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,080
So a figure tables and then reference lists aren't included.

33
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,270
My answer would be to definitely cite your references and list them in terms of the format.

34
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,590
Whatever is your preference, just kind of click a style and be consistent throughout the manuscript, right?

35
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,680
So some people just include a superscript, right?

36
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,580
A one, a two or three, and then there's a full list at the end of the references, you know, by a number.

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,610
Other styles are to actually include them at the bottom of each page.

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,530
There are multiple options if folks are struggling with how to do that.

39
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,950
Reach out to me. I can I can put out a link. Maybe I'll do that.

40
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:30,850
I'll send out an announcement on canvas with a link to a couple of different options just in case folks are struggling with what to do there.

41
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,850
Great question. And then I saw another question, Rebecca. Yeah.

42
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,100
Is there like a good place to look for examples of proposals?

43
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Examples of proposals. So the answer is yes.

44
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:02,820
But the reason that I'm struggling is I'm not sure if there are good examples for what you're being asked to do specifically here.

45
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:17,590
Let me go ahead and see if I can find. There are certainly resources, Web sites that I can direct folks to for how how to write a proposal.

46
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,150
They're going to be geared more around the research, around forming a hypothesis,

47
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,340
research objective, that type of thing, which is not really what you're asked to do here.

48
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:40,560
So much here is it's more of a a proposed application that you're not being asked to take up some some new strategy that no one's ever used before.

49
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,820
Right. That's novel and innovative. You are being asked to apply kind of state of the science write in and you

50
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,340
all are very quickly have become a kind of expert in this field of exposure,

51
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,270
science and exposure assessment. So so good question.

52
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,570
Let me see if I can if I can find some resources there.

53
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:13,300
Did you have a comment? Yeah, I was just wondering if there would be one like from eagle or eagle or some other body that.

54
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,190
Yeah, that's presumably their public. That's what I'm going to hope to come across.

55
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,200
But there's not yeah. There's not one in my mind that I already know that I can easily find.

56
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,330
So I will probably in the same announcement,

57
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:38,620
want to send some links with regards to reference style and format as well as maybe some basics that if not,

58
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,879
you know, explicitly in this style, but just conceptually, you know, how to to propose.

59
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,650
But to this is actually a good point of clarification.

60
00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:02,290
I am not looking to grade you on on how well you've proposed.

61
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,080
Right. I'm not looking for you to make a hypothesis and to come up with research objectives.

62
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm not even looking for it to be in any particular format or style.

63
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:22,419
What I'm what I'm looking for is really the the content within whichever way that you choose to kind of

64
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:29,020
describe it and those you will all come up with kind of a slightly different approach to just your own style.

65
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:36,790
It's probably going to be more of a narrative and it is going to be some sort of formal proposal in terms of the format.

66
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:49,330
So so know that, right? In terms of how this grading following this rubric, if you've been able to just introduce the topic of contamination.

67
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,260
Right. I think I talked about it a little bit further up.

68
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:00,760
You know, the historical problem of people in community settings, if that's their you know, you're going to get points for it.

69
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,520
You've looked into it. You can kind of tell that story what the problem has been up until this point.

70
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,080
And uh, the gist of it in terms of points.

71
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,530
So most of the points is number two here, this component,

72
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,910
which is really what you're proposing as an exposure assessment methodology describing that sampling strategy,

73
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:31,150
what exposure measurement methods or other data that you might be kind of secondary or supporting data that you might be proposing to collect.

74
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,860
Right. And it's kind of going back to just the course material that we've talked about in class over the last couple of months.

75
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:47,080
Uh, you know what the options are. So I'm looking for you to be able to convey that you understand what these options are.

76
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,480
You understand the, the benefits and challenges of each of them,

77
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,440
and then your ability to kind of propose which one makes the most sense for this particular application.

78
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,590
And then, yes, I am looking for you to identify,

79
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,430
based on what you're proposing or based on these exposure assessment methods, where are some of the uncertainties?

80
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:20,350
Right? Where might you be a little bit unsure or where might the resulting data have some uncertainty associated with it?

81
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,370
And then how does this play into a standard?

82
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,530
You're going to collect some data. The data is going to, uh, show something.

83
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,720
Are there standards out there that help you to interpret the data or what actions might come of it?

84
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,110
So being able to just be knowledgeable of that and demonstrate that you appreciate and understand it.

85
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,410
And then again, simply that the proposal length being in that 8 to 10 page range.

86
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,600
In terms of how to kind of actually break this out or take this out.

87
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,470
This is a suggested format based on the kind of order of components here, maybe starting with an introduction,

88
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,070
actually proposing and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of different methodology approaches.

89
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,020
Which ones you're going to propose?

90
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,660
I support the uncertainties associated with that and how those results might be interpreted based on any relevant standards that are in place.

91
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,730
But you can choose a different format if it's easier for you that that's not an order you have to follow.

92
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,610
You can mix that in match it. You can you can discuss things out of that order and it's totally fine.

93
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,270
I will be looking for it. And if I see it and it's addressed, you know, that's all I'll I'll buy the grade similarly,

94
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:48,350
not based on, you know, your, you know, your ability to follow this specific order.

95
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,590
Does that answer the question? That was a really long winded answer.

96
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:10,320
Okay. Should be the subtitles that are separating the parts of it or that might help.

97
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:20,370
Again, not a requirement, but yeah, I think that would be probably a logical, uh, structure if you want to just say, you know, for example,

98
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:30,780
uh, you know, section one or Section eight, introduction, uh, section two or section three, I would say figure something out.

99
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,780
If you are really organized and it helps you to kind of self-organize, you can do, you know, section one,

100
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,600
subsection A and B, right, with kind of subheadings within that and break things down even further.

101
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:51,990
I wouldn't suggest going, uh, as informal as like always, I would still stick to kind of like,

102
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,580
you know, paragraph and in sentences, uh, you know, to convey your approach.

103
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,860
Um, but yeah, if that helps to organize, I just want to clarify.

104
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm not, I'm not grading, I'm kind of getting back to my previous comment.

105
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm not grading on your organization. Right? Or you are kind of you're not going to allow me with any fanciness, right?

106
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,959
There's no expectations about having this look, you know, pretty so don't don't spend any time on,

107
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,730
you know, colorful graphics or cool, uh, borders or something like that, you know, within your document.

108
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:40,799
I was yeah. Yeah. So I'm just wondering, since we're picking a place that already exists, in theory, I guess we don't have to.

109
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,490
But do you want us to also cite the history of P like already found in most

110
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,010
areas because I know you go has like a lot of that information already online,

111
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:01,350
so it's up to you. Uh, so, you know, as part of the introduction to past contamination, you,

112
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,280
you might choose to focus on, uh, Michigan or if you're choosing a real community, right?

113
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,760
If there are issues in that community, for sure, it doesn't need to be limited to that, and it doesn't have to be that.

114
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,339
You can talk about it more broadly across the country or even outside of the country as

115
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,110
part of your your introduction or kind of the history that's gotten us to this point.

116
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,320
And then, yeah, in terms of that community, it can be a real community, right?

117
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,510
For example, Ann Arbor, it can also be totally fictitious if that helps you.

118
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,590
Uh, you can make up your own community, its population, its demographics,

119
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,110
you know, whatever it is that might help you kind of work through this, I guess.

120
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm also wondering in terms of like because the ones that exist have like histories of sampling processes, I almost feel.

121
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,110
I'm overly reducing my workload if I like want to just continue doing that same family structure.

122
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,870
Yeah. So I mean, obviously I would want to think critically about the sampling method.

123
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,269
Yeah. And that was I was doing everything but like that's what I was going to come back to is, you know,

124
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,100
this is where, you know, most of the evaluation is your ability to, to convey all of this.

125
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:27,990
Um, and, yeah, that, and, you know, in terms of references, what I don't want you to do is to find some like single EPA website that says,

126
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:39,570
what should you do if there's, you know, contamination and then simply regurgitate that inside that EPA document, you know, 27 times, uh, dig in.

127
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:46,169
You can definitely use those types of resources. Certainly there's going to be some from the state of Michigan within Eagle.

128
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,320
There's going to be EPA in the other states, probably.

129
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:58,589
Um, but don't be afraid to get into, uh, not only the peer reviewed literature, but kind of the softer literature, right?

130
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,780
There's going to be a lot of history that's in like news articles and things like this that help to kind of tell the story.

131
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:13,890
So utilize kind of like multiple resources in that regard in terms of how you research this and then, uh, kind of base your, your whole methodology.

132
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,160
There are great questions, by the way. Yes.

133
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,260
Just kind of wondering, like what kind of security we might be expected to have so we don't have any real data.

134
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:35,670
Yeah, there are not expected. So there's a real answer to your question that that's only in there as a note that how I'm

135
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,220
kind of assessing the length of the proposal being in that application of that piece,

136
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,870
an age range. I'm not counting whatever figures might be included or whatever tables might be included.

137
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,160
I don't want to suggest, you know, figures and tables. But again, it's sometimes it's helpful, right?

138
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,440
If you can find a ready made figure that helps you to kind of tell a story or without trying to,

139
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,670
you know, create spend a lot of time creating something on your own. That's totally fine to do.

140
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,950
Any other questions? All right.

141
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:30,830
Well, I have made some notes to myself to follow up with a posting on canvas, which is easily some way to,

142
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,790
you know, kind of some citation approaches that you might take for references.

143
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:46,849
And then, uh, being hopeful that I can find some links about even if they're not so much how to write a proposal,

144
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,110
which is not necessarily what, what I'm looking for here, again,

145
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm not evaluating and understand how well you can write a proposal,

146
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,270
but maybe some examples of previous calls for proposals and what has been asked and how it's been spelled out.

147
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,550
All right. Continue to reach out to me as you continue working on this and you have questions over the next couple of class periods.

148
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,649
I'll try to start the class on these lines and prompt folks for questions because

149
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,570
they know it's getting you're getting more and more into it for the next few days.

150
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:32,719
All right. So shifting gears to today's topic, and I did have an announcement to actually start class as well here today.

151
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,230
We're talking about exposure assessment and risk assessment.

152
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:44,240
But I wanted to draw your attention to a seminar that some of you or most of you even might be interested in.

153
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,690
They're coming out very soon. This is tomorrow. So we have a guest from the University of Maryland, Professor Devin Sturgis,

154
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:04,040
who's presenting on some of us and some of us are overcoming the some of environmental burdens impacting minority populations.

155
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,120
So we've talked a little bit in this class, right, about.

156
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,870
Storms or accumulation of exposures.

157
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,469
I think Professor Meeker, actually in the last lecture, talked a little bit about it in terms of,

158
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:27,340
you know, using the term cumulative to be a single pollutant or contaminant for the life course.

159
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:38,290
But then also cumulative can mean all of the different hazards and stressors that we encounter, whether chemical, physical, biological, psychosocial.

160
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,590
Right. In that sense, cumulative kind of all at the same time, which we understand as a reality.

161
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,400
And so, uh, this is something that the field has, has a,

162
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,720
like for sure is being able to account for all of these factors at the same time, which is what the reality is.

163
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,790
Many of the standards need to be evaluated one at a time.

164
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,200
Right. Here's a Professor Meeker talked about exposure and dose and response.

165
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,650
And that's how an individual chemical is is regulated.

166
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,410
But the reality is we're exposed to all of those chemicals at the same time.

167
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:31,870
Right. And there's there's not a whole lot. Professor Julianne's lecture talked a little bit about that, the ability to mix in different chemicals.

168
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,170
And again, it goes beyond chemicals. It's really all of these stressors.

169
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,650
And then there are also all of the, you know, kind of vulnerability factors that come into play susceptible populations.

170
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:51,370
Anyway, it's a long winded introduction, but if you have time tomorrow at 1:00, the Cornell, the Room 1680 is just outside.

171
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,960
You're kind of right from the lobby area by the main entrance. Uh, check it out.

172
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,320
All right, so our learning objectives for today, uh, really defining the goals of risk assessment.

173
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,280
Kind of. What is it? What do we mean by risk assessment? What are we trying to accomplish?

174
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:19,300
There are four specific components that we're going to define and describe will step through each of them, specifically, uh,

175
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:31,990
understanding the role of exposure assessment itself in assessing risk and understanding the relationship between risk assessment and risk management.

176
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,340
So a lot of this is going to be definitions and, uh,

177
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:47,250
we're using terms that maybe conceptually sound very similar, so importantly differentiating between them.

178
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:56,309
So when we talk about risk, what we mean is the probability of injury or disease or death or,

179
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,830
you know, some sort of health outcome from exposure to a hazard to oppressor.

180
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,350
And these end up being a function of the potential for exposure,

181
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:18,000
the characteristics of us as receptors and the likelihood of occurrence of exposures and health effects taking place.

182
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,580
Contrasting that a little bit, contrasting risk with risk assessment.

183
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:34,470
This is more specifically the scientific approach to how we evaluate the potential for harm from environmental stressors.

184
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:44,760
So the risk assessment framework and approach allows us to answer questions such as how harmful is a particular stressor,

185
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,350
how important of a priority is it or should it be, uh, along the same lines,

186
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:58,260
which agents are of the greatest concern, uh, and what's their comparative risk, right?

187
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,300
If you are exposed to a bunch of stuff, you know which ones are the most important as you compare them.

188
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:12,390
And this process, uh, kind of historically was codified by the National Academies going back to 1983,

189
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,650
uh, in their document titled Risk Assessment and the Federal Government Managing the Process.

190
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,640
And it's been known ever since, as simply referred to as the Red Book.

191
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,980
So within the U.S. Right. And we we kind of have this U.S. centric focus.

192
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,250
We'll go back out a little bit outside of the U.S. later in the class period.

193
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,660
But within the U.S., there's a four part risk assessment framework.

194
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,900
And again, we'll step through each of these independently.

195
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:52,590
But it's looking at hazard identification, exposure, assessment, dose response assessment, and then finally risk characterization.

196
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,150
So who actually regulates risk in the US?

197
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:05,050
We've talked a little bit about these different kind of regulatory bodies or agencies.

198
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,790
There's four primary agencies in the US that actually regulate risk.

199
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,560
One is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency primarily focusing in kind of those community environmental settings.

200
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,750
Another is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA,

201
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,760
which is focusing mostly mostly in workplaces, the Food and Drug Administration.

202
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,850
And then finally, the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

203
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:42,820
There are other agencies, many of them, actually, that are involved in risk assessment but don't serve as official regulatory bodies.

204
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,210
This can include health and human services like the National Institutes of Health, for example.

205
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:59,650
Many of the state and even local county level health departments and health agencies, the Department of the Interior itself.

206
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,730
As well as a whole array of non governmental organizations.

207
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,649
And then a risk assessment isn't isn't simple.

208
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,990
And yet go ahead and stare at that for for a moment. It's a fine one.

209
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:30,030
Uh, you know, reality can be so complex that what are seemingly equally valid observations from differing perspectives can appear to be contradictory.

210
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,490
Uh, do you. Do you see this conflict here, the seven or eight or five?

211
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:47,190
It might be a little bit too early for that, but yeah, I, yeah, I every I've used this line now for a few years and it's, it's baffling.

212
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:57,350
You're trying to follow those lines. We are pretty good, at least historically, at assessing risks.

213
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,430
Right. My favorites, spiders, snakes, if you see them, stay away.

214
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,950
Right. Uh, you know, certainly fire, right?

215
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:12,510
This is kind of like almost in an eight over eight. And if there's fire nearby, you know, run in the other direction.

216
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:22,200
So we're good in that sense. Uh, but we're maybe not so good with what we might consider kind of more modern risks.

217
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,720
So this is going back to, uh, you know, kind of one of Professor Knight's approaches of,

218
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,350
of listing what might be a ranking, what might be the greatest risk to us.

219
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:47,610
So starting with, you know, uh, ranked number one, uh, being the, the worst risk of, of death all the way down to how many other there were seven.

220
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,620
So give a minute, look at these different options. Come up with maybe your top three.

221
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,650
What do you think is the the highest risk of death?

222
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,260
The next highest risk of death, and then the third highest risk of death out of these seven choices?

223
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,010
Yeah, I just want to clarify that eating a thousand bananas is not in one sitting.

224
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,350
Um, yeah, there are several components of that, right?

225
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,780
Because if you were to eat a thousand bananas in an hour, there would be other factors that come into play.

226
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,460
So yeah, perhaps over like a reasonable time frame.

227
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,500
Who was the champion sprinter?

228
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,549
Was the Du Sein Bolt?

229
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:32,760
Was he the one who would eat like, I don't know, like 20 bananas a day or something like that as part of the training or on race day?

230
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:40,690
I don't know what it was, so I don't think yeah, I don't think a thousand is realistic but just given it, you know what say monster.

231
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:51,280
And I'll get I'll give you a minute or so to kind of ponder this. And.

232
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:19,660
It was dangerous.

233
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:39,590
It's like. All right.

234
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:48,260
What would do folks think? What do you think is going to give the highest risk of death out of these seven choices?

235
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:58,920
He wants to get me the peanut butter.

236
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,130
Peanut allergies are common. Okay. Peanut butter.

237
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,620
Any other for peanut butter? You hands going up.

238
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,259
Okay. What else?

239
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,400
How of the non peanut butter fans? 4 hours.

240
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,290
Okay. Uh, 4 hours. Traveling by anyone else in support of the canoe.

241
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:30,660
Okay. Is this include your risk of injury or accident?

242
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:38,340
This is going to be so regardless of what the mechanism is that ISM is is resulting in death.

243
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,870
The highest risk of death.

244
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,360
Good question. We've got peanut butter traveling by canoe.

245
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,280
Any others? I think the thousands of bananas.

246
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,610
Just like the overload of potassium. Okay.

247
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,290
Anyone else for bananas? All hands there.

248
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,520
All right. Are there any others other than those three, the folks that come up with.

249
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,800
I have. Denver is my name. Denver is number two.

250
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,090
Okay. Yeah, I guess. What? What else? Any of those that you have in your top three.

251
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,050
Outside of peanut butter and banana.

252
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,550
All month in Denver. 4 hours by connect. All right.

253
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,480
Let's see how we are faring here. Okay.

254
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,200
So number one two, the highest risk of death is actually traveling for hours by canoe.

255
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:49,510
Number two is living 12 months in Denver.

256
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,980
So that traveling by canoe is the risk of accident. Right.

257
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,580
So, like bad things happen when you're in a canoe, mostly when you're out of the Canadian, most likely.

258
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,720
Right. Number two is living 12 months in Denver.

259
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,620
This is because of the altitude. Right.

260
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:12,190
And the cosmic radiation that folks receive, uh, number three is eating those eight tablespoons of peanut butter.

261
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,850
And it's because of the biological risk associated with that aflatoxin.

262
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:24,270
That can be peanuts. And then number four, we discussed it is the thousand bananas.

263
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,420
And it is related to the potassium. But because of the radioactive decay of potassium more specifically.

264
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,670
So that's a radiation dose. With eating, though, is fine.

265
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,090
Okay. So, you know, the disclaimer here is that you all are kind of exposure science experts, right?

266
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,610
And you really have a kind of an advanced understanding of risk.

267
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,799
You can probably see, right, if you were to whatever trivia night with your friends and pose this question,

268
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,900
they're probably not going to fare very well. Right. And this is kind of where we are as a population.

269
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,790
There's there's not a good appreciation for some of the moderate risks.

270
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,570
And again,

271
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:12,070
this is the reason for why there is risk assessment built into this process in having experts like yourselves that can actually go through in a way,

272
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:20,290
all of these things make recommendations, uh, implement policy and, and enforce regulations.

273
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,649
All right. So with this risk assessment process, Thursday's four components.

274
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,960
The first one is hazard identification. And we'll actually take time here and step through all four of those.

275
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:42,370
So with hazard identification, we're asking the question of what health problems are caused by this particular stressor.

276
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,910
So this is more of a descriptive process.

277
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:55,250
It's not so much quantitative. So describing, able to describe, you know,

278
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,940
what are the potential adverse health effects from from a specific agent are

279
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,760
what are the mechanisms by which that agent could cause the adverse effects?

280
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:16,090
And then being able to kind of get into the dose, the route of exposure, how long that exposure takes place,

281
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,630
and importantly, the timing of the exposures that might be associated with those adverse effects.

282
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,470
So really more of a descriptive process, descriptive understanding.

283
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,180
And in that hazard intensification, there are some steps.

284
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,430
One would be reviewing data on toxicology and human health impacts.

285
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:43,390
Right. Of a specific agent, identifying and describing the mode of action within the body.

286
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,000
So this is getting at kind of the mechanistic component,

287
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:55,930
reviewing the an exposure under which those adverse effects rise and then kind of conducting this weight of evidence evaluation.

288
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,230
Right. How much is there that's known about it?

289
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:09,610
And do we have a high degree of confidence, you know, based on the evidence there, to inform our hazard identification?

290
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:20,590
In that data review, it would be looking for descriptive evidence for specific potential impacts.

291
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:27,160
Importantly, distinguishing between cancer versus non-cancer responses.

292
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,730
Right. Um, and related to that, the route of exposure.

293
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,000
I think I have it here in an upcoming slide.

294
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:47,920
But whether we're talking about the contaminant or a hazard that is potentially carcinogenic or not really impacts,

295
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,010
uh, the time frame for cancer causing agents.

296
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,159
We would then be looking to assess exposure and assess risk over a long time period, right?

297
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:04,640
Because this is kind of the mechanism of toxicity related to carcinogenic compounds, whereas some other compounds, right?

298
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,390
All it takes is like a few minutes of exposure to result in some acute health effect.

299
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:17,330
And so the time frame would be quite different. In terms of that mode of action.

300
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,950
So we would look at animal studies.

301
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,430
There are a lot of animal studies and this is where most of the mechanistic information comes from.

302
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,920
But importantly, how well does that translate? Can we translate the animal studies to people?

303
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,200
How does the response vary with dose and importantly at low dose?

304
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:44,210
There's often a lot of information about some almost unrealistically high dose in animal studies, and it results in something bad.

305
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,190
But is that relevant to kind of the real world with regards to humans?

306
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,930
And can we evaluate what a response might be at a much lower dose?

307
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,510
How does the impact vary across susceptible populations?

308
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:00,830
Right.

309
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:12,020
So again, this is, you know, most of the adverse health effects from environmental hazards are disproportionately impacting susceptible populations.

310
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:22,610
So that's really where the focus should be. And then how and under what conditions the agent might cause toxins and then fate and exposure.

311
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,980
So what does this mean in terms of hazard ification? So what media the agent most likely would be accumulating?

312
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,240
Is it is it in the air? It's in the water, for example.

313
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,970
How does it cycle in the environment? How long does it exist?

314
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,660
Is it inert? Is it something that breaks down into different byproducts?

315
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,920
And then based on this. Right, what are the relevant routes of exposure?

316
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,810
Yes. So the indicators of concern would be a perhaps an agent that's persistent,

317
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,620
meaning it doesn't degrade rapidly in the environment, but I think would be a good example of that.

318
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:13,610
Does it accumulate in the food chain? It might actually exist in environmental media at low concentrations in the air or in water.

319
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:24,860
But as it deposits perhaps into aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems, if it can bio accumulate and then result in high concentrations through ingestion,

320
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:31,140
for example, and then certainly something that's highly toxic would be a concern.

321
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,350
And then that last step and how the ratification is evaluating the weight of evidence.

322
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:49,290
So this would really be a kind of a narrative summarizing the hazard assessment and what the conclusions might be regarding,

323
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,020
uh, potential for both cancer and non-cancer health outcomes.

324
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:01,850
Explaining the evidence that's available and how it fits together or perhaps doesn't fit together,

325
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,520
there might be some inconsistent evidence out there.

326
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,520
And then this process, it really points out, you know, what the significant issues are.

327
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,870
It points out what we know and what we don't know, what the strengths are.

328
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:24,150
But it also importantly, what the limitations of the data that are out there and what conclusions could potentially be drawn from them.

329
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,600
Yes. So this is a specific one for the cancer component.

330
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:41,100
There's an international agency for research on cancer that classifies substances to show whether it's expected to cause cancer or not.

331
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:47,450
And it places substances into one of five categories, depending on the strength of evidence.

332
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:53,370
So it's really relying on this this kind of weight of evidence to evaluate carcinogenicity.

333
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:04,100
Okay. So that's hazardous vacation. Now let's move to exposure assessment, which we talked quite a bit about in this class.

334
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:13,460
Right. So in this case, we are concerned with how much of the pollutant, uh, do people inhale, for example, during a specific time period?

335
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,450
How many people are exposed to these types of questions?

336
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,020
We're looking to identify and evaluate population exposed.

337
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:34,010
What's the composition and size of the population? Importantly, we've talked quite a bit with the magnitude of the exposure, the frequency,

338
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,710
the duration, how long does the exposure last, and importantly, what's the relative exposure?

339
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:48,080
Uh, and then using exposure information to be able to estimate what a dose might be.

340
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,410
This is kind of going back to not as complicated as Professor Jolie's approach with intake fraction,

341
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:04,280
but simply being able to estimate what intake might be of an agent.

342
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:12,080
And looking at this kind of simple formula over here on the left intake is a function of the concentration of the agent.

343
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:22,310
In medium, the rate of intake, the rate at which the medium enters the body, the duration of exposure, and then the bioavailability.

344
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,850
And over here, as I often do in this class, I'm using PM 2.5 as kind of as a sample.

345
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:37,670
Right. So the concentration might be something like one milligram, hopefully something less than let's go with one micrograms per cubic meter.

346
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,840
You know, the intake rate would be related to inhalation or out of exposure related to our breathing rate.

347
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,910
So we're inhaling, you know, some volume per day.

348
00:39:50,540 --> 00:40:00,410
The duration might be for a bioavailability and then we can calculate, you know, what the actual intake is in terms of a mass quantity.

349
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:15,300
Estimating dose. So the dose rate for and I kind of alluded to this a few minutes ago for not carcinogenic,

350
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,910
uh, compounds of concern or generally looking at an average daily dose.

351
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:36,660
Right. So when what happens in units of mass of the count component over them, the mass of us and then averaged out over some time period.

352
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,680
Whereas for carcinogenic compounds,

353
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,340
we're looking at being able to estimate kind of a lifetime average daily dose because it's a

354
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:53,820
much longer time period that we're utilizing to assess carcinogenic potential and impact on.

355
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,210
Moving on to dose response assessment.

356
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,440
So at this point, it's looking to look at more quantitative.

357
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,940
What are the health problems at different exposure levels?

358
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,049
Right. So we're looking at kind of dose that classic dose response curve.

359
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,510
For those of you that are in the six of two, course, you you're learning quite a bit about this,

360
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:32,600
but there are some really interesting or important components in this dose response that we're looking to evaluate.

361
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:42,530
One is, is there a threshold, right? Is there a certain level of exposure at which, okay,

362
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:49,400
we now start to see health effects and anything below that, we don't see if that threshold can be identified.

363
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,140
It's highly valuable in this risk assessment process.

364
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,040
We're often looking at being able to identify a slope height.

365
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:08,569
So, you know, what's an equation that can describe that dose response curve that allows us to extrapolate

366
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:15,590
right under different exposure conditions what might be the risk of adverse impact on health?

367
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:26,990
And then we actually get into the risk characterization which is coming around to the more relevant questions of,

368
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:35,149
you know, what's the extra risk of developing a health problem in an exposed population.

369
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,479
This is kind of like where the rubber hits the road, so to speak,

370
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,910
and coming up with what's truly going to inform the policy or the regulations that would be put in place to be protective of health.

371
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:54,989
So risk characterization evaluates the overall kind of quality of investment and importantly,

372
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:01,110
the confidence in the estimates that we come up with risk and what conclusions we might draw.

373
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,120
So what kind of brings everything together?

374
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:11,760
The hazard is application, the exposure assessment, and what we've learned from the dose response analysis.

375
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:21,720
And it allows us to describe risks, individuals and populations in terms of the extent of the risk,

376
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,330
the severity of the risk and the probable harm that might come.

377
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:39,680
And then importantly, it includes the ability to communicate results from this to decision makers, which is not always easy,

378
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:47,470
and it's not a safe assumption that it can be easily communicated from truly kind of the scientific sphere.

379
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:56,960
Right. We've talked about this kind of science policy challenge from the scientific sphere to the policymaking process.

380
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,890
And then importantly, we talked about this, I think, in a different setting earlier in the semester,

381
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,800
but I wanted to talk about variability and uncertainty.

382
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:17,100
So variability refers to the quantities that are inherently variable or heterogeneous within a population.

383
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:28,830
So amongst us there are different food consumption rates right by age, gender, whatever it might be.

384
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,040
There's going to be certainly variability in exposure or duration.

385
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:45,180
And even for looking at carcinogenic potential, the lifetime rate of different individuals in a lifetime is going to vary quite a bit.

386
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,660
Uncertainty. So to contrast variability with uncertainty.

387
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,100
Uncertainty means really a lack of precise knowledge about something.

388
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,490
So in this case, it might be the lack of knowledge around the potential exposure scenarios.

389
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,910
We just don't understand it well enough. Therefore, there's uncertainty involved with the estimates that we come up with.

390
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:17,410
There might be a lack of knowledge of potential distribution. How are these exposure variables are distributed?

391
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:30,040
So questions like how well measured are the exposures or how well-defined are the models that we're using estimate exposures.

392
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:37,120
So there are many potential sources of uncertainty in this process, and it's really,

393
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,850
really important to have an appreciation for those uncertainties in this process.

394
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,950
All right. So when we put together these things, um, we have risk assessment, right?

395
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,080
Which is our goal here. We also want to be able to manage risk.

396
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:06,980
So this is kind of implementing policy and having regulatory decisions come in to the picture, but then importantly, risk communication, right?

397
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:17,510
So risk assessment and you know, these risk characterizations that we come up with directly inform risk management, right?

398
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,650
So whether regulatory decisions are put in place or not.

399
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:28,790
Risk assessment also informs risk communication. So how risk is considered?

400
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:33,470
Know what are kind of public opinions or responses to that?

401
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,370
What are the the sociological components of risk acceptability?

402
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:49,610
Right. I think we all agree that most people don't want there to be risk.

403
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:58,880
We're probably all on the same page there. But they're important components of the society that weigh in with ranking.

404
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:10,580
And how important is it? Right. So a big one in this country is what's more important, moneymaking potential or risk to health.

405
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,950
Right. And oftentimes during conflict.

406
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:25,160
So that risk communication process also indirectly ends up impacting risk management in terms of what policy actually gets put into place.

407
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:37,100
All right. In terms of future directions, Donna, we'll see if this is the directions that we're that we go in this country.

408
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:46,070
I really want to come back to you. I think the framework in the European Union is really such a strong contrast that it's worth coming back to here.

409
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:56,960
We talked about reach the registration evaluation authorization, restriction of chemicals and how it requires all chemicals that are manufactured,

410
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:08,270
imported and used in the EU to be assessed for safety prior to being mass produced and mass distributed.

411
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,320
Whereas in this country it's a little bit backwards.

412
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,250
Somebody comes up with, you know, a novel compound.

413
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:23,240
It's great for this. And the other products it's put out into the population widely.

414
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,740
And then a couple of decades later, right, we end up identifying, hey, you know what?

415
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:33,319
We we've determined through epidemiology, retrospective exposure, assessment,

416
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,150
whatever it is that it's causing, you know, this adverse impact on health.

417
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:45,319
So, you know, within this field of exposure science, you know,

418
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:54,140
we're definitely looking to to follow a framework that's much more in line with what the European Union is using.

419
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:05,270
And it's it, even though it's, uh, you know, reach itself is focused within Europe, within the EU,

420
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:14,700
it is having an impact worldwide because of this component of imported and used it.

421
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:24,800
So anything that's coming into the EU, even if it's manufactured and produced elsewhere, still is required by the EU to follow this process.

422
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:30,230
And I think, yeah, I'm really early today.

423
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:39,350
Any questions on that? That was kind of a lot of material, all in a relatively short period of time.

424
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:44,540
But any questions around kind of exposure assessment and then more importantly, this risk assessment framework?

425
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:53,240
So it seems like there's been a little bit of a dichotomy between cancer and non service function and of how we approach them methodologically.

426
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:02,290
In general, is it safe to say that we can apply like the cancer approach to any exposure that has an effect over a longer time frames,

427
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,720
like for example? Yeah.

428
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:13,260
And it's yes. For some it is more along the lines of other cancer.

429
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:22,340
I think, you know, the differentiation is really if the focus is on carcinogenicity or not, if the answer is yes,

430
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:35,450
then we're really following this kind of long term exposure assessment and, and interpretation of risk for other chemicals.

431
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:42,820
Um, certainly those that are on a much shorter timeframe, you know, more acute types of impacts on health, right?

432
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,930
We're looking at shorter time periods.

433
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:51,709
But you're right, there are some that kind of like blends, maybe not even one or the other, but maybe even a little bit in between.

434
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,030
Right. And there's terms that are used like others, acute and chronic.

435
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:02,840
And there's a bunch of descriptors, you know, kind of in between subacute, some chronic, you know, these types of things.

436
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:11,090
But yes, there are there are compounds. And I think we've talked about even some regulatory examples of how standards are set.

437
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:21,830
Right. There's the one I think we talked a way earlier in the semester about ozone in the air that, you know, is a respiratory irritant.

438
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:35,390
Children with asthma anymore, with a respiratory condition where, you know, exposure for even an hour and can result in adverse, natural, you know,

439
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:50,300
quantifiable symptomatic impacts on health where as lead exposure taking place in an hour doesn't result in a health effect on that day.

440
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:57,140
Right. This is it's a it's a very it's a lag, um, and a cumulative exposure.

441
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:03,440
And because of that, all the standard for ozone or what's allowed to be in the air,

442
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:11,990
it's a one hour time period, at least that minimum for lead is an average over a three month time period.

443
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:18,740
Right. So that would be a good example. Uh, it's not carcinogenic, right?

444
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:25,370
Um, and it's not a lifetime exposure, but it's not, it's not one hour or one day.

445
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,880
It's kind of something that falls on everything. But yeah, really good question.

446
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,040
Does that sort of answer your question? It wasn't a direct answer. It was more of like a long interview response.

447
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,100
It's it's complicated. So yeah. Yeah.

448
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:44,480
But I think, right in terms of like you phrased it as a dichotomy, there's certainly have been for carcinogens.

449
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:50,120
For non carcinogens. It's not such a defined event. It's a it's a bit more broad.

450
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,320
Any other questions about any of the material from today?

451
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,599
Perhaps this is not this class but implement.

452
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:17,240
I'm really curious about the implementation of REACH because it is relatively recent compared to the chemicals, but it's regulating.

453
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:26,430
And so I'm curious how that. Because they couldn't have just stopped importing and manufacturing things for like while they studied.

454
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,559
Yes, that's my sense.

455
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:38,580
And so I'm curious how that was actually implemented and how it's like if there's a lag for assessing all of the chemicals that are there.

456
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,170
Yeah, I'm trying to remember the exact dates. I'm they're not fresh in my mind.

457
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,790
It's not an earlier slide from it, from an earlier class period.

458
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:56,250
Um, there was a several year lag from the time that the reach as a ruling was codified,

459
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,170
uh, to that, to its actual implementation and enforcement state.

460
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,830
There was a several year time period, so there was a lag there.

461
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:12,870
Um, and it's, you know, as much as we've talked about it several times in the class, I think Professor Meeker talked about it as well.

462
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:21,660
Um, it's not perfect by any means, but I think there's a good argument, at least from the scientific community,

463
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:28,680
and it's perhaps a much improved approach and what is being utilized here he was.

464
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:40,450
I'm also curious, like I imagine for some areas, if you're like doing risk assessment,

465
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:48,339
you don't want to say that you think like I'm just thinking about like politically how like in something like a proposal,

466
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,570
depending on the environment, they might not, they might be like.

467
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:01,980
I feel like Congress hates it. And you're getting into that kind of that science policy.

468
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:10,470
Right. And where the friction is there. From a scientific perspective, it doesn't matter, right?

469
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:15,750
It's science and it just ends up being a convenient example.

470
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,440
But as scientists. We're not just pulling this out of thin air.

471
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:34,160
Right. There are actually other, you know, uh, modern economies that that have adopted this, have implemented this and continue to function, right?

472
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,330
That, um, they have growing economies and so forth.

473
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,580
Right. That, that's kind of a pretty counter to the argument of I would never work.

474
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,110
Right? Everyone would lose their jobs and the economy would lives on its face and so forth.

475
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,780
Yeah. No. And, uh, you know, I. I know.

476
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,030
Whatever. It's my shameless plug with this.

477
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,880
The course I teach in the winter semester, which is on environmental health policy, really gets at this, right?

478
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:12,129
It's like, okay, we understand all the science around environmental exposures and the impacts on how there seem to be

479
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:17,110
some obvious implementations that we could that we could put into place to effectively mitigate,

480
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,650
reduce the exposures, massively improve health.

481
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,470
Why doesn't it happen? Where are the opportunities?

482
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,220
But but importantly, what are the challenges that prevent that?

483
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,560
And yeah, it's not an answer I can give, you know, it just to, you know, a few minutes.

484
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,210
Uh, it's an entire semester's worth of investigation.

485
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:50,200
Any other questions? All right.

486
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:56,709
Well, hey, I know we are considerably early, but I'm going to assume that that's not necessarily a bad thing,

487
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,070
especially since we're back to having the sun shining.

488
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,120
It's going to be, like, actually warm for another few days.

489
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:10,990
So enjoy the rest of your day. And if you have a chance, check out that seminar tomorrow at 1:00.

490
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,360
Otherwise, I will see you on Thursday.
