1
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:30,530
Okay. Good morning, everyone. I hope you have a great weekend and also that you have time to rest that week that we didn't meet.

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,040
Okay. Today we are going to discuss about Alzheimer's disease.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,390
In fact, this is a new topic for this class. I add this topic this year because I have been interested.

4
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,770
You know, I focus on my own research is type two diabetes genetics, type two diabetes, also diet in relation to type two diabetes.

5
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:05,900
Then I am interested between the link between now between Alzheimer inflammatory diseases, chronic diseases, in particular with type two diabetes.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:16,730
The reason I decided to put this topic in, in the syllables for this class, and then this is the first time that we are going to discuss it.

7
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,200
Then as always, my plan for two days.

8
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,470
First to talk the first part of the lecture about a little bit about Alzheimer's.

9
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm going to focus more on the epidemiology of Alzheimer, what we know about risk factor.

10
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:45,950
A little bit about genetics. And then in the second part, we will have the discussion about evolutionary theories on the origin of Alzheimer disease.

11
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:55,180
Now, Alzheimer's disease is the three the most common cause of dementia.

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:06,100
It's estimated that about 60 or maybe 80% of cases of dementia are due to Alzheimer's or Alzheimer related pathology.

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:17,350
Now, that first description of the disease was done by in 1907, you'll see that the very beginning of the 20th century by law of Alzheimer.

14
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:26,170
And the patient was at that time about 50, 51 years or so on proscenium dementia.

15
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:35,889
Initially, that description of Alzheimer was unknown, said age between 40 and 60 years old.

16
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,160
And this what that is a description with so memory loss, disorientation and space.

17
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:52,660
Carolyn's in appearance also regulates motor activity, leading after some time a complete lack of memory and comprehension,

18
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,220
leading to incontinence, incontinence, a rapid physical decline, even death.

19
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:10,450
Now, some of these characteristics are, in fact, similar to the image that you get to old age tools in light of dementia.

20
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:20,080
The only difference is the at the onset at that time, that definition was only that evening with the onset of all of Alzheimer's.

21
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,950
What does bronchodilator to be in that middle sixties for the onset?

22
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:40,240
Now I'm not going to because the also that is not my expertize or the discussion that is going on about the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's.

23
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:50,380
So people propose, I think, according to what I read, based on the symptoms or their proportion on some biomarkers.

24
00:03:50,770 --> 00:04:01,690
But you've seen the consensus, and this is according to some to the National Institute for Aging right now,

25
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:12,460
that they know these or first timers is a defining some ideological entity is going to based on biomarkers, basically amyloid doses.

26
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,190
These are the position of plaques in the in the brain also told catalog you

27
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:27,100
tall is up is a protein that is part of the skeletal cytoskeleton in neurons.

28
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:38,170
If things are you know say this protein is folded into this structure of neurons and also other biomarkers or the new generation.

29
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,510
But you can see through that years they have been changing criteria about how we define Alzheimer.

30
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,879
Now, again, I'm not going to discuss this in all my expertize, but for our purposes,

31
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:04,010
for this class, we are going to work or two to take the definition of Alzheimer's.

32
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,810
Somebody a new entity based on biomarkers.

33
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,649
QUESTION So far there's been know if there's like I don't think there is,

34
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:21,470
but is there a way to like pretest to see if you're like like if you had a family member?

35
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,460
Yes. Are you you're more predisposed to get also years.

36
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,910
You have family history. You are more your livelihood.

37
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,410
To get out to get that assignment is higher. Now, according to what I read,

38
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:43,660
there are some Mendelian cases like Inside Mare that are inheriting now dominant like

39
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,780
patrimonial imperatives and the gene that we know about that I'm going to disclose that.

40
00:05:50,200 --> 00:06:01,029
But the the problem that I have, according to what I read, is that most of these previous day, nausea is still is done.

41
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,950
You see that clinical criteria. Then, for example, there is a continuum.

42
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,400
Don't say a normal person that someone with some mild cognitive problems then are.

43
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:23,980
So far as I read, I think that the reason I bring this to Alzheimer's now you have family history and the reason paranoid parent is in

44
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:33,400
the family then is we know that genes hold that not all also well want to discuss about that risk factor because the.

45
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,940
Even though there are there is such an important contribution of genetic factors in Alzheimer's.

46
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,870
But if they are also a big part of modifiable risk factors,

47
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:54,540
that maybe we can intervene every young life or during middle midlife and where when to see what is the evidence regarding that?

48
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,650
It's like diet, like diet, for example. No, not initially again then.

49
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,990
Now, I think that's what we want to talk about the inflammatory aspects of Alzheimer,

50
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,980
because still what you'll see in the definition amyloidosis or pathology.

51
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,030
Yeah, we have the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain, although we got distracted by neurons,

52
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:33,360
but now is gaining attention that Alzheimer can have an inflammatory component that is going to be in part mediated

53
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,410
through these type of cells in the in the brain that microglia cells that are immune cells in the in the brain.

54
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,600
But again, we're going I think the second part to talk a little bit more about the inflammatory

55
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,520
aspects are how the evolutionary theory for that inflammation got into Alzheimer's.

56
00:07:51,690 --> 00:08:02,490
Now, basically, then, what I want to point out in the field, you can you see here, look with this screen, where is the meeting that's going?

57
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:15,919
You'll see in the field the Apple E protein that initially was thought that that relationship between Apple E and

58
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,510
Alzheimer's was mostly mediated through lipid metabolism because the ABO proteins related to lipid metabolism,

59
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:32,989
in particular cholesterol. However, now evidence points out it has an inflammatory regulatory function that would

60
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,930
be on most of the maybe mechanism linking poorly with Alzheimer's disease.

61
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:51,610
Now, how? How big is the burden of of assignment or dementia around the world?

62
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:01,360
Now, here again, I'm I want to clarify that this is dementia, but I remember about 60 or 80% of cases of dementia are due to exercise.

63
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:18,410
Now, there was a report from 2015. He estimated that overall by 2030 will be almost 25 millions of persons living with dementia in the world.

64
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,890
For 2050 will be more than 103 millions of persons with dementia living in the world.

65
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,500
They are somebody across different regions in the world, here in the in the Americas.

66
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,000
And the continent will be about 30 million of Barcelona living with dementia by 2050.

67
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,490
In Africa, the Middle East is estimated at about 60 million persons.

68
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,020
Europe, including all the parts of Russia in Asia, is estimated at 19 millions.

69
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,650
In Asia, about 67 million by 2050.

70
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,780
Then you can imagine the burden of these big numbers in the health systems.

71
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,660
Economic aspects, social aspects of dementia are under war now.

72
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:20,940
The big part of this, of course, is you got to deal with this course in the longevity lecture.

73
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,870
Now people are living longer and the risk factor for dementia or age,

74
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,710
but also the ah humidifier factor that maybe we can't, we can try to, to understand better how to and try to intervene.

75
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:49,510
Now here in the United States, there was a recent study for this year what based on data from the they follow almost all mediums or

76
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:58,030
subjects using passenger and data and you see that you see them by race and ethnicity in the United States.

77
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,430
Now, again, this information and most of them will be assignment.

78
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:15,460
Then you'll see. But by the middle sixties, you see as you slow on a start to growth after the seventies useful.

79
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:24,910
Now, according to this data, the group with a higher incidence of dementia in the United States.

80
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:39,070
Hispanics. Followed by Blacks, Asians, American Indian, Alaska Native and the group with the lowest incident are whites.

81
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:50,830
Now, we don't know the reason. Well, that could be and again, related to two differing psychophysical factors,

82
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,960
because the they are also getting into different Alice in frequency of of a body.

83
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,809
But I think most of the difference of you to modify it would be factors that can be are that

84
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,690
we would try to better understand that to and to make some public health interventions now.

85
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,200
But again see that we observe a big increase or diminish that you see and after the seventies.

86
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:32,070
Listen so far. Now, what I thought was I found this interesting and I won't want to point out limitations on the results.

87
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:39,570
These are based on cohort studies of mostly European ancestry participants.

88
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,320
Then we don't know whether these results can be, you know, lies to all their populations or to other ethnic groups.

89
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,670
But at least these data suggest that in the United States, in Western Europe,

90
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:04,450
incidence of Alzheimer disease could be decreasing in the last decade, maybe the last one or two decades.

91
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,320
Okay. These are the different code words that were done for these for this study in France.

92
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:17,339
Packet packaged they're done studies in Netherlands Framingham Heart study here in the United States or their cohort in Sweden,

93
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,530
U.K., France and Iceland. You'll see here the sample size of all this.

94
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:34,620
For what? Ali, for this analysis. How many years of follow up they have until that diagnosis that they measure the mean age for this time,

95
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:42,600
you see that they are in the middle seventies. Yet to allow for enough cases of dementia to approve women burst into women.

96
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,750
And again, I want to make this important clarification here.

97
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,630
You see that most of these cohort studies are from Caucasian ancestry.

98
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,710
Then we don't know whether the results can be applicable to other populations.

99
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,210
And again, this is the reason why we need to increase diversity in these type of studies,

100
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,650
because we want to know whether this is applicable to other populations.

101
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:15,659
Okay, let's see the results. And they say how many cases of dementia they were able to identify through

102
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,180
the different years of follow up and how many cases of incident Alzheimer's.

103
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Okay. So they were able to identify not what is it?

104
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:34,410
Could you suggest that again, the incident of dementia by different cohort and age group from the 65 up to the 89.

105
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:47,200
And you'll see again we observe basically that entering old age is a major risk factor for dementia wheelchairs on different several different quotes.

106
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,580
But basically wheelchair does a rate the same trend. The older the age, the higher the risk of dementia.

107
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,250
And again, these are from Western Europe and from the United States.

108
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:11,780
Now. Regarding the incident by six.

109
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,040
You feel that at least from the seventies up to the late set.

110
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,630
So sorry. From the sixties, middle 60 to the late seventies.

111
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,470
The rate of incidents is more or less equal.

112
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:50,410
Comparing men and women. However, after the seventies, women tend to have a higher incidence rate for dementia compared to men in older ages too.

113
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,380
I think I want to discuss today also in the second part.

114
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,970
These hypotheses about estrogen protection against Alzheimer.

115
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,690
However, here we go back to sixties. We already have.

116
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,530
Most women would be already monogamous in menopause.

117
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,620
I mean, the hypotheses that we're going to this quality that maybe estrogen during reproductive life as a protection against Alzheimer.

118
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,479
What is still unclear I think is why is until the late seventies early eighties

119
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,990
that we observed these differential sex for the risk of dementia with in so far.

120
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:49,310
Now let's see how that using the dementia are changing in the last ten years and this time comparing it to the

121
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:58,100
rate of dementia in that if it equal what compared to the previous ten years in carrying that in calendar time,

122
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:08,450
they've fared for all cause dementia. We observe that in general there is an increase in the incidence of dementia.

123
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:18,050
Again, this is for all dementia and that meta analysis produced a hazard ratio of about 80.87.

124
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,910
Okay. Anyone from your AP classes?

125
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:31,549
What about you start classes? What will what will be the interpretation of these hazard ratio equal to 8.87?

126
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:43,879
What that means. Okay.

127
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:52,800
First what mean? I hazard ratio less than one. Yeah, there is a protective effect.

128
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:04,250
But here we are comparing and saying what they mean, shall I say, today with the incidence of dementia in the last ten years, in the teen years ago.

129
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,240
Then what would be the interpretation of this? A 0.87.

130
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,760
Yet, you see, let's say, getting better.

131
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:35,950
In fact, what he's telling us is that you see dementia, as we have observed, very low to about 30% in the last ten years.

132
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,579
Now regarding assigned assignments, he's about the same.

133
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,460
Remember, most of case of dementia are new to Alzheimer's. We observe a decrease of about 16%.

134
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,330
If we are satisfied by six, we observe may be on a stronger effect in men.

135
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:14,170
You'll see that we have a reduction of about 24% in the last ten years, compared to a reduction of just 8% in women in the last ten years.

136
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,930
Any idea what will be these? I don't know why, but what would you suggest?

137
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:30,130
Because these are this is worthy of research to understand why we are observing now lower rate of dementia compared to ten years ago.

138
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,970
It could be a powerful exposure. So it's maybe like a part of the.

139
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,560
Had on. And women could be using.

140
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,889
Okay. When you hear something you mean there may be a chemical problem in the past?

141
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,890
Now is no place in the west. Yeah. Like they allowed it.

142
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:08,450
It could be. It will be interesting to see what what products in the last ten or 20 years have been removed from the market.

143
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,990
Yeah, maybe women just have more like chemical exposure, like.

144
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,530
Make up? It could be.

145
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,799
That would be one reason why even even even when we observe women,

146
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,250
the Israeli option is not such that because it doesn't mean that maybe still women are more exposed to this chemical buy.

147
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,610
But it's interesting the theory that estrogen can be protective because.

148
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,710
Obviously men don't have. Yes, exactly.

149
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:50,990
That's that's how I would get in trouble because. Yes. What protects against are they mentioning early ages?

150
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,690
I mean, women, obviously. Live longer. Mm hmm. We a higher rate.

151
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,790
It's pretty. Pretty. Yeah.

152
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:17,540
Because it will be on estrogens. We will early for men we will expect the higher rates in life and mean that another and this is another hypothesis.

153
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,460
No no exactly. Related to to a size size outside.

154
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,889
But in general, in in biology,

155
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:34,680
there are some effects that we call threshold effects that like you'll get certain number of

156
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,520
influx during life that you need to ah to reach out at the point to observe a phenotypic effect.

157
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,110
Now the idea regarding Alzheimer would be that maybe the early and reliably, maybe before the 60,

158
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:56,760
that is enough cognitive reserve to be able to adjust to this and faltering life.

159
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:09,240
But it's just late in life that is in salt reached a point where that is that is all about phenotypic expression.

160
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:22,830
Now those Steve would it we would explain why if estrogen is the major factor of lifestyle, we observe lower rates in May early in life.

161
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,780
Sorry. You said certain number of incidents I think is like a hit.

162
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:41,830
Yeah. Yeah. No other reason why besides our chemical products being removed from the market.

163
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,650
It could be whether. Yeah.

164
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,900
Like the cyclone? Yep. Yeah.

165
00:22:52,130 --> 00:23:01,700
Yeah, that's true. But. But, but. But I asking you is why they say that situation right now regarding the that is better than ten years ago.

166
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,990
Because that day incident you see that is getting nowhere. I mean.

167
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,170
I think there's some improvements to die in the past ten years.

168
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:23,940
I mean. That could be a problem with diet, maybe like sugar sweetened beverages.

169
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,640
Mm hmm. It's quite possible that people are more aware of these, and they are been changing diets over time.

170
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:38,640
Also, I will suggest even being physically active late in life.

171
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:46,290
Maybe people is more aware of that now with all this is about why people are more aware of,

172
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,340
for example, how many steps you need to to work during the day.

173
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,860
I don't know if it happens to you, but, um.

174
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:09,270
Okay, I have these watches. I also have to count the steps, but sometimes I just for get to put up watch and I feel like I'm not walking.

175
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:19,480
Do you have the feeling? It's like. And I think that's part of this tracking system that make people aware of what they need.

176
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,000
For example, you need to walk and then maybe some other reason where, you know, he had people.

177
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:31,650
Then what? I would hope that the idea of engaging regarding physical activity,

178
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,350
even the removal of this chemical product from the environment can be helping to these increases.

179
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,250
In one sense, people are more aware and becoming more aware.

180
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,850
But at the same time, in the past ten years, we've seen an increase in like screen time and yes, phone usage.

181
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:58,530
So it's like in one way. We have these phones and these devices to make us more aware of the phones in the first place.

182
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,460
Made us less physically active, too. Exactly. That's yeah, that's true.

183
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,879
And I think we still are not seeing the effect of these last two years regarding the pandemia,

184
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,500
for example, people was just even phone watching Netflix on their TVs.

185
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,210
Yeah. There was an increase in their consumption of alcohol during these the last two years even.

186
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:33,070
Um, um, I went out in that in the morning watching the news and there is, these are during these winter coming winter,

187
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,340
people are predicting a big wave of COVID flu, but also respiratory viruses, you know,

188
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:46,810
as more kids will be due because in the last two years it's market where yes.

189
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,430
In home they were not exposed to all the kids.

190
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,850
Uh, the way that people get the immunity.

191
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,520
Even in Costa Rica last month, in Costa Rica right now,

192
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:09,579
where in the rainy season last month they closed schools for one week because there was a huge wave of respiratory viruses

193
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,870
in kids and the hospital where just overall they're overwhelmed with the number of cases they forced school by one week.

194
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,129
Okay, let's continue. I think here they are. Interesting.

195
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:30,070
These protests are to explore what will be these the case of these decreasing rates and real dementia.

196
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:40,310
This is an estimate, for example, globally, that Ritalin he suspected that, uh,

197
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,680
that that rate by 2040 is going to decrease in 13% in that Europe and the

198
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,009
United States is expected to see a decrease in the incidence rate of dementia,

199
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,710
likely of up to 15%. Now, again,

200
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:03,580
I want to make the clarification that the results are again based on go from the

201
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,060
United States and Western Europe and also basically a European etc. participant.

202
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:23,220
Now regarding mortality, because we need to discuss mortality now that we're going to discuss the evolutionary aspects of of atheism

203
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:31,340
because remember it is a trait is affecting mortality to be selected is going to be under natural selection.

204
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:40,120
Now. Again, these are results from the United States.

205
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:49,900
And this is how the life expectancy after diagnosis of dementia.

206
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:59,560
But I think what we also hear, Andy was asked how.

207
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:15,070
I will say. I fought in the war.

208
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:24,070
But, okay, what I want to say here is that there is a differential on mortality by ethnicity, too,

209
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:35,200
but it's in white participants that we have the lowest survival or highest mortality after diagnosis of dementia.

210
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,860
And we see that using a decision that they definitely the United States using

211
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:49,750
Asian Americans that we observe the longer survival after diagnosis of dementia.

212
00:28:52,110 --> 00:29:02,460
Hispanics where someone here in the middle. African Americans and also American Indians are somewhat in the middle.

213
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:12,990
But I think that the mean survival is about 4 to 5 years after diagnosis of dementia.

214
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:25,330
Now, common question about that. No, that will depend a lot on that.

215
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:33,610
And on the on the age that they mentioned, I know they see what's happening with with the divide by age.

216
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:44,590
They see that the median use of the Bible after the diagnosis of dementia and again by race or ethnicity,

217
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:53,440
if they maintain they know are all 54 to 69 years old.

218
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,690
They see that prevalence 1.7, the prevalence of dementia in that age group.

219
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:08,230
You see that Asian American has a median life with pregnancy of seven point almost eight years.

220
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:18,100
Latinos almost saving African-American a little bit more than half saying, I'm white, only five and a half years.

221
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,110
Now, here, for this time, there was enough numbers for American Indian and Alaska, Alaska native.

222
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,640
Then they were unable to calculate mortality for these for this age group.

223
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:41,830
But you'll see that for all age groups, the life expectancy is lower for whites compared to other groups.

224
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:56,820
And this is quite I still I read the paper and it still isn't clear what would be these factors because these is for on one hand,

225
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,950
we are observing the higher incident. And again, let's go back to these data.

226
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:12,780
We are observing a higher incidence of dementia in Hispanics and blacks here in the United States incidence.

227
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,770
But mortality rate is lower in Hispanics and blacks compared to whites.

228
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:34,760
And again what could be that this I there's no written or credible hypotheses what is mechanism what will be the staircase.

229
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:46,790
Could it be just like there's more like a greater number of studies done on what it's like you were saying.

230
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,730
You mean. Yes, a just result. Hmm.

231
00:31:52,140 --> 00:32:03,360
Yes. Yeah, that is a reason. But at least this particular study day was based on data from these the Kaiser Permanente in California.

232
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,320
And they were able to recruit hundreds of thousands of participants.

233
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,170
They got the idea from this study.

234
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,510
They were able to identify all the different ethnicities then essentially of way.

235
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,250
And I think this is another interesting area of research regarding anyone why the differential mortality.

236
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,510
Now let's see what we know about the modifiable risk factors.

237
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:42,459
Now, they have been proposed. The theory is there is evidence regarding well-known disorders in general.

238
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:50,650
While these are for poor risk factors, type two diabetes, the ability of blood pressure,

239
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,830
these are have been proposed also that experience as a risk factor dyslipidemia or obesity during midlife,

240
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:13,330
cardiovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury, other type of factor, for example, high homocysteine in blood here in love or for diseases.

241
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:25,690
Depression, I stress is mocking air pollution, even some kind of medication for protective high education, cognitive activity during life,

242
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:35,410
bilingualism that will be related to all these social engagement being married, physical activity,

243
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:44,739
formal dietary factors like a moderate alcohol intake, moderate coffee, Mediterranean diet, dash diet.

244
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:58,910
These among my diet days menthol. These particular days reproachfully to to be able to to maintain cognitive ability from any diet.

245
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,010
Now they are evidence going around about the fact that we're going to see what is the more recent evidence.

246
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,950
Tell us about it.

247
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:17,180
But what I will say is, in general, no, because we need to, for example, for diet, even if there is one particular diet that could be protective,

248
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:24,620
I guess I would say would be protective against other type of diseases and even keeping a healthy lifestyle.

249
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:34,880
Now, the idea is that then we can make some intervention during life to try to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's in life.

250
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:44,750
For example, are early intervention more likely to get more people in school, maybe learn from extra languages?

251
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,709
Now, again, I think here is not the you know, that we know a language.

252
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:57,080
I would say rather is the then you keep engaged in some kind of intellectual activity.

253
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:07,040
And now in the second part, I want to discuss with you. Okay, from the French perspective,

254
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,610
because schooling is early I mean is in recent in evolutionary time doesn't

255
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:20,299
came maybe a hundred 200 years that school is more available to the general

256
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:28,910
population than what happened in the past let's say during our they will leave you out especially with the western all these formal schooling.

257
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,610
Now I found this meta analysis. This is the most recent, one of the largest meta analysis.

258
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,190
Or do you put in refactored or protective, thoughtful protective factors against outsiders?

259
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,000
And this is out diary that we have now. We have.

260
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,560
Okay. First the blue bar.

261
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:59,990
Light blue bar represents the sample site for this metallurgist because they collect that information from different studies.

262
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,420
Then the last. The longer the bar, the the the high, the the longer the the sample size.

263
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,460
What is the meta analysis?

264
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:18,320
Now, remember here we had that risk ratio equal to one higher than one means harmful factor and lower than one means a protective factor.

265
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:29,450
Then what were the protective factor with the most evidence you solve inside any use the longer to use that area for that

266
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:39,930
attainment also that high because these display these are the positions of amyloid amyloid plaques they they have different forms.

267
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:50,960
There is in that form a, b, 140 is. But a particular type is rather protective against Alzheimer's, high education, cognitive activity,

268
00:36:51,560 --> 00:37:01,459
obesity late in life is seen to be associated with lower risk of Alzheimer social

269
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:09,740
activity wasted over Highway C parents are getting late in life is protective physical

270
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:16,910
exercise less weight loss that will be related to obesity later in life in that are

271
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:24,950
huge weight loss late in life is rather counterproductive at least for Alzheimer's.

272
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,580
Vitamin C, aspirins and high BMI are getting late in life.

273
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,300
You seem to be protective now. What are the risk factors?

274
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,910
Some measure of rating smoking. Malkin's is old age.

275
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:53,630
I read this. I don't remember head injuries, low serum, folate.

276
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,640
And let's see about diet, what we know about diet only, what this evidence show was about diet.

277
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:11,660
Let's see. Beer drinking seemed to be bad for outsiders.

278
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,240
But you see here the alleys, everything from these are from this meta analysis.

279
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:27,350
The dietary factors that are more consistently associated with diabetes are it by, for example, vitamin C protective beer drinking is harmful.

280
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:41,420
No limitation on the meta analysis because for example, for Mediterranean diet or the type of diet number of studies are still relatively few studies.

281
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:53,870
Then they were not able to do the event analysis. But again, in general, healthy diet for Arnone for outside and actually recommended Western so far.

282
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,850
No. Then that's what. Yes. Potential point is on life.

283
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,160
When. So interventions I recommend.

284
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,639
I don't know whether this benefit is in the income base,

285
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:27,210
but I recommend to read this paper because it's a nice paper to meta analyzes and they present some evidence about wedding life.

286
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,929
So intervention could be more effective to reduce our risk of Alzheimer than here.

287
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:39,510
You see that we had the protective reflectors at school in vitamin C,

288
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:46,650
a small weight loss during maybe life, physical exercise, a healthy dietary partner,

289
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:53,760
cognitive activity, but also they are some harmful risk factors that we could we could treat,

290
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:02,070
including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, midlife, depression.

291
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:10,860
There are some evidence that suggest that Alzheimer's depression can have even common get at the bases.

292
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,210
Okay. What we know about Alzheimer's that genetics statements.

293
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:27,720
Now, first, based on screen studies, the heritability is estimated between 60 and 80%.

294
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:34,920
Now, I want to clarify these, because heritability is rather the technical term.

295
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:45,480
These doesn't mean they are, say, maybe 50% of all, for example, cases will have time to complete.

296
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:55,560
That is that wrong interpretation that that that that's not that meaning or that 60% is rather how much of the variability

297
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:05,310
of Alzheimer's risk is due to variability on key genes is estimated between 60 and 80% based on previous studies.

298
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:16,319
Now, so far, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's is that before I leave that,

299
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:28,440
explain about 90% or is the ability but result from genome wide association studies.

300
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,929
Remember, you know why the association decided that this huge study that we take for example that number of cases and known better control for certain

301
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:46,080
traits that the disease and we compare added frequency between what group and see with are more or less frequent in cases compared to controls.

302
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:54,690
Then so far people have been able to identify 40 risk values associated with Alzheimer's.

303
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:13,500
Now let me explain this graph. In the x axis, we had the added frequency from them going from 0 to 100% of the added frequency in populations.

304
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,120
In the Y axis, we had the effect of that value.

305
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,909
Then here we have one lower than one is protective.

306
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:29,070
Let me put that. They said point that this is protective.

307
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:37,290
I'm higher, though one is rather high risk increasing increasingly then that they are setting the genes.

308
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:50,680
That they have a huge risk. You'll see, for example, these barriers in the press, any one jeans that be seen wanting.

309
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,610
They have huge risk ratio of more than 20.

310
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:03,230
Meaning that someone with Darlene has a 20 more 20 times the risk of having a swimmer on back to walk, to perform without need.

311
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,239
However, you see that they are in frequency, very,

312
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:19,560
very rare little 0.01% that usually these are these with huge effects are rather concentrated in certain families.

313
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,540
These are Mendelian like cases of Alzheimer's.

314
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:31,800
We observe the families. They are certain parental inheritance, but they are no, they are not frequent in the population,

315
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:40,980
meaning that they look they don't explained much of the viability of Alzheimer's in the population because they are concentrated in certain families.

316
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:54,560
The fatalities that so far either one was consistently associated with Alzheimer's in general populations has that frequency of about 10% overall,

317
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,830
and that risk is about between three and four,

318
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,750
depending on the only study population,

319
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:12,660
meaning that someone with the E4 Ali cassava about three times the risk of Alzheimer's compared with from where would that eat to or entry.

320
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,890
That is all that is the whole people have been associated with that site.

321
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,309
But you'll see that risk. They are very close to one, for example, is one.

322
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:30,950
They are over one. That relative risk could be in the range of 1.05, 1.10.

323
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:38,030
They are just a small effect, although we have some protective allies, but it's really a plausible one.

324
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,700
They may be they are a relative risk about Europe of 9.95.

325
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:57,260
There is one effect. Then in summary, they figure we have certain genes with huge effects on the risk, but they are very rare in the populations.

326
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,400
They are found only in family familial cases of Alzheimer's.

327
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:08,600
On the other hand, we have more commonalities with with this mild to moderate effects.

328
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,960
Now we're going to discuss in the second part about that apology.

329
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,080
And remember, the the apology, Ali.

330
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,570
The apology for Ali is the ancestral Ali in humans.

331
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:36,379
The oldest Ali will come back to that e300 to that e300 to remember the order.

332
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:44,630
You need it about 200,000 years in the past, according to some estimations, that would be moral at the time of the origin of our species.

333
00:45:46,190 --> 00:46:01,879
Then that does does beg the question of if that if what the ancestral Ali is doing is in doubt that

334
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:11,420
there was outside mercy in the past with in our hominins ancestors that they only had the ability for.

335
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,230
They didn't have three or four or e to.

336
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,970
What do you think? So like only healthy people before.

337
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,790
Yes. The high risk. Okay.

338
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:42,639
Yeah. We don't want to discuss that because they are.

339
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:51,610
So maybe that showed that E for a little affect risk of Alzheimer's only under western conditions of life.

340
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,910
They are still maybe for example, different in hunter gatherers, more traditional societies.

341
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,910
That that report before I leave is not associated with risk or alcohol side because

342
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,090
in that is an interaction but yeah but but we really we don't know will be.

343
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,230
Okay. Just the distribution that I boycotted.

344
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,770
Remember, I think I showed you this in a previous ah, in the previous lecture, the most frequent blue oval at E3,

345
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:30,080
the CW that is more freaking in across the world, in some cases reaching frequencies as high more than 90%.

346
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,540
Then the second, more frequently that ancestral I'll leave that you for and again if you frequent you see them they accept in regions in

347
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:47,930
that war for example in Brazil East about 40% in central Africa is about also 40% and a little less frequent that you do.

348
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,110
But still, there is the ability across the war.

349
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:10,370
Now an idea to working with deans is that if we could predict disease based on genes, then what we know about genetic prediction of Alzheimer's,

350
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,760
then people have been working on these are getting results from different, you know, wide association studies.

351
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,590
See whether they can predict Alzheimer's using genes. Then let's focus.

352
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,680
Yes. In this part of this table, decide about cases of Alzheimer's that or that type of dementia.

353
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,790
But let's just block of Alzheimer's that he did it out.

354
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:40,310
We can, for example, imagine that we have these 40 genes that people have found associated with an assignment photo.

355
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,950
Then remember that each gene has two values.

356
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:54,050
Then we can count how many risk allies a person has in this photo.

357
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:02,959
Then we can create an escort that is going from zero up to. With 40 years, where will we see Romania?

358
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,350
That bears not any risk. What will be the maximum?

359
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:15,550
Anyone. It will be something.

360
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,730
Yeah. We have 40 identified genes and each has to release.

361
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,900
Then we can count the number of risk values that we can go from.

362
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,290
Zero zero will be up better without any risk value.

363
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,330
After all, the 80. Exactly 80 will be better.

364
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,990
So we will be homozygous for all the colleagues.

365
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:47,040
Now, usually if you do that, you will get more or less a normal distribution like this belt distribution.

366
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,070
Then in that phase of the distribution, you are going to have just a few number for four or five years.

367
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:59,459
Multiple will be in the middle. But then you can do that and then you can create any score and you see how the risk of certain

368
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:06,420
disease increases using that to sport that in this study they use this is core for these genes.

369
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:17,040
They found that per one is standard deviation increase of these as core risk of Alzheimer's increases by 70%.

370
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,479
Then the higher the number of studies, the higher the risk of Alzheimer's.

371
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,820
I suspected they did different calculation.

372
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,740
For example, they that they cut off made a cut of death in that median of the score.

373
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,920
People in the upper half, they have more than three times the risk of Alzheimer's compared to people in the lower half.

374
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:46,620
Also, they might one times what dies are interested, but quartile is only people in the upper part diet,

375
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:52,800
meaning people with a huge number of risk values that in that in an increased risk of of Alzheimer's

376
00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:02,640
a if for a long increase it is by more than three times and they are different combination.

377
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,700
Now this is quite impressive people are homozygous for that.

378
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:14,100
If for a leader they have almost 14 times the risk of Alzheimer's.

379
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,730
These are somebody that homozygous for that E4.

380
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:32,440
Then in general, what this tape wouldn't show was that there is some use to use genetic information to try to break risk of Alzheimer's.

381
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:40,150
Again, the sample size you see here is this small is the number of cases that they will have in 25.

382
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,160
But at least this suggest that would be some value to do this type of analysis.

383
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,480
Now, these are these we had a study from Germany.

384
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:59,409
That is according to Germany as their if they record the people in the six sixties and they had

385
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:07,660
been following the four different filling up that they are left with in this part for Alzheimer's,

386
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,270
what they found. You see how you see this type of curve.

387
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,550
When we want to predict an outcome, we create these qualities, this type of use.

388
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,140
Then here we have one man who had specificity. Yeah, we had a sensitivity.

389
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:37,540
And the idea is that the closer this line is to the to the if cheap debater, the prediction, then we use only age, sex and education.

390
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:43,330
We have predicted value more or less about 77% in this score.

391
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:58,090
If we at apologetic risk score again this is the score using genetic data increases about 0.81 if we are only approaches about a 0.80.

392
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,500
If we add that polygenic risk score an up or you sagging about 0.80.

393
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:15,909
What you see here is that that genetic information at a little something but using only non-genetic information like age,

394
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:20,080
sex and education, we are able to predict a lot.

395
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,780
That that prediction was he made that he wished to divide by six.

396
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,830
You see, he had the values, the middle by 60.50 3.58 by age.

397
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:44,730
Then it in that is type of prediction that you can get into the information is useful by different type of stratification.

398
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,430
And just to finalize my part,

399
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:57,560
because this is related to the to one of the hypothesis that you read about unrelated to me talking between microbiota and Alzheimer's,

400
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:07,340
you can you can calculate the correlation, what we call genetic correlation between two different traits.

401
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:13,910
For example, you can see with gene associated with the one disease, and we feel that genes are associated with this other disease.

402
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,290
And then you can see some kind of overlap and see the correlation.

403
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:25,580
Then what is interesting is the Alzheimer disease was found correlated and you see that correlation and you see that P value.

404
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:33,920
You see highly significant form of flooding correlation between Alzheimer's and different arm disorders or that you struck the right track,

405
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:46,790
meaning that genes that are associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's are also associated with higher risk of these are disorders or that the drug.

406
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:59,290
And also they found correlations between Alzheimer's and the microbiota.

407
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,500
I don't know if you can see here, but these are different type of bacteria.

408
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,680
And basically, there are some for example, this one here is a rather protective against Alzheimer's.

409
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,960
You see that restoration is the alteration less than one, this little one,

410
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,990
but they are all there that rather they are harmful, associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's.

411
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,260
Then again, this is just to try to make a little bit a little introduction for the second part.

412
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:39,910
Now, then, just to finish my part, I just want for you to keep in mind that different theories about the origins of Alzheimer's.

413
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,469
I think we're going to discuss some of them, for example,

414
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:53,740
that our life span have are getting longer or also antagonistic radiotherapy, maybe be a byproduct of the evolution of our brain.

415
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:01,300
That's a little on a bullet to a poetry against protecting us outside, here and out from these bacteria.

416
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:08,470
We will discover some of these. In the second part are questions.

417
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,440
Okay. Then I'll take a five minute break and we will come back for that discussion.

418
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:38,619
Okay. Then we are going to start the second part of today's lecture about the discussion of evolutionary theories regarding our science.

419
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:45,219
All right, so it's my first time to give such a long presentation, so bear with me.

420
00:56:49,419 --> 00:57:03,219
So I was I'm has symptoms include some like difficulty solving problems memory loss poor judgment difficulty with words those like some symptoms.

421
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:13,838
And so I assume a disease is the most common type of dementia and involving this function

422
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:21,039
across multiple physiological pathway like spinning center and peripheral systems.

423
00:57:21,549 --> 00:57:30,999
So a patient with autism and disease neuritic plaque and neuro fiber euro five Lurie Tangle.

424
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:45,309
So what is pack peg are made of the accumulation of amyloid beta and the tango other twitches fiber of the protein tau found in the neural.

425
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,639
So in the healthy brain it looks like this.

426
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:51,099
So in the house of brain,

427
00:57:51,099 --> 00:58:02,559
the tau protein for microtubule which transport nutrients and the support cytokines a skeleton and with the expression of APOE4,

428
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:09,849
it will increase the amyloid beta accumulation and thus increase the development of eyes.

429
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:10,689
AUGMENT disease.

430
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:27,998
So the assignment is is I regularly appear after 65 years of age and its prevalence doubled every five years in the over 85 population.

431
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:34,479
The prevalence of AIDS and the disease in developed countries range from 20 to 40%,

432
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:44,199
and the incidence of the disease is significantly higher in the developed country compared to the traditional society.

433
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:57,009
So just a guess. I predict that the number of Americans with this disease in the year of 2016 compared with 2014.

434
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:10,709
Just because my guest never like the lower interest, double or triple any anyone, maybe even more.

435
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:19,749
Yeah. So when I read the research, I was so surprised that the number will go triple by the 2060.

436
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:26,829
So it will go. Yeah. Yeah. I want to clarify because actually that question refers to prevalence.

437
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:40,029
How many. Because what we discussed in the first part about the experience of higher incidence that we can have long as more number of cases per year,

438
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:45,579
but that prevalence is more or less rather than going to increase also because of the arm.

439
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:51,579
So so also for other race and ethnicity,

440
00:59:52,689 --> 01:00:01,689
the disease that according to the CDC shows the African America has a higher prevalence of either as I'm a disease.

441
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:15,249
So there's microbiome translation in human history the human species has experienced at least three major lifestyle shift over the last 15,000 years.

442
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:25,088
And we will talk about more detail in next slides about how agriculture revolution,

443
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:32,949
industrial revolution, globalization era effect the eyes emergence, disease development.

444
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:41,648
So first is agricultural revolution. It is 12,000 years ago, people who lived in stable camps,

445
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:48,339
planted crops and raised animals which increase the human interaction with the Second World

446
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:56,619
and increased this increased geographic stability and the population size and density.

447
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:05,019
And also we start to increase the grain consumption as there's a decrease physical activities and diet diversity.

448
01:01:05,439 --> 01:01:18,159
So and also the pathogen, the pathogenic virus likely to increase due to the evolutionary selection opportunity of the larger number of human host,

449
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:27,729
maybe in the closer proximity and the time goes to the industrial revolution.

450
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:34,839
So by leaving the city, people experience less contact with animals and the so called contaminated

451
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:41,738
mud than before pathogens likely to have benefited from even more advantages.

452
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:49,059
Opportunities to infect human host due to shared indoor environment and higher population density,

453
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:59,529
and were there by likely to select to become even more violent and air pollution started to occur,

454
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:04,929
which altered the composition of airborne microbiota.

455
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:17,259
Additionally, the technology advanced in transportation to greater volume and distance of population movement and the greater human mobility.

456
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:21,909
Also transport microbe to new habitat.

457
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:33,159
And the food started to be industrialized, washed and cooked people's diet, widely used antibiotic medications.

458
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:39,159
So because of these changes, the diversity of human microbiota decreased.

459
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:46,649
And then is the globalization era, which is 50 years ago.

460
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:53,369
There's higher population size and density. People are more century.

461
01:02:53,489 --> 01:03:00,809
And the diet we consume are tetra, become high fat, high sugar, processed food.

462
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:07,409
And there's high obesity rate and high pollutions.

463
01:03:07,919 --> 01:03:11,459
So also, there's overuse of antibiotics.

464
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:26,579
There is this period and the formula feeding can also contribute to these viruses during the critical phases of infant development.

465
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:47,319
So I think this is a it's great picture to show you how the time goes and what the changes and this picture shows with the time goes,

466
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:54,249
the microbiota diversity decrease and then the pathogenic virulence are increase.

467
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:02,659
How I open and I see that next slide this we generally go back to that.

468
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:16,419
Oh yeah. Then how I know for for that let's of that cloud because what we're seeing here is that these are degrees of the diversity of our microbiota.

469
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:25,388
In fact, if we compare even today, let's say, Western societies or more traditional societies,

470
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:30,519
the diversity is is lower in developed countries than you actually go for microbiota.

471
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:39,519
Can you imagine any mechanism, any is general how that degrees of diversity or microbiota could be related to Alzheimer's?

472
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:50,649
I don't know why they did that. They mentioned something it up in this paper.

473
01:04:53,089 --> 01:05:10,269
It's so it really focused on like how it's just like stated I didn't like emphasize the details.

474
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:15,549
Yeah, I think I think you continue. Yeah,

475
01:05:15,939 --> 01:05:23,899
I think that I don't think I want to talk about IBD because he had the hypothesis that we are where I am

476
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:31,489
macrobiotics is not only less diverse biologically is that we have a microbiota they are more bacteria.

477
01:05:32,439 --> 01:05:40,569
Then again, that that the the the underlying hypotheses that we are going to have under more chronic conditions of employment of inflammation,

478
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:48,639
low degrees of inflammation. And now I think now you are going to discard that relationship with type two diabetes and inflammatory diseases.

479
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:56,979
Then that would be one potential mechanism lower biodiversity, higher virulence,

480
01:05:57,069 --> 01:06:02,349
leading to more inflammation, maybe Alzheimer's and or other metabolic substance.

481
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:16,459
So and also AIDS disease is considered as type three diabetes.

482
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:25,429
That increase is it is is a disease would actually be due to the emerging complication of type two diabetes.

483
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:31,788
So as we all know, type two diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar.

484
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:46,909
Is resistance relatively a lack of easily and this arise because the reduced sensitivity of muscular mass Q muscle liver and the fat so easily,

485
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:54,319
which we call a insulin resistance. And also we have the pancreatic beta cells.

486
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:01,878
This function and this resulting metabolic disturbance leads to chronic hyperglycemia,

487
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:14,059
which is the immediate cause of many of the symptoms of diabetes, such as of the peripheral neuropathy.

488
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:24,949
And Type two diabetes are strongly associated with cognitive impairment due to the

489
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:31,249
failure in the action of glucose absorption in the new role for energy production.

490
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:41,539
The association between type two diabetes and amino acids and Alzheimer disease is complex.

491
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,439
Both are interlinked with insulin resistance.

492
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:50,839
Insulin growth factor signaling inflammation response.

493
01:07:51,289 --> 01:08:02,209
Oxidative stress, glycogen synthesis kinase three beta signal mechanism and amyloid beta formation.

494
01:08:06,769 --> 01:08:15,049
And we will talk more about the how type three diabetes relate with mismatch in later.

495
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:19,549
And then we're going to talk about the previous hypothesis.

496
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:24,489
So. This is the outlier.

497
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:31,379
Okay. So the first hypothesis is the normal extension of life expand.

498
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:44,049
So what is me is that either my disease was not subject to selection since the ancestors did not live beyond 50 years and have a shorter lifespan.

499
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:50,829
What it means is that the Eisenman disease persists in our spaces because there has

500
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:57,609
not been enough time for selection to influence the frequency of associate Alice.

501
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:04,539
The logical extension would be that I am a disease is the result of the normal.

502
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:12,699
We see nurses during this new extension of lifespan, not the pathological condition.

503
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:22,689
However, this weakness of this hypothesis is that despite the dramatic increase in life expectancy and hence at birth,

504
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:31,629
that does what the adult mortality curve has probably maintained a similar shape according to human history.

505
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:39,309
And also it says, I I'm a disease is the result of normal brain senescence.

506
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:49,329
However, if people lived at age around like 138, then it will assume that all people will develop eyes and a disease which is not true.

507
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:56,139
So rather than convincing of eyes a disease as a byproduct of normal aging.

508
01:09:56,469 --> 01:10:10,899
It can be considered is dead as a set of bowel biochemical changes that can be active by the age related with mechanisms for the rate of decline.

509
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:18,428
Please make sure to you having read the paper later in this slide because I think these

510
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:23,709
are nice summary and discussion about what you believe in theories of assignment.

511
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:34,148
And I think this is one because even though it's true that in the past the infant mortality was huge and that it was

512
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:40,899
affecting the life expectancy by one cut based on which adult life most likely of a woman reached out their life.

513
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:49,379
Then that's one weakness of the hypothesis, because the hypothesis that it was not that we're not like other people in the past, and that's not true.

514
01:10:54,669 --> 01:11:01,059
And then the next hypothesis is, is the antagonistic play all trippy?

515
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:09,069
So what is is this is a hypothesis that genes are beneficial in one way but can be harmful in another,

516
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:14,799
and genes that are beneficial in certain phase of life circle can be harmful in the leader.

517
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:22,838
So either one of these is maybe conserved in human population because this is set up to build these genes,

518
01:11:22,839 --> 01:11:31,689
maybe pre ultra peak may have the ultra peak effects serving the adaptive function.

519
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:39,339
The other process for like other times, like cancer genes can promote fecundity,

520
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:50,019
curl and a cool coral narrow artery disease can relate to g can really kind of positive associate with the fertility.

521
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:58,149
So these hypotheses believe that the ISM and disease may be the result of selection for gene

522
01:11:58,359 --> 01:12:08,889
relate to see rather protects neural activities and especially especially the neuroplasticity.

523
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:20,379
So which could make the brain better at learning but more vulnerable at but more vulnerable to the timing of disease type dysfunction.

524
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:25,569
However, there's still no evidence to support this hypothesis today yet.

525
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:37,959
And also this hypothesis that they put in for increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease and is also associated with an early age of disease onset.

526
01:12:38,379 --> 01:12:45,249
So a heavy wound to April for ad is increased the risk of developing Alzheimer's.

527
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:57,879
However, the apo e for protect against the hepatitis C associated liver damage and also cardiovascular stress,

528
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:08,589
age related macular degeneration and better outcome for children with diarrhea and protect against malaria.

529
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:18,909
And also this hypothesis believe that the amyloid beta may be responsible for Alzheimer's disease neuropathy.

530
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:25,779
However, it also harbor the antimicrobial properties.

531
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:36,969
And then the third hypothesis is the rapid brewing evolution as the part of brewing.

532
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:43,388
Most damaged in the course of ice damages is are those that were subject to the most extreme

533
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:50,139
enlargement during our ancestry business shift from chimpanzee like brewing to the modern one.

534
01:13:50,949 --> 01:14:01,329
So this includes a frontal parade or temporal and mythical people campus, which you can see from these pictures.

535
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:05,298
Now then the hypothesis,

536
01:14:05,299 --> 01:14:18,889
what he said is that the deeper dives had done more in the aftermath and are more susceptible to doing damage to the eyes and smoking.

537
01:14:22,789 --> 01:14:31,819
And then the first hypothesis is about lack of selective pressure during the post productive phase as a

538
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:41,959
disease persistence in human population because it manifests after reproductive secession like menopause.

539
01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:49,729
Therefore, it has no selective pressure and will not affect offspring's number and production.

540
01:14:50,839 --> 01:14:57,798
But this hypothesis witness the individual with as many diseases like with the will,

541
01:14:57,799 --> 01:15:02,539
gradually lost their autonomy and autonomy as the disease progressed.

542
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:14,449
So this is not caused a sudden mortality, but typically it remains life in 7 to 10 years, which will cost burden on the king.

543
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:24,709
So this means that the seductive pressure may resist aging and disease promoting gene due to the burden on therapy.

544
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:33,919
And then next hypothesis is the delay neuropathy by selection for memory.

545
01:15:34,249 --> 01:15:38,009
So we we talked about grandmother in last last week.

546
01:15:38,759 --> 01:15:48,169
Among primates, reproductive success require not only giving birth, but also raising offspring to independence.

547
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:55,399
And human eyes, I mean, this is answer is typically decades after the Reproductions association.

548
01:15:55,999 --> 01:16:09,589
So why is this important so delayed a maturity result, a pronounced need for parental care and human females.

549
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:17,169
They need to raise the youngest grandchild to independence before they can develop eyes.

550
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:25,129
I'm a disease without experi fitness problem, but the weakness for this hypothesis is it.

551
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:34,789
It is. This hypothesis confounds all three should show that he is cooperating the breeding.

552
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:38,808
So when I when I read this I was really confused.

553
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:41,669
What about this took this to definition.

554
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:54,378
So what is our social altruism or is infants that were relatively helpless and depend on parents care for extended period of time and the

555
01:16:54,379 --> 01:17:02,809
crop cooperate breed breeding is that the offspring received care not only from their parents but also from additional group members.

556
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:07,609
So this hypothesis kind of mixed this two definitions together.

557
01:17:08,389 --> 01:17:16,969
However, the duration of the offspring depends does not obligate the grant maternal care.

558
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:21,409
So that's why this happens. It is also have some weakness.

559
01:17:22,249 --> 01:17:28,759
So and then the next hypothesis is novel ad is selective to delay neuropathy.

560
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:37,878
As we all know, the April four is the early death rate with Alzheimer's disease.

561
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:49,279
And then April two and three is the new isolate form, a human that was set up to detect against the Alzheimer's disease.

562
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:57,919
Sorry. So the first in the first part of this hypothesis is think the I'm a disease.

563
01:17:57,919 --> 01:18:03,679
Neuropathy should begin at really the same time in the Apple store.

564
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:17,389
And the second part is the people with at least like Apple three and go to Alice have later eyes in the disease onset then the April for the

565
01:18:17,419 --> 01:18:30,139
witness for these hypotheses is the first part is state that the reason this is brain change began to occur shortly after people's last pregnancy.

566
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:35,689
But these are two symptoms decades after the last practice.

567
01:18:35,989 --> 01:18:48,019
Normally, like the average age that people will developed as a is like 66.4 years old.

568
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:54,449
But the average nature of fertility population is 41 years old.

569
01:18:54,469 --> 01:19:06,649
So this two decades, like two asymptomatic decades during this time of period that this hypothesis cannot explain.

570
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:18,138
I think also these are that the relationship of E4 with Alzheimer's is quite interesting because we don't know,

571
01:19:18,139 --> 01:19:25,218
because this is the ancestral allele, we don't know whether there was a similar, you know, what ancestor and what they study.

572
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,339
They only have this animal that evolved.

573
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:36,648
And I think the evidence shows that is rather the E4 that of the embracing of inflammatory

574
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:43,489
environment values that will be the causal mechanism mediated by sameness because

575
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:51,199
added from hunter gatherer societies to in today's today we see that that relationship

576
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:57,979
between E4 and assignment is not quite clear like in in the say more with our nice sites.

577
01:20:02,849 --> 01:20:07,379
Okay. Then the next hypothesis is the delay of Alzheimer's.

578
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:15,029
It seems the delay of assignment is the byproduct of selection for protection against cardiovascular disease.

579
01:20:16,499 --> 01:20:26,368
So this theory think that the trend of meat eating has the risk for the atherosclerotic

580
01:20:26,369 --> 01:20:32,879
disease and thus create a selection selective pressure cholesterol regulator.

581
01:20:33,389 --> 01:20:46,409
So April three is highest frequency among groups that have practiced that have practiced agriculture for the longest time, like Mediterranean.

582
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:56,549
So they would have a more consistent food supply and thus perhaps have greater longevity and a longer risk of cardiovascular disease.

583
01:20:57,389 --> 01:21:04,169
And April four is found at its highest frequency among the contemporary hunter

584
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:10,169
gatherers and other populations that are associated with instant food supply.

585
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:18,059
So for them, increased cholesterol absorption would provide a survival advantage.

586
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:24,479
But the weakness for this hypothesis is the emergency.

587
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:38,159
The emergency 8.3 actually is 3000 years ago and predates the advance of agriculture by approximately 208,000 years.

588
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:47,609
Make it difficult to justify that the shift to the agriculture explained the selection for this at AD.

589
01:21:48,629 --> 01:22:00,569
This hypothesis suggests that the meat plus the agricultural induced lifespan tension caused the higher risk of atherosclerosis.

590
01:22:00,809 --> 01:22:06,509
However, the hunter gatherers rely more on meat than people in agriculture period.

591
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:11,279
So they should probably have stronger selection than agriculture.

592
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:16,679
People for adaptation. Avoiding the atherosclerotic disease.

593
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:31,249
The next hypothesis is the preclinical isomers is the adaptive sacrificed during time of calorie stress.

594
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:41,808
So the preclinical isomer disease is an adaptive way to limit the metabolic furniture on brain because in the

595
01:22:41,809 --> 01:22:51,919
simple life of hunter gatherer activity and the activity for them become more rote and repetitive by the old age.

596
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:58,579
So there's not the same needs to maintain this ability to learn or improve their skills.

597
01:22:59,089 --> 01:23:12,979
So because they don't need to look no longer to obtain the first much skill for them before so their calorie is being restricted.

598
01:23:14,029 --> 01:23:19,579
This event is those who conserve energy sources by sacrificing their brain function,

599
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:28,249
but this hypothesis is conflict with the importance of higher cognitive function in our species,

600
01:23:29,419 --> 01:23:32,569
and mortality is gradually hunter gatherers,

601
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:46,439
intellectual change of foraging lifestyle and the physiology for prioritization of the brain function that we have known before.

602
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:48,819
When do you think about the hypothetical?

603
01:23:48,839 --> 01:24:00,339
Basically when saying that to save energy we useless our brain and we've just learned about the larger brain?

604
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:06,978
Yeah, yeah. It's game over, decide what to do with this one because that is against the evidence that rather

605
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:14,119
that brain is how you decide one that is one that is additional calories.

606
01:24:14,179 --> 01:24:18,669
Yes, it. Okay.

607
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:24,789
So there's also a math mismatch for the A's owners.

608
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:32,649
So what does this means? So that idea that normal features of modern life in the developed world may enhance the

609
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:39,999
incidence of disease that were absent or real during previous phases of human history.

610
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:47,739
In addition to E has that this incidence more than affected me has two onset of disease

611
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:54,399
that would have occurred significant later in the life expectancy pre modern environment.

612
01:24:56,049 --> 01:25:06,159
So so this mismatch are insulin resistance we already talk about that as a disease is is kind of the

613
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:15,308
type three diabetes like so like the temporal hunter gathers pre more than people would have be

614
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:22,298
unlikely to frequently exhibit insulin resistance and therefore may have been less just steps

615
01:25:22,299 --> 01:25:32,529
ability to the glucose metabolism malfunctions characterized of the eyes and reduces pathogenesis.

616
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:37,419
And also based on the paradigm of the contemporary hunter gatherers,

617
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:49,589
it has the estimate that our hunter gatherers would have been like 3000 calories per day and consume 1.5% of the diet as simple sugar.

618
01:25:50,019 --> 01:26:01,959
Compare it with the contemporary people in the developed country who expend only 2000 calorie per day and consume 20% of the diet as simple sugar.

619
01:26:02,589 --> 01:26:08,319
So you can see the simple sugar goes super high in the developed country.

620
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:14,199
And also there's a mismatch on the as true organic neural protections.

621
01:26:15,159 --> 01:26:24,429
So estrogenic has been shown to inhibit amyloid beta formation and promote amyloid beta clearance,

622
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:32,769
inhibit the neuronal apoptosis like inhibit the tau hyper phosphorylation.

623
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:49,508
So the the the premodern women like you to exhibit divergent or very formal hormonal profiles compared to women in the industrial work and premodern,

624
01:26:49,509 --> 01:26:57,279
women are more likely to experience a shorter time span of the astringent exposure.

625
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:05,979
Normally the me is like 70 years compared to the industrialized population and also the premodern women.

626
01:27:06,849 --> 01:27:17,499
We're also likely to expose to rapidly high dose of estrogen compared with women in industrialized environments due to the high parity.

627
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,699
When when I reached the high parity, I was a little bit confused about that.

628
01:27:22,269 --> 01:27:37,389
So I did some research and it is actually defined as the heavy more than five pregnancy of greater than 20 weeks of gas station.

629
01:27:37,809 --> 01:27:46,659
So let's make make sense because the estrogen level during pregnancy the highest in during the life span.

630
01:27:46,809 --> 01:27:54,159
Mm hmm. Yeah. I think one note that we can explore these hypotheses that doesn't explain why men does

631
01:27:54,819 --> 01:28:00,458
have Alzheimer's earlier in life than women because are for cardiovascular diseases.

632
01:28:00,459 --> 01:28:07,419
We know that estrogen has a protective effect. Then we know that the man has a more reasonable cardiovascular disease.

633
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:13,538
But it's not for me to live. But for Alzheimer's, I see that.

634
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:21,609
It's not that we don't see higher risk of heart tightness in men, then I think that's another limitation of the hypothesis.

635
01:28:25,769 --> 01:28:28,679
And also there's a mismatch on the inflammation.

636
01:28:28,949 --> 01:28:36,418
So inflammation is an important contributor to item and disease pathogenesis decades before symptom onset,

637
01:28:36,419 --> 01:28:46,769
there's upgraded type one inflammation and potentially due to that in sufficient regulatory T cells and such immune dysfunction.

638
01:28:47,129 --> 01:28:54,509
This regulation is typically of the auto immunities that have previously been

639
01:28:54,539 --> 01:29:00,779
attributed to insufficient immunological challenges during the early lifetime.

640
01:29:01,289 --> 01:29:09,239
So as our hunter gatherers assess who is likely to experience more constant and low levels

641
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:17,789
of immune activity activation due to the more contact with animal feces and the soils,

642
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:29,129
it's likely that they would have developed the higher concentration of T like the regulatory T cells in the developing world today.

643
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:44,219
Low stimulation from the benign microorganism may lead to low rate of limb for early limb forces turnover during the life course,

644
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:53,039
which will subsequently cause the insufficient, insufficient development of the T rex cells.

645
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:56,189
And compared to the pre-industrial population.

646
01:29:57,209 --> 01:30:10,349
So the early life immune stimulation from the benign microbe will encounter during critical stage of developed are beneficial for immune education,

647
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:18,599
so it can help to avoid the excessive inflammation later in time, later in the life lifetime.

648
01:30:20,529 --> 01:30:26,168
And also there's a mismatch. Environmental toxins via virus,

649
01:30:26,169 --> 01:30:36,909
industrial toxins that have been absent from pre modern environments have been implicated as climate disease risk like air pollution,

650
01:30:37,209 --> 01:30:44,649
heavy metal exposure, including the lead mercury and cadmium.

651
01:30:45,729 --> 01:30:54,489
Please, please keep in mind these have me romantic thoughts that actually play itself out into this being a way out,

652
01:30:55,179 --> 01:31:02,149
the eating out of so many degrees in the last 20 years, maybe more middle age homes,

653
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:07,029
they're less toxins in the environment would be about at least playing a role.

654
01:31:07,489 --> 01:31:14,509
Yeah. And then there's also a mismatch on the airport.

655
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:18,579
So the airport, if word is, as we know,

656
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:29,869
is considered the primary genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and the demographic present a different frequency across the global population today.

657
01:31:30,259 --> 01:31:40,669
So with the Europe that April four is more is most frequent at the high latitudes with decreasing frequency for the south.

658
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:56,059
And airport three is airport three is highest in low at altitude latitude and a poor eave two is as high as frequencies in mid latitude Europe.

659
01:31:56,749 --> 01:32:15,079
So so apple e airport was placed as the eyes m a disease risk factors that were conducted in the developed and more in the wealthy countries.

660
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:25,649
And so after you listen all this lectures, hopefully you can get some points.

661
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:34,529
Do you think that the modern diet may play a role and pathogenesis of either illness, disease and what causes AIDS?

662
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:38,789
I a disease. Comments.

663
01:32:41,099 --> 01:32:53,509
Well. I so personally and so I think first is from diet diet perspective, like people have high fat,

664
01:32:53,719 --> 01:33:01,399
high sugar, processed food and also for the like physical activity part people are more sanitary.

665
01:33:02,449 --> 01:33:09,048
And also there's overuse, overuse of the antibiotics in the models.

666
01:33:09,049 --> 01:33:17,969
And also the I think the form of feeding can contribute to the dysbiosis, biopsies during the like critical phase of development.

667
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:27,169
And and there's some other factors that may also impact the ordinary disease,

668
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:37,639
like high population size and density in the developed countries and the high obesity rate, also the high pollution.

669
01:33:39,749 --> 01:33:46,769
Yeah. Or for the Cabal. I don't have a great record now.

670
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:56,548
You think race on that score would make sure the inflammatory potential of an effort that you should make will be interesting?

671
01:33:56,549 --> 01:34:01,789
To see the relationship between those type of values that the score and the excitement.

672
01:34:01,799 --> 01:34:13,499
Because regarding the hypothesis you have applied liability tree that may be that is an inflammatory mechanism that is common to all 50.

673
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:19,339
Yeah, I totally agree. Any question for me?

674
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:28,309
What is quite interesting in that I was looking be quite interesting in diabetes and then I would say that um,

675
01:34:29,369 --> 01:34:34,889
that genes that are related to diabetes and what I want related to this and why over a lot of people

676
01:34:34,889 --> 01:34:41,579
at least these are not huge overlap they may be that relationship is not genetic just lifestyles.

677
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:47,549
Maybe our lifestyle, the connect of things.

678
01:34:51,329 --> 01:34:57,919
Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay.

679
01:34:57,919 --> 01:35:02,039
Before we go there next week, easy immunity.
