1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:12,390
Not possible from the mastermind. You look, all I know is that was how I got on Capitol Hill.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:24,570
I would just go to the president. I can tell you that you realize that is really not all.

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,360
No, no, I got I got been called here.

4
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:44,150
You see me up there on the stairs.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:59,110
And it's just the powers that, you know, I know is going to rise.

6
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:17,080
And I don't know what you're doing because I was like, if I want something, you know, I'm going to get something.

7
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,790
I guess. I guess I.

8
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,080
Great. This is just out of curiosity.

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:37,290
Yeah, that's huge. Yeah, we've got to have an agent, but it's not until after and so on that.

10
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,870
But yeah, I mean, I hope not.

11
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,950
But these are many things that long term.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:08,520
But you still can't predict what's going to happen because like, I know you even get nervous from home.

13
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,190
I know you're in search of those groups. Yeah, yeah.

14
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:27,630
I think it's open going or show like that.

15
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,530
You have to search for at least one.

16
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,290
Good morning. Good morning. Right. So we have two student presentations today.

17
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,059
So we will start those in about 20 or 25 minutes.

18
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,020
But until then, we're going to work on a couple of things from the practice problems.

19
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,400
And then after class, of course, the solutions to the practice problems,

20
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,700
first thing we're going to work on is calculating and actuarially fair premium.

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,700
We have a little bit of a more complicated insurance policy. We were calculating actually fairly prospective.

22
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:19,050
Are we taking that which actually do you know, it's actually the insurers perspective because it's a question.

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:27,780
What the RFP is, is the expected value of the insurers liability under the terms of the policy, taking the insurers perspective,

24
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,430
sort of saying, I'm I'm the insurer, I'm taking on some risk, I'm enrolling, enrolling a beneficiary, I'm taking on some risk.

25
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:45,270
What is my expected value of claims payout for taking on that risk, although we're talking about 100% coverage.

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,790
There's not really a distinction because I'm not splitting that risk with anybody.

27
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm just taking the whole risk. It's an easy calculation. So if there's a 10% chance.

28
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,440
Of $10,000 loss. And the AFC is a very easy calculation.

29
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,590
It's $1,000 is 0.1 times 10,000.

30
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,720
Because if I take on this enrollee, I expect 10% of the time they're going to file a claim.

31
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,710
I'm going to be liable for 100% of that claim. 90% of time they're not going to file a claim and I have no liability.

32
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,890
So let's have to multiply those to say here is the thousand dollars.

33
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,560
What do you think? What if things are a little more complicated? What if we have that, if not double and co-insurance in the plan?

34
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:49,960
So for the first practice problem, the example we have, there is a 20% chance of a $15,000 loss.

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,220
And that plan has both a co-insurance of 25% and it has a deductible 1500.

36
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,420
So nothing is paid until loss exceeds 1500.

37
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,910
And let's assume this plan has a premium of 20 $200.

38
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,490
So our two questions are what is the RFP?

39
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:36,010
This plan almost quoting is there on this plan, given that premiums 20 $200, the premiums way 200 is what's actually charged.

40
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,209
Right. Figure out what's the RFP and we have that information.

41
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,670
We can figure out what the loading is or is. How does that 20 $200 premium compare to the ACP?

42
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,410
Is it parked up quite a lot above the AFC equal to the RFP?

43
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,220
Is the insurer really foolish? They're charging less than the RFP.

44
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:06,280
So how do you think we get started with that? So we have this easy calculation is no co-insurance and no deductible is multiply

45
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,990
the chance of a loss by the size of the loss and we got the RFP of $1,000,

46
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,339
but now we've got these two extra complications. We got a deductible we have to account for in our calculation and we've got no insurance,

47
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,059
so we have to account for the RFP is from the insurer's perspective,

48
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,709
it's the insurer asking if I take on this enrollee under these terms,

49
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,400
a 1500 dollars deductible and 25% co-pay, what is the expected value of my liability for client?

50
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,730
So you want you want to get us started.

51
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,040
So the first thing in the calculation. 20% times.

52
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:57,220
15, 20%. The point to point two chance that I have any liability at all.

53
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:23,430
If I really want to be complete about this, I can actually say. There's an 80% chance I have zero liability.

54
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,450
So it's really be complete about the calculation 80% of the time there should be no claim at all.

55
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,870
So I'm not going to be liable for anything. So I think it should be 15,000 minus, 1500 bucks.

56
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,300
And I multiply that by the one minus C, I think.

57
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,930
So you got a proposal there that we want to say, well, there's a 20% chance I'm going to face a claim at all.

58
00:07:48,460 --> 00:08:00,850
If I do face the claim, I'm not liable for 100% of that and liable for 75% of that.

59
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,700
So the co-insurance is the insured is the insured person's liability, 25%.

60
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,270
The flip side of that is my liability is the insurer 75%.

61
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,330
But what am I liable for? My liable for 75% of that entire loss that was branded.

62
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,820
So I'm not I'm only liable for the amount by which that loss exceeds the practical.

63
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,430
So before we do that, math is so kind of the logic sort of there makes the 20% chance that I have to pay a claim at all.

64
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:41,300
If I do have to pay a claim, I only have to pay for 75% of whatever piece of that claim I'm liable for.

65
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:49,309
The insured person is liable for what, their 25% cost sharing and what amount of claim my liable for in the first place.

66
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm not liable for the entirety of the $15,000 loss.

67
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,730
I'm only liable for the amount by which that claims loss exceeds the 1500 dollars deductible.

68
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,350
So as an insurer, as the insurer, I've paid 75% of $13,500.

69
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,129
So that reflects the insured person is liable for 100% of the first 1500.

70
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,220
So we're just going to take that out of the loss. From the insurer's perspective, loss was only 13,500.

71
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:28,879
The total loss is 15,000. But since there is a deductible of 1500 as an insurer, I couldn't care less about the first 1500.

72
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,180
So that's out of my calculation of the appeal because I'm not liable for a penny of that first 1500.

73
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,890
I'm only liable for a fraction of the 13,500.

74
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,280
If the amount of that liability exceeds that are not double in, the fraction that I'm liable for is 75%.

75
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,590
So if we do all that math, you can trust me.

76
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,660
We get 20, $25. So that's the RFP.

77
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,040
So we've answered the first part of the question how do we calculate the loading?

78
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,610
If you consume the premium minus the air over.

79
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,470
So premium minus the AFP over the AFP or maybe just you.

80
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,520
There's 2200s premium economies.

81
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,020
Sure we can do it that way and we would get to that 8.6%.

82
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,860
So in other words, the actual premium is 8.6% of the fee.

83
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,790
Another way we could have done it is just to design premium by the RFP.

84
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,060
1.46, which is equal to one plus the loading.

85
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,530
So then we would get the same, we get the exact same 11.6%.

86
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,850
So either of those approaches would be fine and would yield the same answer.

87
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:29,129
Either just divide the premium by the RFP and say, well, that's one plus the loading, so subtract one and 3.6%.

88
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,960
So we're being charged 8.6% above the RFP. Or we could do the calculation as originally suggested, which is the direct way of calculating the loading.

89
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:48,060
My second way is like an indirect way. First calculate one plus L and then we figure out, okay, well one plus L is 1.86, then .086 or 8.6%.

90
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,370
Or we should do it the first suggested way,

91
00:11:50,370 --> 00:12:03,030
which is just the direct calculation saying the premium is $175 above the RFP of 2000, 2575 divided by 2025.

92
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:13,320
That sort of excess premium which is being charged above the RFP is 8.6% right on that.

93
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,390
So that's just to clarify, the loading factor improved,

94
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:26,650
I guess it consists of like an attempt to make profit as well as any overcharge for moral hazard or any other trick.

95
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:33,320
So in this in this actual example, we don't really have any moral hazard.

96
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,250
We just had sort of a one lost 20% chance of a 15, $15,000 loss.

97
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,210
And we kind of assumed implicitly that that loss was fixed.

98
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:52,979
If the loss isn't fixed, then the premium is going to have to go up just to recognize the fact that the expected loss goes off,

99
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,900
the more generous the insurance policy is.

100
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:02,670
So if we had 10% co-insurance instead of 25, we'd expect all people would consume even more care and the loss of even larger.

101
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,280
So the pre so even the fee is going to go up because the actual amount of the loss is going up.

102
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:26,950
And actually what we can. We kind of see that in one of the other questions from the practice problems that I want to look at.

103
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:36,760
And there we can see very directly how that happens. Suppose the uninsured demand equals 1000 -20.

104
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,050
And we ask, well, suppose Price is 40.

105
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,960
How much does a person consume uninsured? Let's just plug that price of 40 into that demand curve.

106
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,130
20 times 40 is 800. So the person's going to cancel 200 uninsured.

107
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:21,080
So if we graph that user uninsured demand curve, the intercept will be 1000.

108
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,909
How do we know that if we plug in a price of zero quantity of a thousand so the x that stop

109
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,600
the quantity intercept is just how much would the person buy if it is being given away?

110
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,560
So that's a thousand units. What's going to be the price intercept?

111
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:52,190
At what price would this person buy? Zero. 15.

112
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,710
So you kind of eyeball it and say, well, he would turn this into zero 1D, 20 times P to be a thousand.

113
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,300
Or I could have solved this equation for P and then just kind of looked at the intercept directly.

114
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:21,530
So there's my uninsured demand curve. You know, the price of 40, I'm going to buy 2000 to 200 units.

115
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,800
So what's the expected value of the loss? First, I have to say, what's the probability of the loss?

116
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,480
See what the question.

117
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,040
There was 10%. So the person consumes no care if they don't get sick.

118
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,530
If they do get sick. This is their demand curve for care. So there's a 10% chance they get sick.

119
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,720
So the expected value of this loss, this person is uninsured.

120
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,320
So the price is 40. I respond by buying 200 units of care if I was sick.

121
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,020
So the expected value of the loss that I face is the 10% chance that it happens at all.

122
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,920
Times $40 per unit, times 200 units.

123
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,950
So if we do all that math, we should get 800 is a 10% chance of an $8,000 loss.

124
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,050
So that's the expected value of the loss, I'm sure to now be kind of go to two branded question what happens when we add moral hazard evidence?

125
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,840
Let's add an insurance policy and say, suppose now this person gets an insurance policy.

126
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,160
It has no deductible, but it has a co-insurance rate of 30%.

127
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,390
Are they still going to buy 200 units of care?

128
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,940
You have to tell me how many they're going to buy, which is it's going to be 200, or are they going to respond by buying more?

129
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,790
It's not. It's going to be different.

130
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,790
Yeah, they're definitely going to buy more because their coinsurance rate is reducing the price they face out of pocket.

131
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,300
So what's for what's 30% of $40? Well.

132
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,630
So now all of a sudden they say, well, every unit of care I buy costs me $12.

133
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,160
Well, I didn't have a perfectly price inelastic demand curve. My demand curve is not vertical.

134
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,860
It's sort of a standard downward sloping demand curve.

135
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:44,000
So if I'm only paying $12 out of pocket for sure, I'm going to buy more care than if I paid $40 out of pocket.

136
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,490
So how do we get the equation of the new demand curve? That's kind of what we did last week.

137
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,910
You substitute PE with what you actually pay now, which is 0.3 PE.

138
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,479
Exactly. So whatever the full price of care is in price I feel is point three P so it goes

139
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,780
back to my offender s comment about people don't care what health care costs,

140
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:16,460
they care about what it costs them. So I don't care what P is, I care what point three P is because that's what it costs me.

141
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,050
So we can't create a new insured demand curve.

142
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,920
Just by substituting in point three P for P because point three P is the price that I feel when I have this insurance policy.

143
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,710
So it's 1000 minus six. Okay, let's graph that demand curve.

144
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,159
Anything could happen. Like quantity intercept. It shouldn't.

145
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,970
Because the quantity intercept tells me how much this person would buy if the price was zero.

146
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,480
Well, a price of zero or a price of 0.3 times zero.

147
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:09,180
Price of zero. So the quantity intercept shouldn't change, but the y intercept is definitely going to change.

148
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,770
So to calculate that easiest way to do it is solve this for p.

149
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,500
So I put the standard y equals m x plus p, form a line six p equals a thousand minus.

150
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,940
Q I think everything by six.

151
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,570
So our insured demand curve has the same quantity intercept, but the price that are up goes up to 167.

152
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,550
So how much am I going to buy? So if the price is 40.

153
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:15,240
Six times 40 is 240. So I'm going to buy 760 units.

154
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
And so now we can ask, what's the actuarially fair premium for this policy?

155
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:41,919
How will this calculation? So even a little easier than the last one, we have no deductible.

156
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,170
We just have the co-insurance to account for. So we have the expected value of the loss.

157
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,410
Uninsured is 800.

158
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:00,220
What's the expected value of the full loss with this insurance policy and still a 10% chance of a loss?

159
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:12,550
The full cost of care is still $40 a unit. So now this person is buying 760 units.

160
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:34,250
So I haven't done that math. So we see that moral hazard as increased the total size of the loss from 800 to 3040.

161
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,510
This is a very price response of demand curves versus buying a lot more care.

162
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,129
So what's the IFP? It's a total loss.

163
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:56,670
But does the insurer pay that entire loss? And they pay 70% of that.

164
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,310
So at a point seven, if we do three or four times points seven.

165
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:22,610
2128. Then the insured the insured person bears the difference.

166
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:44,190
What is the chance of. So we see that the expected value of the Los uninsured is only $800 where we had insurance.

167
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,490
The loss grows because quantity of care consumed goes up from 200 to 760.

168
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,920
So we got a big increase in the loss. And the RFP for that policy, even though it's only covering 70%,

169
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:04,070
is actually a lot bigger than the entire expected loss on insured because the loss has grown so much in this country.

170
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:11,549
For example, that kind of answer your question like so moral hazard is kind of going into the AFP

171
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:17,280
calculation that moral hazard is also going to kind of make the policy less attractive.

172
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,719
It's from the consumer's perspective, I've got to pay this really high premium to cover all these extra units of care that again,

173
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,390
if you believe my demand curve as a measure of value are really not worth $40 to me.

174
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,100
So yeah, once I have that policy, I'm happy to consume those extra units which are worth $12 or more to me.

175
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:48,120
But I've got to pay this really high premium. I'm going to pay a premium even though a 30% co-pay is larger than the expected loss on insured.

176
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,479
So that does make insurance for something like this.

177
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,260
That is a really big price response, a lot less attractive because the premiums got to go way up to cover all that extra care.

178
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,950
So any questions about this before we turn it over to our presenters?

179
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:23,970
I do. Which group wants to go first?

180
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:35,110
If you go by whichever one is listed first and the second, Tara is never ready.

181
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,690
Yeah, go for it. We have got a window.

182
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,720
Text presentation is here. You guys have your presentation? Did you send it yet?

183
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,260
They can go. Then let's find Muhammad. Hundred units. Sorry. Oh.

184
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,470
Is it okay if the other group goes further? Yeah, that's totally fine. Right.

185
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,350
Okay. Take it away. I don't want one person on the line.

186
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:18,800
Just on Zoom. Okay.

187
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,740
You know your sweater. Sit down.

188
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,850
Stephen, can you hear us? Excuse.

189
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:30,070
When you look at the discussion here.

190
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,710
Yeah. I think that there is.

191
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:50,380
I suppose you're surprised to see. Can you hear us?

192
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:11,290
Well, it was very, very strange.

193
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,190
Stephen, do you want to start? Hello? Yes, you're good.

194
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you. So, as well as the gist of it, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the class.

195
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,330
Listen to me. I wouldn't like to see my group members.

196
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,390
One and Stephanie and what they're going to be. David representing the buildings.

197
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,110
It is the maintenance of the nation and the physical condition following the state of the women's skills adversely.

198
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:48,340
So I do believe that actually the nation was sold to at the beginning of the position.

199
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,180
Any guesses on whether we didn't actually think so?

200
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,760
My husband won't need those like me.

201
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,390
You get the idea now. The the times needs the bags when we can sleep.

202
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:11,470
So the minute that was said was most in England in its existing intelligence that it was it actually would be sold from the Lucie County homes.

203
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,770
So it's hard to believe that, but used to be buildings without even one woman.

204
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:24,910
So as a child in the village, then the media provided the air and light.

205
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,700
What do you claim to be given? So what are the reasons for this?

206
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,370
So they would think these reasons was being the expense of the village and was a

207
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,550
world of difference and blaming which raised things which raise the need for money.

208
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:50,920
And the second reason was the possibility that is that none of the existing businesses were going was degraded, basically.

209
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:59,660
It is misleading. That was one of the reasons. So I think all the new that's I knew that.

210
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:07,090
So what is the new next thing? The new. That was who they said the factory.

211
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:17,980
Do things on each house. And if you had houses which had windows between ten and 20, then you made oceans.

212
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,700
And if you had houses between two, it more than 20.

213
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,190
Could you be patient? One would think the one sitting would be one.

214
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,820
It really wouldn't even be useless. 1696 one?

215
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,770
No. And there was the one that was 16666 windows.

216
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:47,910
It was what it would. So it would notice to imagine how high the taxes would.

217
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,740
So many individuals owed taxes so much.

218
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:06,180
The main concern was that the taxes paid by the owner of the building,

219
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:14,880
which means that the rate of Northern Ireland being the exception is listed in buildings which had multiple arrangements,

220
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,700
which are the single residences. The tax code to the landlord will be c one of the business owners.

221
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:27,500
C 109 lots of windows and the reconstructed buildings also without windows.

222
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:40,800
One other point is that the document was inconsistent despite being so do not have names on the windows.

223
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,920
He said before he said there was an accident not trying to remove the ones you least one name.

224
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:56,400
So like I mentioned before, those resolution things for each house that you knew before you chose them.

225
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:05,640
So if you remember, that was an attack on the environment as opposed to the new guy sitting on the beach.

226
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:18,480
So the information to advance makes one city according to your risk, ensuring that he was abused and absolutely be on each window.

227
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,190
That if your house had been put in windows, the base expands on each window.

228
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,430
If your house had between 15 to 19, then it would be nine beds in each.

229
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,530
And if you had a house and more than two individuals, it would be one thing which is like, well, that's.

230
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,510
So before the winter dance, there was the dance which was as good as dance.

231
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:53,730
So this was nice. But you had to be if your house had a fireman or some to do, things were paid for by somebody else.

232
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,050
So this was the most likely source of the resources. Why was this so important?

233
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:06,850
The reason was that the expedition had in the house to count the number of the chickens before the race of privacy.

234
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:18,740
This was the case in this beyond the country of Sweden. So that was another big problem,

235
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:30,470
which was definition of what can be defined as to be the most needed clarity in what is defined as an instance of celebration.

236
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:39,980
If you follow a professor from Cambridge, Big Macs, or one of his films in the scene, you know, and it wasn't very nice, but it trembled.

237
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:48,280
So you bring some of it into your house because then you will know the difference.

238
00:32:51,660 --> 00:33:00,810
There was some exemptions under the ban. So if there were two major exceptions in the below provided in rather than light,

239
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:09,690
they were exempt diplomats and if they were then treated but they were jobs requirement and that they could function and those were exempt.

240
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:19,590
The audition will begin. And so it is it takes. Finally, the medical officers petition for quality.

241
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,520
Over the next months, it could be a major crisis.

242
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:29,790
And the parliament finally. What is it? Anything as big as this you've never used in public.

243
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:35,070
And there was a little bit of vetoes. Did finally in 51, it was abolished.

244
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,750
So what were the laws from the regions? This is a debate.

245
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,410
This is a good word. Do it really is a vision of society which is created inefficiency.

246
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,980
It's not good for supply and demand out of the military.

247
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,319
So basically the benefit in the debate because you include education rose to the second

248
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,200
debate in London so that it basically didn't get to the point of be divided by.

249
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:16,350
So the consumer in this, although there are two cases, it is an individual who consumes cookies one day.

250
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:26,829
If you have zero windows and you don't have to be tax and you don't include maybe those two images, which is one that's easy,

251
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:36,340
always need at least one window before the tax and continue to produce more than zero because and they have to

252
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:44,500
be a little bit of a benefit and it's often a benefit in some cases recklessly because they may lose both.

253
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:56,919
See, which is the difference in three fishing boats, the ones who would buy the you know, you do tax exemptions easily lose ones the taxes.

254
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,500
And so in this case, it could be zero zero.

255
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:14,440
So bedfellows as people see. So what do you think which gentlemen feasible also is to be obviously remove

256
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,910
choose the option that minimizes the loss of tax to begin to the reduction.

257
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:30,340
And I think if that was the case, which was an expediency, then the repeal of US industry, just because they view the way the tax,

258
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:37,420
if it's positive or as if it's the other way and then be indifferent when they come to the scene.

259
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,720
So we wanted this hypothesis and so you said if we know, that's absolutely distorting positions.

260
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:56,020
So according to the new rates, if you remember, if a house kind of vetoes something before the six months,

261
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:03,100
if it holds and we lose some 15 divided by 19, that's neighbors in your house and windows.

262
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,130
You'll be good for anybody.

263
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:11,120
But you could keep a 19 year old to do it. So then you expect to see the signs.

264
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,850
It's a 914 and maybe because that's the extremities of the religious right.

265
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,760
So looking at the numbers, what do you conclude?

266
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:38,340
One hypothesis, I mean, is this was because they could do that if you have a at and instead of waiting we see sharp spikes and they would be making.

267
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:54,200
We actually. So when the demand is elastic, demand is steep,

268
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:04,670
and willingness to bring raises as the quantity of signals on demand is anything I say, it is possible just to wait and watch.

269
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,610
So we expect to buy fuel and domestic at launch.

270
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:23,890
So if the demand is elastic, my hope is that by if the demand goes divided by 81, you know, I think it is demand and it is deeply divided.

271
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,920
So if the demand is dusty, it is easier for you to immigrate or something.

272
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,049
But if the demand is in a state, these are windows need to wed.

273
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,930
I didn't know it was that which was really good.

274
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:48,620
So the was this large with the demand is inelastic and small when the demand is the state and Zealand, when the demand is potentially less.

275
00:37:51,690 --> 00:38:06,320
So there was there was assimilation. And assimilation was that the region was one of the 16% of the taxes being contributed to

276
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:11,380
the new tax was a clear example of the degree and also the taxation that Milton said.

277
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,870
Many people live in very nice houses because of the high taxes and environments that

278
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:23,230
had good within the new Liberal one point and is an issue that 92 is the taxes.

279
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:32,770
But I mean even that was perhaps the lesson that we can learn here is that we don't need to raise money, that there is significant revenue.

280
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:40,960
Even dogs can survive for a long time now and despite all the problems.

281
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
Awesome. Thank you.

282
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:55,180
So the second article that we look at, a study I should say was a fiscal rehabilitation of Medicare protective payments in its facilities.

283
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,450
And so the purpose of the study was put out by the fact of prospective payment

284
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:09,460
systems simply on delivery of rehabilitation therapy and skilled nursing facilities.

285
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:20,890
And so looking at this, therapy was important because, one, it's an expensive therapy and then which is a high cost for the facilities.

286
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:29,110
And so I can't it's a measurable way to treat patients because each individual patient is.

287
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:40,060
A high majority of the patients are under this treatment. And then, as I mentioned, one half of these are also getting this treatment.

288
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:52,630
And so, on other hand, it's important for policymakers to kind of observe this one, because there is a need to control expenditures as policymakers.

289
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:00,180
And since marginal revenues are directly related to and influenced by this,

290
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:07,030
and it's a way for policy makers to leverage and control expenditures not too much.

291
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,460
And they're also curious onto how payment methods contribute to provider behavior.

292
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:20,590
I guarantee you that all providers pretty much control what treatment is given to their patients.

293
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,720
It's a little bit the background that we've already learned about in other classes is retrospective,

294
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:33,030
retrospective, reasonable cost payment based, cost based payment.

295
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:43,070
And so these payments are determined before. The service, and there's a little time to start.

296
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,810
This payment is determined after services are expected payment system.

297
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,940
And in the study, they use an algorithm called Rook three.

298
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:05,909
And so basically if they had based off the therapy time predetermined rates and so the rates were determined by patients physical therapy,

299
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,980
occupational therapy and speech therapy.

300
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:23,740
And so using the algorithm that runs these nodes, 45 minutes on there, 50 minutes, 3.5 minutes, 500 minutes and 700, 720 minutes.

301
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:31,569
And so anything that was in between these intervals had a zero revenue and anything

302
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:37,810
that was exactly 2.5 minutes or under 50 minutes and so forth was a positive revenue.

303
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:44,350
And some more background to consider under cost based payment.

304
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:55,240
There is a marginal revenue as content. So every additional therapy also comes at the same cost as the previous minutes versus previous payment.

305
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,100
There's a discrete marginal revenue piece, and therefore at those notes I mentioned,

306
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,980
there's a positive revenue versus at intervals there's a negative or zero revenue.

307
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,450
And so therefore, this can rise to the hypothesis of the research study,

308
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:19,450
which one that keeps causes facilities to provide Medicare resident rehabilitation at no to levels,

309
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:26,020
which was up to one which was at the 45 to 150 and so forth with the five different levels.

310
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:35,930
And so I think that the study looked at, as I mentioned, it was Medicare patients, specifically those under part A,

311
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:44,390
and then it also looked at non Medicare patients such as out of pocket patients and those with Medicaid.

312
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:56,000
And so I looked at before and after a piece and a two part model was used along with a logistical model.

313
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:12,410
And so the study used data set assessments, which was considered had 400 items such as demographics, payment sources and diagnosis of the patients.

314
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,230
But these were just a few that were listed.

315
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:26,000
And then specifically in the study, participants have over 65 years of age, and they had to be admitted into the facilities either in 1998 or 999,

316
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:34,700
and had two specifically had less than 109 minutes of therapy per week, whether that was occasional speech or report.

317
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,200
And then I will pass it over to Norman to go over the results of the study.

318
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,430
Okay. So. Yes.

319
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:51,760
So the results are summarized in four tables and one finger.

320
00:43:52,180 --> 00:44:01,930
And so the first temple shows a breakdown of therapy and therapy points for all resistance, regardless of what they use.

321
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:10,269
And then we can see that there are some conditions that are very represented in therapy, for example, hypertension or stroke,

322
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:19,180
and then for non therapy can be taken up and people are resisting care or depressed, very presentation in therapy.

323
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:26,170
And then chapter two shows a breakdown of the payers.

324
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:35,270
So we have Medicare, Private and Medicaid and then we're looking as the comparison between before he s and V.

325
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:43,780
S, and we can see that the prevalence of therapy increased for Medicare and then decreased for private and Medicaid,

326
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,730
but then the average therapy time decreased for all groups.

327
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:57,249
And then figure one actually shows like everything has been broken down to.

328
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:08,350
Now we're looking at just Medicare patients and under the curve we have the number of patients represented in the Y axis.

329
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:13,929
We have the means of that in that is the issue of the minutes and then in why we have the numbers.

330
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,889
So under the graph we have the actual number of people who will be getting the therapy.

331
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:26,600
So and to give a lot which identifies will have a certain, like a certain percentage of residents who are getting for example,

332
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:39,669
there have been 50 minutes we have everything 8% of prison and so getting that but you teach one per week at those minutes and

333
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:52,900
then we can see that the cost based the grade wanted that the perspective the whites area under the cross over time before PBS

334
00:45:52,990 --> 00:46:03,110
there was a steady distribution of therapy increases and the number of in the number of therapy minutes per week but then just

335
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:16,810
PBS they that huge spikes of the models especially at 325 and it's 500 and then to a lesser extent at around 150 and 725.

336
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:30,010
So not expensive. And then thus this one shows the the first few columns you can see the Medicare and then plus

337
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:39,250
period and then like the breakdown of plus papers plus PBS are based off of each payer.

338
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,780
And we can see that those results have been quantified.

339
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:54,250
We've taken the results from figure one from the previous slide and use the data from the other payers like Medicaid and private payers.

340
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:07,159
And we have combined that and how the authors were using a dependent variable as the total number of therapy minutes within 5%,

341
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,330
not the level of select, not all therapy levels.

342
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:21,280
And then the observation was that pre PBS Medicaid residents are mostly teachers to receive not all levels of care and

343
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:32,290
then plus PBS that there was a huge increase in the and then not all levels of care for Medicare patients or residents.

344
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:39,879
Although all of the the groups experienced an increase in the in the number of

345
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,580
minutes and in the number of minutes of therapy and shifted towards Nutall.

346
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:58,750
And then the last table looks at how this payments payment method affected the receipt of therapy and also therapy time.

347
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,389
So Stephanie mentioned that there are just call regression everything.

348
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:14,260
So like this is like the previous slide that this one bring everything together and so we can see that pre so the first similar to the other table,

349
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:27,940
the first few columns I we're looking at and we can see that pre piece Medicaid Medicare residents one was one three times

350
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:39,130
more likely 3.7 times more likely than private residence to do more recommended for therapy for helping to take to therapy.

351
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:43,030
And they received total physical minutes to.

352
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,900
The companies and groups like the private players. And but we can see a shift to peace.

353
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:57,290
The eyes have increased for the for Medicare patients.

354
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:03,590
Medicare is against the number of time spent has significantly decreased.

355
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:12,830
So we're looking at 7% less time compared to that comparison group, which is private payers.

356
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:21,530
And then the contributions that others come up with is that the use of therapy decreased.

357
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:31,910
The occurrence of use of therapy decreased with the amount of therapy, provided it actually observed increased occurrence of therapy.

358
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,180
But there was a decrease in the actual amount of therapy that was given.

359
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,550
So the odds of a being recommended for therapy increased for Medicare patients.

360
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:50,690
But the actual time that was spent in therapy, like even the actual time that residents spent spent in therapy, decreased.

361
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,280
So and they have different reasons to explain that.

362
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:05,629
And they say one of the things is that they mean that the increase to the shift to the not all parts of the office in terms of

363
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:15,230
minutes which to economic incentives but also there may have been a need for for for for therapy in this in this facilities.

364
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:27,380
And as Stephanie mentioned, they may have been because of the negative revenue at the site at points other than the notes.

365
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:36,860
It meant that the possible explanation is that our facility has moved twice the nine, so that can increase their chances of making more of you.

366
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:43,729
And then the authors also say that this may be due to that replacing errors or the move

367
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:51,080
towards the number of minutes constantly approaching the noise may be due to reporting errors.

368
00:50:51,500 --> 00:51:03,559
And then the last one, they they concluded that providers were probably differentiating treatment based on on the peer.

369
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,340
So like Medicaid, private care for Medicare.

370
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,099
So that is our presentation.

371
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:23,810
And I have a question so we not like what the authors have given, like reasons why the the observations that they observe may have occurred.

372
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,130
So what do you guys think?

373
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:33,380
Why can you think outside of services that they've provided that could have that could possibly explain the shift towards the

374
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:44,180
knowledge or a decrease in the number of minutes spent in therapy and an increase in the arts of being recommended for therapy.

375
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,820
And then we'll go back to the slide.

376
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,680
But these are the notes are not.

377
00:51:52,790 --> 00:52:03,530
And so basically the providers referred to give the these minutes of treatment to their patients because there is a higher revenue.

378
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:12,820
But what other reasons you think that besides the revenue that they would get would be a reason for providers?

379
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,490
I mean, it's is kind of kind of linked to the revenue.

380
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:23,910
But I guess if you think about like the length of a normal appointment, maybe they would schedule a 45 minute appointment or a 30 minute appointment.

381
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:28,400
69 day. That's like usually in a health system you schedule like on the mark.

382
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:34,280
While there's probably not gonna be anyone that's scheduling like in 130 140 minute long session,

383
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,170
I don't know how many sessions you would schedule to actually reach that 150 mark.

384
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:45,879
So to me, it would seem like most providers, unless the patient really have like an excessive fee for therapy,

385
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,870
you would never get above that 45 minute mark before they might have scheduled 60 or 90.

386
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:56,870
But if they're not getting extra reimbursement for that, they're just going to stick them, not that like straight 45 minute appointment.

387
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:04,490
So I think that could explain some of the like kind of overall decrease and number of minutes of therapy provided.

388
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,940
And that's a good thing to kind of note that this was per week. So could have been through sessions.

389
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:18,580
These were skilled nursing facilities. Yeah. Okay. So normally he's in there for for longer than ten.

390
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,090
I mean, the doctor points, but yeah, I don't know.

391
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:32,740
I mean, I think, uh, if they generally scheduled a bunch of appointments at like 498 or something like that, they'd probably screwed up.

392
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,600
But anywhere around that benchmark, a little higher, a little lower between the nodes,

393
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:45,870
I can imagine them trying to push down the amount of time just for more like an efficiency, more stuff and things like that.

394
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,640
So maybe that would contribute to the less amount of therapy provided per patient, if that's what it was.

395
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,010
And I guess another one is like, how often do you really like question your provider?

396
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:08,850
So like they tell you the specific amount of sessions or amount of time often or you know, I'm not going to go to that lower time or higher time.

397
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:13,990
So yeah. Any questions? I think we'll have to turn over to the next group.

398
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:21,819
For me, the lesson is Medicare.

399
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,610
300 years later, we're still making the same mistakes in design that you know, which was like.

400
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:57,910
So yes, I am happy to know if you believe Obamacare insurance.

401
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,610
Yes, I thought it was right. Like over email documentaries.

402
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:11,710
The Mountain Climbers Challenge.

403
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:26,910
You know, I finally decided to speak to her right before they should have been right around the world.

404
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,690
Americans are. Yeah.

405
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,590
They're out of your life.

406
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:54,270
Yeah. Hopefully it will go back to a speech somewhere else trying to recruit some sort of person who lives here.

407
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,340
Oh, come on. Oh, no, no.

408
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:05,100
Out. I just. Really. How far is it still?

409
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:21,180
It's kind of. I mean, it's just like you're in charge of the town, and it's like a long downtown.

410
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,150
There's a lot back here, and I think it's just trying to go.

411
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:34,390
I don't know if it's like, I think I can just go like, I don't I everyone.

412
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,190
Hope you're all doing all that great and we'll do our best to something.

413
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:42,030
On the stability of the Obamacare insurance market first thing.

414
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:46,740
Really quick question what did the ACA do? Like give me three provisions of the ACA.

415
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,790
You got that? Well, there was originally a mandate that everybody had to get insurance on an exchange.

416
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:03,500
Perfect. Thank you. And we have. Can that be worked as a base? Yeah, it's just you got to give them extra points because what you said.

417
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,610
Thank you. Just awesome.

418
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,150
Anything else? One more. What?

419
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:21,540
Ryan. Sandy, what did the ACA do? Something about preexisting conditions?

420
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,030
All right. Well, we're not talking about any of that today.

421
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:31,620
Today, what we're talking about is the individual insurance marketplaces and those provisions under the ACA.

422
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:38,070
So to start, we're looking at two articles. Both articles are by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

423
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,060
They're looking at the profitability of the individual insurance marketplaces.

424
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:51,540
The first article is by Levitt, and it is looking at potential efforts to repeal the ACA, specifically relating to insurance premiums,

425
00:57:51,540 --> 00:58:00,360
subsidies and the potential of an insurance spiral, both as a consequence of the ACA or as a consequence of repealing the ACA.

426
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,060
It was published in 2016 and looks at data from 2014 to 2017.

427
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,440
And then we're going to go more into that in a minute here. The second article that we have,

428
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,360
the individual insurance market performance in 2019 is by Fair McDermott and Cox

429
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,130
and looks at the profitability of the ACA individual insurance marketplaces,

430
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,450
both from their early years where we had some really major change and fluctuation for the relatively more stable years recently.

431
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:34,680
That article is from 2020, so it does have a little bit of discussion about impacts from COVID 19,

432
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,550
but it doesn't have any data directly from the COVID 19 pandemic.

433
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,380
And Matt and Sara will be talking about that article further in a minute here.

434
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:48,629
And yeah, just again, to note, we are not looking at Medicaid expansion,

435
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:53,640
preexisting conditions or typically looking at the individual insurance marketplaces.

436
00:58:54,330 --> 00:59:00,800
Now, you can take it away with that first article. Okay, cool.

437
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,610
So to summarize,

438
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:11,250
the article discussed how ACA is preexisting condition clause and certain aspects of ACA getting repealed could potentially cause death spirals.

439
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,980
So we looked at this last class,

440
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:22,140
so adverse selection that spirals happen when the premiums rise and healthy people drop their coverage due to the high premiums.

441
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:31,860
And healthy people are more tempted to drop their insurance because of the high premiums, since it's no longer seen as a good value.

442
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:38,010
And since they drop their insurance, the premium rates increase for everyone else, which isn't good.

443
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:41,970
Okay.

444
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,560
So during Obama's presidency, under the ACA's preexisting clause, insurance can't tell which people are at risk and which people are not at risk.

445
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,300
So insurers had to give premiums the same premiums to everyone.

446
00:59:54,660 --> 01:00:01,230
And this is an example of asymmetric information, which we learned about last class and some classes before that, too.

447
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,800
This is when one party knows something that the other party doesn't know about.

448
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:14,220
And asymmetric information can also cause adverse selection and moral hazard, which is also something that we saw in the initial years of Obamacare.

449
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:23,459
So adverse selection is when high risks are likely to purchase insurance and more generous coverage compared to low risk individuals,

450
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:30,540
which is what we had in the initial years of Obamacare and with generous coverage being purchased by high risk individuals.

451
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:35,160
Not only does this change that behavior because they don't have to bear all the costs,

452
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:41,640
but people that purchase more expensive coverage also expect to get more expensive treatments.

453
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:47,190
And so because of that, insurers had to raise premiums to actually make profit.

454
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,760
So we go with asymmetric information.

455
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,479
People that are healthy are not interested now because it's expensive.

456
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,709
Right. And then you go to adverse selection, moral hazard, and it becomes even more expensive.

457
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,760
So more healthy people want to leave that were already in ACA.

458
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,580
I added the means got me through thick and thin with experimentation.

459
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:18,810
Yeah. And so to prevent asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard, the rates to lower the rates and also prevent a death spiral.

460
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:28,620
What the ACA did was that they the prevention methods were premium subsidies, which is for low to middle income Americans,

461
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:38,579
and also the individual mandate which required Americans to purchase minimum essential coverage for minimal at minimum essential coverage.

462
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,220
And if you don't, then you there's a tax penalty.

463
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:50,670
And so what we saw from these prevention methods was that premium rates decreased and more people that were low risk got insured.

464
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:57,300
So they prevented the death spiral and also lowered the asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard.

465
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,709
Okay. So during Trump's presidency, so when Trump became president,

466
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:11,370
Republicans used a reconciliation bill which although couldn't repeal the market regulation of ACA,

467
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:17,430
it was able to lower premiums, subsidies, including removing the tax penalty from the individual.

468
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:26,909
And also around this time around 2017 and 2018, we saw a number of insurers leaving the marketplace because at that time,

469
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,969
we didn't know what was going to be completely repealed.

470
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:36,720
And also by decreasing the premium subsidies, we also see that insurers are more at risk of losing money.

471
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,400
So they were leaving to prevent themselves from losing money.

472
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:49,709
And we also saw that President Trump and Republicans obviously had to make some difficult tradeoffs.

473
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:56,940
And we learned about tradeoffs in the beginning of this semester, where we choose less of one thing to gain something to gain more of something else.

474
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,700
And the article mentioned that Trump wanted to keep the good things from the ACA, for example,

475
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,550
having saved premiums regardless of your preexisting conditions,

476
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:10,320
but removing the unpopular stuff, which was the individual mandate and increased taxes.

477
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:16,680
But by decreasing the taxes, by removing the tax penalty, we saw an increase in premium rates.

478
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,110
However, I do want to mention that although premium rates did increase,

479
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:28,840
it did increase compared to the increase as compared to like the initial years where there was a huge spike in premium rates.

480
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:35,880
It was more just a gradual increase. But this is something that Mike and Sara will talk more in-depth about in the next article.

481
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,549
Okay. So here is a premium subsidies demand curve.

482
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:50,790
So as you can see with the premium subsidies, consumers pay this price P2 while the producer, the the insurer receives the price of P3.

483
01:03:51,150 --> 01:04:00,420
But if the subsidies are eliminated, then the price for the consumer goes up from 3 to 2.1, while the producer is more at risk of losing money.

484
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,710
And so but with the premium subsidies, subsidies, we can see that the consumer and the producer,

485
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,200
the insurer and the charity both benefit from premium subsidies.

486
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:15,329
So what we can see from this premium subsidy demand curve is that you can tell that

487
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:20,550
low risk populations expected utility is greater if they don't have insurance,

488
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:28,290
because if the premium subsidies are eliminated and premiums are increasing, low risk population,

489
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:37,139
the low risk population can possibly find other insurances that are more affordable, or they can just be uninsured.

490
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:42,430
They can choose to be uninsured. This leads to our next discussion question.

491
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:48,070
All right. So our first question for you today, we're trying to kind of put them in the middle if they all don't fall asleep.

492
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,970
But given the context of the article is what I just described,

493
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:58,840
can you tell me some ideas that you might have about why all efforts to repeal the ACA have fundamentally failed,

494
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:06,790
besides the limited provisions that were passed under Trump because it's become very popular.

495
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:14,680
Exactly. DNA structure is what it wants, the subsidies removed, because then they would lose more money.

496
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,980
And Mr. Romney, this may not be related to the article,

497
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:29,380
because even if they're unsatisfied with their insurance, they're scared to change it to a whole new strategy.

498
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,090
Yeah. I mean, so you can say that our consumers are largely risk averse, right?

499
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:38,080
They don't want to go without insurance and these subsidies help them maintain insurance at an affordable price.

500
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:46,240
Any other reasons? The economy is pretty stable right now, so they wouldn't want to make that change.

501
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,200
We don't want to rock the boat. If things are running smoothly, why would we make a big change?

502
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:58,329
Awesome. Thank you guys so much, guys that matches up next for their our second party that she plays as well.

503
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:03,220
I remind you also my voice is kind of short, so please let me know if you caught him.

504
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:13,240
So I have an article which is individual insurance funding comments in 2019 to start off with this article.

505
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:22,240
Analyze individual insurance market performance under the Affordable Care Act, I'll be known as Obamacare from 2011 to 20.

506
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,770
What was it? Was it 2011 to 2019?

507
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:33,729
And analyze financial performance without the individual mandate, people were concerned that it would negatively affect the marketplace,

508
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,800
hence that the authors examined the medical loss ratios and the gross margins.

509
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,959
This article found that in most recent years that financial performance actually

510
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,060
improved overall compared to the market earlier the early years of the ACA.

511
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,740
So medical loss ratio, which I will revisit as MLR, would be very likely.

512
01:06:54,750 --> 01:07:01,030
It kept on saying the same word over and over again. But is the share of total health care premiums spent on medical claims?

513
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:09,970
The ratios were expected to be worse in the first few years because of the little information little information insurers had available to work with,

514
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:14,610
which kind of relates a lot to asymmetric information that you mentioned.

515
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:20,710
It just doesn't seem to focus on individual market gross margins.

516
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,829
So it is the amount of a it is the amount of money a company has left after subtracting

517
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:31,660
all direct cost of producing or purchasing the goods and or services themselves.

518
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:40,270
And in other ways they examine the average amount by which premiums in by premium incomes exceeds claims

519
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:49,300
costs per enrollee per month gross profit side gross margins gross margin had a similar pattern to LMR,

520
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:56,200
which you can see where you're going to see more insiders slide where it goes from 2018, 2019.

521
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:04,650
And also there was a increase of dollars 16,080 and focusing on the on the graph specifically

522
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:09,730
the initial years under the ACA were not profitable or the gross margins were less than zero,

523
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,170
indicating a loss of profitability, while in the recent years insurance had become profitable again.

524
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:22,210
This indicates that the premium rose enough to cover the costs of medical claims and

525
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:26,530
that the market was stabilizing with less healthy consumers leaving the market,

526
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:32,440
leaving the market than might be anticipated with the repeal of individual mandates side out,

527
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:41,320
I do want to remind everyone that a positive margin does not mean that that is a that is profitable.

528
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:49,299
So in regards to specifically the repeal of the individual mandate to start off with rebates are a

529
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:57,340
retrospective payment which ultimately reduces the overall cost of products and services at a later date.

530
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:03,310
If consumers are below the ACA, LMR and LR threshold,

531
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:10,950
insurers need to spend 80% of the premiums on claims and the remainder going from marketing admin profits.

532
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:21,760
Also for the article found that in 2020, insurers expected to need to pay $2.7 billion, nearly double the rebates compared to the year before.

533
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:25,660
The results show the improvement in financial performance over the years.

534
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:32,980
By analyzing the data in this article, we found that we found that after the elimination of the individual mandate,

535
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:39,460
the market risk has stayed relatively stable, which many were surprised by because everyone assumed.

536
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:50,530
That it would not be stable and premiums actually fell from 2019 and 2020 and 2020 because 2018 premiums were higher than needed to be.

537
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:57,040
So this shows that the individual market remains profitable even after lowering the tax penalty.

538
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:01,840
And this is something we'll follow wind up. All right.

539
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:12,260
Thank you. Now that we've had an overview of both of the articles, I'm going to talk about how this connects us.

540
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:18,500
And the first major topic that we've touched on in this presentation we've been talking about in class is asymmetric information,

541
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:23,120
which we know is when one party has an information advantage over the other.

542
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:32,330
And in this case, insurers had very little information to work with when they were setting their premiums and as a result performed worse financially.

543
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:39,709
Earliest years of the ACA marketplaces and as Matt mentioned, medical loss ratio,

544
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:48,650
which is what we're using here to measure financial performance, is the share of premiums that are actually paid out as claims.

545
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:57,920
And you can see that a larger percentage for the ratio means that insurers are paying out more of the premiums claims.

546
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:02,059
And in 2015, the ratio exceeded 100%.

547
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:06,050
So it was actually costing insurers more in claims than it was in premiums.

548
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:11,230
But as the years went on, the ratio decreased,

549
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,010
indicating that insurance insurers were better able to match their premium

550
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:21,290
revenues to claims cost and that they were starting to become more profitable.

551
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:30,030
The second concepts that we talked about in class last week was ex ante and ex post risk transfers.

552
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:38,940
And so with this concept, know, as we mentioned, insurers didn't have much information when setting their premiums under the ACA.

553
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:46,919
They could not exclude based on preexisting conditions. So they didn't know who was high risk and who was low risk before setting their premiums.

554
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:52,020
So we call this ex ante transfer because they didn't have the information beforehand.

555
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:58,080
And then when they use these premiums to pay the claims for the people who actually get sick or actually incur a loss,

556
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,360
and this is happening after the loss has been deferred. We call this an ex-post risk transfer.

557
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,280
And we learned in class that insurers would prefer not to make ex ante transfers.

558
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:16,290
It makes it difficult for them to match their premium revenues to claims costs and as a result

559
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,739
ends up raising premiums for everybody as they're struggling to match those revenues to us.

560
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:28,770
And we can see from this graph, which shows the trends in monthly premiums and claims per person over time,

561
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:34,110
that that's exactly what happened, that premiums were rising for everybody.

562
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:44,490
And then the final topic that I wanted to go over that also also mentions and that we've been talking about in class is adverse selection.

563
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,180
And this was a concern that was mentioned in both of the articles for our group

564
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:54,160
that eliminating the individual mandate penalty would result in the low risk,

565
01:12:54,180 --> 01:13:03,240
healthy people dropping out of the market and leaving only a high risk for these clients and causing premium price because premium prices would go up.

566
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:10,590
And so I pulled this graph from our class to illustrate the concept of why adverse selection occurs.

567
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:19,680
So we can see on here the use star is the utility of income at the actuarially fair premium price.

568
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,070
So this is the premium that's being charged to everybody in the risk pool.

569
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:29,490
And then the little Jacqueline is the expected utility for high risk people.

570
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:34,049
You can see that it's a lot lower because they don't buy insurance and they buy insurance.

571
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:38,310
So the high risk people are going to continue buying insurance and staying in the risk pool.

572
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,560
And the Little Ghost is the expected utility of income for low risk people.

573
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,830
And you can see that's higher for them if they do not purchase insurance,

574
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,510
which is the incentive, why they don't have the incentive to stay in the risk pool.

575
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,990
In this example and I will talk about an average insurance.

576
01:13:55,290 --> 01:14:03,780
So this is a concern that if we eliminated the individual mandate penalty that this would happen, that we would see adverse selection happening.

577
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,080
But we also have data from this article showing that the number,

578
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:14,520
the average number of days spent in the market absorbed spent in the hospital for

579
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,710
the entire market was actually lower in 2019 and it was in the previous four years.

580
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:25,770
And my question to all of you is, does this data supports the concern that adverse selection is taking place?

581
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,660
Why or why not?

582
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:43,550
So we're worried that low risk people are going to drop out or healthy people are going to drop out, leaving only sick people to market.

583
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:48,490
So just to support that. Now you expect it to go up.

584
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,830
Exactly. Okay.

585
01:14:54,130 --> 01:15:00,370
So if we weren't seeing only sick people left in the market, we would expect the number of hospital stays to increase.

586
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:11,230
Anybody have any ideas? Actually, you wouldn't expect it to show up as much.

587
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:19,960
Hospitals obviously are the only really avenue there. I don't necessarily have good.

588
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:27,880
Yeah, I don't know. Hospitals are you might expect to be more stable than other things or other avenues of care.

589
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:34,720
True. Yeah. And this is also this is just one metric like this is not you know, we're not trying to make any blanket statements here.

590
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:40,590
This is just an idea to get you thinking what you might expect to see if you have symptoms.

591
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:47,050
Is it because probably the premiums went up after the en.

592
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:52,300
Because healthy people are out of the food. Choose not.

593
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:59,810
And therefore people would use less care. I think it's actually showing the opposite of that.

594
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:04,600
So our hospital patient days per enrollee is decreasing.

595
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:10,570
So what that actually is indicating is that adverse selection is not taking place as much as you would expect it to.

596
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:18,010
We thought these healthy people would drop out after the individual mandate was repealed and in fact, in reality, it doesn't appear that they are.

597
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:31,540
Yeah. What happened to the uninsured? Uninsured rate when the individual mandate got repealed or reduced to zero?

598
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:36,600
Um, really great question and I wish we had that data up on our slides.

599
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:41,710
Yeah, that wasn't part of our article and we didn't look at that data.

600
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:47,500
Didn't change very much. All right.

601
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:52,180
So one reason that this could have happened is because the premium subsidies were still in effect.

602
01:16:52,330 --> 01:17:02,020
So it's possible that that was still enough of an incentive for healthier people to stay in the market and stable investments.

603
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,809
So just a really quick summary. So we have more time for discussion.

604
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:12,459
But overall, both of these articles are showing that with the provisions of the ACA,

605
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:20,140
even with the repeal of the individual mandate and the lowering of premium subsidies under Trump marketplaces remaining relatively stable,

606
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:26,829
insurers are profitable. In fact, they're remaining so profitable that they have to send rebates back to individual

607
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:31,330
purchasers and employers because their medical loss ratio was too low.

608
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:38,020
They're not paying enough of their premiums on claims, so they're actually making more money than they're allowed to under the ACA.

609
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:45,070
And while there are some concerns about adverse selection and adverse selection costs and a potential death spiral,

610
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:52,390
it doesn't appear that at this time that is really happening as we still have a relatively good mix of risk in the insured population.

611
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,490
So just final question for discussion.

612
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:05,590
What does it tell you that the insurance markets, insurance marketplaces have remained stable even after the individual mandate was repealed?

613
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:23,180
I know we've talked about this a little bit already once. But people are risk averse because I think especially after COVID,

614
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:27,390
I think people would want to stay just in case anything really bad like that happened.

615
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,310
Yeah, definitely. Fear that. I think again.

616
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:39,500
You know, I would just say that that kind of implies that the individual mandate was not the sole reason for people to change their behavior,

617
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:45,230
consumer behavior, that there was something else like the government subsidies that were in effect, that were affecting their behavior.

618
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:49,460
Yeah. Thank you. Oh! Oh, my God.

619
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,230
Are you that. It was for me. And then my last question.

620
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:01,280
Going through a time where is our is the medical loss ratio rebate provision of the ACA,

621
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,580
which mandates if you don't spend 80% on claims, you have to send the money back to consumers or employers.

622
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:12,560
Is that a good or effective way to limit the rise in premium costs?

623
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:19,550
Are these rebates that are being sent out? Are those good or bad for the insurer, for the purchaser of insurance or for the employer?

624
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:29,370
Think about utility of income, right? So you're overpaying on your premium and the insurance holding onto this money for the entire year.

625
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:33,180
Is that good for you or bad for you? You're good for them.

626
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:40,680
Exactly. And what can you expand on that a little bit, Andrew, because they can use that money to earn other money, interest, etc.

627
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,150
It's money that you could have used during the year for other things that you might have prioritized differently.

628
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:49,540
Exactly. Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

629
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:55,170
Yeah. I also think typically when like individuals or employers get the rebate, they're probably like,

630
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:58,483
oh, also by insurance gave me a rebate instead of thinking, oh, they over.
