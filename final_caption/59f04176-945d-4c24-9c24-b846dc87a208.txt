00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:09,379
By the 17th Century,
a more sophisticated approach to

3
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:13,617
managing the public's
health began to take form.

4
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:19,565
In 1639, the Massachusetts Bay Colony
required birth and death registration.

5
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:21,530
Less than ten years later,

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,380
a resolution to prevent pollution
in Boston Harbor was adopted.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,526
Officials started to isolate people
with diseases like small pox and

8
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:36,786
quarantine ships from other
countries to assess whether

9
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,083
the people on board were carrying disease.

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:45,706
Infectious diseases like small pox,
cholera, typhoid, yellow fever,

11
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:51,998
and malaria persistent throughout the 18th
century as leading causes of death.

12
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,316
[MUSIC]

13
00:00:54,316 --> 00:01:00,889
In 1793, a major epidemic of yellow fever
in Philadelphia Infected two-thirds

14
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:07,990
of the population and 10% of
the city's population did not survive.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,600
To address these and
other public health challenges,

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,250
the United States established
the Marine Hospital Service in 1798,

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,920
set up to deal with disease onboard ships.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,650
The Marine Hospital Service Act
also provided healthcare for

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,540
merchant seamen and thereby became the
world's very first healthcare insurance.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,658
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:43,200
By the middle of the 19th century the
industrial revolution was in full swing.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,852
High densities of people settled
in industrialized areas,

23
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:52,972
dangerous and toxic working conditions,
dangerous machinery.

24
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:58,022
Overcrowding and lack of adequate
sanitation as well as poor access

25
00:01:58,022 --> 00:02:03,350
to clean water, and
massive air pollution from factories.

26
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,420
All contributed to an increase in
the spread of infectious diseases and

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,700
the emergence of chronic diseases.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,900
This led to the need for better living,
and working conditions, and

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,315
improved sanitation efforts to
keep disease from spreading.

30
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:23,133
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,937
One of the most significant public
health achievements of the era came as

32
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:31,560
the result of the work of John Snow.

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,621
In 1854,
during a cholera epidemic in London,

34
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:41,730
Snow successfully mapped the location
of cholera cases throughout the city.

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,685
And discovered that people who
were infected all got their water

36
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,896
from the Broad Street pump.

37
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:54,470
This was the first noteworthy example
of modern day epidemiology in action.

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,981
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:01,563
Meanwhile, during this period
Lemuel Shattuck completed

40
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:06,144
the report of the sanitary of
Massachusetts based on what he

41
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,190
described as a sanitary
survey of the state.

42
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,220
Making recommendations for the promotion
of public and personal health.

43
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:23,130
This is often considered the beginning
of the modern era of public health.

44
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,347
[MUSIC]
In 1873,

45
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:30,470
Michigan became one of the first states to
establish a statewide health department.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,219
During this period,
the National Port Quarantine Act,

47
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:39,218
a precursor to the public health service
and centers for disease control and

48
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,750
prevention made the federal government
responsible to identify and

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,720
address disease outbreaks.

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,210
By 1910, every state had formed
a statewide health department.

51
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,936
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:00,515
While public health advances most
often produced a positive result,

53
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:06,480
some public health undertakings
created serious ethical controversies.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,358
In 1932, the public health service
launched the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment.

55
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:17,290
The purpose was to study the natural
progression of untreated syphilis.

56
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,482
600 African Americans
participated in the study

57
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:27,438
to evaluate what they
understood to be bad blood.

58
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:33,580
400 of these participants didn't
even know that they had syphilis.

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,870
And while they were given free healthcare,
meals, and

60
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,670
burial insurance,
they were not actually treated.

61
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:47,560
Despite the fact that penicillin was
proven to cure syphilis by the mid 1940s.

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,293
Many of these participants died and

63
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:54,220
even passed on syphilis to their wives and
babies.

64
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,880
The experiment continued until 1972,
when it was deemed an ethical disaster.

65
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,230
Leading to the establishment of more
stringent regulations guiding human

66
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,270
subject research.
