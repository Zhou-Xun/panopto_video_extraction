1
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:55,240
But. Yeah.

2
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,780
Yeah, I was just wondering. Okay.

3
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:25,060
Seasonal workers train. Why not pay the students, other students who don't know each other?

4
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,000
I keep it. That's good. That's. That's why the less.

5
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,540
The less legible side is because. So it's a good idea.

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:46,170
I know. It's like, yeah, a lot of a lot of times like people know each other, like, really well and really like, every class together.

7
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:55,070
And sometimes. Yeah. So, um.

8
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,270
Between yesterday, talking like much of the day this morning already even on some phone calls, I'm like, oh, my gosh, that's real.

9
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,399
I'm talking to you. Best off, too. Okay.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:25,590
So today we're going to talk about mental health, which we've certainly touched on lots of pieces of childhood mental health previously.

11
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,120
But just like I said, the mini lecture was sort of to give you guys a background on sort of these are the diagnostic categories and issues.

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,249
And if people are interested specifically in mental health as it plays out in kids and sort of the things that we think about mental health in kids,

13
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:51,420
it's a reasonable background. So today we'll talk about a bit a bit of, you know, recent data in terms of COVID because that's, again,

14
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:00,310
like hard to ignore and studies are coming out again all the time in terms of, you know, tracking this information.

15
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,050
So sort of from an epidemiology standpoint, what's happening for kids.

16
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,610
And then I wanted to just go over some of these reports in that child trends reading,

17
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:18,719
which was that Bartlett reading for you guys is sort of like a I think of it as very like a cookbook

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,990
of sort of steps to take to address some of these issues and sort of outline these big priorities.

19
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,150
So I think those are important to know about. And then we'll just go over a little bit.

20
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,200
If people had sort of questions around this diagnosis, definitions, stuff and talk about treatment strategies.

21
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,499
And then we closed the door for discussion and talk about school based mental health clinics as one.

22
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,910
Oh, thank you. Very good.

23
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:01,350
Um, so based on mental health, which was the read and respond piece, so, okay, so, so first, just thinking about the COVID impacts,

24
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,570
which, you know, I feel like every single thing for this class, it could be like, okay, what if COVID do?

25
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:15,480
What did we know what acoba COVID do? Like where do we stand? I mean, across so many public health issues, but it's just really striking.

26
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,469
So we know that and that as well.

27
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,000
So I get that sort of global public health article because there's really some great work.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,780
If people are interested in global public health, particularly mental health,

29
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,790
that's a really just intersection of some really powerful and awesome work.

30
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,610
And I think we can learn a lot from what we've seen in global health context around mental health,

31
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:50,910
even though there's sort of less, you know, money poured into tertiary health care in other countries compared to here anyway.

32
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,909
So what we know is that clinically elevated rates of depression and anxiety,

33
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,110
which are usually what people are talking about when they're talking about mental health on a broad scale.

34
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,439
This is what we can measure reasonably easily. And again, with that many lecture I talked about a lot of different nuances in kids.

35
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,379
So we can discuss that more, but we know that it increased dramatically.

36
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,700
We also know, as with so many different conditions, there's a shortage of providers.

37
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,060
There's really high turnover. If you're talking, you know,

38
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,739
doing talk therapy with people or even working with people to get them services around mental health care because of limited access,

39
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,300
you have a lot of stress that you take on. So we talked about that a little bit last term.

40
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:42,329
Foster care, certainly an issue here as well. We know that there is major limited access.

41
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,330
So we'll talk about some things that are happening here that are trying to alleviate that or address that.

42
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,800
And what's really so tragic is that it's in communities where there's just really high need.

43
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,729
And we talked, if you guys remember,

44
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:06,660
like way back in the beginning about sort of the specialized child care and pediatrics for behavioral

45
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,320
concerns like this is where we have a massive deficit in care providers in the mental health space.

46
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,770
We also have really, really limited care in rural settings.

47
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,090
So that's a big, big area of need.

48
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,470
We also know that there are like, you know, especially in rural settings, for example,

49
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,849
there's a lot of, you know, there's stigma with with regard to mental health overall,

50
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:44,399
I feel like it is decreasing and I think like my hope is that it's generationally kind of decreasing stigma around mental health.

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,690
And I think that even in the past, again, like decade or so, we've seen some real change.

52
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:57,900
And I think COVID kind of again, put that on the on the front burner of something to acknowledge that that's a crisis.

53
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,510
But there's still variability, of course. Community contexts and there's a lot of stigma in certain contexts and rural contexts is one.

54
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,290
And then as with again many things that we see,

55
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:18,019
we know that there are race disparities in support services and so we see disproportional impacts in these communities.

56
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:28,760
So good foundational things to know in terms of this sort of big picture, you know, aspirational goals.

57
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:40,430
I think one of the reasons that I'm sort of hopeful in this space is that a sort of stigma is declining.

58
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:50,930
And again, I think, you know, as as Gen Z starts to take over, it could increasingly decline, which I think is great.

59
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,090
These are sort of, you know, these very, very broad statements.

60
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,660
But I think you can actually make them a little more specific.

61
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,310
So, for example, like this was a 21, 2021 report around youth mental health.

62
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,979
And if you look at some of these statements, like I would say,

63
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:16,550
this is actually like this is from the sort of executive summary level part of the report.

64
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,180
But I look at that statement and I go, Oh, that has implications for the kinds of interventions that we do and that we know how to do.

65
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,100
So if you're thinking about, Oh, I want to do an intervention with youth and families around, you know,

66
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,320
emergent emotion coaching in the family or teaching preschoolers how to label their emotions.

67
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,690
That really fits right into this sort of overarching, really broad goal.

68
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,920
And I just want to point that one out. I mean, there's a lot of other ones we can do here.

69
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:51,170
We can talk about developing culturally competent mental health care strategies and training people to do culturally competent mental health care.

70
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,450
And I think when we think about like going into organizations writing grant proposals to fund the work that those organizations do,

71
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,659
I think these are the kinds of things we want to know about,

72
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:10,970
because if our organization is like a mental health provider and under resourced community and you can come up with, you know,

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,710
a way to link programs that they do or that they want to implement to these kinds of goals in a very, like, responsive way.

74
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,180
That's that's like the, the trifecta of grant writing.

75
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,740
Like, that's what you want to do when you're writing grants and trying to get funding for your programs to kind of work on these big picture goals.

76
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,990
Because on the one hand, when you look at these very big picture goals, they're so big picture, it's a little overwhelming.

77
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:44,480
But if you can kind of tie them to specific concrete like interventions or tasks or, you know,

78
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,210
programs that we can think about implementing, then it actually that's why it gives me hope.

79
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
So I feel like even in those big reports, there are really specific things.

80
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,960
A lot of what we've talked about in this class in terms of how we think about interventions for kids and families and making them more better,

81
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:10,639
making them better. The other thing that I liked in this report that they pointed out was that they talked about the early childhood educational

82
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,820
workforce so that this week we've been talking about child care and all the stress and burden that child care workers have,

83
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,980
and yet the really important role they play.

84
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:28,880
I like to have popped up in here as an important sort of goal for protecting youth mental health, any of those kind of,

85
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,110
again, like aspirational statements that people would have ideas around, how might we do these things?

86
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:51,720
Just off the top of your head. Ideas for tapped out can't be tapped out.

87
00:10:51,900 --> 00:11:00,170
It's not even Thanksgiving. Doesn't have to be a fully fledged grand idea.

88
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,880
What would be some things that people could suggest to? And.

89
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:19,700
If you think about organizations that seek to serve kids, families, communities establish someone who's trained.

90
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,340
Religion virtues.

91
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:41,990
They get Kroger, they do vaccine. You know, like checkup visits, like, hey, can I do, like, in depression, anxiety, depression screeners?

92
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,420
Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, you tell that.

93
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,250
Yeah, that's what I mean. Like something just kind of random and creative.

94
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,820
Right. But that could be maybe placed in a setting that would be, you know, not expected.

95
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,970
And we talk about libraries a lot, too, in early childhood.

96
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,350
Yeah, I'm like, that reminded me of the program.

97
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:15,590
It's for older adults. Mm hmm. And it's like any community member can get, like, trained on it and do, like, a whole training packet.

98
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,880
And they really try to, like, reduce, like, the stigma around it.

99
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,780
Like, anyone can get this, like,

100
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:31,760
training and anyone can sign up to get like basically counseling from a community member or a teacher or religious leader or something.

101
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,920
And a few people still that sound like pretty really young people.

102
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,999
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it. And.

103
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,420
Yeah, and that, that pearls program, um, I feel it is for older adults.

104
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:54,130
Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why talking about it certainly that idea of like and I've talked about this before

105
00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:02,360
but like wedging in an awareness screening programing in these unexpected settings where people go.

106
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,490
That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, more like on the policy level,

107
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:16,680
advocating for better reimbursements for Medicaid because a lot of Medicaid patients get left out because providers don't like that the insurance.

108
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:27,830
And so that leads in some very direct ways to this reduction in provider availability because of insurance concerns.

109
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,010
So absolutely policy changes can be really impactful.

110
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,770
Yeah, I'm thinking about the screening component.

111
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:41,000
I know like thinking about this, my teenage years of the pediatrician, like, well, they would do a depression screening,

112
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,610
but it was like three questions and usually like my mom would still be in the room.

113
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:54,270
So I'm going to probably answer those truthfully and they'd have to leave for other things just from not that.

114
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:01,999
And I think that might be important to have that of, I guess the opportunity with the provider to talk about that.

115
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,420
But also maybe just overall improving the screenings kind of going off of culturally competent because one might be relevant for me

116
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,379
isn't going to be relevant for someone else with a different background and three questions is not really enough to dive deep enough.

117
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,130
I feel like that misses a lot of things, too. That's that's true.

118
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,320
And that that is true with so many of our screenings.

119
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,229
We have to like make do with less and try to figure out so that like from a sort of statistical perspective, right?

120
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:38,540
Like what would be the best questions to ask that you could then go deeper because we can't have screening,

121
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,290
take up everything, even though for now I want to screen for everything, right?

122
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:51,109
It's like a balance. So that question of like how do we kind of get kind of quick access and even within a visit,

123
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,459
the timing of when one might do that, that type of screening.

124
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,950
And yeah, and I've thought about that whole sort of transition from sort of those early

125
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,570
pediatric visits to like the preteen visits where the parent goes out of the room.

126
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:14,180
It is a great opportunity, but I think it's there's some missed opportunity there to like talk about with parents and teens.

127
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:21,290
You know what happens now? I we're making this transition for the teen to be seeing that caregiver, you know, the provider on their own.

128
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,570
It's like that's a great that was like very high school like announcement something.

129
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:41,810
Yeah so sort of like the timing of all of that is that, that I'm like, yeah, it's like a lot of like it's just, it's just it again.

130
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:53,780
Yeah. So, so yeah. Definitely screening how that happens, where that happens, policy changes to insurance.

131
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:03,560
Any other ideas? Yeah. Jackie I started with a lot of things I always think about like, where's the fun element in things?

132
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,560
Especially when working with like you think kids.

133
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:16,760
And also since I've recently been talking with parents, like a lot of things that go pay for is like experiences for their child.

134
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,129
So like if you could deliver like mental health care and like a fun experience.

135
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:29,390
All right. I feel like that would just feel more accepted and continue to reduce stigma.

136
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,240
Hmm. That's a really good, really good point. And I think I'm just scanning these.

137
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:42,260
I'm not sure that it appears here really, but maybe we wedged in here.

138
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,920
But what do we know about prevention? Right. So we know things like physical activity, you know, help boost mood.

139
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:58,100
And that has been more the focus of some like advocacy and reasoning with school

140
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,000
professionals around trying to bring physical activity back into the curriculum.

141
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,300
That's been sort of cut out in a lot of places and sort of maybe bringing it back in like

142
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,950
little bursts sometimes across the day because we know it can actually enhance mood.

143
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:19,310
And so again, like just building the argument for what is preventive and what could be fun, like having also fun.

144
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,190
Absolutely. They're kind of like your. That's right.

145
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,930
Okay. So what does child trends have to say about it, too?

146
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:38,480
So here's what they kind of are recommending for these strategies to promote child mental health during and after the COVID 1919 pandemic.

147
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,959
And so I think that, again, one of the things that we talk about a lot and we've talked about in here before,

148
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,350
is that idea of sort of connecting systems and coordinating care for kids and families.

149
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,710
So there's lots of different potential places we could get care.

150
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,299
It's not well coordinated oftentimes.

151
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,530
And, you know, particularly in mental health care because the availability is so low.

152
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,049
And so if you have a child in crisis, there is there are limited beds, for example,

153
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,700
in hospitals that so kids and families end up waiting for a long time.

154
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:27,830
And if you're really in an acute mental health care crisis, like that's not okay because kids need to be cared for.

155
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:38,810
The other thing that we. So this is kind of also around like the funding piece, the very big picture, increasing workforce capacity.

156
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,210
That's really important. And again, sort of thinking a little bit outside the box like not everybody's going to go and like

157
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,150
get their Ph.D. in clinical psychology and be a therapist in that sort of pathway.

158
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,350
But there's lots of other ways to sort of do mental health promotion and prevention of risk factors.

159
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:03,350
And so I think this is an important piece and then this idea of innovative technology to increase access.

160
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,820
So we've definitely seen, you know, mobile mental health apps during COVID and even before COVID really take off.

161
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,219
So that sort of is certainly a place where there's a lot of like exciting stuff happening.

162
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,770
I would say, like the jury's still out. Like we don't know everything that we may that we certainly do want to know about how this would work.

163
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,830
But it's it's certainly an important like space to understand in terms of mental health.

164
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:38,570
So and then of course, this, which is something we talk about all the time and linking that to like linking social determinants,

165
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:45,800
ACS, etc. to mental health. Again, for those of us who've been sitting in this class, it might be one of those things like,

166
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,310
well, no, duh, of course, but not everybody thinks that way, believe it or not.

167
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,080
So it's always important to kind of make that make that linkage.

168
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,790
Okay.

169
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,760
So the other things to think about in terms of just, you know, talking with policymakers or advocates or schools, we make work with our programs.

170
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,879
What are the costs like? Why do we care about this? Why is this such a big deal? You know, kids are sad.

171
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,970
Kids are, you know, feeling depressed. Kids are having anxiety. Kids are, you know, having aggression and behavior management problems.

172
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:22,670
Like, why is that important, you know, if you don't necessarily keep your focus on the kid?

173
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,750
But what we know is that kids who were having this experience have reduced educational achievement.

174
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,940
I think that back again to the economists and say like, gosh, if there's reduced educational achievement,

175
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,400
this country is going to be in crisis because we need to have educational achievement for productive, wealthy workers.

176
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,549
We know that it increases stress. We know that there is stigma around this.

177
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,790
We know the ultimate costs of suicide, substance abuse.

178
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,910
There can also be harm to others.

179
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:00,200
Yeah, both direct physical harm, but also just emotional harm to families and peers and disrupted family functioning.

180
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,270
And then this is sort of like that, that argument.

181
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:13,430
So we will have lost productivity if we have big, ongoing, untreated mental health difficulties in kids of youth.

182
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,160
And it will provide it will increase health care burdens on society.

183
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,810
And the other that Patel reading about there is this whole movement like probably,

184
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,060
I don't know, like the early twenties maybe, but it was just no health without mental health.

185
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,160
And again, those of us who have like existed in the mental health space for a long time are again like,

186
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,449
Yeah, but this is sort of again, kind of like aces.

187
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:50,000
It was sort of a news and it was a new perspective on like the importance of mental health for physical well-being and vice versa.

188
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:57,230
So those are just sort of big picture points as well and they're really redundant myself,

189
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,920
but that sort of phrase really kind of I don't know if people have heard that phrase or if that's

190
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,610
something that is like not under discussion at the moment because it's maybe so accepted.

191
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,609
That's kind of what I think.

192
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:17,420
But anyway, this was sort of a new thing a number of years ago that seemed always a little puzzling to me that it was new.

193
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:32,200
Okay. So I wanted to also just. Review a little bit and see if anybody had like questions clarifications around the developmental stuff because.

194
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:42,240
I think it's important to just kind of remember like this is why training is important and sort of developmental training.

195
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,270
And when we're talking about and with kids around feelings and emotions and mental health,

196
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:56,340
you know, given what you guys know about how kids are, that can be particularly difficult.

197
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:04,530
You know, on the one hand, kids may have less stigma around sharing feelings of sadness or worry, that kind of thing.

198
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:13,080
But what's really important here is figuring out like how kind of permanent or not permanent,

199
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:22,680
but like how risky those feelings are and how much harm the child would be experiencing if these feelings were to sort of stick.

200
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,360
It's this issue I think is really critical and it relates to insurance and it relates to ability to diagnose and it relates to medication.

201
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,980
So it's really important just to sort of sit with for a minute.

202
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,899
It also relates to how and where we've talked a little bit about where we could do screenings,

203
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:54,690
we could do treatments and school based mental health clinics, but who should be doing those treatments and what your responsibility is for how much

204
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,629
you need to know in order to work with kids who are at risk for mental health concerns.

205
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,630
So I don't know if anybody had questions on that or comments or thoughts.

206
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,410
Like this is an example of why screening is hard. Like brief screening questions.

207
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,780
Because if you ask a kid so that this is one of these examples I was talking about in the mini lecture,

208
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,300
which is like how you might assess depression symptoms in a young kid.

209
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,929
And when I say young kid, this is for like kids can do this this evaluation,

210
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:38,020
like for a sort of early school age kid of eight, but not with a preschooler.

211
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:45,940
So it says, you know, this is like in the investigate in the assessor's head, you talk to these kids and ask about like, how many times are you sad?

212
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,590
Are you always sad? You know, how many situations are you sad in?

213
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,790
So like in kid language? And then what you're sort of trying to figure out is, you know, what's sad?

214
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,860
It says to comparisons should be made enjoyment compared to that of peers,

215
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:11,500
which implies like the child has to kind of know what the peers are enjoying, but like the level of sadness they have compared to peers,

216
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,429
which is like perspective, taking up others minds,

217
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:21,580
like lots of different developmental capacities need to be present for the child to be able to like say this.

218
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,320
And then it says the second is not possible in episodes of long duration.

219
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:35,770
Both that's more about suicidality, but basically severity is determined by the number of activities which are

220
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,300
less enjoyable to the child and the by the degree of loss of ability to enjoy.

221
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:48,960
And then it says, do not confuse with lack of opportunity to do things which mean that which may be due to excessive parental restrictions.

222
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:55,780
So basically this is like about one symptom of depression, which is it's not actually sadness.

223
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,560
It's called anhedonia, which is like loss of joy in things.

224
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:09,730
And if you think about it, actually, per your comment about joy, like assessing a kid's lack of joy in something is like a really hard thing to do,

225
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,540
especially if you don't know the kid, especially if you don't have that much time with the kid.

226
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,990
And especially here, it's saying like, don't confuse this with parental restriction.

227
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,950
So it's like, how, how how do you assess that? That's really, really tough thing to do.

228
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,120
And so I'd just like to pause on these kind of measures because it's it's a little

229
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,690
bit easier said than done to say like get developmental training to lots of people.

230
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,040
Because then when you're sitting down with a kid, if you are in that condition and you have to make that call,

231
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:46,109
kind of like what we're talking about last week about being a mandated reporter. It's nuanced, right?

232
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:52,709
And there's a lot going on. So I don't have people have questions,

233
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,780
but I'd like to kind of go through that in a little bit of detail because it is

234
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,200
sort of highlights the difficulty of is this kind of kid having a tough day,

235
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,940
are they having a tough week? Are their parents getting divorced? What's happening in the context that could be leading to these behaviors?

236
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,590
How long term is that? What do we need to do to put this kid on medication?

237
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,910
So like all of this decision making you're trying to do around this little entity that like,

238
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,250
isn't that good about giving, you know, reliable information?

239
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:35,190
They may not understand what's happening, etc.? It's also a case like I just I always hear because it's really hard to disentangle the

240
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:41,040
child's behaviors and mental states from kind of what's going on in their family,

241
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,359
especially when they're younger, which again hopefully will seem really obvious to you guys.

242
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,100
But I think that that's part of being sort of informed about early childhood development in particular,

243
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,530
is knowing how important it is to assess that family context, not just the individual child.

244
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:03,000
Um. Okay. Um, other.

245
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,380
Okay. Um, I forgot what else I was going to say about that.

246
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm not sure. Um, today I think I talked about medication stuff a little bit.

247
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:26,459
I did. Um, I would say there are a lot of these, like, medication controversies that are still going on in terms of how we treat children.

248
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,250
And that's another place where this becomes really important.

249
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:42,430
Um, so just, we don't want to not medicate kids who really need it, who are like exhibiting really, really problematic symptoms that are severe.

250
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,800
They're sort of really at the extreme for what we see and give their age.

251
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:56,159
But we also want to be really cautious because we know that these medications work because they're powerful and psychoactive medications.

252
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,460
And so it is a kind of a big decision for thinking about how to manage young children.

253
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:13,170
Okay. So thinking about slightly older children, we know also that.

254
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:21,420
So we know that depression is the biggest predictor of depression and access to environment because predictors of suicide.

255
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,500
Um, and we know, so this is from 2015, but we know that rates have really increased with COVID.

256
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,340
So this is an important issue.

257
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,830
We also know like this sort of starts at age 12, just this data set.

258
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:45,330
But we know that suicide and suicidality and suicide attempts and suicide have increased among younger kids.

259
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:56,410
For lots of reasons you can delve into. But that's just sort of important to keep in mind, is that this is only starting at age 12.

260
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,650
So what do people notice about this set of data?

261
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,840
This is pretty common. I mean.

262
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,490
Observations. I've.

263
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,500
Yeah. So we see this big gender difference, right?

264
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:33,230
And remember, like our early puberty conversation too, and sort of all the risks that that can confer both biological and then sort of societal,

265
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,180
that sort of a context to think about what that that difference as well.

266
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,600
Yeah. And Gracie and then Carly or or did you have.

267
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:53,120
Okay. Sorry. Um, looking at ages, there's a really big difference between 14 and 15, and that's kind of when you're entering high school.

268
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,770
So I know, um, some school districts keep you in middle school in ninth grade,

269
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,090
but a lot of them, you're mixed in with the ten through 12th graders at 14.

270
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,970
And especially with the early puberty aspect, like comparing yourself to those older kids,

271
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,020
maybe getting bullied by those older kids could definitely increase that rate, especially I can see it among females as well.

272
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,080
So probably contributes there. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.

273
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,190
Getting into like substance use and other things that you're getting exposed to as

274
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,590
a ninth grader if you're in a nine through 12 versus in a different arrangement.

275
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,839
Right. So that's like a big kind of social context decision.

276
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:40,639
Like what type of school district are you in now? There's more middle schools compared to junior high school, only seven and eight.

277
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,070
So it's up that younger side, too. Absolutely. Other thoughts?

278
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,640
Yeah, that's. It's interesting.

279
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,210
Just. Between black and white students.

280
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:03,750
Just in time to the associations that has, you know, lifestyle and socioeconomic status in all that.

281
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,810
Yeah, it's interesting to see this. It's like big of a gap.

282
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,380
And it's. You know why?

283
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:23,390
What do we think might be going on? Yeah.

284
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:33,440
I mean, I think that there's probably a higher likelihood. Over screening their kids for depression versus like they're I know they're can like.

285
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,680
Racial stigma around getting help for mental illness.

286
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,640
So. That could certainly be kind of what's the what's this?

287
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:51,660
Because this is a downward flip. And what we tend to think about and see in terms of thinking about these sort of stressors.

288
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:59,180
Yeah, absolutely. I remember that there's quite a few studies that kind of talk about how fly children,

289
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,430
especially young children, are misdiagnosed with like things like anger issues and dislike of.

290
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,680
Or something. Instead of addressing, you know, like problems at home or just like, you know, maybe a school with learning disabilities.

291
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,680
So there's a lot of misdiagnosis. A lot of that. Absolutely.

292
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:26,730
Absolutely. So I think all of those things that, like, come to, you know, bring you bring to bear on other issues are playing out here as well.

293
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:41,460
Yeah, these are interviews and I think with kids and parents, but I could be wrong, but I think it's directly with kids.

294
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,370
So it's interesting. But yeah.

295
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:52,650
And if your community has stigma around mental health, you know, I don't know what items, you know, led to exactly this survey,

296
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:59,940
but our work, we're on this survey, but you may not feel comfortable endorsing those items, for example.

297
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:07,740
So there's no survey data can only tell us so much, but it's important to collect for sure.

298
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:22,889
Um, so here, okay, there's the puberty point, and I think that this puberty piece plays out here,

299
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,959
maybe in biology and then certainly in the school context, I think this is really important.

300
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:36,420
And so if I were thinking about prevention, I would certainly want to go in this direction in terms of how do we prevent,

301
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:43,170
you know, mental health concerns earlier on.

302
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:53,249
One thing that we have talked about, well, the literature has talked about quite a bit is the cognitive styles.

303
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,649
So I think I talked about a little bit in the lecture around like thinking patterns.

304
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,700
And so if people are familiar with cognitive behavioral therapy, it's used in lots of different settings.

305
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,820
Now there's like text based cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT,

306
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,410
and that's very focused on sort of shifting the way that you interpret the surrounding

307
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,950
environment and things that happen in the world and things that happen to you.

308
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:28,739
So there's been a lot of literature on like males and females and how they embrace different cognitive styles of thinking, for example.

309
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:38,250
And so females again in this literature are sort of taking on a more, you know, self-blame kind of cognitive style.

310
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:49,799
And we think that that is a contributor to some endorsement of depression symptoms, for example, and mental health functioning.

311
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:59,730
Sometimes I think that CBT is one of those kind of people possibly heard of and probably heard of it.

312
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:08,190
It's like a behemoth in the field just because it's got so many studies of it and it's evidence based and it can be really effective.

313
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:15,540
But I think it is always really important to do a little cautionary note because CBT is is great,

314
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,519
but it is very individual and it's very focused on sort of like how can I reshape my

315
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,990
thinking so that I'm not overinterpreting these events that may be random in the world,

316
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:32,760
but I'm interpreting them as, you know, bad to me, basically gross oversimplification of CBT.

317
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,680
And I just want to say that what we talk about and hear so much are all these contextual factors,

318
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:46,950
and that is a little bit of a concern with some of the way that CBT has been like recommended to everybody at times,

319
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:56,610
because we don't think in terms of how our like contexts might also be shaping how we're interpreting events in our own individual cognition.

320
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:02,699
So now there's lots of offshoots of CBT like trauma informed CBT and like I mentioned, text based CBT.

321
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,430
So it's evolving, but I just wanted to keep that cognitive styles note in there.

322
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:29,130
Okay. So here's the other thing, is that what we know in terms of suicide and this breaks it into suicide attempts and actual suicide deaths.

323
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,370
This gray line is females. So suicide attempts in females.

324
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,620
This is deaths in females. And then this is males, this black line here and then deaths of males.

325
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,700
So when you guys see that, um.

326
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,400
What do you guys think? Comments.

327
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:05,790
Yeah, I remember. One of my classes in undergrad, we talked about this similarly.

328
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,599
I think it's sort of the article.

329
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,979
It's about how females are more likely to use a more meaningful method if they are going

330
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,500
to have the time to take their lives so that even though their weight might be less,

331
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,850
they are often more successful. Just they're more liberal can use firearms.

332
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,070
I believe that females are. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:37,820
That kind of explains a lot of this. Oh, yeah.

334
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,160
So yeah. And look at like, just sort of I think that's what this comment about like rates are higher thing.

335
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,000
So if you look at that age band too,

336
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:59,420
like really rise in 10 to 14 year olds and that's what we've unfortunately seen more of now is like actual suicide among 10 to 14 year old age groups.

337
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,460
But that's attempted is really, really high.

338
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,090
And so, you know, different, you know, people write about this in different ways,

339
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:17,360
but it's certainly the case that females use much less lethal means typically,

340
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:28,159
and I would say historically, because it's kind of changing and that females, you know, do things like take pills.

341
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,760
And people have said like, maybe that's a cry for help.

342
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,319
Um, you know, there's, there's interesting ways to kind of interpret some of this,

343
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,030
but it's certainly the case that firearms, you know, play a large role.

344
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:48,170
And again, I think we're right at the beginning of the course, we looked at some of those recent studies that have just shown,

345
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,210
you know, increase that firearms are now the leading cause of death among youth.

346
00:39:53,810 --> 00:40:01,040
And this is certainly, you know, coupled with mental health crises, we can see why that is, I think, generally.

347
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,050
And here's just one more on gun ownership and youth suicide.

348
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:17,050
And so there's a pretty strong correlation there. Like you don't see lots of correlations like this in our social and public health science, really.

349
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,440
That's a really, really strong and.

350
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:33,770
You know, and like I've said, often there's a lot of firearms research and firearms injury prevention research going on in this university.

351
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:43,159
And so I think we will hopefully be able to like, you know, flatten that line a little bit because I think people we also know gun ownership,

352
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,170
firearm ownership has gone up during COVID and continues to go up.

353
00:40:48,950 --> 00:41:01,940
And so like this ownership, I think it's just going to continue to go up in this country or at least be stable at the very, very high rate that it is.

354
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:11,480
But if we can kind of, you know, flatten the line here, then that would mean even if people are owning Gunn's,

355
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:17,750
the suicide rate is less coupled to whether people are owning guns.

356
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:28,170
So I don't know if people have. Thoughts around this one.

357
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,040
I think I had located where in Michigan? I think Michigan's like right in the middle.

358
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:40,060
But those are sort of numbers in Michigan. Any thoughts?

359
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,930
Do you think we would look at this and maybe implement?

360
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,280
Like Libya. What kind of regulations? Oh, yeah.

361
00:41:52,310 --> 00:42:00,230
That's a good way to think about these data. So these are New York, California, Connecticut, Hawaii.

362
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:12,140
I think that's kind of a less. Tightly coupled association is a great point to analyze those policies by state government.

363
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:20,640
I think think about Michigan and I guess a lot of the states that are the left side thinking about like rural

364
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,950
land areas they have because those areas may be more likely to own firearms and have their children be more,

365
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:36,299
I guess, involved with them. And like in Michigan, I think we have a pretty good mix of more like urban areas, more rural areas.

366
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:46,860
But a lot of those like Western states and like West Virginia, Wyoming, are up high gun ownership, high suicide.

367
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:53,730
And that I'm thinking that might be coupled so kind of going off of what me guess I'd like seeing what those states under the line are doing.

368
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:02,910
It might just be the population and like the makeup of their states and things like that, not necessarily regulation, although it could be.

369
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,010
Also it could be.

370
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:11,459
And it also when we're thinking about we were saying mainly sort of mental health stigma and support and availability in rural environments.

371
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,260
And we have seen this sort of increase of suicide in rural settings.

372
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:24,769
Um. You know, and I agree, there's definitely highest kind of gun ownership rates here.

373
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,640
And this is like I'm trying to I'm like trying to find Michigan. I don't know.

374
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,960
I think we might be like right here. That's why I pulled that out.

375
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,460
But this is like Montana, Wyoming, Idaho.

376
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,280
West Virginia's under the line over here. I think this is Mississippi, Alabama.

377
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:52,250
So of interesting that Georgia kind of clustering the southern states have somewhat of a less you know strong association just interesting.

378
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:06,230
Um and yeah people within the country feel more like maybe like they have less of an ability to have more opportunities to be.

379
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,800
I have heard that like in an area, areas just like super isolated.

380
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,570
It's hard to like leverage yourself out of that community.

381
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:22,840
So, I don't know, maybe these kids are like, I'm stuck here.

382
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,170
Where are my opportunities as my town is kind of like I'm stuck.

383
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:38,400
I have one school that I go to. It's kind of a desperate situation.

384
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:48,730
Yeah. Yeah, we know so much about how like opportunities have left rural environments and rural health in so many ways.

385
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,040
It's really declined and has a lack of opportunity for youth.

386
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,100
Yeah, it's interesting too, like looking at well, I only know like California, New York,

387
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:06,890
but like thinking about the population in California, like Los Angeles alone, like that population is like higher than like some states.

388
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,970
And so you think you think that like there would be a higher just based on like population,

389
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,160
like percentage, there would be a higher gun ownership percentage.

390
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,440
So it's interesting to see that difference.

391
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,939
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know.

392
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:32,120
And again, this is from the, you know, behavioral risk factor survey. So I'm sure lots of us have seen lots of data from this survey before.

393
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:46,070
It's all self report. Right. So it's reporting like, yes, I own a firearm and I, I would just as you're talking, I'm like, I don't know.

394
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,240
It would be interesting to know kind of the nature of firearm like acquisition and

395
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,330
ownership and the motivations for firearm ownership and certainly things like training.

396
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,910
And are you a sportsman and are you getting you know, are you in a, you know,

397
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:12,020
culture that's not very accustomed to using firearms and very, um, laid out training procedures, etc. for certain areas?

398
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,840
Yeah. I think a good way to kind of address those type of concerns with,

399
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,929
to compare this graph to another set of years or like a time where maybe like gun laws

400
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,290
were a little bit different and compare those rates and compare them to how they are.

401
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:38,830
Again like compared to would suicide so just years and has lots of change and I believe it's doable.

402
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:46,150
But yeah, I think that would be a good way to look at. Yeah.

403
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,750
And this is also pre-COVID a little bit.

404
00:46:51,900 --> 00:47:00,020
So looking at kind of disassociation, even in this very specific post-COVID era, like overlaying those would be interesting.

405
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:13,960
Other thoughts? I mean, when we think about interventions and strategies for intervention, what do people think?

406
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:22,510
In the space. Keep an eye on the shipping channel.

407
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:29,549
I'm just looking for, like, all the states that are, um, more rural and out west, like Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota.

408
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:37,230
I think that South Dakota, um, hunting is really big there and like, guns seem to be a big sense of, like, pride.

409
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,790
I used to live in Montana and everyone, like, they would just be hanging on their walls and be like,

410
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,149
look at these cool, beautiful guns that I get to own.

411
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,190
And they're like sitting around everywhere.

412
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:53,550
And because I have a lot more access to them and for them, I have, like, their own guns because they go out hunting.

413
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,090
Sure. Um, so, I don't know.

414
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,750
That's like a hard thing to try and address because I think that's very cultural, like.

415
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,000
No, keep it locked away. And they're like, oh, they're like a cool artifact.

416
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,070
We spend a lot of money on it. We can show them off.

417
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:15,420
So I think trying to balance that with like really stressing the danger of like will get into the hands of children

418
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:22,830
and maybe they can still display them but like need to be storing bullets separately and locking them appropriately.

419
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:29,280
Stuff like that. Yeah. And that was a really, really like you said, it's a really hard issue.

420
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:37,530
And I think the overlay and I think there's two so this is youth suicide as we're looking at it in terms of the outcome.

421
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,790
And then there's also among littler kids unintentional injury with firearms.

422
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:52,170
And I think thinking develop mentally you really want to have different strategies to kind of engage families around those home safety procedures.

423
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:59,010
But I think in order to talk about youth suicide prevention, you have to also need to talk about sort of mental health.

424
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,220
Right. And that's hard. And so there's that extra overlay.

425
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,799
If you recall when we were talking about like little preschoolers and toddlers

426
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,670
getting into like grandma's medical medicine cabinet and cannabis and all that.

427
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,760
So that's and when we watch the gun video,

428
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,770
like that's kind of a whole different set of messaging you might want to think about for parents of younger kids.

429
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,380
And of course, people can have kids of all ages at home.

430
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:36,030
Um, and so from a policy level, you know, the red flag was certainly are also really relevant here in terms of just if people have had,

431
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,430
you know, a positive mental health screening like screen positive for depression and,

432
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:49,020
you know, their guns in the home, that is when you could kick in some action to remove guns from the home or advise

433
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,400
the person who is living with that individual to remove bands from the home.

434
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,820
So there's lots of. Strategies we could think about.

435
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:06,860
But I think it's challenging because of all of, you know, high rates of gun ownership, you know, lots of culture around guns.

436
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:11,000
And I don't think those are going away.

437
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:19,340
And so we need to think about how to kind of like work within this as well as implement policies to kind of like you had noted,

438
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,870
make it make the gun environment and environment different.

439
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:29,720
But also know that this is a really, really challenging one for for this country.

440
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,980
And it's hard because, you know, people compared to other countries, it's like comparing our child care environment to Norway.

441
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:49,160
Really different setting in other countries. Right. And we are very particular and these certain characteristics are just very unlike other countries.

442
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,060
Other thoughts, any other form of closing for. Okay.

443
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:03,600
Oh, yeah. I was just thinking about we had a meeting a couple weeks ago I think where I guess the,

444
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,429
the other person read the article, the person they were talking to in the past get you to come.

445
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:14,900
I really got into that space because she, her child had picked up a friend and somebody to pick up.

446
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,889
Oh, yeah. I'm thinking also about, like, how she talked to him about it.

447
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:23,450
But how do we talk about other people who may not have children, may not be in the family,

448
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:29,990
but who still need to have like a good idea of how to keep their firearm safe if they're around that kind of thing for them.

449
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:36,290
Mm hmm. Absolutely. So there are.

450
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,920
And I. Full disclosure, I'm too. I'm in the middle of writing a proposal about, like, parenting in our homes right now, so it's like, on my mind.

451
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,989
But there are some really interesting initiatives around this, other people issues.

452
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:53,980
So we talked about at some point like it's like around playdates, right?

453
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,110
Like you're the parent of a young child. There's a recommendation actually, and I don't know if people have heard of this yet,

454
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:06,589
but, you know, from like different firearm prevention groups for pediatric offices,

455
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:13,820
you're supposed to like if your child's going on a playdate, talk to the other parent about like, are you going to be home?

456
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,740
Are you going to let them watch TV in screen time? Are you going to have fruit snacks?

457
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,299
Oh, and do you have a firearm in the house? Is it locked up in the bullets stored appropriately?

458
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,960
Like that's a super awkward conversation to have.

459
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:34,219
And so there are people who have been working on like making that a more have a ball conversation I guess between parents.

460
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:41,990
And so like I remember as a parent myself of like a kid who was going to first go to someone else's house for the playdate.

461
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:49,639
And I think at one point I did ask, you know, the firearm question because I was like, Alison, you can do this.

462
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,800
You're like, oh, you got to do this, too.

463
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:58,399
And it was really, really hard and it was super embarrassing and like sort of shameful and odd and a strange interaction.

464
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,680
And I think that was the only way with that family. But like, I don't know.

465
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,240
I don't know. Totally possible. But it was one of those things where you're like, Oh my gosh,

466
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:16,600
our public health people are just like recommending all these things that are like super, super hard to do.

467
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,440
And so I think it's this question of like, how do we make this easier to do?

468
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:28,340
And, you know, some of the recommendations are like like we think we do a lot of health communication things,

469
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,510
right, where we're maybe all going to go see family members in a week.

470
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:39,740
And they may not all be like super aligned with all of the beliefs that we hold about lots of different things.

471
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:44,540
And so we think about in health communication like one strategies say, oh, you know what,

472
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,609
I heard this on TV, like I heard this report and that it like, what do you think?

473
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,870
You know, I heard we're supposed to now ask about firearms in the home.

474
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:58,939
I thought it was a little weird, but I don't know. Do you have firearms in the home? You know, sort of a lessening of this.

475
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,640
Like, I'm a really wonky, you know, child psychologist, public health person.

476
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:09,110
Like, I need to know. But that's probably not, you know, going to build parental relationships.

477
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,640
So I think it's a really you know, it's critically important.

478
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,549
I think we don't know how to deal with as well.

479
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:24,710
And I think that, again, coming up with strategies to kind of manage a lot of those situations, this is important, isn't it?

480
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:33,230
It's an important goal. So if anybody else has ideas, you know, some of my way with this project gets funded, I'll reach back out.

481
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:43,969
We will see. Okay. So I wanted to kind of switching over from talking about firearms,

482
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,630
but still relevant to mental health that we kind of didn't get to the other week, but was the social media stuff.

483
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,880
And so you guys may, may or may.

484
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,480
Now read or may not remember, but this article about have smartphones destroyed a generation?

485
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:10,540
I kind of I like it because it's a little bit it's like a little bit dated in an interesting way, I think, because it's very,

486
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:17,680
like, alarmist and it's very much, you know, some people in this room may have been born between 1995 and 2012.

487
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,049
This generation is growing up with smartphones,

488
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:24,790
have an Instagram account before they start high school and do not remember a time before the Internet.

489
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:31,600
And so, like that could describe some you know, some of us the arrival of a smartphone is radically changed.

490
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,839
Every aspect of teenagers lives from the nature of their social interactions.

491
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:41,079
And this is where she talks about like, people aren't dating as much, people aren't drinking as much, people are getting pregnant.

492
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:49,900
Less like all of these things that have been sort of these problem behaviors actually have declined over time.

493
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:55,440
But she's sort of also saying like the smartphone is sort of the reason for their decline.

494
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,760
And this is also, of course, before COVID.

495
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:05,480
All screen activities are linked to less happiness and all non screen activities are linked to more happiness, which I like.

496
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,740
Like this is like very ridiculously provocative quote.

497
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:22,720
And so thinking about sort of social media interface with mental health in lots of different ways, I would say positive and negative.

498
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:30,790
What do you guys what do you guys think of some of these quotes and or just like reflections on on some of these?

499
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:38,380
I mean, I think this one is probably there's some truth to it and there's some truth to it.

500
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,630
Like, what's your response?

501
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,770
Yeah, I think that I wouldn't agree with this just because I think.

502
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:55,329
Like smartphones are often used as a scapegoat as. All the kids are all sad and depressed and stuff like that,

503
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:04,180
but it's actually it's more of a symptom and it's not looking at the contextual factors of social isolation and lack of opportunities and just.

504
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,850
You know, our society in general. Just how much you know.

505
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:21,630
Like it doesn't support children, it doesn't foster an environment for them, but that's the built environment or the actual environment.

506
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,690
So I like make these social connections and wants to drive this thing.

507
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:35,329
So I just feel like it's often. Pointing to social media and saying all street activities are made for less happiness.

508
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,799
But I think there are some ingredients in this that a lot of people like to do,

509
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,459
and it makes people being able to connect to friends that they've never seen.

510
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,870
And, you know, I'm saying if they've moved away, maybe they have old friends.

511
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,740
So I just think that it's good.

512
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,230
That's good. Sounds like a symptom of our fracturing society and some part of society.

513
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,949
And I think it really depends on how you look at it.

514
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:03,430
But I do see that there are a lot of benefits.

515
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:11,700
I. I was like, straight up say yes to that question because like.

516
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,309
As kids, as kids are. Those younger kids have smartphones.

517
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:21,260
They have also had access to a bunch of things that you as a parent have no control over.

518
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:27,559
And secondly, there's certain things that like, you know, you don't know how to deal with them once you're exposed to them.

519
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,100
And there's like a certain age that you dating and drinking and stuff, right?

520
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,430
Those are things that, you know, pre smartphone generation.

521
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,299
It's like once you got to that age group, right, and you were in that environment, that's when you weren't.

522
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,520
And by that time you would kind of think that, oh, you're like developmentally, like ready or like understand context.

523
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,129
And I think with phones it also has to do with like our brains function and the word systems.

524
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:55,160
It's like there's like instant reward. And I was like, well, like when you go out and things aren't instantly rewarding,

525
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,990
you don't know how to function and you have to like wait a little bit longer.

526
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,290
And things like, no, on Amazon it's like 2 seconds.

527
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:10,189
Like I didn't think about whether I needed it shows up at my door and I'm like, and when I go off, I have a something to think about it.

528
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:15,050
I would have thought about it. But like you anyways, I think, I think like yes and no.

529
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:22,069
I think there's a lot of stuff that you really can't control what your child is exposed to once they have a device in my hand.

530
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:31,340
And I can say that because I was I like my parents were a lot more strict and I found a way and there's always a single thing.

531
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,090
I found a way around it. It's like I hope that like now I look back and I'm like, Well, that's kind of scary.

532
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:39,440
If I, you know, I, I know I was where you end up,

533
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,590
you get exposed to a bunch of things that you don't know how to like comprehend that age, whatever age it is.

534
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:51,530
And, and like as a parent, there's literally only so much you can control once they have their hands on a device.

535
00:59:52,010 --> 01:00:01,040
So yes or no, I love your developmental perspective because like, yeah, there's a lot there's, there's a lot to that.

536
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,960
So absolutely. It's rich context. Yeah. Caroline Yeah, I guess I agree.

537
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:16,760
I think that the like context is really important and just thinking like myself, like I was born in 1998, like what has happened in my lifetime?

538
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:25,610
Like, you know, around the age of four people born in that time frame, 95 to 10, 12, like what age we were and like the recession happened.

539
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:34,100
I mean, obviously COVID and like a lot of other stuff like historical events, it feels like that other generations haven't had that.

540
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,860
But I do think that. Social media.

541
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:42,150
Smartphones are not to blame. We are a little more aware of what's going on.

542
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:48,550
Also thinking about climate change and kind of the closeness of that if you are like a young person.

543
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,819
So yeah, I guess I grew up on like I don't think they're necessarily to blame.

544
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:59,380
I think they can sometimes be part of the solution and part of the problem.

545
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:07,680
But I do think it's just like an overall like. Feelings of homelessness that are not necessarily tied to smartphones.

546
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:14,490
Yeah. Yeah. There's like a modality of delivering this information about a what that has been

547
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,410
going on in our society that is like very immediate and hard to kind of screen out,

548
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,220
so to speak. Yeah, yeah. And he said, yeah.

549
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,969
So something about her like status and like I'm kind of struggling with of is like the fact that

550
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:35,910
adolescence is contracting and how these are the 18 year olds are now acting more like 15 year olds.

551
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:38,910
And 15 year olds are, I think, more like 13 year olds.

552
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:45,240
I don't know, like our today's teens are getting older to take on adult responsibilities.

553
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:52,830
That's because, like, their parents are pushing like higher education rather than like working and that they have like a lot of free time now.

554
01:01:52,830 --> 01:02:01,080
Zoe already like focusing on school and with that free time, really fun time playing on their phones like going, but it's not necessarily true.

555
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:07,350
And I reflect on my high school experience, my friends like, like since a lot of parents are pushing higher education,

556
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,079
that makes it more like competitive to get into certain schools.

557
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:15,229
And not only do you have to focus on school, we also have to focus on extracurriculars and like,

558
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:23,100
I feel like you're always, always for me in high school tapping. I want to do so like a more competitive applicant for college.

559
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:33,890
So I don't know, I guess having a job makes you an adult then I guess for kind of pushing back on that responsibility

560
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:40,020
by those other right things in those off abilities that kind of I don't feel comfortable.

561
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,669
Adult, I don't know. Right. Right. It's it reminds me of that.

562
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,730
I think I've mentioned that like one of my favorite things is like that's like what's

563
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:52,740
kindergarten readiness or like when does it get ready for school in different eras.

564
01:02:53,010 --> 01:03:00,450
Same thing with adulting, you know. And remember we looked at that, that graph of adolescence, like what is adolescence like what are adulting tasks?

565
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:04,649
And even historically, like I, I mean, I'm speaking for myself.

566
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:08,280
Like, I couldn't drive like a oxcart, you know what I mean?

567
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,429
But that used to be, like, a really important skill, and I don't have it.

568
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:18,809
And I would imagine a lot of us don't have that. So how do we kind of consider development and like meeting these developmental

569
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:24,090
milestones in a really in a really different kind of social context here?

570
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:31,520
So it's really it's fascinating. Yeah. Um, probably I don't think about how quickly this transition kind of happened.

571
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:38,340
So in early 2000, baby and I grew up outside kickball with all the neighborhood kids.

572
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,909
There's like pictures of me, like concerts in the front yard.

573
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:47,010
Like, we were always outside, never really touched a device, except on a rainy day.

574
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:52,830
We'd still be outside in the rain sometimes. And that's like when I turned 16, I got a car, started babysitting.

575
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:59,370
The kids that I was watching were glued to their devices. And I'm like, I'm not that much older than you.

576
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,590
When did this happen? So I don't know.

577
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:12,749
Like, my childhood is a unique experience for someone my age or it it really did just happen that quickly that that was not like this article.

578
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:23,160
I was like, I don't know. It's a very wide range to include in this whole thing because even if someone 21 is having that experience,

579
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:28,050
what about the 95 kids who had six years I mean, before that, yeah.

580
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,819
Like if think about like that's like the width of like a generation, you know, or half a generation or something, right?

581
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:39,629
And I just crack it up because like my daughter, who I would say is like, you know, in her in her days is pretty screen addicted.

582
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:47,580
Is that like taking care of her 11 year old cousins who are born 2012, 2011 and she's 23.

583
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,110
And she's just like, Oh, my gosh, they're so sweet protecting her, honestly.

584
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:59,149
And it's just very so it's like, where are you in your daily life?

585
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,540
What's your perspective? How do you use is super fascinating.

586
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:10,010
Oh yeah, I keep reading. I'm an 85, so I definitely resonated with that article.

587
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:18,160
But what comes to mind is like in social media and the access is like comparison,

588
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:23,480
like subconscious and conscious comparison I think is like much more increased.

589
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,010
And then also it was like distortion of reality of like we're only getting

590
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,999
bits and pieces and then there's all the topics about like filters and stuff,

591
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,180
but like also what you choose to like show and not show.

592
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:41,540
And then the pure source of like a lot of information is like it's immense.

593
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:45,800
And I think that's like a new challenge in itself.

594
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:50,480
And then also since I used to work like in marketing,

595
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:57,469
it does concern me because like especially like I observe user behaviors and then I've design around it and then like

596
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:06,700
marketing and then see how like people would buy stuff and how people would think differently and like major impacts.

597
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:13,190
And so understanding that like what you see has so like a sort of big control of your life and you don't even realize it.

598
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:18,290
It controls your behaviors and your actions, um, concerns me.

599
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:24,620
And then I also did a test on myself. I didn't, so I did not realize you could set on your own phone like limits.

600
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:30,170
You know, that's not new, right? So I did it.

601
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,610
And literally the other day I was like, Oh, [INAUDIBLE], okay, that was my 30 minutes.

602
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:40,819
I was like, So what am I going to do now? And it actually like I felt like, force me to, like, do other stuff.

603
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:45,320
And so it made me think like if you weren't watching TV, if you weren't doing that Netflix show,

604
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,930
you weren't on social media, what would you be doing right now? Oh, yeah.

605
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:58,910
And so many of our tasks that we have to do have converted to being old and be able to be done on this, which is a challenge for sure.

606
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,560
And like the yeah,

607
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:10,850
that sources I'm just writing down like sources and kind of knowledge like meta awareness of what we're getting through our different media,

608
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,970
media feeds because it's not our choice.

609
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,219
I think that has that that's like a big shift since you wrote this article, you know what I mean?

610
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:26,840
So I think that's important to keep in mind. And even little kids and even little kids who are less able to kind of cognitively be meta aware.

611
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:32,480
Yeah, one more piece of context that I think about in this,

612
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:43,820
like being on the somebody help tech side of things to they're catching on to how people become addicted and how to get people addicted to and

613
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:53,060
like they're they're catching on meaning like when we get addicted to phones or like we get addicted to it or like doing things like it's,

614
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,520
you know, strategic. It's supposed to keep you in this.

615
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:02,059
And like, the things that I've kind of learned on in like taking these classes and learning about how, like,

616
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:09,830
software development works and like what goes into that literally makes me want to go like live on a farm or not because it's like,

617
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:17,030
it's like set up that. It's like, no, you really, really have to be careful because it's so easy to get completely addicted to it.

618
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:25,129
It's like, Yeah, but it's just like, these are things that would complicate things from this perspective when you think about mental health and stuff,

619
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:31,760
because not that these factors that they're adding into what you're like, how you combat that, but it's like constantly changing.

620
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:38,389
And I think you have to keep in mind that things are constantly changing. So you have to it is it is a constant, constant changing.

621
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:47,800
And I think that go, oh no, I was just gonna say, but like this idea that like all these screens are what's,

622
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,690
you know, the problem and stuff and like if kids just get off their screens, then everything will be filmed.

623
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:59,209
They'll be out running and, you know, doing all these healthy activities. And we know that that necessarily is not true.

624
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:04,220
So we also have to make sure that like if we do, I have a question more towards off screen.

625
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,490
What are they doing outside of the screens?

626
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:12,049
You know, are they making healthy decisions or are they not only just smoking and,

627
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:18,270
you know, doing a lot of doing what is it that they were doing and or they were falling?

628
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:23,720
But, you know, kids in the nineties and early twenties, what they were doing right before the phones and now.

629
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,890
Right. So back to that, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

630
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:31,630
And I think that there's so much I think it's summer next year.

631
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:37,670
Let me just flip over to it's a complicated context, right?

632
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:41,500
It is such a complicated context. And I love the whole discussion.

633
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:48,290
But of course, we also use like as you kind of started out like we definitely use these phones for connections.

634
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:53,190
Then what will we have done in COVID? If there weren't films like, maybe we would have gone to farms.

635
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:59,920
I don't know what we could have done that instead. But you know, like it's really interesting to think about how that would have been different.

636
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,790
And also like that immediacy of news factor, it was really important,

637
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:09,040
but it probably also stressed us out a lot more, you know, like so it's just unimaginable to think about.

638
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:16,570
And of course I mentioned already, but like mobile health and I think that like some schools, you know,

639
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:25,809
I think that context piece of like when do we want to kind of have phones, when are we okay with phones have being more ubiquitous and when not.

640
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,629
And so there are some these moments where like during school,

641
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:33,940
like I would argue like that's a time when we don't want to have phones present if we at all possibly can.

642
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:41,409
And so there are some like movements around us in the sort of junior high space where developmentally like you're sort of learning phone habits and

643
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:51,100
behaviors and appropriate texting and inappropriate texting and all that stuff so that you can maybe get a sense of the power of those devices.

644
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,190
Right. And then this is like an old thing,

645
01:10:54,190 --> 01:11:00,990
but that sort of there's different there's this away for the day and then there's it's like wait till eighth for kids,

646
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:06,819
get the smartphone, like wait till eighth grade, which again for some kids that would be like impossible.

647
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:11,110
That's way late because they're like shuttling back and forth across parents and houses.

648
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:15,309
And other than what's going on, you have to have a phone. Other kids like that's totally fine, doesn't matter.

649
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:20,890
They don't need a phone till their eighth grade, you know. So all sorts of things around this piece of how to manage it and.

650
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:32,280
And then we did talk about I think we heard someone said reward seeking and like why we use these things.

651
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,609
Like our phones can be soothing our food and phones can be a nice distraction.

652
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:39,990
You know, there's lots of emotion, regulation, reasons to use phones, right.

653
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:50,590
And screen limits or time limits are helpful to sort of check ourselves when we're like, you know, 4 hours have gone by, right?

654
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:51,450
And you haven't moved.

655
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:58,290
And I'm like, when you're my age that like if you sit for 4 hours, like you really feel that you're sitting for 4 hours of not it's not pleasant,

656
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,990
but so there's a lot of things around here, child and parent factors in terms of motivation to use.

657
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:08,420
And then, you know, this, I would say this area is developing and we're learning more.

658
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:13,980
We're learning more kind of like how to manage these things. And again, like this is where I think generationally and it just.

659
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,980
That's right. And so with my daughter, it cracks me up.

660
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,209
So it's like, what could you do to, like structure their screen time use?

661
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:24,510
And she's like, well, no phones in the bedroom, this man, I'm like, Huh?

662
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:29,339
This all sounds very familiar, you know? So it's just interesting that, you know, because it's so hard.

663
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,290
It's such a hard thing to monitor.

664
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:36,209
And like you said, because you're like as soon as that sort of out of the bag gets out of the bag and kids are using it a lot.

665
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:42,480
So how do we kind of like integrate positive use strategies and reasons for phones?

666
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,480
And I would say like this we will see. We will see what else?

667
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:56,550
We mentioned this. We mentioned disparities to purpose. Sorry, this is kind of switching but around mental health care,

668
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:06,569
I think while we're almost at time but this is around like the read and response and sort of like where do we want to think about services?

669
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:12,780
And I think that mobile health and mobile mental health services like crisis text line and

670
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:18,749
some other things are really important to think about so we can all move on from this.

671
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,079
But I think these are things to think about.

672
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,629
Like this is COVID. Like kids are highly anxious.

673
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:30,180
Kids are getting all these emergencies of the world directly to them urgently and getting notifications on their phones.

674
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,579
Right? And really big things have and are happening in our world.

675
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:43,170
And so it's really hard to even as, you know, adults think about these things.

676
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,629
And so how do we think about, you know,

677
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:50,880
how to help kids think about these things and manage their feelings around them because a lot of them are unmanageable, like climate change,

678
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:57,450
like that's like a big, unmanageable, intractable, hopefully somewhat tractable,

679
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:05,609
but like the anxiety around it is very high and it's not an individual thing one can do anything about necessarily.

680
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,940
And so how do we talk to that about that with kids?

681
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,299
And so this was a piece that came out talking about school like from school counselors, basically,

682
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:22,830
because we often talk about school mental health clinics and we can read and respond about it, but it's a really important thing.

683
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,799
But these people are super overburdened. Kids are super overburdened.

684
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:32,970
So like with other things we've talked about, like that's not the solution, but it's important to support people in that role.

685
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:38,249
And so, you know, some strategies, talk to counselors,

686
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,489
get together with a friend that something maybe you could do virtually maybe in

687
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:48,030
person all these these different factors that school counselors talk about.

688
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:55,290
And then what I wanted to end on talking about is that there are some local resources that

689
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,389
have been developed like here at U of M and people are interested in these different areas.

690
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:04,830
So there's a group I'm involved with over at Social Work looking at kind of

691
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,450
systems change approaches for trauma informed schools and how do we do that?

692
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:20,339
There's the trails group that has work to put a version of CBT into schools and sort of train school health

693
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:26,700
school professionals who are not mental health professionals in delivering CBT to students who need it.

694
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,469
This is more systemic. This is more like a program that's based in a school.

695
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:37,770
So just the differences between those are helpful to think about when we're trying to be creative with, like, what do we do?

696
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:45,479
This I wanted to point out this is in psychiatry, an initiative to basically we're talking about rural lack of services.

697
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:53,910
So this is a group that is a group of psychiatrists who consult with people in rural communities who are primary care providers,

698
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:56,849
but who may not have like specialty mental health training.

699
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:06,149
So this is a good model of like a consultation model that sort of, you know, you're not sending a psychiatrist to that rural health setting,

700
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:10,090
but you're providing them the support and expertise that they might need on a consultant basis.

701
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:20,700
So I think a nice model of a way to chip away at the access problems and then, of course, like telehealth and.

702
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:30,129
Virtually delivered mental health outcomes. Mental health supports are important and these are good space, good things to know.

703
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:38,580
And I just wanted to point out that I think the state of Michigan had like a contract, got a contract with with headspace, like the meditation app.

704
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:42,760
I don't know if people have used that one, but during the pandemic and it's still available,

705
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,980
you can go and get like little meditations that are from Headspace are available for free.

706
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:57,520
Talkspace is a good one, but it's not free. And then there's just some links and resources for you guys for why I for best apps out there.

707
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:06,969
And then just the final thing is like there has been some really cool work thinking back to like that cognitive styles,

708
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:12,760
reframing what's happening to you and just sort of putting a narrative around my stress around climate change.

709
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,330
My parents are getting divorced, what's happening in my life,

710
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,979
putting a narrative around that and like sort of contextualizing it for yourself and making

711
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:26,860
your personal story can be a really powerful way to think about events that are happening.

712
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:34,479
That's sort of the basis of therapy, right? So there have been some kind of cool experiments that are taking place in schools

713
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,560
thinking about prevention and thinking about things that can change in my life,

714
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:46,600
how people can change, etc. So I just put that in there as an example of like a light touch, not free, but inexpensive,

715
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:53,200
not heavy training intervention that could be done, you know, in this developmental sensitive time in ninth graders, actually.

716
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:58,900
Okay. And like basically what it was is that they they read things from seniors that were like,

717
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:03,100
things may seem bad now, but wait until you're senior and you'll manage a lot of these problems.

718
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,980
And like, as you know, that may not always be true,

719
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:10,150
but like it was sort of that was the intervention that they sort of read these notes from each other.

720
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:17,319
Okay. And so that's that for mental health, but we'll talk about it more.

721
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:21,130
But next time we'll talk about some other issues.

722
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:26,379
But we will not meet for what's today.

723
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:31,400
Thursday will meet the Tuesday after.

724
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:35,739
I know. I'm like there's Thanksgiving. And then our next meeting.

725
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:39,879
Yeah, our next meeting will be the 29th, which is that Tuesday.

726
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:47,830
So enjoy your week. I hope that people travel that is uneventful but roughly and I'll see you guys then.

727
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:57,190
The link for the email you said. Oh yeah, let me know if you want an intro.

728
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,679
Yeah, that's cool. So with this colleague of mine who the colleague is.

729
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:09,290
Yeah, I don't know. He just mentioned that. Reach out to Chris so I can possibly email you something.

730
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,070
I appreciate it. Yeah, that would be great. That would be great.

731
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:18,460
Yeah. So I will. I will do that. Either Scott or I get kind of.

732
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:25,640
I mean. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I saw something yesterday and walking around, you know.

733
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:33,860
Thank you again. Okay. And I would like you to know the water.

734
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:45,260
Yeah. I'm not going to ride when? I'm not going to have to wait for citation.

735
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:52,549
How about you have that? Well, I do. Yeah, I think just get my interpretation and then the way I said it.

736
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:57,500
But it used to be that because I needed to have knowledge of everything else.
