2
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:11,863
In this segment we're gonna talk about
the specifics on how to estimate disease

3
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,660
frequencies in population.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,897
And in particular,

5
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:19,335
we're gonna talk about the two main
ways in which we sort of calculate and

6
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:25,060
categorize disease in populations,
that's prevalence and incidence.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,080
It start with the big question,

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,880
how are we gonna quantify
disease within the population?

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,230
There's so many different kinds of people
out there that are in their busy lives,

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,090
how would you know if they're sick?

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,445
How many people within a county or a state
or a nation actually have the disease.

12
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:46,882
The first sort of most basic way is to
figure out who has the disease right now,

13
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:50,155
and you can think about,
for instance, flu.

14
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,720
How many people right now have flu?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,408
Is the prevalence of flu in a community.

16
00:00:56,408 --> 00:01:00,730
If we wanna look at how
many people developed flu,

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,440
how many new cases of flu, we have
to sort of give it a time dimension.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,030
So how many people
developed flu this month

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,230
would be a measure of
incidence of disease.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,250
Both of these concepts can
be put on a timeline and

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,390
prevalence is this sort
of cut through time among

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,850
all the individuals in a population
to estimate who has it it right now,

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,930
and incidence is the number
of cases in a window of time.

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,040
We've put these sort of
concepts all together,

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,180
and think about disease in a population,
there's lots of different metaphors,

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,680
some people think of it as for
instance an urn.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Where there's a certain number of
cases of disease already in that urn,

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,510
incidence is actually the new
cases coming into that.

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,940
And then there's sort of a shuttle off
of individuals leaving the population

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,320
of disease that either actually
die from it or are cured from it.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
And so those main concepts make
up our view of population health.

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,590
When we map this information over time,
what we can actually start to read into

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,390
the data is what is happening in our
response to, for instance, AIDS.

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,580
When we actually looked at
the prevalence of AIDS,

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,850
the incidence of AIDS, and
the mortality of AIDS over time.

36
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,250
Let's say the last two decades,
we can see that for

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,450
instance the prevalence
of AIDS is going up.

38
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,370
And that's because there
are less people dying from AIDS.

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,640
And that prevalence is going up
because they're living longer, and

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,710
we've gotten on top of the prevention and
so the incidence of AIDS is going down.

41
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,980
This is an example of how these
basic statistics actually tell us,

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,810
are we making a difference in
terms of preventing disease and

43
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,392
preventing premature death from disease?
