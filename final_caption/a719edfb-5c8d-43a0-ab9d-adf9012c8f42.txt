1
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:13,395
We're gonna look at what happens when practitioners,

2
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:17,584
who although are not trained MI, use a little bit of it naturally.

3
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,684
What happens with their patients over time, in this case,

4
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:22,421
what happens to their patients?

5
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:26,730
Wait, if they used a little bit of MI to talk about their weight in their

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,618
encounters.

7
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,745
Specifically, we're gonna Understand the Findings of Project CHAT.

8
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:35,447
Will show that even a modest amount of MI expression,

9
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:39,575
can have positive impacts on outcomes such as body weight.

10
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:43,321
The study was done by a group at the University of north Carolina,

11
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:48,172
who was expert in rating the fidelity, of motivational interviewing counseling.

12
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:53,084
The primary goal of this study was to answer the question, what happens when

13
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:57,934
practitioners use a little bit of MI, during weight control counseling?

14
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:02,915
How does that impact the weight status of their patients over the next 3 months?

15
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,667
The study involved 40 primary care physicians,

16
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:08,355
who were told it was a study on preventive health,

17
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:11,951
not a study about motivational interviewing, and that was done.

18
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:16,654
So, it didn't stimulate them to use more MI or two in other ways bias them,

19
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:19,203
you may notice as the Hawthorne effect.

20
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:23,992
Patients were recruited from each practice based on the clinician's roster of

21
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:28,932
upcoming patients, and then they asked physicians to record those encounters.

22
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:33,198
That led to between 11 and 12 recordings for each provider,

23
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:35,726
leading to 461 audio recordings.

24
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:39,674
Then, those audio recordings were subjected to a coding system called

25
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:43,230
the motivational interviewing treatment integrity scale, or

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,285
what's abbreviated as the mighty.

27
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:49,984
This is a validated scale developed by some of the people who created

28
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:56,013
motivational interviewing, and it's been used widely to assess the fidelity of MI.

29
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,780
What's interesting was,

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,554
they were able to score each of these 461 encounters using the mighty.

31
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:07,517
And then correlate those mighty scores to weight loss over the next 3 months.

32
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:12,236
In particular, we're gonna pay attention to two outcomes today,

33
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,712
MI spirit and we're gonna look at the findings for

34
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:20,617
any reflective statements, be they simple or complex reflections.

35
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:24,761
These are called global ratings in the mighty and these are on the session level.

36
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:29,844
So, the raider who was blind to the intervention goals, is asked to score each

37
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:34,792
of these dimensions on a scale of 1-5 with one being low and 5 being high.

38
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:39,404
In this study, they created a composite variable called MI spirit.

39
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:44,674
That was the aggregate of evocation, collaboration and autonomy support.

40
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:47,510
Normally we expect your skill level to be a 4 or 5.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,705
But for this study because these are not fully trained clinicians,

42
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,410
they basically dichotomy raised it to one and above one.

43
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,571
So the MI spirit here,

44
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,237
one is you had one in all 3 of these variables if it was greater than one,

45
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:01,688
you had at least something greater than one on these 3 variables.

46
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,301
And for reflections it's simply gonna be the count,

47
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,041
enumerate how many reflections that were procession.

48
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,717
And they basically that compromised the sample into zero and one or more.

49
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:15,151
So this table is gonna take us a little bit to wade through but

50
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,703
it has two very interesting observations.

51
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,966
Let's start with 2A,

52
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:23,262
amongst patients whose provider for that encounter was scored a one for spirit,

53
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:26,502
which is the lowest score sort of the complete absence of MI.

54
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:31,186
Their weight actually increased a little bit 91.4 kg to 91.6 kg over

55
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,683
the next 3 months based on chart audit.

56
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:38,076
Alternatively, if their clinician had at least some of MI spirit,

57
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,171
remember those 3 individual global ratings.

58
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:46,163
That were combined into an aggregate spirit variable their weight went down

59
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:48,510
a little bit 95.4- 94 0 kg.

60
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,132
And the difference between those two differences a significance.

61
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:54,124
What we see is, there's a statistically significant

62
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:58,816
weight difference amongst those who had no MI spirit, versus also had at least some.

63
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:03,936
Now, amongst the patients whose providers exhibited zero reflections,

64
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,600
their weight went up a little bit 91 kg to 91.4.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,597
However, if there was at least one reflection that is not zero,

66
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:15,383
their weight went down a little bit at 93.2-92.7.

67
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,607
What do we make of this study?

68
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:22,615
Well, what it shows is a little bit of MI, is infinitely better than no MI.

69
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:27,050
Now, this doesn't necessarily show that higher MI skill is better than medium

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,655
MI skill.

71
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,911
What it shows is that any produces better outcomes than none.

72
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,239
Why do we show you this study so early on in your MI training,

73
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,715
many people as they embark on their MI journey?

74
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:42,622
Look at this as I'll never master this, this is too difficult.

75
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:46,850
I can never learn this well enough to have an impact on my patients.

76
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,733
Well, we show you this study to specifically counter those arguments.

77
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:56,183
What we wanna show you is, even if you can inject a little bit of MI spirit and

78
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:57,890
a little bit of MI practice.

79
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,839
Remember the duality of MI, there's the spirit and the technical,

80
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,847
you might improve the outcomes with your patients.

81
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:09,505
So don't necessarily define you MI expectations as mastering this and

82
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:10,901
being perfect at it,

83
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,566
but simply gradually injecting more MI into your patient encounters?

84
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:20,395
There was a repeat of the study with adolescents, and although the sample size

85
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:24,726
was a little smaller, they basically found the exact same findings.

86
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:29,760
So today, I hope we've shown that a little bit of MI, can go a long way.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,770
The biggest jump maybe from 0-1.

88
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,899
Just getting some empathy,

89
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,872
some reflections into your encounters, some autonomy support.

90
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:44,477
Even if you haven't mastered MI, still apply these skills even in small doses and

91
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:48,215
you'll probably improve your outcomes
