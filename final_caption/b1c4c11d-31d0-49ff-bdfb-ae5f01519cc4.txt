1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,940
With somebody on their computer walking into the lecture didn't tell me that it's recording now.

2
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:31,270
Yeah, just tell me if it's recording. It's a clinical virology as well.

3
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,740
Yes, I think it's this important right now.

4
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,660
OK. Awesome. Thank you so much. One time I thought it was recording and it wasn't.

5
00:00:39,660 --> 00:01:21,250
Yeah, it's good. Wonderful. We are going to get going in just a minute or two.

6
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,820
It's not a real long lecture today or Monday, but it will also leave time for you to ask questions today.

7
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,880
Today or Wednesday, the test is going to be a week from today, not as it says on the schedule.

8
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,300
OK. And I will mention that again.

9
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you ever other than Dan, my student assistant, is working on him right now what we're trying to look at questions that weren't good.

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:58,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, we're starting on viruses today.

11
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,870
How opportune in this year of corona virus? OK.

12
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,380
So if masks are optional and you guys don't mind wearing yours, I could take mine off on talking.

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,230
Does anybody mind? They're not out of the classroom. Oh, they aren't.

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:25,170
OK, then I'll keep it on. Thank you. OK, virology is isn't for people who've never taken a virology class or virology lecturer.

15
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,220
It's totally different. OK, so I wanted to go over some objectives for virology.

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:38,180
So you have to understand the differences between bacteria and viruses know like left and right.

17
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:48,560
Okay. How are viruses classified? And what's the difference between an envelope do virus and a non enveloped virus?

18
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,360
There are some very distinct differences there. How do viruses replicate?

19
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,710
They are not alive when they're outside of the cell. So how do they replicate?

20
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:07,610
And what are the steps of the virus life cycle? Then how do the viruses affect host cells?

21
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,040
Sometimes they kill them. Sometimes they don't.

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:19,190
So for the various diseases, what are the viruses due to their host cells into something on antivirals?

23
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,060
And then how do we? For me, the most important part?

24
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:33,140
How do we detect viruses in the clinical laboratories? And it has made like a hundred percent change over the last, say, 10 years.

25
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:42,560
Most laboratories don't have gone to molecular tests for detection of viruses and rarely used tissue culture anymore.

26
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,120
Tissue culture is great. It takes a long time. It's very expensive. It means you have to have extra labor in your laboratory.

27
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,750
And sometimes it won't be to use the wrong set of cells and the virus won't grow them.

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,710
If you put the specimen in another type of cells, it would grow.

29
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,960
So there are a lot of problems with with tissue culture, although for many years, that's all we have.

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,350
So what is the virus? It is an obligate intracellular parasite.

31
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:25,340
And if you want, it wants no parasite means pirate of the cells and in part in a virus in Latin means poison.

32
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,730
Well, bits analogy. You can pull on somebody else and time.

33
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,630
It is not a cellular organism. There is no cell, no organelles, no ribosomes.

34
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:43,430
It doesn't produce energy. And it is not free living when viruses are outside of cells.

35
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:53,910
They can't do anything. They can only do something when they're inside cells, so they are completely dependent upon the host cell.

36
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:01,320
So what is the virus part two viruses do not grow or divide,

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,440
they in fact a cell that either multiply in that cell but not outside of that cell or kill the cell.

38
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:20,330
They make copies of themselves using tools that the cell has enzymes and proteins encoded by the by the cells nucleic acid.

39
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:20,670
OK,

40
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:29,130
so they take over cellular metabolism and they use the machinery from the host cell to grow and actually kill the cell then or sometimes not kill it.

41
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,530
Sometimes they just live there. Next slide.

42
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:41,350
So viruses versus bacteria. Last year, I made up this chart and I thought, OK, I think this might be a little bit easier for people to remember.

43
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:47,890
So we have three columns. What characteristic are we going to talk about? What did bacteria do and what do viruses do?

44
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,770
And are they cells? Bacteria? Yes. Viruses? No. How big are they?

45
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:00,360
And while arms should be micrometres bacteria one to five microns in size?

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,760
Viruses are greater than point zero to two point two microns in size.

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,500
So much, much smaller. Do they have nucleic acid bacteria?

48
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:20,270
Have DNA and RNA viruses have either DNA or RNA, but not both.

49
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:29,840
Bacteria have a nucleus that prokaryotic cells. Viruses do not have a nucleus, nor do they have cytoplasm, ribosomes or mitochondria,

50
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:39,320
whereby bacteria have side of cytoplasm, they have ribosomes and they do, and although they do not have mitochondria either.

51
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,270
So now let's get out to the outer surface of bacteria are pretty hardy. They are really pretty hardy.

52
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:54,200
The outer surface of bacteria are rigid with with up to the glycans. Viruses have a protein cell and some viruses have a lipid envelope,

53
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,520
and that lipid envelope really is a pathogenicity factor for the virus because it makes it much more difficult to kill that virus.

54
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:11,610
Back, some bacteria model, they have larger viruses are not mobile at all.

55
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:21,330
And the replication bacteria multiply by binary fission, and I know you find that a biology class once or twice.

56
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,570
And replication of viruses is entirely host cell dependent.

57
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:36,350
So there are some very distinct differences between viruses and bacteria.

58
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:43,940
So let's talk about the sizes of viruses. So nice little chart here that I didn't make myself, I borrowed it from.

59
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,060
I don't remember a friend, I don't remember a trend.

60
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:56,900
OK, so the the scale goes from 10 to the minus two centimeters to less than one nanometer and over to atomic size.

61
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,460
And so you can see that animal cells here are about 10 to the minus five.

62
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:13,030
Bacteria about one micron, then we have viruses that are bacteria 10 to the minus six.

63
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:19,380
Viruses are 10 to the minus seven in size. Proteins are 10 to the minus nine.

64
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,990
And Adams, of course, are much smaller. So with a light microscope, you can see animal cells or human cells or bacteria.

65
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:35,010
You can certainly see fungi where the yeast or mold. You cannot see viruses with a light microscope.

66
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,270
You can see cells that have been infected and the damage being done to the cells.

67
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,400
But you cannot see the virus inside those cells because they're too small to see with a light microscope.

68
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,850
With an electron microscope microscope, you can see so much more because of the enhanced power of it.

69
00:08:50,850 --> 00:09:00,190
So if you can see animal cells, bacteria, viruses and even proteins with an electron microscope.

70
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,320
You have X, Ray, what can you see? You can see viruses in the proteins and atoms.

71
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:18,230
But generally that's not used. And then with NMR, you can see proteins and atoms, but it's too specific that it enhances too much for viruses.

72
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:25,990
So here is the basic Irish structure. And the genome is either DNA or RNA.

73
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,800
There is not a virus that has both. OK.

74
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,040
And I will tell you that the list of RNA containing viruses is much shorter than the list of DNA containing viruses.

75
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,820
OK, so you've got the virus inside the viral structure and we've got a protein shell over it.

76
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:51,760
It's called the capsid. OK. This is your basic virus structure, very, very simple.

77
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,880
So once again, I said viruses can either be envelope or not involved in what some people call them naked viruses.

78
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,360
So a little bit more about the virus capsid, that outer shell on the virus.

79
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,700
It's a it's a symbol from identical protein subunits.

80
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,180
So every segment on that capsid is equal equivalent to every other segment on that capsid.

81
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:27,430
We also have to talk about symmetry viruses. And that is, as I say, here in the geometry of a virus particle.

82
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:35,380
So if it's icosahedron, if it's spherical and if it's helical, it's rod shaped.

83
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:42,170
So here we have icosahedron over here on the right hand side and helical rod shape.

84
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:51,830
If you were to look at this, you wouldn't see all the ups and downs. You'd just see it straight across ratchet virus.

85
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:59,210
More now, more enveloped viruses. Once again, DNA or RNA, but not both.

86
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:06,740
And they had this protein shell all the capsid, and then they have an outer coat called the envelope.

87
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:15,770
You can see the well in this schematic. The envelope is the outer blue circle.

88
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:23,570
Go on in the outer coat. It's it's more about the article, it's derived from the host cell, so you get a cold.

89
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:30,620
The virus can use something from your host cells that are infected to make the the outer coat,

90
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,990
and it has a lipid bilayer and then it has viral glycoprotein.

91
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:49,590
And these can be used to help identify viruses when they're infecting a human or an animal.

92
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:56,800
So I mentioned the viral symmetry before there are different types of viral symmetry.

93
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, that suggests a lot better than it does on the screen. OK, so I close the Heathrow nucleocapsid capsid.

94
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,290
You can see the icosahedron shape here. And over here on the right hand side, we've got the nucleocapsid here with the little bumps on it.

95
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,950
And then we have a lipid bilayer and that's an envelope icosahedron.

96
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,700
So it's either just just you, a nucleocapsid or the envelope icosahedron with a lipid bilayer.

97
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:34,350
And if you go down to the lower left hand side, we have a higher level nucleocapsid, so it just widens like a like a spring.

98
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:43,620
Why is this like that? And then there's an envelope helical that has not only the nucleocapsid wound up inside of it,

99
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:51,450
but it has a lipid bilayer and then it has spikes in protein spikes called pep talks.

100
00:12:51,450 --> 00:13:00,300
OK. And these are the five basic types of viral symmetry.

101
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,100
OK, now common principles of virology.

102
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:13,830
All viruses package genomes in a part of what we've just been talking about, that that virus particle has the genome inside of it.

103
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:21,000
This ensures delivery to other hosts. So that's a nice way of saying infecting another animal or humans.

104
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,300
Virus genomes contain information needed to make a virus, help a virus make more virus when it's within cells.

105
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,340
Like I said before, once a virus is outside of a cell, it cannot replicate.

106
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:43,170
It has to be inside of a cell. All viruses establish themselves in a host population to replicate.

107
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,590
I'm saying the same thing over and over. Next slide.

108
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,120
So how do we classify viruses, I already told you that they're either DNA or RNA.

109
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,170
So the classification is based on on structuring hobbit composition.

110
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,900
So the big one is the nucleic acid,

111
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:10,620
and it can be either single stranded or a double stranded can be segmented or non segmented, can be linear or circular.

112
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,700
So those are some very abilities in the nucleic acid structures. What about the morphology of the virus?

113
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,450
Well, we've already talked about whether or not this envelope. And then we have the structure of the capsid.

114
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:34,110
And then we can classify viruses by how they replicate inside of a cell because they don't replicate outside of cells.

115
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:40,260
So here is the viral life cycle virus that attaches to cell.

116
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,740
This is a big square cell. It enters.

117
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:56,500
It penetrates the cell. And it is on coding because it can't replicate, it still has its coat on.

118
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,740
Then it affects the host functions, so the host can't get rid of it.

119
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,980
And it goes through a transcription phase to replicate nucleic material.

120
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:21,210
And then it translates into another viral particle. And you can see it's getting to get its outer shell on it right now.

121
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:34,750
And then it multiplies even more and more and more. Then the assembly is done and it leaves the cell, some viruses kill the cell when they leave.

122
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,970
Some of them leave and don't kill the cell just depends on the virus.

123
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:53,640
Boom, and there's a lot more viruses released to further enhance the infection in a person or to infect other people or other animals.

124
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,460
So let's talk about replication strategies. We're going to talk about the start with RNA viruses.

125
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,480
So RNA produces proteins, many different types of viruses, RNA viruses.

126
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,790
The RNA will produce many different types of proteins, which will then form into a virus.

127
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,450
The RNA can also make more RNA, which makes more virus proteins and more viruses.

128
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:24,480
The RNA viruses, the retroviruses as an HIV are a little bit different.

129
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,790
They go from RNA to DNA to RNA.

130
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,790
Then they start making proteins and eventually they have an entire virus made.

131
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:48,490
It's a much more complex lifecycle RNA to DNA, to RNA, to proteins, to a new virus virus particle, not a totally new virus.

132
00:16:48,490 --> 00:17:00,300
So. Let's go through the list of RNA viruses, we know the only human retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus, the HIV virus.

133
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:13,950
That's not right. There are a number of viruses that contain RNA polio virus, rhinovirus, the common cold virus, coxsackievirus, norovirus.

134
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,000
People have vomiting illness with rotavirus diarrheal causes.

135
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,410
Diarrhea illnesses.

136
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:27,210
West Nile virus, which unfortunately, we're coming into the season with West Nile, with mosquitoes, influenza and then hepatitis C.

137
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:40,810
Those are all RNA viruses. OK. So the replication virus replication strategies for DNA viruses are a little bit different.

138
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:50,140
They can delay viruses, can produce RNA and DNA. They can produce proteins and all that comes together to form a new virus when they're replicating.

139
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,330
Our DNA viruses could also become latent and hide out.

140
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,910
Prison might not know that they've been infected.

141
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,460
And then years, many years later or a few years later, however long it takes, they get ill with something else.

142
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:14,720
They might have cancer. Something affects their immunity, the person's ability and the virus can break out and cause disease.

143
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,340
Thanks, Mike. So the DNA viruses, I think they're easier to remember because I think they're more common.

144
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,430
It just seems like an easier list to remember.

145
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:31,670
Herpes simplex, virus zoster, Epstein-Barr and parvovirus, those are all grouped in the herpes virus group.

146
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:41,420
OK. But do they cause different diseases? They're different viruses. Then we have hepatitis B in the DNA viruses.

147
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,930
That a good small, good list.

148
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:53,990
So I've already said the virus can kill a cell, or sometimes it just lives there and replicates and releases more virus, but may not kill the cell.

149
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,130
So killing a vaccine in cells infected by bias?

150
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,360
Clearly, they can. They can kill the cell. They break out kill cell.

151
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:11,990
Some viruses don't have very much effect on the cell, and they'll do very little cell damage, which means they can keep growing in that cell.

152
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:18,830
The damage due to that cell is due to the host's immune response, trying to get rid of that infected cell.

153
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:25,400
And it can also, because they do little directed people will harm to the self, they can produce latent infections.

154
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,180
So a person, as I said, may not know that they were infected. And then later on, something happens, their immunity wanes and get cancer.

155
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:40,060
Then a bad bout of influenza. Something happens. And another virus can show up.

156
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:47,380
And cancer viruses also can cause cellular transformation and certainly cause cancer.

157
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:56,100
There's no question about that. So what about therapy with antiviral drugs?

158
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:05,910
Well, when we treat bacteria or fungi or yeast with an antifungal turned to bacterial as we kill herself, we kill the growing multiplying cell.

159
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,620
Since viruses do not grow or divide, antivirals can't work that way.

160
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,060
They have to do something to block a step in their replication.

161
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:22,810
So I said, before viruses make copies of themselves using tools from the from the cells that they have invaded.

162
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:30,420
OK. They can use enzymes. They can use proteins. They can affect the cell's internal machinery.

163
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,560
They can do a lot of things without finding the cell will die.

164
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:47,180
So once inside a cell, a virus in the final analysis of the virus in the cell have an intimate relationship.

165
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,660
The cell is trying to get rid of the virus and the virus is going say, Hey, I like it here, I'm not leaving.

166
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,480
And so as you can see what's with, what's written there,

167
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:04,370
the difficulty is hurting the virus and not hurting the cell and then comes in the issue of selectivity.

168
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:10,070
All antivirals. Do some damage to cells.

169
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,660
Some of it is so minor, you don't know that it's the cells are being damaged.

170
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:25,080
Some of it is major. So what potential target can you think of him to sell antiviral drugs?

171
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:32,320
Anybody want to make a guess? Well, let's go.

172
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,150
Yeah, go ahead. Obviously by the Americans, I'm sorry.

173
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:44,340
Stop staring. That's that's one way. So here we have a virus attaching.

174
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,580
And I have to tell you the schematics are not mine. I did not do these.

175
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:55,050
A friend gave them to me that the virus attached to this big square cell again, it penetrated on coats,

176
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:01,110
and then it uses the host's functions of transcription, translation and replication.

177
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,040
To assemble the Bartonella, the virus assembles and releases.

178
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:13,530
So if anything, you can do to interrupt at one step or another step or stop the replication.

179
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:21,720
So drugs interfere with viral replication have been most successful for herpes, a cycle, there is a very, very efficient way to give it a purpose.

180
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,220
The patient may have to take it for a while, but it will work assuming that they have some sort of cellular immunity because

181
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,660
it's hard to get over any infection without this cellular immunity and HIV,

182
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,930
AZT and lamivudine work very well to stop viral replication.

183
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:49,920
So there are some, some drugs that have been formulated and tested and are now on the market to really help people who are infected with HIV.

184
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,870
There are protease inhibitors, so of course, if you have a protease inhibitor,

185
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:05,220
you can't make more cells and protease inhibitors are used for HIV with then of every time there.

186
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:13,160
And then Tamiflu, which is used against influenza, prevents virus release from the cell.

187
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,640
OK, if they can't release, that's all is going to die, but it's not going to release live viral particles.

188
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,520
And then someone who's coughing or hacking or, you know, breathing on you while they have a temperature, you're not going to get sick.

189
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:43,460
So here's an exam type question. Viruses rely upon host cells for protein production as they lack which essential component.

190
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:50,900
Like, I'm sorry. Radisson Bingo.

191
00:23:50,900 --> 00:24:00,470
So now let's talk about how to get good samples to the laboratory and what we can do in the clinical virology laboratory,

192
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:07,310
and as I said with molecular testing, this is all changed dramatically in the last 10 years or so.

193
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,720
So we have different types of illnesses on the left hand side,

194
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:21,530
specimens of choice and then other specimens that might be used for bronchitis and bronchiolitis, NP swabs, washes and aspirins.

195
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:29,450
Now when I say a lumpy swab, if the person I have, I have any of you ever had an empty swab, it's not fun.

196
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:35,270
Your eyes water. You may say, Oh, it hurts, but that's a good specimen, OK?

197
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:43,310
It's not just the swab of the interior, Mary's. And the more that people come to understand that we really need to get back all the way up there,

198
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,850
get the material all the way up in the nasal pharynx.

199
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:56,600
The better test results we will have OK for colds or upper respiratory tract infections and PE swabs, washes and aspirins.

200
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:06,950
You can do throat swabs, but they aren't as good for pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract infections may not be or aspirin or tracheal aspirate.

201
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:19,760
So sticking a flexible pipette up there really aspirated material you can do washes an NP or trachea washes and bronchial alveolar large fluid also.

202
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,560
There are other specimens that are tried in pure throat swabs. They don't work as well. So this column that says others, those all don't work as well.

203
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,810
Sometimes you have to use them, though if you don't have any other options for influenza NP swabs,

204
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:40,350
washes aspect of sputum throat observations are not very good examples, so it's a rash.

205
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:51,050
An example vesicle swab. So you take a viral swab and you get under the scab and you get the the material underneath

206
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:57,780
the scale that will get you some tissue cells and that will get to the fluid also.

207
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:04,520
OK, and viral swabs are different from bacterial swabs, but generally much smaller if you can get up in the MP.

208
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:12,550
But the transport media will support viruses whereby bacterial transport medium will not support viruses.

209
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,990
But about gastroenteritis, stool specimens, there's no other way to say it.

210
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,090
You can't get a rectal swab. If the diarrhea is really bad, it'll probably work.

211
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,220
But a stool specimen will give you more specimen to work with.

212
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,690
And then with meningitis, when supplies was the big one in spinal fluid that got to do a spinal fluid, throat swabs through a metal swabs.

213
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:42,580
Yeah, they may be positive sometimes. But are you really going for critical illness like meningitis and syphilis?

214
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:49,650
You really want to get spinal fluid and have that tested.

215
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:57,090
So now this next slide shows you the different viruses and the specimen of choice and when they should be collected.

216
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:03,030
OK, so take cytomegalovirus specimen of choice, number one specimens,

217
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:12,510
urine and throat swab or watch or Buffy coat from why it's so difficult and you want to get it when the when the patient is symptomatic.

218
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:19,440
And for all of these, you want to get them when the patient is symptomatic and is early in the disease as possible,

219
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:28,280
because once the patient is out like a week or two weeks, patient may still feel horrible, but there will be many less viral particles present.

220
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:38,850
OK, so you can go through this this slide and look to see what the best specimens are and pay attention to the time of collection.

221
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,350
So with herpes simplex, we want to get that specimen within the first three days of Malaysia.

222
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:52,360
We don't want to wait a week or two weeks or anything like that. We want the specimen well, while it's still fluid and and the lesion is young.

223
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:03,250
A mumps goes out for a while, but all the rest are usually one to three days or four days for a rotavirus from stool.

224
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:10,750
Next slide. So get the swab and, you know, the MP swabs are very tiny, they're not the regular size.

225
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,810
Rather the very tiny swab put it in viral transport media do not put it in bacterial transport

226
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,660
media because it will be rejected by the laboratory has to be about transport media,

227
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:30,370
and it could be from various sites that we've already talked about, even eyes to put in viral transport media.

228
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,560
When it gets to the lab, that will be ground up and then they'll work on it that way.

229
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:45,550
Submitted when it says submit need, you don't have to put the specimen in anything else urine sterile container into the lab ASAP.

230
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,480
Same thing with sterile body fluids and blood. You'd need to put it.

231
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,610
Well, it depends on what you're looking for.

232
00:28:51,610 --> 00:29:01,350
Working for an internal virus put it in a red top to if you're looking for a cmb that the DNA virus has put it in a green top to OK.

233
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:10,030
And so you can see that some of these are just the transport media is different.

234
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:16,780
And so first, rule anything you can put it in, just get it to the laboratory value and same thing,

235
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:26,850
put it in a sterile container and get it to the laboratory and so on. So I've already mentioned viral transport media a few times.

236
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:34,650
So there are a lot of different formulations for viral transport media, most of them work almost exactly the same.

237
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,540
It's has eagles minimum essential media or Hanks balance salt solution.

238
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,890
It's one or the other. And they both work very, very well for viral transport.

239
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:52,980
They have some protein in it to protect the cells, either gelatin, bovine serum albumin or something like that.

240
00:29:52,980 --> 00:30:00,300
And it will have antibiotics to cut down on the growth of bacteria and fungi because they can.

241
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,700
If you taste it, it may. If it has to be sent to another lab to be tested, they're multiplying back to.

242
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:18,270
You may multiply every 20 minutes or so, and they can overgrowth and make your test negative storm at room temperature until used later inoculated.

243
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:25,470
Keep the viral transport media at four degrees. And don't forget to stick the patient label on there because that's an automatic rejection.

244
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,170
It comes to the lab without a patient label on it, and I know you're thinking, Why is she telling me this?

245
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:37,630
It happens. OK. How are we going to detect infection?

246
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,770
There are direct methods and indirect methods.

247
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:48,340
The direct methods are antigen detection and molecular assays, OK, because we want to test that specimen directly.

248
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,330
We don't have to go through culture, steps and incubation and everything else.

249
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,830
That's direct detection.

250
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:04,330
Antigen tests will not detect as few of organisms as well molecular tests, but some of the antigen tests are still very useful.

251
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,640
The molecular assays are like the gold star.

252
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:16,510
They are the top of the line for for testing, but there's not molecular assays for everything, and they are very expensive.

253
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,590
We could also do some viral labs. Virology labs still do culture.

254
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,450
If it's rare, I know the public health lab, some of them are still doing culture.

255
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,510
But most of the hospital labs have stopped doing viral culture because they can do molecular.

256
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,970
The tissue culture cells out. It is so expensive to do tissue culture. Do the molecular stage.

257
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:42,370
You get them done a result that day or the next day. Serology is still useful.

258
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,050
You need, as you as you might think,

259
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:51,010
you need an accurate specimen and a convalescent specimen collected at least two weeks after the initial specimen.

260
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,580
But it can be very useful, particularly for patients who are immunocompromised.

261
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:02,380
You have to prove that there is no compromise, no formation of antibodies, and then I put electron microscopy down here.

262
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:11,350
It's wonderful if you have one, I would guess that in the clinical labs in Michigan, there's less than five electron microscope.

263
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:23,490
OK, they've gone. They've pretty much fallen out of use except for research labs, because the molecular assays are so good.

264
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,530
So direct antigen detection, this is what we used to do before we in the lower classes.

265
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,180
So you can do fluorescent antibody staining and you can see an example that here specimen is

266
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,690
applied to the microscope slide it stained with a panel of different types of antibodies.

267
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:45,480
You can assess the quality of the specimen looking at a microscopically on the slide.

268
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,550
You have to have a greater than 20 km epithelial cells for flu. And so it has.

269
00:32:50,550 --> 00:33:01,560
If a patient is acutely ill with influenza, it has high sensitivity and high specificity for good quality specimens if it's a bad for disbursement.

270
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,270
There's no test in the world that will make that a good quality specimen.

271
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:13,900
And the turnaround time for this is about two hours. OK, so for those of you going into infection prevention,

272
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:21,040
I know many of you are watching when the lab calls and says that specimens never please collect another specimen.

273
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm asking you very nicely don't get mad at the laboratory. They're trying to do what's best for the patient.

274
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:35,080
Also, as the physicians and nurses, the Infection Prevention Authority, and they have no way of saying this is a live specimen, they collect it.

275
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,040
But when we look at it in the lab, on the fly, we can tell that's not a good specimen and we don't want to turn out misleading results.

276
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:51,370
So if somebody calls and says, please here to get specimen, make sure you ask what specifically, what is it that you need for this test?

277
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,890
So here's an example of fluorescent cells. The chemical in four fluid.

278
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,960
And I don't know if this is an A or B, but it's positive.

279
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:10,150
So there's also direct antigen testing you can't detect as small of numbers of a virus with antigen detection,

280
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:16,840
but in overwhelming illnesses, it works very well and it's very rapid. So this is the beauty director Jehan, and when I say the companies names,

281
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,340
I'm not putting one company ahead of another company just with the pictures that I have.

282
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,350
And this is a membrane enzyme immunoassay.

283
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:30,520
So you get the respiratory specimens, have to digest it and put it on the membrane and it can detect one or two different viruses.

284
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,510
But I can't tell you if the quality of the specimen is that is any good.

285
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:41,230
And when you talk about an enzyme assay compared to a molecular test, enzyme assays have really,

286
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:49,660
really poor sensitivity compared to a molecular test that can detect much smaller quantities of the virus.

287
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:56,650
But the turnaround time is 20 to 30 minutes, which is nice if it's positive, you know what it is, but it is also an expensive way to go.

288
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:03,330
But with insurance, it's generally not too bad.

289
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:11,160
OK, I can talk a little bit about molecular, we've talked a little bit about and let me ask you just now you can do viral

290
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,410
cultures have done a lot of viral cultures in three seven years of working,

291
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:23,130
but they are pretty much falling out of favor unless you're doing research or you have a new virus that shows up anyway.

292
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:31,410
There's no commercially available test for it. So there are different types of cell lines that were used in tissue culture.

293
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,430
So a primary cell cells are the first generation of the tissue.

294
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:42,880
So so you get a lung or spleen or a kidney, and then the animal is ground up.

295
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,640
The cells are manipulated, they're sterile. They're sent out in tubes to do viral filter.

296
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,280
And that's first line, OK, directly from the tissue taken from the animal.

297
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:05,450
An example of these are monkey kidney cells. Then we have semi continuous or diploid cell lines, and these are derived from fetal tissue,

298
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:11,550
is that is that sound, but it's from fetal tissue when the infant did not survive.

299
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:21,390
OK. The fibroblast cells and they have they go 25 to 50 generations for a passage, so if it's a slow growing virus,

300
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:28,140
that's great because if it only goes 10 passages before the cell cells start dying, it may not detect what you need to detect.

301
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:34,920
And so some of these cell lines are human embryonic kidney and human foreskin fibroblasts.

302
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,540
And then we have continuous cell lines and these are cells obtained from malignancies.

303
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,080
There are various sources you can passage them that's like subculture in cells to another,

304
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,780
to another, to another to indefinitely because their cancer cells.

305
00:36:52,780 --> 00:37:01,270
And so examples of these are HeLa and Vero and Hep 2's and those are if you really love our relatives, you probably hear those cell lines frequently.

306
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:12,250
And we have LLC Mate is an indicator of a bunch of others, but the first three of the HeLa zero and have twos are very commonly used for very, a lot.

307
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:21,290
OK. Still talking about moral culture, the primary cells are the best, but also the most expensive,

308
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:28,350
and the shelf life is short and they do support the widest range of viruses.

309
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:37,590
They are very, very expensive, and that's why most laboratories have stopped doing viral culture because it's so expensive,

310
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:45,720
if there are molecular assays that can be used and the molecular forces that are on the market now are very, very good.

311
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,630
When they first came out, some of them were a little questionable.

312
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:55,200
But the ones that are out there now are very good, and they can detect multiple viruses in the same assay.

313
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,090
They are expensive and it's not at all.

314
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:05,250
It says here, commercial supplies are often unreliable. It's not at all.

315
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,500
It happens. It does happen. Have a bad flu year. Everybody's using molecular assays.

316
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,480
Something happens at the factory. But we can't get the assay. It happens.

317
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,730
It's no one's fault. People are doing their very best, very best work that they can.

318
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:27,880
But sometimes things don't work out. And that's where you look for another lab to do the testing center to public health and so on.

319
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,680
So continuous cells are the easiest to handle because they're going to live and live and live.

320
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,120
You don't have to bring up new cells after one or two passages.

321
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,930
But the range of viruses that will grow in can in continuous cell lines is very limited.

322
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:53,010
During those viruses. So. Here we have viruses and the left hand side and cell lines on the top.

323
00:38:53,010 --> 00:39:00,840
And I'm not telling you to memorize this entire chart, OK, but you might want to look say for herpes simplex,

324
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,640
what are the best cells and you can pick out something you hear people talk about all the time.

325
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,130
What do we use for influenza?

326
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:16,260
Primary like primary monkey kidney cells are used probably about for everything except Saramago and HSV and Browder's and BTV,

327
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,080
but they're used for everything else. So we have had no virus can be detected in these.

328
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,840
If you come on down, influence is detected in primary monkey kidney may be detected in a 5:49.

329
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:37,530
That's not the best one. And that's it for for influenza virus. So they don't like to grow in tissue culture, except in primary monkey kidney.

330
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:47,950
So what am I telling you to do with this chart? Look to see what are the most commonly used cell lines.

331
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,310
I'm not telling you to memorize the entire time, and I would never say that,

332
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:57,770
but what are the most commonly used cell lines and what are they good for?

333
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:07,250
Unfortunately, we don't have the culture polio anymore with immunizations and molecular tests that's gone.

334
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:12,740
OK, we're onto the next slide, OK? Tissue culture, OK.

335
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,640
When I was in graduate school, we did tissue cultures.

336
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,160
When I went into my fellowship, my clinic, micro fellowship, they were just changing over from clinical virology to molecular biology.

337
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:33,950
And what they were doing tissue cultures. All these tubes have different cell lines, depending on the color of the top of the to.

338
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,330
The pig is different from the orange, which is different from whatever this white one.

339
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:46,220
They're all different, but they probably use three tubes of different types of cells for one specimen, and they'd be inoculated with the specimen.

340
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,470
If it's a liquid specimen, it can go right in or concentrated with concentrated in the tube.

341
00:40:51,470 --> 00:41:02,180
If it's a tissue, it needs to be ground up and then inoculated to this whole rack goes on a wheel and so that the cells are being rotated,

342
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:08,180
the tubes are being rotated and they're getting media flowing over them over fast.

343
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,160
The the the wheel is boiling, so they never dry out.

344
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,930
OK. And then when you say, OK, we have to start looking at this week's viral specimens, let's start right here.

345
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:28,430
Take a tube off. You have to lay it down because the cells are on the side on a cover slip in that tube.

346
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:35,630
OK. And you can put it on a scope that has a special ocular and it's up for reading tissue culture cells,

347
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:42,180
and you can look for changes in the cell structure that on that slide.

348
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,270
OK, if it's positive, you see that positive, we're going to take it out,

349
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:53,100
we're going to do this either DFA or some other kind of stand to demonstrate which viruses.

350
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,970
But as you can imagine, having several racks the size, it takes a long time.

351
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:06,130
It's very labor intensive. But for a long time, that's all we had. So how do we detect it in culture?

352
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,300
We look for the psychopathic effect. What does it do to the self? Is kill them?

353
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,610
Are there inclusions through the cells, balloon out and then split?

354
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:22,960
It may be specific damage. It may be nonspecific damage, but also destroy the self, as I said before.

355
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,490
So there's another test that we can do to look for a virus we can see if they human saw.

356
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:36,010
So if the mammalian red blood cells will absorb two infected cells and we can do that right on that slide.

357
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,660
And you know that we've had in the tissue culture medium with a specific slide out.

358
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:51,970
We can put red blood cells on there, let it sit for a little bit and watch not look up and look to see if they still adhere to the cells on the slide.

359
00:42:51,970 --> 00:43:00,650
And if they do, we've got absorption of red blood cells, and that is particular for certain viruses.

360
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:10,180
And then you can confirm doing a neutralization assay, human selection inhibition or immunofluorescence.

361
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:16,630
Next slide. So I copy this right out of the textbook, as you can tell.

362
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:23,230
And so it says just for an example, I had no virus likes PMQs, but not as much as enterovirus enteroviruses,

363
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:28,360
you know, for plus positive, whereby had no viruses, only two plus positive and PMK cells.

364
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:35,800
But they do better in hep twos. And then they describe the CPP's because not all can you see.

365
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,870
And as you sit there and you read slide after slide of slide or you sit in your biology class, which light up a slide,

366
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:49,720
he certainly you know which cells caused, which viruses cause destruction of the cells, which will cause ballooning of the cells and so on.

367
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:57,620
And so if you hear look here, influenza in PMK cells is destructive degeneration with swollen back related cells,

368
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:05,110
and it does take two to 10 days for that to be demonstrated. And so, as you know, people like results very rapidly.

369
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:09,280
This is great. This is very helpful, particular with new viruses.

370
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:20,260
But the molecular assays give people the results to the docks out where they're needed and people can be isolated if necessary.

371
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,950
So respiratory syncytial virus, the CFPB, since Isha, in HepG2 cells only.

372
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:32,370
And since this year, large cells.

373
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:43,790
So here is a rhinovirus, the CPE and fibroblast, and you can see these enlarged, irregular looking cells, these are all infected cells.

374
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,550
OK. What are the central tenets for virus identification?

375
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,240
What are the patient demographics? Is the patient in town?

376
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,950
Has it gone anywhere except to the grocery store? Has the patient traveled as a patient?

377
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:05,120
Been on an airplane? Is the patient have any underlying diseases? So there are a lot of things that have to be considered.

378
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,950
What is the specimen source if it is a respiratory virus?

379
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:19,050
Probably want the NP swab sputum if the patient's bringing up sputum or something from the lower respiratory tract, if necessary.

380
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,000
What type of CPE is observed if you're doing tissue culture,

381
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,970
the type of CPE will often help you decide what virus it is because I see the types of different along with the CPE.

382
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:40,590
What cell types are infected? As I mentioned before, not all viruses infect every type of cell, so you have to consider that.

383
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:46,680
Also, what is the time to positivity to take three weeks to become positive?

384
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,230
What did it take two days? And finally, what is the time of year?

385
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:57,840
We generally and I say generally don't see influenza, except during the winter.

386
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,480
Now, that's not to say it can't happen, it can't be imported from some other country during some other time of the year.

387
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:12,790
Well, we know influenza generally falls in midwinter. So there are problems with cell culture.

388
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:19,240
It's not perfect and it is very expensive. Sometimes you have to wait up to four weeks for a result.

389
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,210
Patients very well. They don't know how to treat the patient with if there's any antiviral work.

390
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:32,080
Really, that's a very long time to wait for a result. But for a long time it was only.

391
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:43,320
The sensitivity of the test. Is highly impacted by specimen quality, so if the patient gives you saliva and you needed sputum,

392
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,860
you've got about a 50 percent or less chance of having a positive result even if the person is infected.

393
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:57,210
Saliva, as I said before, is not the same mosquito specimen quality is incredibly important and not just in virology,

394
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:02,520
in all areas of clinical microbiology. We worry about specimen quality.

395
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:12,330
The cell lines can be that contaminated with bacteria, even though they do have antibiotics in the cells,

396
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,190
they can be contaminated with our rising rates of antimicrobial resistance.

397
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:26,970
This is getting to be a larger and larger problem. And the specimen itself can be toxic to the cell line.

398
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:35,070
So if the cells crawl up and die in 24 hours, it's probably not due to a virus, but probably due to some toxicity in that specimen.

399
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:41,700
And that, of course, is those viruses that want to be difficult and may not replicate in cell culture.

400
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:51,270
And here's a partial list. Adeno 441 will not rapid cell culture, nor will hepatitis parvovirus, human papillomavirus or norovirus.

401
00:47:51,270 --> 00:48:02,520
So we really have to have some other means of identifying those, those patients who are infected with those viruses.

402
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,200
So I mentioned the show by I say we're going to talk about it here.

403
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:17,190
Viruses can be detected within two to four days after inoculation. And so the shell vials are grown in short tubes with a screw cap.

404
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,980
And there's a round cover slip in the bottom and on that round covers that are the tissue soft tissue culture cells.

405
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:35,250
And so you inoculated with the specimen and you spin it so that you force the specimen down on those cells and then you incubate it.

406
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:43,680
And then after and you will you will generally do two or three Shoval on one specimen because after a couple of days,

407
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,980
you're going to remove the cover slip, stain it. And it wasn't fluorescent antibody and look to see if it's positive.

408
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,870
OK, if it's negative,

409
00:48:52,870 --> 00:49:03,460
you probably have one more tube or two more tube that you can do the same thing to in a couple of days or three or four days later.

410
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:09,880
And that's spinning the sample down onto the tissue culture cells really speeds up the heat

411
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,560
and decreases the incubation time speeds up the time for the virus to infect those cells.

412
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,850
So these are show vials with clever slip in the box.

413
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:31,410
See here he's taken out the cover slip. It's going to be stained and put on a slide and look to see if anything's positive.

414
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:36,820
Now, here's a positive for cytomegalovirus and the yellow blotches.

415
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:50,120
Her virus virus, infected cells. So see for me is this the Shoval is so huge and the cover slip is taken out.

416
00:49:50,120 --> 00:50:01,100
It stayed up 16 hours after inoculation, and then it shows the viral proteins and nuclei of infected cells.

417
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:09,170
And that is it for virology. Do you have.

418
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:15,650
Sincerely. Do you have any questions? No questions.

419
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,370
Please, please,

420
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:24,500
please read the material in the text because I cannot possibly give you all the information on virology with so many of you going into infection,

421
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:34,760
prevention is very, very important. We will talk about virology again next session and then there will be a test a week from today.

422
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,930
OK. And I will stand and watch, you know, degrading right now.

423
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:44,350
I have your test back to you on Wednesday.

424
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,830
Are there any questions? No questions, OK?

425
00:50:50,830 --> 00:51:00,829
Have a wonderful evening. The weather is nice.
