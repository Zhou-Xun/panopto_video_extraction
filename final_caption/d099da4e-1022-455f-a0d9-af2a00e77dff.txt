1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,150
Okay. Good morning, everyone. I apologize for this.

2
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:28,570
They took that this cream bag. And you see, they're okay today.

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:38,440
We are going to discuss about the when we film human longevity, as we have done in previous lectures.

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,110
I will talk a little bit the first half to introduce that topic and maybe to clarify.

5
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:51,010
So on the conflict that we will discuss in the second half of the book to the glass.

6
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,870
Then before we start there, let me ask you this question.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:13,210
Why do we age? Why natural selection does didn't allow for organism for humans in particular you to live forever without aging.

8
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:25,180
Then why do you think we need to age once we pass our genes to the next generation was seen as somewhat.

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,659
Society yet that one alternative will be exactly that one.

10
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,300
We reproduce them and we get but I don't want to say I get all people that that question why do we get the

11
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:49,710
L but but will be exactly where we reproduce them we're don't to be alive one of them will be they are

12
00:01:49,890 --> 00:02:01,110
the hypothesis the other hypothesis you're showing sorry no one who age because our cell turnover cannot

13
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,300
catch up the breaking down so there's a balance and the ball is in the kids about losing some people.

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,600
If you can keep on going then it's possible.

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:17,010
Mhm. The second is this is just a journey is a physical body has to go sometime so we can move on to do something else.

16
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,660
Yep. Then this the second hypothesis that just the body.

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,760
Just a body just like on its own. You got breaking down over time.

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,820
Yeah. Bioaccumulation. Maybe a mutation is eroding our metabolism.

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,050
And then you can imagine eventually we need to die because just due to oxidation.

20
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,830
So you can imagine another mechanism that is doing damage to our physiology.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,319
Veronika we need to die to, like, complete the cycle of life.

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:02,250
Kind of like the biosphere idea. Like things die in the trees to help take CO2.

23
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,390
It's like part of the entire system. Mm hmm.

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:22,070
Mm hmm. Yep. Doctor, the other hypothesis that we that we need to digest to allow for a new idea that we're all leaving all that species.

25
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:32,209
Yes. To live in the earth. But because we can imagine the scenario when we don't die, then eventually the resources are going to deplete.

26
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:37,340
And maybe if natural selection didn't do that, eventually that life will be extended.

27
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,490
Right now that will be a possibility as the money and not the resurrection, as in allowing for aging.

28
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,830
Now, those are very interesting ideas because in fact, there are several theories about that.

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,540
Why do we need to age? What are the biological mechanisms behind age aging?

30
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,019
And I think, one, that we may feel that this theory that the accumulation of eras during have

31
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:11,090
or our our by our life then this is called the mutation accumulation theory.

32
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:24,740
And the idea is that imagine here what we have here are different type of mutations that are going to be happening during our life.

33
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,980
Now, I've you know, our DNA is constantly reproducing, duplicating our cells.

34
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:48,290
We are exposed to you. For example, you relied or different types of chemicals in the air that are going to introduce mistakes in our DNA.

35
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,480
Now that this figure, what is telling us is that they are different type of mutations represented here by different colors,

36
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,510
that they are going to have deleterious effect at different ages than,

37
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,739
for example, could be so mutations represented by red that maybe they are going to have harmful effects very early in life.

38
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:20,629
So let's say it is a human disease human life story they see 20 years before of long we age is

39
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,360
going to be some accumulation of mutations that are going to have harmful effects later in life.

40
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,760
Then you see the idea that we are going to accumulate mutations as a consequence,

41
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:41,090
our metabolism is going to get to that are more error prone and eventually one went to die.

42
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,899
We could conceive what example garden cities are just how do is when the body is

43
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,760
unable to remove cells without concept phenotype or we can get more type of diseases,

44
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,260
cardiovascular disease that that the basic idea that is accommodation for mutations.

45
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:11,730
Now. Do you how?

46
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,020
How can you test the hypothesis in human populations?

47
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,180
Could you imagine one way to test the hypothesis?

48
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:38,840
But let me let me give you this kind of information, because we all we are carrying these type of mutations.

49
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,770
If we take a random person, we sequenced their genome, they most likely are going to get some mutation.

50
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:54,710
And we are carrying this type of new data. Now, some of the mutations, they are more deleterious one day adding homozygous state.

51
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,910
Remember what I was going to say was one where they have one parent exactly.

52
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,970
That we had that same two aliens in the same person.

53
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,070
Then one prediction the hypotheses.

54
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,950
Even these mutations are more deleterious in the homozygous state.

55
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:23,690
Therefore, the level of what causes individuals is going to be related to mortality.

56
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,560
The more the heterozygous person, the lower the mortality.

57
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,840
That is one of the predictions. And in fact, I've been establishing humans.

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,770
Human populations are what we observe.

59
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:47,630
These are the hazard ratio of mortalities for different studies in humans.

60
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:57,300
They are these right now. This study is based on a basically European ancestry populations and also African-American populations.

61
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,790
But you'll see that the higher that is healthy voices, the lower the mortality.

62
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:16,669
In fact, this is the result of a meta analysis. What they observe is that each one is standard deviation or rather standard deviation.

63
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,550
Lower heterozygous is was associated with one or 2% lower mortality.

64
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,899
Has somewhat effect by still is interesting that the higher the total sequences that

65
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,510
lower the mortality in human populations after an absolute biologic perspective.

66
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:48,320
This makes sense because the higher level of data people see less likely to have these values in homozygous data is clear.

67
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,569
But that conflict. Mm hmm. How do we not imagine are heterozygous you referred to.

68
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,190
We have two different leads in each of them.

69
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,879
E we tend to have differing values in different local.

70
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,750
Then it's less likely that are going to be too deleterious same.

71
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,079
Therefore it more likely that we're going to have lower mortality in a headed of people.

72
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,709
See. I this.

73
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,100
This is what we observe in human populations. Hmm.

74
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:30,560
Again, these are not big effect. 2% lower mortality, but each is lower standard deviation of the difficulties.

75
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,580
Are now by a different type of death is about the same result.

76
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:51,960
For example, death from cancer. You see, the hazard ratio is about 2% lower for cardiovascular death, about the same even for any any type of death.

77
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:59,460
Not only consider cardiovascular. Also, we observe lower mortality associated with higher literacy classes.

78
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:15,080
And again was about the same. Now, if in effect is a little bit, Alisyn, this result is a little bit stronger in Maine.

79
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,220
You see the hazard ratio is probably 98, about 2%.

80
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,809
In fact, in women, you have that ratio is quite significant.

81
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:30,469
You'll see that 0.891 across, one in male wheelchair model.

82
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,840
How about the same? But you see the heterogeneity of effects by six.

83
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,220
Any idea why you want some hypotheses? Yeah.

84
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,120
Why? Whether you've seen the the male, how the x y.

85
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,959
So the chances will be less. Yes.

86
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,710
If for the sex chromosome. But for the other chromosome they have nothing.

87
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,560
Chromosome of women say to number one to number two and so on to X.

88
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,650
If it's not recessive in the extent these two women, the higher chance to get it.

89
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:16,610
Yeah I think we still we don't know exactly why the effort of people trying to to get an answer from

90
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,610
you I think I think it's not clear why the affected LC lucky seems to be a strong adding meaning.

91
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:29,720
However, we know in average women live longer than men that expectancy of women is longer than men.

92
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,730
What's. The hazard ratio hazard ratio is that is similar to our.

93
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:49,590
Consequently is a risk ratio is comparing the probability of death in a given time.

94
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:59,340
When you are comparing groups being here we are comparing let's say a person with a certain

95
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:05,190
degree of head refuses against person with that lower literacy both by one standard deviation,

96
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,130
then lower than one means that the probability of death in a given time is lower.

97
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,070
Higher than one would be. The right that is higher than is a risk ratio.

98
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,730
The reason the male has less hazard.

99
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:31,120
Yes. And again, remember this. If by one standard deviation lower header sequences that.

100
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,590
Sorry. Is that for for a for a standard deviation higher equals zero.

101
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,610
The higher the difficulty, the lower the rate of mortality.

102
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,190
Again, repeat this.

103
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:55,510
I want to repeat this, but I think I what I was saying in the wrong way, the higher the equal SES, the lower the risk of death in a given time either.

104
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:09,560
Males get lower grades. Yeah, but again, this is comparing men because this is only 35, 96.

105
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:23,990
Among men, only among men. The R the higher the total C courses, there is about 2% lower probability of death among men.

106
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:31,640
Among women, you'll see that the effect is lower still if indeed there is a trend to lower mortality.

107
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:43,240
But it's quite non-significant. Now, there are other maybe other factors going on going here, because remember that women, they live longer than men.

108
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:51,050
You know, they have a higher, longer life expectancy. So we're not comparing males and men and not really comparing within men.

109
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,900
Exactly. Right. Exactly.

110
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Now that it is the hypothesis they spelled out this profile, Soma and Soma Yang refers to the to the body that is not part of the germ cells.

111
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,830
And the idea here. And remember, we discussed this when talking about insulin resistance.

112
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:38,670
The natural selection hubs help to allocate energy according to the needs of the individuals being in the in your life.

113
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:49,890
Here in this graph we had a different energy allocation for maintenance of the body in blue, for growth in purple and for reproduction in green.

114
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,160
Now, in the first part of the view that, number one, what do you see here?

115
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,690
Where is more energy allocated production in reproduction?

116
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,910
Then you can imagine if more energy is allocated to reproduction and less to growth and maintenance,

117
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,870
this type of species that went to reproduce fast but we are able to have a shorter lifespan.

118
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,150
We have that when documented, more damages in the body, more formative damages.

119
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,830
That is, you know, a lot of resources for maintenance and repair for the body.

120
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,850
And therefore, we are going to have a short today. But I in fact, you see what we observe.

121
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,770
You are a species, animals, species, at least they reproduce fast.

122
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:46,770
They tend to have a shorter lifespan. Can you define so like are you talking about this, the spider matic nervous system?

123
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:56,610
Yes. No. Here so much refers to older body that is not germ cells experimental false or by wrinkles or of.

124
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,190
Daddy. That's only because this is what is on.

125
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,850
This is why we don't pass to the next generation. We pass our selves.

126
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,730
But we don't pass this one at the skin, Arthur.

127
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,720
Now you can imagine that we can have that type of business when there is more allocation to maintenance,

128
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:36,340
allocation to growth and less to reproduction, then these are the type of pieces that they delay reproduction.

129
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,100
They invest more in growth and therefore they are going to have a longer lifespan.

130
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:49,870
And if in the in humans, at least compared to other primates, we have this type of life story.

131
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,380
We allocate more energy to maintaining the growth and we delay our reproduction compared to other primates.

132
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,420
That makes sense. Like some of the animals. Like the turtles nests.

133
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,010
Hundreds of years. Yep. And the elephant? How does the elephant in the household live longer?

134
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,700
They have something of some future. Here has. Look. Okay.

135
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:27,959
Now. What is also interesting or maybe illuminated is that now in at least in Western societies and I

136
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:36,990
suspect that this is our own I would say very useful game is longer form for women compared to men.

137
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:50,280
But what we see in Europe is that even for Europeans populations in the 19th century, in the middle 19th century,

138
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,920
life expectancy was a more or less similar to what else they took from the Paleolithic.

139
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:04,169
Hmm. You see here the blue line are D and this is based again in remains, archeological remains.

140
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:13,370
Then they are able more or less to to estimate when that particular individual died.

141
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:24,000
But you see that are the yellow line. They from Liverpool in the middle 19th century is similar to the Paleolithic Neolithic.

142
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:33,480
Now in their society but they they they they have access to that all the advanced the modern medicine

143
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,720
even in the 20th century you'll see that they have far less respect dances also with high mortality.

144
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,230
And you see that far from the life expectancy from the UK in early 2000s.

145
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,260
But now then what? What. What I'm trying to say with your feet.

146
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,320
Your is that humans?

147
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,380
The the potential of our life expectancy.

148
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,200
Now we are seeing only through the advances of the modern medicine.

149
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:20,590
The. Now the question is whether there are other species of primates,

150
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:30,250
whether the survival or whether their life expectancy, for example, from a gene over rela compared to humans.

151
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,980
Now I think in the second part we are going to discuss these years, but just to.

152
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,900
This is from one of the papers that you were for today,

153
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,399
a saying that what this is showing are these survival are poorer and also the mortality

154
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,830
rates comparing are more hunter gatherers from different parts of the world,

155
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:06,130
for example, from Paraguay, from Tanzania, them from South America and the border between Venezuela and Colombia, also from the Kalahari Desert.

156
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:21,700
And compared to that gene, then then what the what this coverage or we now see that even for humans that they don't have access to modern medicine.

157
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:28,780
They live far more to a more, let's say, ancient lifestyle.

158
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,340
By still they have lower life expectancy.

159
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,700
They're not cheap. They see here they see that percentage of survivors.

160
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,790
You see that, for example, for that, for chimps, the more they can if it's around 50 years old.

161
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:54,670
55. Mm hmm. But in this hunter gatherers population, still, we observe about 20 or 10% of survivors at age 70.

162
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:02,290
And this is the mortality rate. You'll see that for for teams either for female or male chimps.

163
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:12,580
That is a huge mortality in younger I mean, childhood mortality here are established child mortality.

164
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,610
And then again, we have an increase of mortality in hunter gatherers in humans.

165
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,750
You see that that is again high mortality during childhood.

166
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:30,250
But then there is an established mortality very low, up to a 50, maybe 60, and then we have an increase in mortality.

167
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:43,150
Then we think that our likely stories, if we compare these are, well, hunter gatherers still we observe higher life expectancy compared to chimps.

168
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:56,240
Now this year I came from that same paper comparing some of these life histories of chimpanzees to humans.

169
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:09,200
Now, these are and again, I want to point out the limitation on this type of study, because they did the study human using white chimpanzee,

170
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,270
because actually elephants who they have access to, let's say, do more care,

171
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,970
even though they don't they don't give a lot more different than white chimpanzees.

172
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,080
And then, for example, a white chimpanzee. Life expectancy at the moment was barely 13 years.

173
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:34,010
They say, well, in the wild, a chimpanzee expected to live at the moment of birth.

174
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,340
You'll see that mortality dying from mortality very high, 20%.

175
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:51,650
Now, when a chimpanzee reaches the adult life that in chimpanzees, it's around maybe 15 years,

176
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:01,190
then the chimpanzee expected to live another 15 years in average in the wild for in humans,

177
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:13,100
Alisyn, in these societies before that industrial revolution, revolution, I suspect that he also was very low, about just about three years old, 35.

178
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,290
You see, for example, he reading in that 18th century was about 35.

179
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:28,640
You saw that expectancy. Now, what do you think? Why would that most important mortality factor in in doing human evolution in general?

180
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,120
We have this goes into the starvation both that we had these global factors didn't mean other than medicine.

181
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:45,110
No, not less blessing more rather in that during human evolution look good in all our day when we feel our species.

182
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:56,310
What do you think? What a factor causing more death for food or infection?

183
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:06,560
Infection, infection, infection. What are the strongest factor that's causing one death natural wear went to this got that the link to the

184
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,960
bowel immunity how infectious you are in fact you have to shape our genome even more than in starvation,

185
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,760
even more to access to food. Now.

186
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,580
Now, comparing human populations in that 20th century,

187
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:35,360
you'll see that even in the early 20th century in feeding that I suspect that it was only about 54 years old by now in the early 20th century,

188
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,249
that expectancy was 79 years old. That is show.

189
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:49,670
What I'm trying to show you here is that the evidence show that I suspect that the of humans is higher than primates,

190
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,510
even in pretty good societies, even in society, with the access to modern medicine.

191
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:06,490
Although I will use here in this graph. How do you see her getting the cause of death in white chimpanzees from humans, hunter gatherers?

192
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,610
You'll see that in chimpanzee about 70, 60, almost 70% mortality due to infections.

193
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:28,750
And you can tell that it is about the same 72%. Well, I'm more I'm glad you two are two axioms, balance and two sentences.

194
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,970
You'll see that chimpanzee. Only about one person died of innocence.

195
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,880
They died before due to infections.

196
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:49,000
Even at dealing between chimpanzees and humans, at least in these hunter gatherers, about 10% died due to alteration.

197
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,400
So I'm against some comparisons.

198
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:09,460
I just focus here in this part in red here they are a lot of information that maybe you can look deeper when you are reading these papers.

199
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,160
But again, this is just to compare that there is not a lot of difference among chimpanzee.

200
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,300
If we compared the wild and also chimpanzees, active chimpanzees,

201
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:31,180
you see that the life expectancy at birth for I white chimpanzees 30 years old 30 years for the chimpanzee is about 30 to 45 for humans.

202
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:38,620
And again, this is a whole range of different societies in between 55 to 85 years, depending on the society.

203
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:48,200
So bye bye to forties. Now Inhumans alicemercer cited very high more than 90% over the past few months.

204
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,430
I want to reach 40 years old in Western societies and about 90% I want to reach 60 or more.

205
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,280
Now we are going to I'm not going to discuss a little bit more about this.

206
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,490
I'll be waiting out. We're going to discuss these in the in the second part.

207
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:16,160
But our unique trait or favorite pieces is the survival after menopause.

208
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:31,130
Alice, the study from the prom from chimpanzee show that the female chimpanzee, they are fertile through all that most of the lifespan,

209
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:42,560
and they usually die just a little bit after menopause, after they reach what we call menopause in humans is expected.

210
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:53,719
Or rather we know based on, well, these are life tables that a woman is going to live in average in.

211
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:02,300
I wish I can remember this that our is 25 more years after menopause after that and so there are reproductive life.

212
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,340
And I think I then I went to discuss a little bit more about this.

213
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:17,140
There are more the hypotheses then I'm going I'm not going to disclose just keep it on my why do you want female have these long welfare

214
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:28,250
titles or bible how these plus fertilizer bible affect orbital human longevity on how these post-menopausal survival evolve in humans?

215
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,960
What are the selective forces? Question so far.

216
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,300
Another factor related to the longevity of whatever business is our consumption of meat.

217
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,640
Now I do remember some of the consequences of dying or the consumption of meat.

218
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:16,680
You know, we're during our evolution just to get changes for lower and the brain development, the expansion of the brain, the expansion of the brain.

219
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,670
Now, when we talk about evolution,

220
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:31,559
I want you to think that all these changes are happening somehow correlated now with

221
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:39,930
this cause before when our ancestors started to eat more meat and to use fire,

222
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,060
to cook meat that allow for more energy dense food,

223
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:51,420
that allows extra energy for the growth of our brain because we know that we're bringing the various

224
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:59,130
benzene that require about a quarter of metabolic with that basal metabolic rate in adult humans.

225
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,680
Now. As a consequence of Dave Bigger Brain.

226
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:23,510
Although we did go cycling less last week that the growth or the development of humans takes more time to allow for this more energy.

227
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,280
And also we discover that our brain, even as an adult, keeps united.

228
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:41,560
Great. We talk about you and inspiration, also about the myelin research on our neurons that keeps going, giving us an ideal young adult.

229
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,030
Now, that is going to also have implications for our longevity.

230
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,480
Okay. Because going back to this to this graph.

231
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,030
If I were brain dee any more energy.

232
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,880
Back in deep Europe, or rather one or two in what it would do to our species.

233
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,040
How do you see would be the energy dedicated to reproduction? How is going to change the.

234
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,140
You're going to see exactly a delay. You're going to be. Hmm.

235
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,720
Because they're going to take more energy to growth and maintenance.

236
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:44,159
Then in this part of the discussion, then I want you to Utah to make this connections between how the data redshift are

237
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,820
contributing to this pattern and how it bring to our plot expansion of our data.

238
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,260
Now,

239
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:09,149
comparing the types of sources of all of protein and using great apes will rely upon its infancy and also what we know about some of ancient hominins,

240
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:15,450
for example, Australopithecus and so on, regarding this and the idea that we know more about,

241
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,300
because we have more remains, more archeological remains.

242
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:31,290
But what we see here, at least double rela, the major source of protein of meat, is from insects.

243
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,250
Hmm. I'm for chimpanzee.

244
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,700
They have more barbarity of of meat.

245
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:53,270
Then as a consequence in Inhumans that we have more sources of meat.

246
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:06,080
What happens when we eat a lot of meat? And we want to know the overall synthesized protein.

247
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,410
We can synthesize more protein. Yep. We get more protein. Exactly.

248
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,740
Besides protein, what we're getting with the meat. Expand.

249
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,360
Then the more energy here we have. More energy? Yeah, it's.

250
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,740
Costly to chew, but like humans don't consume raw meat.

251
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:37,940
Yeah, we spend less time chewing exactly what we use cooking meat than we do.

252
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,350
See the whole hypothesis about get rid of some of that GI tract. But.

253
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:48,770
But also. How about.

254
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,520
Let's try a little a little a little moronic.

255
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,790
Could it be that we're extending less and. Sorry.

256
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,460
We're, like, expending less energy, making our own amino acids or.

257
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,490
Mm hmm. Getting them from other sources. Exactly. That's all they are.

258
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,830
Well, they would be consequences. That concerns me.

259
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:27,520
That could mean that we are getting all these micro micronutrients that we don't need to spend that are synthesizing in our own body, our own.

260
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,670
But. But. But all those are said rybakina.

261
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm framing my question wrong now.

262
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:49,810
Okay. So besides all that, all that advantages, that is any drop ball, I mean, any, any rather harmful effect of meat consumption.

263
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:58,780
Vinda I would say it's going to be more creative than the one.

264
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,290
Mm hmm. Because, like the higher cholesterol intake.

265
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:14,040
So, like, uh, effects, like vascular disease, something like that.

266
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:25,560
Yeah, exactly. They are the problems of cardiovascular disease, because I'm probably gonna to and them because of the fact that we are consuming.

267
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,679
And also, besides that,

268
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:38,430
I don't know whether in some of the the paper mentioned that also the risk of infection you are consuming for example raw meat.

269
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,900
I might think out what I'm saying, but even they are cooking the meat that maybe wasn't fully cooked,

270
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,570
then that risk of infection is higher, and therefore that's not really going to affect our immune system.

271
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:57,720
Mm hmm. Now that in response to the consumption of meat, we have more disadvantages, more energy, more resources.

272
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,110
We spend less time digesting cooked meat.

273
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:11,549
We have these other harmful effects. Then our body has to adapt to those changes to those of natural selection.

274
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,000
Rather has to come with those adaptations.

275
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:27,660
And I think we are going to discuss this, that we have seen evidence of natural selection for several genes that are related to to meat consumption,

276
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,320
Ramadan, all the ones that have been more studied at a point they being.

277
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,410
We're going to discuss a little bit more about that in the second part.

278
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:49,950
But also, there are other things that are related to meat consumption being that we have evidence for natural selection.

279
00:36:51,270 --> 00:37:03,660
Now then what I'm trying to say here is that when I when I first heard this this dietary shift to a more meat based diet,

280
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:15,540
they needed to have some kind of adaptations to try to limit the harmful effects,

281
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,570
because that's is going to have an effect on survival, reproduction and the fitness of the individual.

282
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:33,690
Now, there is this study I was in. Well, the papers is a little bit ah, I will say complex because they did so much better in mice.

283
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:45,480
And what they did was they gave to mice to first to different to food type meat or tubers.

284
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:55,590
And also they choose to different types of preparations would be raw or cook and also they they

285
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:02,040
have another intervention that were have to have free fed or caloric restriction to the mice.

286
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,200
And again this was in mice.

287
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:14,189
Then the idea of this study was to okay look, these different type of dieting mice, see what that genes are highly expressed in different,

288
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:21,000
different type of diet and then see whether we have evidence of natural selection and or genes during human evolution.

289
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,880
Then that what are certain of these? A study that was done in mice.

290
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,900
And once they found this gene with differential genius creation,

291
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:39,440
then look into humans lineages, whether there is evidence of natural selection of the genes.

292
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:50,420
And in fact, what they found is that there is a set of genes that were highly expressed with a consortium of cooked meat,

293
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:58,200
that there was a strong natural selection of natural selection in the lineage that is common to the Neanderthals and so on.

294
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:05,690
Humans, remember, they see the hominin line. Then this gene, they are not only particular to humans,

295
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:14,210
but also they seem to have been under natural selection for or for one of our relatives in the past and now tantalum, Denisova.

296
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:30,170
Then this is, I would say, the indirect evidence because again, remember, they found eating in mice with the limitation of the animal animal models,

297
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:41,000
because we don't know, at least from these data, we don't know whether these animals are differentially expressed in humans under this type of data.

298
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:46,340
We can do that and we can just, for example, have few different type of diet.

299
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:56,540
I'm encouraging expression, but what is interesting is that they found that the genes that were highly expressed in response to the poop medallion,

300
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:08,180
there was evidence of natural selection, the lineage, hominin lineage that this line, the line leading to the needs of modern humans.

301
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,410
Okay. Also, I wanted to talk a little bit about what we know about the genes related to longevity.

302
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,270
I think I show you this graphic when the world first lectures and you see that by

303
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:37,520
two 1818 that the United States have changed during the 19 early 21st century.

304
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,170
And they say that's our Bible, too, each night.

305
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:50,720
And you'll see that in the beginning of the 20th century, maybe one or 2% of persons were expected to reach 90 years old.

306
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,660
But now for the Cold War, I was born in 2007.

307
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,780
About 15% of me are expected to reach 90 years old.

308
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,450
And about 25%, a quarter of the women that expected to reach 90 years old.

309
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,500
So bye bye to as a candidate.

310
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:27,400
And again, for Dachau, where I was born in 1900, less than 1%, I will say this is like a 0.1% with respect to reach 100 years by now, the Cold War.

311
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:33,130
I was born in 2000, saving seven. About 1% of men not expected to reach 100 years.

312
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,780
And about two and a half of women are expected to reach a hundred years.

313
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,150
Now, what would what do we know about the genes related to longevity in humans?

314
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,610
We know the age at death outside genetic important.

315
00:41:50,890 --> 00:42:00,370
For example, as dies in twins show a correlation between 20 and 30%, meaning the twins, they tend to die more or less.

316
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:08,620
Well, I think age identical twins based on population basis dies is about 15 to 25%.

317
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:15,280
Heritability alternative, however.

318
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:27,700
And you see why? Because you can argue that now in modern societies with the access to medecine, even with chronic diseases,

319
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:38,820
what able to live seventies, 80 years for example now the likelihood to die from a heart attack or that I didn't do for your heart.

320
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:47,170
That's how you are also what are able to treat cancer in more effective ways than before.

321
00:42:50,350 --> 00:43:00,040
How? But even though that genetic component for surviving more than 85 years is stronger

322
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,879
because you can argue that the environment has any strong effect of ambient environment.

323
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,920
I mean, food exercise is banned, is seen as any stroke effects, surviving up to 80 useful or 85.

324
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,110
But after that,

325
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:28,750
that genetic component is the strongest is in there is a heritability of 40% and this is similar to a trait like a blood pressure or any player else.

326
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:33,910
Type two diabetes are genetic studies.

327
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:39,370
And again, I also I want to make the he mentioned the limitation on many of these studies

328
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,379
and you see how limitation of all the genetic studies and is not more they're

329
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,650
they have been done in an open population European society populations then many

330
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:57,940
of these results they don't necessarily are you know lies to all populations.

331
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,260
What is going to be all environments that we need to take this report with a grain of salt.

332
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,020
Do you see why not that reason why we need more diversity in genetic studies?

333
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,660
Because we need to know more about the genetic basis of these traits now.

334
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:26,500
But taking into account those limitations that two genes that are more consistently associated with longevity are actually foxo three.

335
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:45,320
I believe the appointing, at least in human populations, has realized that a48383 and that you do that in 43 only for that e for the ancestral.

336
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:58,700
I live by your ancestor, I mean the oldest. I leave the earth ordinated during evolution one that four and according to one estimate that it

337
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:04,940
three and that four Alice seems to have it to be originated about 200,000 years in the past.

338
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,580
Now, do you remember what happens around this time during human evolution?

339
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,770
Cocaine. Cocaine? Yep.

340
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,730
But Cook was a little bit older.

341
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:31,299
Is it a switch to switch to an agriculturist?

342
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,840
More recently? About 10,000 years, maybe six.

343
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:46,590
Tools. Tools to retaliate had been altered to use that last model at the urging of our two species.

344
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,130
Would you say the origin of our species?

345
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:58,230
I mean that there are humans 250,000 years, more or less about this range between 200,000, 300,000, depending on the estimate.

346
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:13,290
But let's say around this time now that the consequence of that is that these two added that E3, if that E3 and that E2 are only present in humans.

347
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:20,910
We don't observed 70, for example, in chimpanzees using ancient DNA.

348
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,440
We don't want Civ also devalues the Argentines or Denisovans.

349
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:35,550
They are only presenting humans that humans that you read that are the news article they send you about the Nobel Prize.

350
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,620
At least you look, you can read.

351
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:49,450
It was how they gave it to this society from Sweden that now he's working in Germany, but he had done a lot of biology.

352
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,030
Now the first war using ancient DNA.

353
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:04,079
Now that if for a little it's a high risk rally based on the have decided that if they

354
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:12,150
have the heart they have high risk of death Alzheimer's and also high cholesterol.

355
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,629
They differentiate between the types of cholesterol the LDL is, which are small, dense deals.

356
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,720
And then there's the high yield proteins which are common.

357
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,899
It's been disproven that those are positive. Yes.

358
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:38,340
I think these monthly or overall cholesterol, total cholesterol, but high levels of overall cholesterol aren't necessarily indicative of disease.

359
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,600
Because if you can. That includes HDL. Yeah, ideally, right.

360
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:50,610
You're not you are probably to the right. But also what we know is that with regard to the cholesterol, if you have a legal right,

361
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,760
high risk could be seen not related maybe to cholesterol levels,

362
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,670
but is a high risk for Alzheimer disease and also is associated with a little bit higher

363
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:07,260
mortality compared to that it one day on day three now then this suggest that that

364
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,339
entry and that it too added the older you need it more or less about the time of the

365
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:18,629
original how it is because they were under natural selection to protect against,

366
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:27,490
let's say, harmful effect of meat consumption. We have from China.

367
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,450
We have, I think, not lectured about Alzheimer's in this class.

368
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:40,450
And we are going to to discover more about quality control mechanisms needed to our side mirrors to also that relationship with

369
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:49,750
down to diabetes on people outside type two diabetes where I went to to discuss down to evolutionary implications of that.

370
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:58,120
Now these trials that if for E3 are do they have huge variation in human populations.

371
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:12,070
The more frequent one is that it? He had a darker dark green, the more frequent and the less frequently is that you do that before they.

372
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:19,680
The ancestral ideal has also high frequency in certain populations but you see that are more frequent dietary.

373
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:34,500
Let's see how we are. About time. Okay, let me finish this part and then we can make a break and then we can do the second part.

374
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,420
Now, I want to go back again to that insulin resistance topic that we have discussed before,

375
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:54,460
because these they are signaling the metabolic signal, the insulin resistance, so that insulin is conserved throughout evolution.

376
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:09,090
We observe from organism, from hydrous tin or IBT elegans that fly that fruit fly drosophila and mammals that we have similar signaling pathways.

377
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:19,950
Hmm. To that is the wonder that will with insulin even for hydra even we don't have an insulin molecule.

378
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:27,719
Percy but they are some peptides that insulin like usually under the right sector

379
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,960
they are similar and a signaling pathway is called for conserve through evolution.

380
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:39,570
Now remember that insulin has a key role in the allocation of energy.

381
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,820
Also, now we know that regulate these other gene.

382
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,180
Foxo There have been problems associated with longevity.

383
00:50:51,170 --> 00:51:00,559
I don't want to disclose a lot about the mechanism of Foxo, but FOXO is that genes that are critical factor that use this process in different organs,

384
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,850
interior, adipocytes, different tissue, the more false inflammatory cells.

385
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,420
Even the pancreas has different functions, important function.

386
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:16,950
You'll see that they are related to energy metabolism, to insulin sensitivity, oxidation of glucose and beets.

387
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:33,230
Now, I think someone you mentioned earlier before this yeah this is like suspect until the fitting are organisms the elephant is about

388
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:48,260
85 years this life expectancy the the calendar for the and this is 80 humans this is the longest report that human human life 122.

389
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,610
Hmm. This is the longest confirmed.

390
00:51:51,950 --> 00:52:04,470
Mm. Wow. Now the hydra is immortal that this organism, the hydra is an vertebrate.

391
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:12,630
O is immortal. A type of both reproductive and sexual reproduction and sexual revolution.

392
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,180
But while we know he didn't tell you that. Exactly, you take one of these and they can live forever.

393
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,440
Dude, we don't really know. You look like.

394
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:28,210
But it could be a new thing, but. No.

395
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,360
What what is interesting is that, you know,

396
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:42,600
it seems to be related to the to the amount of stem cells in the hydrants that they continued to have said really wasn't differentiating.

397
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,420
But they have a constant repository of stem cells.

398
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:59,060
Mm hmm. When they're reproduction would be like replacing faster than the depreciation and that you keep a new.

399
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:05,650
And that is related to this pressure and that hopefully we have a let's see what type.

400
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:14,360
I mean, they say the normal height that can reproduce that is stem cells is going to produce differing I mean,

401
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,130
they're going to be revolutionary producing for men what they put in polyps.

402
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:33,470
Polyps. However, if we remove the fox, the gene from Hydra, the high that is start to die that you see in this gene Foxo is important for longevity.

403
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:49,730
Now, we don't know exactly the mechanisms, at least these things that participate in the insulin signaling pathway to allocate energy to young humans.

404
00:53:51,560 --> 00:54:03,350
There is an animal that really in the fox of treating individuals that are homozygous for that particular yield, they tend to live longer.

405
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:13,860
Again we don't know the mechanism by it seems to be related to ah to energy allocation.

406
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:24,209
Now there is also a discussion going on about if caloric restriction is related

407
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,890
to the lifespan and also experimentally animals interact with this stuff.

408
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:34,430
The fruit fly and mice, they show that we restrict caloric intake.

409
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:45,660
They tend to be a little bit longer. Now in primates, I think the evidence is not quite clear where caloric restriction could lead to longer lifespan,

410
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:55,500
but at least in experimental animals is there is some evidence that caloric restriction it can be related to lifespan.

411
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:06,780
Now, let me I think I asked you this before. Suppose we have a group of person that we are leaving a hundred useful.

412
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:19,140
Do they live with chronic diseases or start to have chronic diseases later in life?

413
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,380
Let me rephrase that with and I say we have a patient that is 100 years.

414
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,580
Then that person, they say, for example, can't have the heart attack at 50,

415
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,570
but was able to survive and reach 100 years or older person that didn't have a heart attack.

416
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,660
Most of their life is going to be health. What do you think? We have studied this before.

417
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:49,020
Do is they have the chronic illness later that's delayed to much later yet.

418
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,380
And is it what we observe in humans?

419
00:55:51,600 --> 00:56:02,610
Again, these are the hypotheses are possible as an idea that morbidity with the longevity one they say are either during lifetime morbidity,

420
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:10,920
chronic diseases a certain period of time. I happen to have death here now with the extension of our longevity.

421
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:22,169
One possibility is that chronic diseases start at the same point of time, but we are able to survive more time or morbidity.

422
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:31,600
Rather, it starts late in life and as a consequence we are going to live longer compared to, say, with this first scenario.

423
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:39,450
And what we know from humans is a rather this last scenario, this we had a study.

424
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,840
This is done in Argosy in New England.

425
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:53,640
And let me explain the figures here. We have persons, centenarians, meaning that they are 101 hundred fold useful.

426
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:07,440
We have what they call semi centenarians that if a 5.100 thing and we have the super centenarians that are 100 thing or more.

427
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:18,730
Now this is the proportions of different categories of person.

428
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:27,430
Survivors are subjects with onset of a chronic disease prior to 840.

429
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:35,020
Then you'll see four persons that have 100 fall. About 70% are survivors.

430
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,819
They have the first of the disease before age 84.

431
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:52,120
Persons living in 100 108 is just 12% for relieving those 108% less in this last column.

432
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,939
This is the more lead example of what they call escapist escape.

433
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,040
There are those that have the first chronic disease after 800.

434
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:11,260
Then you see that person in 100 thing. They start to about 69%.

435
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,480
They are free of disease, chronic disease for 100 years.

436
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:25,510
Hmm. And here, I think they defined here in DC, like diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular or cancer.

437
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,090
Yep. Professor, all the people want the peacekeepers.

438
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:40,780
Was that would would the escapist data also at some point in the past accounted for in the survivors?

439
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,340
I mean, is this same people possible the same person?

440
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:52,299
No, no, no. Because I saw my buddies wonder how far this is. Great pride before 80 an escape.

441
00:58:52,300 --> 00:59:03,220
But he's a person that has abuses after he they are not I think person because either you have it at 80 or you had the first 100.

442
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:17,140
Oh, I got you know, these diseases are like killing cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancers.

443
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:24,750
Okay. Yep. Not like. 21.

444
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:39,690
This graph is about, I say an idea and this is how long our life we leave home with chronic diseases and compared to controls about a bit about

445
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:49,169
this it I mean about 20% of their life and you see that what I range from ten up to let's say 35 over of their life and if

446
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:58,079
we chronic diseases but persons living in 110 or more they have a media outlet that 10% of their life living with chronic

447
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:07,020
diseases then it he had them be that up the onset of chronic diseases delayed if there's only been this very long life.

448
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,720
Now to finish. I want to talk a little bit to finish my part.

449
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:21,290
I want to talk a little bit about this controversial topic about aging and stop.

450
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:26,089
Hmm. How do we find aging? Anyone?

451
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:34,820
Can you define any idea how can you give me any definition of aging, if you will, to find it?

452
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,840
Everything declined. Slightly declined. Physiologic feature of the physiologic function.

453
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,630
Calcium. Lower, you know, measurements. Mm hmm. Yeah.

454
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:51,020
Yeah. No, that's exactly the decline of our basic functions.

455
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,810
Now that from the point of view of one. Wow.

456
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,580
Individual, banal. How?

457
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:08,270
From the popular population point of view, how do you see a being in a population?

458
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,180
Let's say you what you say you are measuring survival or mortality rate during time.

459
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:15,860
Let's say you have a cold.

460
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:25,310
Let's say you are off in the let's say the cold dies for right now in this year, 2022, we are going to follow both what in the old all day life?

461
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,290
How do you expect that mortality rate to change over time for that forward?

462
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:46,020
And the mortality rate because they say when they are born usually dead, these are high mortality within the first maybe five years.

463
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,690
Is that the infant mortality that then they do after that? That is more moderate course.

464
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:55,470
But in older life, we expect the mortality rate to keep accelerating.

465
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,120
Hmm. Then from the population point of view, that's how we define aging.

466
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:09,330
The mortality rate keeps oscillating elevated. Let's say the my probability of dying right now, I don't want to say my age,

467
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:23,910
but my probability of dying right now is higher than a person ten years younger than me, and also is lower than a person ten years older than me.

468
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:31,670
Hmm. What if that person younger than you has had. It has had, like, a heart attack.

469
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,260
Okay. Controlling for all potential conflict. Okay.

470
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,860
Yeah. No, you are completely right. You are completely right. Balisacan.

471
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:47,700
Let's say we have two comparable persons that are differing ages now from then, from a population point of view.

472
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:53,210
That's how we define aging. Acceleration of the mortality rates during time.

473
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:58,370
However, that is one field and this is based on theoretical studies.

474
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:04,040
People have done this mathematical model and basically the idea is, after all,

475
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,700
a certain moment of time when we are very old networks, electronics are not acting anymore.

476
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:21,020
But then as a consequence, and this is based on mathematical models and the mathematical things that people would be here are dance about that.

477
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:25,190
But one what that interesting conclusion is that it is happening.

478
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:30,020
Mortality rate tends to reach a plateau in very old life.

479
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,720
Annalise in fruit fly you've seen these days.

480
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:47,540
How? You'll see that after certain days, because this day, flight day really far less than less than a year, a few months.

481
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,620
But after in a year, you'll see that mortality rates, they reach a plateau.

482
01:03:54,870 --> 01:04:02,219
Hmm. Then that means that I bury all ages.

483
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,930
I want more. Will you stop aging? No.

484
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,710
I want to make clear. The fact that we stop aging doesn't mean that we are going to die.

485
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:18,210
Our mortality rate rate. Nothing change over time is just the same after starting ages.

486
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:28,780
Now and again, they are some evolutionary theory that suggest that even that could be the case for humans,

487
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:36,310
that after all, a year, they say after 200 years, mortality rates remain the same.

488
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,670
Now, the evidence regarding humans is, I will say, is unclear and contradictory.

489
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:55,850
There was honestly done in Italy without quite a lot of women that were born in 1904, and they measure of hazard ratio mortality rates.

490
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:00,500
They imagine that these are mortality rates after 105 years.

491
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,590
We could argue that is more or less a plateau.

492
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:17,780
Now, whether you see in this graph in any any question or other any abilities, do you see that is is constant you see have plateau here?

493
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,910
Yes, she did plateau, but that's the average. And then how long was the sample.

494
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,860
Yeah. That that one probably they very, very difficult to do.

495
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:36,380
I study at those age range and you'll see that the confidence interval of these hazard ratio are huge.

496
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:41,540
Then they see really a plateau or just that.

497
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,770
Our data is just at that ages.

498
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,780
We have no we have no data and we have no enough data.

499
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:54,889
Then regarding that, there was any study done here in the US with that with what are women born in

500
01:05:54,890 --> 01:06:01,190
1900 and the white circle here represent that data because this their problem

501
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:11,929
with working with these type of cohorts that is very difficult to have the exact ages of these participants because usually as you see in Costa Rica,

502
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:22,880
the the study, they were trainees. We had that birth certificate because Costa Rica since 19th century that is have had we are keeping all these data.

503
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:27,470
Then you can look in the birth registry and we know the exact age of those participants.

504
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,720
However, the women in this study, we just asked the participant, How old are you?

505
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,170
Don't remember. They don't remember. They are wrong number.

506
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:43,070
Even sometime we need to ask other relative how old is the person?

507
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:50,929
Then the quality of the data is very murky, I would say for this type of study because we don't know the exact age of those

508
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:56,720
participants then they were done here in the United States is tied in in

509
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:03,350
in in quite this is a role data that the age to the participant according to

510
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:09,020
any sort of information rather than self-reported or using by registry data.

511
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:15,590
However, when they restricted the analysis to people with clean data meaning that they left.

512
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:23,270
So but from writing some document showing the age of that person,

513
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:28,520
that birth year to the person, what they got, what the mortality rate keep increasing.

514
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:35,600
Hmm. Then there is the thing humans we did that I will say is contradictory.

515
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,560
We don't know whether the mortality rate is tabulated after 100 years.

516
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:50,530
Mm hmm. Question. How would you like the evolution of medicine through that amount of time?

517
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:58,900
Like I've said this year, that that's a good question because more Ebola is more there may be better reason.

518
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:04,420
For example, I think penicillin is just from the forties, 1940s.

519
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,180
Then in our evolutionary time is very short.

520
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:19,150
It is ah, maybe a human generation is about 25 years old and from the forties up to now is maybe three generations.

521
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:22,750
Yes, it's just a short time, too, to see any genetic changes.

522
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:33,360
Yeah. But yeah. But that we don't know too many other details of how he's going to shape what you know.

523
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:46,190
Okay. I'm going to stop here. Then let's do a five minute break and we will continue with the discussion.

524
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:51,850
Okay. Okay. Okay.

525
01:08:51,870 --> 01:09:01,490
I'm going to I will talk about this this lie after the break.

526
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:22,109
We are going to continue with the second part of today's lecture, Ideas for the how to talk about these lessons like that.

527
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:24,239
To summarize what we thought in the first part,

528
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:32,759
now we know that that we hear about how fixed and then engagement compared to our primates, even compared to chimpanzee.

529
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:44,579
Now, the genetic evidence suggests that this extended longevity is started to control, maybe with or without.

530
01:09:44,629 --> 01:09:47,158
And even before our species,

531
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:58,218
with the first member of our genus Homo maybe Homo erectus was more of it is about 3 million years ago that that could be related to the estate,

532
01:09:58,219 --> 01:10:02,969
to the use of fire, more eating of all of meat.

533
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:07,649
That could be some of those factors going on right around that time.

534
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:16,139
From our perspective, from the perspective of our evolution for our the interests of our class.

535
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:25,409
This extended longevity, though, now we have will require a distribution of energy allocation, because if we are living longer,

536
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:31,889
we need to expend more energy in growth and maintenance and we want to delay our reproduction.

537
01:10:32,759 --> 01:10:40,739
We will discuss in another lecture developmental plasticity how life history of humans change due to these factors.

538
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:49,918
I think now we are going to discuss the issue of the long life after life in in in women,

539
01:10:49,919 --> 01:10:57,449
in humans are females and how the dietary chief cooking in particular may not play a role in they will be feeling human

540
01:10:57,449 --> 01:11:05,639
activity now and again we are going to discussing another lead lecture about the issue of of how outside medicine,

541
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:09,419
beef, cholesterol or not, these are causative factor.

542
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:18,419
But what I want to mention here is that that April reading seemed to play a key role in the longevity that we observe in humans,

543
01:11:18,809 --> 01:11:31,829
in particular the ALS e three. And if it to the our derive value from the more ancestral e four however that e for earlier seems to be

544
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:37,499
protective against infections that the reason why this could be a still pressing the human population

545
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:43,939
because and these appear is still present you see the high frequency is in these are protective against

546
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:51,539
the infections because you need to remember also when the construction of meat road meat for example,

547
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:59,569
could be related to higher risk of infections. And again, remember how these relate to that.

548
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:04,919
It will be filling up our brain size. We need more time for our brain to grow.

549
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:12,029
We observe, notably in humans, meaning the remaining of juvenile treats that in the adult.

550
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:20,249
Now we live in societies, even with ancestors, they live in societies and maybe they need they needed more time to learn.

551
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:29,699
And then I'm going to stop here and we are going to continue with us as to this discussion.

552
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:45,409
Okay, John, thank. Okay.

553
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:49,799
Here, I'm going to talk more about the evolution of human activity.

554
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:56,069
And we're going to discuss, like, some key points why humans live longer than chimpanzee.

555
01:12:57,419 --> 01:13:08,909
So what are our thoughts about this graph that we can say that the average life of chimp human will be like 30 years longer than chimpanzee.

556
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:16,199
And also, the chimpanzee suffers from an earlier acceleration of mortality rate,

557
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:26,429
which means that their mortality will increase steadily among the like 40 or 50 years old.

558
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:31,109
While like humans mortality rate will increase year late his higher.

559
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:39,089
So as we are, they discuss a lot why humans have a longer life expectancy.

560
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:44,429
So can you like give me some reasons for why when they.

561
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,919
Anyone. Oh, vaccination.

562
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:04,089
Vaccination? Yes. I think that's like for modern humans that you think about it more in the past.

563
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:07,449
Yeah. Or in the past. Yeah. They say what else they store.

564
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:11,349
Oh. For energy allocation.

565
01:14:11,709 --> 01:14:16,239
Yeah. More towards. Yeah. That's for maintenance and growth.

566
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:25,269
Yeah, that's a point. Anything else? Yeah.

567
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:29,369
Yeah, right. Yeah.

568
01:14:29,829 --> 01:14:36,909
So, like, there is like many simple reasons that can you has our life expectancy of I cooked food

569
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:43,959
which means we can have more nutrients and less manufacturing seeing our life and also the

570
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:53,709
increase of consumption which also like for the meds tend like dense nutrition and also the

571
01:14:53,709 --> 01:15:02,229
related evolution and genetic changes as we talked as Edward talked a few minutes ago.

572
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:11,649
And also there's another there are also about the grandmother hypothesis that will like enhance our life expectancy.

573
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:20,709
So first, I will talk a little bit more about the meat consumption like or or I didn't know that

574
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:33,008
communist did not consult much made at way today and we can see ad the graph government

575
01:15:33,009 --> 01:15:44,558
is saying it started like even started before like we could cook cook food and oh compared

576
01:15:44,559 --> 01:15:50,259
with the brain size we can say well we started the man to attain the brain size.

577
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:55,269
We all like growing larger after we get more nutrients.

578
01:15:55,689 --> 01:16:02,648
So as meds can provide like more dense nutrients like vitamin days and B12 purifies

579
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:12,279
and amino acid to your best body like we have largely we expand our life.

580
01:16:12,289 --> 01:16:23,709
Exactly so and however there's some like raised will wait some time to make so the first of

581
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:31,178
risk is the elevated blood cholesterols are which can lead to many diseases such as AIDS,

582
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:39,369
Hamza's and vascular disease. And so kids also high meat consumption will lead to a high per cluster over me.

583
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:48,159
And thirdly, it will also lead to some infections such as HIV, ABLA and mad cow disease.

584
01:16:48,879 --> 01:17:00,129
So human need to like fight against those challenges where they want to like gain some advantages

585
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:12,069
by making assumptions so they like develop some genes to like to fight against those risk.

586
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:20,699
And one of the most important genes is the apple e and we can say the grass here is quite complicated here,

587
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:26,889
but we know that the apple a it's it's works for cholesterol carriers.

588
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:34,599
So it can like carry different types of cholesterol in our blood and yes not sorry for

589
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:41,709
it I think I may to you your work in a study of or myocardial infarction in Costa Rica.

590
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:49,749
I didn't think that we found that it really was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular infarction.

591
01:17:49,869 --> 01:18:00,729
Yeah I tried some does that then that showed down in the Finnish population because there was a Hispanic population that we'll set up protection.

592
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:16,479
So I will go more detailed into the Oppo E J's human contents like three types of A4 engines for the first A4 X-ray,

593
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:21,659
which like is the most distributed airport in J in humans,

594
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:34,029
that's like approximately 65% to 85% of human have that gene which has the ability to find HDL and the second type of APJ,

595
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:42,759
it can bind with out the L and the last the type airport E2 is the less common gene in humans.

596
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:47,379
And with I say the difference is very like they look very similar.

597
01:18:47,379 --> 01:18:53,519
And the only difference is between like the point to point in the over your foot,

598
01:18:55,029 --> 01:19:01,149
they have like two amino acid changes to make the whole like function difference.

599
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:06,129
So during our evolutions we can see high y here.

600
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:13,899
Our ancestor have developed the equal e js during our evolution.

601
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:15,579
Uh oh. Sorry,

602
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:29,138
the airport e three is during our evolution so that we can like decrease our race to get cardiovascular disease or decrease our rates to get to,

603
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,329
like high cholesterol leukemia. Yeah.

604
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:39,608
Also in this graph also as you were the the order you these two are easy three it really two happens.

605
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:43,389
Yeah it wasn't very more noticeable we or you know what is busiest.

606
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:48,279
Yeah. Then almost certainly study for example in the RBD on the console.

607
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:58,509
Right so and except for a holy adaptation,

608
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:07,269
humans also have others adaptations including like gene changes and psychological phases, physical logical changes.

609
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:11,679
The first of what is are lipoprotein a and adequate protein h.

610
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:24,459
This is also like some things will be found high in chimpanzee, but it's will like increased risk in risk of cardiovascular in humans.

611
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:38,529
So like during our evolution way, like gradually we like have some mutation in those kind of genes and will be less produced in humans.

612
01:20:38,979 --> 01:20:41,949
And the second is the need for dietary fat,

613
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:56,139
fat because like we know to digest made that we need carbohydrate and fats during the digestion cycles so the meal fat is like also a

614
01:20:56,409 --> 01:21:10,269
another adaptations to to more maize in humans and the third is also the same age and the C like sialic acids and which is amino acid,

615
01:21:10,749 --> 01:21:22,509
it's not those which is a figure like on the on the cells to like detect some of the Pied Piper genes and human

616
01:21:22,509 --> 01:21:30,039
has these new occasions to like increase their immune allergy and to decrease the risk of getting infections.

617
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:39,489
And the third of prion genes it's also James out here and then develop to like increasing their immunology and decrease infections.

618
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:53,739
And also the cystic fibrosis gene, as we've just said, is another type of G that can help humans decrease infection.

619
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:55,989
And it's a lot.

620
01:21:56,349 --> 01:22:07,449
But that taking we have is that that justice system that we have like a longer length of small intestine to absorb, like the protein better.

621
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:20,109
So here's like something we want to discard together, like all after all the adaptations we have during the evolution,

622
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:31,899
why we are still like to suppose to have like low mids fat, low meat diet like on current days.

623
01:22:36,329 --> 01:22:44,039
Anyone. People who eat more meat proportional to a vegetable, they tend to have a storage issue,

624
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:49,269
which means that the illnesses is about how the process was going.

625
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:55,229
It doesn't come out this direction, but overall it does help their mind.

626
01:22:55,619 --> 01:23:03,039
But however, this part of the body has more issues. So you mean like with more meds, some trail?

627
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:07,979
Yeah. So preferably just consume good meat 3 to 6 hours twice a day.

628
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:12,269
That will be enough to sustain and for the developed development.

629
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:15,839
Yeah, those people tend to do not to too much.

630
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:26,999
And also they do not eat no vegetable because it is you only can eat as much, so too much meat and then not enough vegetable for the microbes.

631
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:30,539
Yeah, right. Like. Yeah, just. That's true.

632
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:40,919
So sad that we can see on the graph that there's like a huge increase of meat consumption like each country is during the last centuries.

633
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:52,168
And even though we have like adaptations in milk consumption that we already consume, like too much mad, that's that we can handle.

634
01:23:52,169 --> 01:24:01,229
So I guess that's the reason why we're like advocates for more healthy diet parties like Mediterranean diet or dash diet.

635
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:12,718
What is dash diet? Well, dash that is like diets to control to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.

636
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:18,049
It's like contains less salt and less meat in the diet pattern.

637
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:24,209
I don't necessarily like meat. It's easier to just generalize meat as the issue.

638
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:29,309
It's like refined carbohydrates does also is a bigger issue.

639
01:24:29,339 --> 01:24:33,568
The world give greater rates of insulin resistance and also the food.

640
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:38,969
We're headed to the meat in the last eight years.

641
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:42,809
Yeah, yep. Yeah. It is going on. A lot of processed meats.

642
01:24:42,959 --> 01:24:49,198
Processed probably. For example, will hydrates increase in sodium?

643
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:52,149
Yeah, right. Insulin resistance like.

644
01:24:52,499 --> 01:24:58,889
Yeah, I feel like it's more yet another thing other than just the meat because we've been eating meat for so long.

645
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:04,409
And also, I don't know, we don't have that in this this last topic,

646
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:12,388
but that it is huge discussion about also whether what is most important to say for control for weight

647
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:20,189
control is the calories per say or the type of or the content of the food and the gets the calories.

648
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,899
Then then that would be a great opportunity I think.

649
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:29,419
Next. Yeah. Well what the intensity level. Yeah, actually level is what we hold it.

650
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:39,029
A lot of consumers today put food, the industry pollutant, all that are fat soluble, including the paint.

651
01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:44,209
Okay, all that stuff. So you had to be stored in a fat, too, and also in the.

652
01:25:44,489 --> 01:25:47,789
The type of fat too. Right, right.

653
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:53,759
That's going really off. But like you said on our computer.

654
01:25:56,699 --> 01:26:01,319
I don't. Yeah, because it's like. Mean is important to get your complete protein.

655
01:26:01,379 --> 01:26:04,379
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. You know, with iron and whatnot.

656
01:26:04,379 --> 01:26:11,539
Like, I feel like there's more benefits to me than there is to, like, refined carbohydrates,

657
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:17,889
snacks, which saw the increase in all these preservatives that were not previously explained.

658
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:19,649
Do you like what you're talking about?

659
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:32,248
So you were saying what you mean from the meat that only if the meat is raised, whole grains under the sun eat the grass that has been fully grown.

660
01:26:32,249 --> 01:26:40,859
And if are raised inside eating grains, those meat doesn't have that much nutrition and more toxicities is proven.

661
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:46,219
Oh, okay. So that will get into,

662
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:57,359
I think also what our last lecture was about these maybe two in one went to this got the epidemiological

663
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:03,509
evidence that that but people now call public dialog with every like CS or whatever it is.

664
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:06,989
So if anything, we just got the ideas.

665
01:27:07,259 --> 01:27:10,699
I will be doing that presentation on Paleo.

666
01:27:11,379 --> 01:27:18,419
Yeah, right. Okay. Okay. So let's move on to the next part about the grandmother theory.

667
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:29,429
I think it's quite self-explanatory. So it's, I guess from the, uh, from the title, we can tell that it's like grandmothers.

668
01:27:29,429 --> 01:27:34,109
Well, health human will have the next generation has a more longer life.

669
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:44,429
And speaking to the grandmothers theory, I have to talk about the channels model because they the graphs here that everything us basis they

670
01:27:44,429 --> 01:27:51,389
have higher mortality which means they need to like have earlier maturation and earlier reproduction.

671
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:55,409
But if we have a lower mortality in that species,

672
01:27:55,409 --> 01:28:08,459
we will like a slower the maturation and we'll get to the like fertile ages when the adults get to a moderate size.

673
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:14,279
And this will have this will lead to the species have more offspring.

674
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:28,709
And so, uh, so we can say the point here, the primate growth rate is slower than non primate mammals and compared with hominids,

675
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:39,329
humans has a higher age in first born while they share the similar fatality decline and human host life include post fertile stage.

676
01:28:39,509 --> 01:28:44,309
While this is the stage that other like primates don't have don't have.

677
01:28:45,389 --> 01:28:53,759
So uh, this is a graph here that you can see that wave out grandmother mothering.

678
01:28:53,909 --> 01:29:02,129
We can see the expected life expectancy will like, uh, will decrease to around 30 years.

679
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:08,819
But waving the grandmothers carrying the life can be much longer than expected.

680
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:16,169
Some ecological scenario shows that there are females in the hominids will subsidize

681
01:29:16,169 --> 01:29:24,359
their own juveniles and this will like spare much time for the mothers of the child.

682
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:35,639
And the mothers will like can spend more time to like finding food or like gave birth to another generations.

683
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:42,569
So when grandmother is taking care of the offspring,

684
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:54,389
this will like increase the survival rate among the juveniles and the results will be like slowed aging and lengthen the survival time.

685
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:59,549
Some theories also like proposed stats,

686
01:29:59,549 --> 01:30:06,058
many foundations of other human features like skill of learning and right brain

687
01:30:06,059 --> 01:30:14,009
expansion hunting paternal probation is also developed after the grandmother theories.

688
01:30:16,529 --> 01:30:22,359
And here are some of the features of the grandmother theories because they the there

689
01:30:22,409 --> 01:30:26,699
are some behavior findings including that help the grandmother will help their own

690
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:33,898
grandchild children and sometimes if there there is like some offsprings don't have their

691
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:40,649
own mothers or fathers that the grandmother we're also taking care of those children.

692
01:30:41,099 --> 01:30:51,599
And also it's an interesting theory that some grandmother will like taking more care of the offspring with shared ex grandsons.

693
01:30:51,929 --> 01:31:02,409
So like if. If they are taking care of their songs, songs like grand songs.

694
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:09,229
So they will like pay less attention to their grand source compared to their like granddaughters.

695
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:14,419
I just read the front pages because of that.

696
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:19,759
Yeah. That sharing with that X chromosome. Yeah. But in general, you know, that's that's an interesting fact.

697
01:31:19,769 --> 01:31:24,019
What is it that good. I'm bothered because the, um, the, you know,

698
01:31:24,019 --> 01:31:34,968
how innovative is how how with proportion when genes grant pardons share with their grandkids a quarter upward.

699
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:38,679
And yet then according to evolutionary theory, ah,

700
01:31:39,109 --> 01:31:53,119
let's say a grandmother helping two grandkids it will be that thing like that help been there won't keep you from motivated theory thing because what

701
01:31:53,119 --> 01:32:01,339
evolutionary theory say that we are more likely to have from one they genetically related to us because we are indirectly helping our own genes.

702
01:32:02,449 --> 01:32:06,169
Yeah, they're interesting. Yeah.

703
01:32:06,379 --> 01:32:13,969
And besides of behavioral findings, there is also like a physiological findings.

704
01:32:14,449 --> 01:32:21,529
Uh, the first is the adrenal androgen. The, um, there's a substance is called the edge.

705
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:31,309
Yeah. As in menopausal men. So we can find the higher of those substances in weight in human than chimpanzees.

706
01:32:34,369 --> 01:32:46,099
Which means, like, uh. Yeah, we provide find a higher dosing insurance.

707
01:32:46,309 --> 01:32:51,709
And the second physical find is if the telomere length that's human is like the

708
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:57,949
shortest telomere length in elder and this will protect you from cancer development.

709
01:32:58,369 --> 01:33:11,539
So I guess the two physical logical findings is raising why I like human will live in a menopausal age then compared with chimpanzees

710
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:19,819
and other findings included that grandmothers will cook for their offsprings and to promote their offspring survival rate,

711
01:33:20,299 --> 01:33:30,438
and also for that logical fact that they can in the bedroom, like better life provided provided by the grandmother,

712
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:40,669
will likely increase the neurological development of their offspring and will also increase like social sensitivity of their child.

713
01:33:42,289 --> 01:33:50,119
Yeah, you need to to think here about where it will all come before the development of writing,

714
01:33:51,229 --> 01:33:55,139
whether or not it was passed from generation to generation through just foreign communication.

715
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:04,819
The now we are able to read that we can get the knowledge from previous knowledge and therapies in writing by reading.

716
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:13,559
But you can imagine in the past now the I mean, your grandmother or grandparents in Vietnam to be with their grandkids to pass that knowledge.

717
01:34:13,729 --> 01:34:22,999
For example, for the animal or the type of plant that they needed to do by there, that they were possible through oral communication.

718
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:27,499
Yeah. The skills were important to learn during that time.

719
01:34:27,649 --> 01:34:39,649
Mm hmm. And here I want to ask that and the like if there's any questions about this theory.

720
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:45,349
Do you believe that you're really finding. Yeah. Do you find that, like, credible?

721
01:34:45,729 --> 01:34:59,589
Yeah. People ask me like what to do, what to cook and how to cook.

722
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,559
I said, You have to do what your grandma does.

723
01:35:03,569 --> 01:35:14,239
Just have to go back in time and do the more authentic way, not just by places, things, and just just in the school.

724
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:18,769
Because that's what. Yeah. Getting underneath you already has.

725
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:24,769
I feel yourself. I need that theoretical foundation very strong.

726
01:35:25,549 --> 01:35:31,019
And, uh. Yeah, because at least from what it is, and I'm not a grandmother fully, but from other respect,

727
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:38,148
we know that what we see on SBC is individual tend to have all that the genetically

728
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:44,779
related they make sense these grandmother to your your game now mother women

729
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:49,848
are able to leave and they are going to help to over I mean with the next

730
01:35:49,849 --> 01:35:58,649
generation I mean of why I must be in it is like what if a person never reproduce.

731
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:06,269
You know what I mean? It doesn't have to be a grandmother who goes through menopause, what it's like.

732
01:36:06,839 --> 01:36:11,979
You just don't want to reproduce after a certain age. We're helping out at the villages.

733
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:22,429
Why? Why do we have to have this, like, significant? Biological change in behavior that now you have to be.

734
01:36:23,959 --> 01:36:28,709
Yes. Maybe like for younger women,

735
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:37,588
they need to do more heavier jobs and to support the village rather than like a child

736
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:50,218
carrying the maybe like jobs that the contents or like I don't know maybe there's another

737
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:57,869
like thing I think important in the grandmother is does the grandma can't allow that

738
01:36:57,869 --> 01:37:08,579
the mothers to give more newborns without like without like a time to relax you know,

739
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:19,018
if you like without the grandmother the mother way like taking care of the child for like y years to make sure that they can like grow to that age,

740
01:37:19,019 --> 01:37:28,349
that they can survive all by themselves. But I saw them during which time the mothers cannot, like, give birth to another offsprings.

741
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:32,519
So I guess that's a point. Why there is.

742
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:41,809
Yeah, but also we are a new point for that, that it's possible that uh, like we see it in others especially grows.

743
01:37:42,059 --> 01:37:45,649
If you're on the bottom of the pile, you're not allowed to be single mom.

744
01:37:46,169 --> 01:37:53,479
So they're all supporting the, the higher dominant group they are actually reproducing.

745
01:37:53,849 --> 01:38:00,659
So I'm saying, like, if that was our structure, why would we need a grandmother theory and this early menopause?

746
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:04,439
Because we don't we haven't been back in time how the structure was.

747
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:23,559
I see your point yet. Um, if for to answer that we really do like that we have um, from chi or day that will become very type of society.

748
01:38:23,559 --> 01:38:25,589
You say where your grandmother,

749
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:36,179
they don't have another group of grandmother and then to see whether we'll have these extended will give the after menopause.

750
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:40,949
But yeah that would be like that everything is very not that would be.

751
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:51,119
Yeah. I personally think it would be hard to find as you grandfathers grandkids that's how we of time

752
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:59,999
getting older you have a class right you have to know so but ah so there's are some classes.

753
01:39:00,009 --> 01:39:01,889
I'm like uh,

754
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:15,568
our grandmother explained of longevity male and also like the reasonable number of elder people accelerated with like a lower number of young people.

755
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:19,589
This is a salary like, like provided by other like centers.

756
01:39:19,589 --> 01:39:26,129
This said that. Yeah, so this is like control controversy service to each other.

757
01:39:27,209 --> 01:39:40,919
And of this my other things I have left question woman because on what you were saying that when people think like you have

758
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:51,389
to keep well up and make the fire in the grammar and a lot like with health and therefore to develop with older people,

759
01:39:51,629 --> 01:39:58,018
they have delayed one of the chronic ailments. So they do have some wisdoms and they pass on to the grandchildren.

760
01:39:58,019 --> 01:40:01,499
Yet love me or not, it does that. That's important.

761
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:05,279
Okay, before we leave, let me. Yes, thank you.

762
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:11,579
You've done. That was great. Then we don't have class next Monday.

763
01:40:12,419 --> 01:40:20,639
It's a study. They study this year. Then I up with your you have midterms next week in an execution day.

764
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:28,199
Okay then good luck. Then I will post homework and the whole world will be with you two week from today.

765
01:40:29,069 --> 01:40:32,939
If you don't, you don't need to fill me in. Nothing for next Monday.

766
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:37,079
I will see you in two weeks. Good luck with your midterms.

767
01:40:38,429 --> 01:40:41,339
Enjoy your classes. Be.
