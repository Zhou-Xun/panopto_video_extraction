1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:08,740
Any questions in general. You know, it's so yeah.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,780
Last time we talked about equity and really that's something that we hadn't really talked about the entire class.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,580
And that's something that traditionally is not part of standard cost effective.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,660
So I think people are realizing that's an important consideration.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:36,900
And so people are trying to quantify that and quantify the equity impacts on things that I'm focused on will be do think a week from yesterday or or.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,250
It's due next Monday. Is that right? Um, yeah.

7
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,270
So. So if you have questions about that, let me know when to switch gears a little bit.

8
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,220
We're going to talk about budgeting.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,399
And this is something that isn't I mean, if I'm going to do a Venn diagram here of things, I mean, we have kind of,

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:11,299
you know, cost effectiveness analysis and um, well, I guess kind of, you know, budget impact analysis.

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,290
There's some overlap. It's not necessarily cost effective analysis. Some of the things that we do expect results overlap with budget impact analysis.

12
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,210
And I think it's about it's relevant to the policy questions as well.

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,680
So with this, we'll talk about the policy process kind of briefly, then talk about budgeting in general and then budget impact analysis.

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,089
How is it different aspect themselves? How does one go through this budget impact analysis?

15
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,020
And we'll go through some examples here.

16
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:47,260
Any questions before we get started here? So as we've been talking about cost effectiveness,

17
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,560
it's important to kind of think about the perspective of the analysis, who is doing, who's doing the analysis?

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,190
What do they care about? Oftentimes in this class,

19
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,849
what I'll say we should do a societal cost benefit analysis to take into account all the costs and benefits regardless of who's making those payments.

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,149
So it might be the insurance company.

21
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:15,010
Government individuals would want to gather all those costs, care with the with payers in a societal level, want us to look at all of those costs.

22
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,190
And those costs might not that you read pieces of paper being passed between people on Venmo transactions or whatever.

23
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:29,859
This might be a really hard economic cost of someone having to spend 30 minutes driving to the doctor's office,

24
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,210
waiting in a waiting room for half an hour, etc., etc., all those things anyway.

25
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,320
So that's a lot of analysis. We can also look at the health care system and say, okay, how much does the health care system pay?

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,350
So that might be a different perspective where we don't include some of those costs.

27
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:54,160
But when we're thinking about actual actors, it might be the perspective of the nursing home, it might be the perspective of the insurance.

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
The private insurance company might be the perspective of a public insurance company. It might be the perspective of a hospital.

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,490
All those different players have different perspectives on things, and that's something important to think about for budgeting purposes.

30
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,180
So if you're Blue Cross Blue Shield, you have to budget and plan for what you have to spend.

31
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,559
And Mrs. Jones has to spend $5 to take the bus here and park and her time off work.

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,380
And so that's not a cost use Blue Cross have to budget for okay so the budget that

33
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,800
perspective is going to be slightly different from our budget impact analysis here.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,970
I also want to highlight here what we are learning about this entire semester and about cost of our houses is value.

35
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,970
How valuable is this intervention? But that doesn't tell us do we have the money or how much money do we need to pay for this kind of thing?

36
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,690
And that's a separate question here, a budget impact analysis.

37
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,160
And for the politics and law and the policymaking process. You know, Scott Garrett and the German hierarchy can give you some more insights here.

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:11,060
Also, I just want to say, too, when the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence, Health and Clinical Excellence,

39
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:20,000
they when they ask for a cost effective analysis from from manufacturers who are producing new pharmaceutical drugs,

40
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,340
they also ask for a budget impact analysis. And oftentimes, U.S. private payers might ask for that as well.

41
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,930
So these things from are R&D.

42
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,510
When we're thinking about budgeting, there are different ways, I think, of budgeting early in state within the federal system.

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,610
There is no requirement that the US federal government have a balanced budget.

44
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,820
States are different in that regard. Michigan, for example, does have a requirement that the budget be balanced.

45
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,190
And so these things are important. And when you think about programs like Medicaid, that is a state program.

46
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,450
And so Medicaid needs to think carefully about how much they're spending and

47
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,020
precisely kind of how much they think they'll be spending and make sure that,

48
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:08,730
you know, incoming revenues to the state are equal to outflows. And oftentimes, Medicaid is one of the largest state expenses in the budget.

49
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:19,200
So that's an important part of state budgeting. Also within the federal system, we kind of think about things as a somewhat artificial distinction,

50
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,610
but people talk about a lot is this distinction between mandatory and discretionary funding.

51
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:32,520
And some things are considered mandatory. And so these just kind of keep on being spent no matter what kind of cut.

52
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,189
Typically what Congress is saying, but some things that are considered mandatory, they're health related.

53
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,219
Here are Medicare spending and vaccines for children.

54
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:49,080
So these are things that are not I mean, are considered mandatory, although I would say in the end, it's all it's all discretionary.

55
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,920
And Congress can change your mind about these things at any point anyway.

56
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,020
So we have these things we like to think about as budgets.

57
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,870
Sometimes they're considered more kind of fixed, like the state of Michigan has balanced budget requirements.

58
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,790
The federal government has no legal requirement that it be balanced.

59
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,079
But in the end, if they keep on spending, on spending a lot of money, they do run into trouble.

60
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,580
And so they they do want to keep track of spending and make sure they don't want to too much anyway.

61
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:30,000
So in the end here, this budget impact analysis can be relevant for both federal and state and of course private organizations as well.

62
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,280
And so we'll get into what is this budget impact analysis in a few minutes here.

63
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,599
But specifically, but again, cost effectiveness analysis is really value for money.

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,810
Is this a good value? Is this something worth spending money on?

65
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,620
And that's a separate question from the budget impact analysis, which is how much will this cost and not only how much will it cost,

66
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,730
but when will I have to make those those payments or that's when will I have to make those expenses?

67
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:09,120
So my example here is let's say you're living as roommates and they say, hey, go pick up some bath tissue at Costco.

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,670
So you got your $20 bill in your pocket and you go over to Costco.

69
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:27,720
And Costco has two different options here. You can get a window of 96 rolls for $63.98, or even the Kleenex brand for ten rolls for $9.99.

70
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:38,130
Now, from from a value perspective, the winds off, you know, which are going to apply to the value here is $0.67 per roll.

71
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,780
And the value of Kleenex here is $0.99 per roll. That's how much you're paying for roll back tissue.

72
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:53,380
So which one is a better value for money? Let's assume they have an equivalent for the.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,870
Winds up right here. And this is our cost effectiveness measure here.

74
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,030
Dollars in this case, dollar per go about tissue. So, Dr. Point, this is a measure of value.

75
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,870
How how good of a deal is this? And so wins offers is a better value for money terms, $0.67 per roll.

76
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:20,840
We like spending less money to get the things we want. So wins offers a better value for money for remember, you walked into Costco with a $20 bill.

77
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,639
Which one is actually affordable? In a Kleenex brand.

78
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,730
Right. This is something that you do. You have the budget to spend.

79
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:38,700
So. So windsock. Yes. It's a better value for money, but it might not be affordable and Kleenex might be less valuable, but it is affordable.

80
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,429
And so that's, I guess, the distinction I want to make here between cost effectiveness analysis and the budget

81
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,210
impact analysis is cost effective is is really asking if you're a value question,

82
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,809
is this a good value for money? And budget impact analysis is trying to understand, is this affordable?

83
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,730
How much you know, how much will we have to spend?

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,840
Now, again, with that said with with budget is budgets here, I will say very rarely do we see cases where.

85
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,889
Well, occasionally we see cases. Very rarely do we see guys go where we find something that looks really valuable.

86
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:17,490
But it's really, really expensive. It would be hard to pay for. We'll talk about that in a little bit.

87
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,840
So again, it's it's this budget impact analysis, though, is routinely kind of asked for.

88
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,860
This is an example quote from the readings you had here today, you know, again,

89
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,010
highlighting the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence or nice in the UK,

90
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,200
the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia at managed care organizations in the United States.

91
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,640
They say here submit estimates of both the cost effectiveness of course,

92
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,500
but then the likely impact of the new health care interventions on national regional budgets.

93
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,240
So again, these organizations want not only value information.

94
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,560
How valuable is this? But also what's the total budget here?

95
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,120
How much you're going to spend? And part of this, too, is if you really are looking for something as high value.

96
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,100
So if you really want to buy the the wince off toilet paper at Costco, you need to know the budget.

97
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,890
So you can come into Costco with $64 in your pocket instead of $10.

98
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,930
So this is budgeting is is an important part of the overall kind of policy process.

99
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,470
So one thing that's going to be slightly different, again, as I talked about, is the perspective.

100
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,330
So the perspective of a cost effectiveness analysis, oftentimes, we're will recommend that it be a societal level analysis sometimes,

101
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,420
although they in the UK National Institute for Health and Excellence recommends a health system perspective.

102
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,070
But it's it might even be more specific for a budget impact analysis.

103
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,639
And so it really depends on the budget holder that you're trying to convince.

104
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,300
And sometimes that budget wants you to break down into different groups here.

105
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,100
So if you're thinking about some sort of pharmaceutical spending and maybe you just want to look at the pharmacy budget or a hospital,

106
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,620
what's their budget or state? If you're doing something for Michigan Medicaid, you don't want another state budget in the UK.

107
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,390
They want to know the national health system budget. So it really depends on that kind budget holder that you're talking to.

108
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:29,730
And oftentimes, even if you're talking to Michigan and state Medicaid, they might have different kind of sub buckets within Medicaid.

109
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:37,360
And so you might want to break it out and say, okay, I'm going to spend this much on pharmacy and this much on inpatient services.

110
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,880
They're spending much in outpatient so they can, you know, have a plan for that going forward.

111
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,500
You know, golf and a little bit of a tangent. So our pharmaceutical costs increasing.

112
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,740
Is that a problem? Yeah. So that may be a problem.

113
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,160
I've heard an argument. This is like over ten years ago, though,

114
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:10,340
that maybe increasing pharmaceutical costs are not a problem if they help us avoid other other costs in health care system.

115
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,720
So if you give someone your expensive statins, that's expensive.

116
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:22,460
But if you can if we're spending more on statins but it keeps people out of the hospital for heart attacks, maybe that's a good thing.

117
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,040
So maybe it's just the mix is changing. No, I don't think that's I think we're actually everything is expanding.

118
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,190
It's not just pharmaceuticals, but I think it's important to know the budgets in different areas and and one area.

119
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,590
It is possible that maybe you spend more on pharmaceuticals and less on inpatient care or something like that.

120
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,500
And so if you think you have an intervention, it's some sort of magical pill that can keep people out of hospital.

121
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,250
It's good to know that from a budget perspective so you can spend money on the

122
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,680
pills and also plan for the savings in your inpatient part of your budget.

123
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:07,670
Okay. One other thing to think about for this budget impact analysis is this idea of a distinction between an open and closed contract.

124
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,950
And when we're oftentimes when we're thinking about a cost effectiveness analysis,

125
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:20,900
we'll typically think about this in terms of a what I call a closed cohort, although the.

126
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,880
The group in here looking at the cigaret bands.

127
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,620
That one actually is more of an open court. But let me explain what I'm talking about.

128
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:40,920
Here was an open versus closed courts. So a closed court means we we start with some people and we follow them over time.

129
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,720
So we we start with a thousand and almost every kind of moral model of the judiciary that I read showing you this.

130
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,060
So far, this class has been a closed court.

131
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,170
So we start with a thousand people with some horrible disease.

132
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,720
And we follow that cohort for the next ten years of the life and see how their disease progresses.

133
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Are they alive? Are they dead? What happens with that initial cohort of a thousand people with some audiences?

134
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:16,560
Or within one region. We start with one representative person born and we follow that person through the rest of their life.

135
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,100
So that's a close call. We start with some population and we just we watch that same population over time.

136
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,840
And open cohort means people can move in and out of that cohort.

137
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,610
So, for example, if someone was Asian, we'll walk through an example of this in a few minutes.

138
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,340
We start with a thousand people with some horrible disease. Next year they progress.

139
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,040
And maybe if we're an insurance plan, maybe some of those people leave our insurance plan and maybe some new people will develop some form of disease.

140
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,009
So they've got people coming in and falling in and out of our cohort.

141
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:54,839
So we call that open cohort with the with the cigaret banning project in this class,

142
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,590
they're thinking about people turning 18, not being allowed to smoke.

143
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,700
Cigarets. And that would start in 2030, let's say.

144
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,220
So in 2030, a certain cohort of people are going to turn 18 and be ordering I can't smoke cigarets.

145
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,370
And then in 2031, a new cohort of people turning 18 are saying, Oh man, I can't smoke cigarets.

146
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,300
And then in 2032, a new cohort of people are going to turn 18, say, Oh man, I can't smoke cigarets.

147
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,700
And so each each year you've got new people kind of entering your population, turning 18 and being affected by this policy.

148
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,770
So that would be an open court where you have kind of births and deaths or people kind of moving into your

149
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,990
health plan and meeting your health plan or people coming into your country and leaving your country.

150
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,110
Immigration. Immigration. So that would be a an open cohort where you have people kind of coming in and leaving your cohort.

151
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,860
And so your cohort is kind of dynamically evolving over time to death in that regard,

152
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,630
leaving and entering the college and for budget impact analysis, that open cohort is helpful or useful.

153
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:03,850
So if you're thinking about planning for if you're Blue Cross Blue Shield to think about, you're covering people with some horrible disease.

154
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,020
You need to know how many you have. So hold this today and what's going to happen to them over time.

155
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,410
But how many new people are going to develop some horrible disease next year?

156
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,400
And your policy is going to cover them. We're even going outside of the idea of some policies, maybe a hepatitis C treatment.

157
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,330
So maybe let's say you're the prison system and you have to budget for for paying for expensive hepatitis C treatment.

158
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,140
So, you know, how many people have hep C in your in your population today, but maybe some of them are going to get released next year.

159
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,610
And then you've got some new people coming into the prison next year also who might have hep C.

160
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,100
And so you need to think about this dynamic open cohort where some people have hep C, they're being treated, they're leaving.

161
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,350
New people are coming in with Hep C. And so you need to think about this in terms of an open cohort.

162
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,140
Again, the close cohort is what we have been looking at before and we say, okay, we've got a thousand people with hep C.

163
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,110
Let's let's consider what happens to them if we treat them or don't treat them and follow that same cohort over time.

164
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:08,850
It's open cohort is is people coming in and leaving our whatever population is we care about.

165
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,570
Any questions? We'll see an example of this in a few minutes here.

166
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:27,540
Another thing to think about for a budget, really, for cost service policies and budget impact analysis is your time horizon.

167
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,220
And you want to think about the time horizon relevant to the budget folder.

168
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,419
And oftentimes with the cost effectiveness analyzes, we'll add, we'll advocate for the societal perspective,

169
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,300
look at everyone's costs and benefits over all time and really for the time horizon,

170
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,170
kind of almost infinite time horizon or the time horizon of the life of the population.

171
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,770
So maybe over 100 years. And that will be, you know, simulating the costs and benefits of this policy, usually a very long time period.

172
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,330
For budget impact analysis, you want to think about what is the time horizon, the budget impact or budget holder really cares about?

173
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,750
And oftentimes that's oftentimes a shorter time horizon.

174
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:14,640
So that's something to to think about as well. Think about the Congressional Budget Office in the United States here.

175
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,669
Typically, no budget, though. They'll do some sort of budget impact analysis costing for the next maybe ten years.

176
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,590
And I'll present some like here's the ten year cost of this program. And then actually you see a bunch of shenanigans.

177
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,270
When people design their bills, they say, like, oh, we're going to, you know.

178
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,790
And actually there is something in that. This is a long time ago, the Affordable Care Act, where they wanted to cover long term care.

179
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:48,260
So as many of you know, Medicare does not really cover long term nursing home care, the cover for a short period of time.

180
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,810
But I mean, if you are an elderly person and you end up, you know,

181
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,860
declining in health and you need full time nursing care for the next, you know, last five years of your life or something like that.

182
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,330
Medicare is not going to cover that.

183
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,300
They'll cover kind of short term reference nursing staff or hospitalization, but typically they're not going to cover long term nursing care.

184
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:17,750
So the Affordable Care Act, they proposed a new insurance plan where they force everyone to pay for long term care insurance.

185
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,890
And then this this insurance fund would pay for your long term care.

186
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,160
And and the premiums look really low and look really attractive.

187
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,950
But the way it works, though, is they made everyone pay for it.

188
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,740
And the way they kind of the math and it worked out is it was going to it was going to bring in a ton of premiums in the first ten years,

189
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,390
and it wasn't going to pay much out in terms of long term care utilization.

190
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,889
But and so it looked like a big budget winner in the first ten years.

191
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:59,660
But actually, if you go on beyond ten years, it was going to be a huge, huge drain when a bunch of baby boomers kind of needed long term care.

192
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,780
And but but anyway, because of the budget shenanigans or, you know,

193
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,070
the way it's structured where they just were looking at budgets in the first ten years,

194
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:15,050
it missed out on that huge, gigantic liability, if you will, for paying for baby boomers in long term care anyway.

195
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,150
So think about the time horizon and think about, you know, what is the appropriate time horizon for.

196
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:30,770
For people and also in a cost effective analysis, I've been kind of driving home the idea of net present value and looking at and turning everything.

197
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:37,850
So if we got to cost today and tomorrow and next year and the year after that, we want to turn that all into a single net present value.

198
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:47,570
So if I just spend $10,000 next year, I want to turn that into a $9,800 or whatever it is, net present value cost.

199
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:56,340
And so that stream of costs and benefits in the future just gets aggregated into a single today's net present value dollar.

200
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,050
And that's, that's very useful for thinking about value. But when I think about budgeting, I need to know when do I need to spend that money?

201
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,700
Do I need to spend $10,000 today or 20000 hours next year and plan for all that?

202
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,190
And so for a budget impact analysis, we want period by period levels of expenses.

203
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:20,120
Do we not know how much money do I need today, how much my the next year, the year after that and that to plan for that.

204
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:31,520
So just as an example here again, maybe I spent $2 million today and I get $1 million each or let's say I've got $2 million, right, in 2025.

205
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:41,420
I mean, make this $2 million investment. But in 2026, 37, 28, 29, 2030, I'm going to get $1,000,000 now from a with reasonable discount rates.

206
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,320
That should look like a big winner in terms of net present value.

207
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:56,329
It would be valuable. I would get a lot of, you know, this $5 million gain even though it's over five years.

208
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,870
So it would probably outweigh the $2 million initial investment.

209
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:08,000
But from a budget impact. So this would probably be a positive net present value in terms of gains.

210
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,270
But from a budget perspective, I need to know to have $2 million in the bank in 2025 to pay for this thing.

211
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,650
And then I can plan to have $1,000,000 each of the next year that maybe take a loan and

212
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:25,100
then I can pay for it the next 3 to 4 years with those million dollar gains of getting in,

213
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,660
the next four years after that.

214
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,850
So from a budgeting kind of financing perspective, it's important for me to know when those cash flows are going to occur.

215
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:42,610
Any questions? The next thing is, how do we think about costs?

216
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:53,540
And in the in the kind of world of the economists and cost effective analysis, we think about what is the real opportunity cost of this.

217
00:22:53,560 --> 00:23:04,330
So if we force Mrs. Jones to go to the clinic and get some sort of screening test, Mrs. Jones time going,

218
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,060
getting in her car, driving, parking, waiting, waiting room, being in the hospital and so forth.

219
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:19,030
That is all an opportunity cost. Even though Mrs. Jones might not be earning a wage, that was her leisure time that we took away from her.

220
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,440
And that is a real kind of economic cost. But from a budget impact analysis, we really want to know what are the transaction prices.

221
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,670
And so here's also something what's different between the well.

222
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,520
I guess in the kind of cost versus charge discussion we had a few weeks ago.

223
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,799
I still wouldn't use charges unless you got to pay or who actually has to pay.

224
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,600
The charges has negotiated something. You use whatever the negotiated prices are for.

225
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,020
So if you want to if you're doing a budget impact analysis for Blue Cross Blue Shield, you want to know what are their transaction prices?

226
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,110
What are they paying for delivery of a baby, heart attack, a stroke in the hospital?

227
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,470
What are they what are their actual transaction prices that they have to pay for those for those things?

228
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,460
And we're not really worrying about the opportunity costs. Also, you might want to think of our system capacity.

229
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,690
So Blue Cross Blue Shield has 100 people sitting in their call center or something where twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do.

230
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,700
And then you give them something to do and you can redeploy those people with without any kind of additional cost to your business.

231
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,170
And that's that is kind of free labor, too.

232
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,680
Yes. So for that, not considering opportunity costs,

233
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,040
is that because like part of it is that especially when it's the government, it's like the opportunity.

234
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,360
Opportunity costs are somewhat infinite. Like if you don't spend money on X, like there's like a billion other things you could spend money on.

235
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,719
Or like, I guess that that just does not make sense to me because like, especially in government,

236
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,480
like there's a fixed amount of money and there's things you could other things you can always spend the money in London.

237
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,499
Mm hmm. Yeah, well, I think. Well, it depends, though.

238
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,470
I mean, the state. The state government. Yeah.

239
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,180
If they if they don't spend the money, you know, they have a surplus that they can put in a rainy day fund for the next year.

240
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:26,440
And then or what do you and the federal government can't kind of print more money if they if they want it or what?

241
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,740
What are your thoughts? I mean, what are your concerns about this opportunity cost?

242
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,219
Yeah, I mean, I guess I mean, I just think about like the federal budget,

243
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,580
like just this enormous quantity is devoted to seniors in terms of Social Security and Medicare.

244
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,069
And like obviously people pay into that over their lifetime.

245
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:51,360
But like the opportunity cost is that like we're not spending money on like maternal health and child care and things like that.

246
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,310
That would boost the number of workers eventually who would pay in to support all the like.

247
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,209
To me, that's a very obvious opportunity cause we're it's like you're spending too much on seniors.

248
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,250
You're not spending enough on like babies and having people to support those systems in the future.

249
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:14,970
Yeah. So I guess for the purposes of a budget impact analysis, we're not going to we're not going to count that as a as a cost.

250
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:24,360
So if we spend, you know, $100,000 on long term care for the elderly, we're not going to say, ooh,

251
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,460
that's $100 we could spend on childhood vaccines to make sure we have healthy kids to be in the workforce in the future.

252
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,510
But that that should be a separate, I guess, from a budget impact analysis.

253
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,959
We we'd consider that a separate discussion about, you know, what?

254
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,630
And that's that's actually really a good value question, I think about what is the value of investing in,

255
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,420
you know, childhood vaccines and things like that to to have a healthy workforce in the future?

256
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,840
Yeah. And the budget impact analysis is less, less concerned about, you know,

257
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,830
whether this is a good it actually is kind of agnostic about whether it's good value or not.

258
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,080
And it doesn't even look at any of the health benefits.

259
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,100
It's just saying, how many dollars do we need if if we want to, let's say, have free long term care for seniors?

260
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:19,650
How much is that going to cost us? So if Medicare is now going to say we're going to cover long term care for anyone over 65,

261
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,770
you know, how much are we going to have to spend to do that?

262
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,250
And then I think it's a separate question about is that a worthwhile investment in and if we spend,

263
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,490
you know, $7 trillion on long term care for seniors,

264
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:41,430
that means we don't have $7 trillion for for schools or we're going to tax the [INAUDIBLE] out of working people like you yourselves will be and,

265
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:50,160
you know, 6 to 9 months or whatever, you know, then that's going to reduce your ability to to do great things as well.

266
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,780
And so this is kind of a separate question from this budget. I would say the budget make us less relevant because that's going to tell you,

267
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,310
here's how much money we're spending on this that that that is going to maybe crowd out some other really valuable things.

268
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:14,950
Yeah. So I think there's some interesting questions, though, about for this budget impact analysis.

269
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,910
You know, what kind of system capacity do you have?

270
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,910
If you don't have some sort of capacity, then you're gonna have to invest a lot to build new capacity for that.

271
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,270
And then what's happening to productivity?

272
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:33,620
If you are if you think you're increasing the productivity of whatever system it is that you're you're organizing,

273
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,450
then yes, you probably would include that if you're doing something that would make your people more effective.

274
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:47,930
But if again, if I'm in the loop, if if I'm taking this analysis from the perspective of Medicare and I do something that

275
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,680
helps someone be more productive at home or actually let's let's say Medicare again,

276
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,860
Medicare is not just people who are 65 hours work or disabled.

277
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:08,480
If I can do something that that eliminates some sort of debt or cure some sort of disability and makes them more productive.

278
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,130
Medicare wouldn't count that as part of their, you know, in a budget impact analysis necessarily.

279
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,590
But that that is a real that could be something really valuable for society but it

280
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,489
might not be included in a budget impact analysis for from Medicare perspective,

281
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,760
yes disabled persons like able to get back into the workforce and like pay into Medicare.

282
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,790
They wouldn't count that, correct?

283
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,190
Yeah, Medicare probably wouldn't count that.

284
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,830
And so that I think highlights though, if you're doing this budget impact analysis from Medicare's perspective,

285
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,280
you're missing out on that big benefit. Yeah. And so that's something to be aware.

286
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,950
Aware of is these budget impact analysis analyzes might not include some really important things we care about.

287
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,470
Yeah. Or if you're looking at what you know,

288
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:02,130
make sure you understand the perspective and what they include and what they might be excluding from the analysis as well.

289
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,580
Okay. So this budget impact analysis, these are the types of inputs that they require.

290
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,230
The first is the size and the characteristics of the affected population.

291
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,220
So maybe this is people on Medicare with a certain type of disability.

292
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,649
Maybe it is people with some horrible disease or children with a heart defect.

293
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:32,110
Thinking about this and we're making some procedures. So what is the what are the characteristics of this population and the size of them as well?

294
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:41,670
So how many people have this pediatric heart defect? How many how many people have this disability in and in Medicare?

295
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,830
And then also the and you can think about this in the epidemiological perspective, your prevalence and incidence.

296
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:55,200
So problems is how many people have it and then incidence is how many new people are going to develop this over time,

297
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:04,800
what kind of come into our open cohort with this. Then the next thing we need is the current intervention mix without the new intervention.

298
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,870
So what are people getting today without this new, new intervention?

299
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,960
So if it's the thing about the film, one rank and shine procedure for pediatric heart defects,

300
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,560
maybe today 100% of people are getting some more procedure. But you need to know kind of today what are people getting today?

301
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:30,690
And then for your budget impact analysis, if you think about a change, what is the what is what is the new intervention mix?

302
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,020
So if so, we need to know kind of currently what are people getting maybe 1% of people wearing this procedure,

303
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,750
what are the costs of that current intervention mix?

304
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,560
And then this new intervention you mix, you're considering maybe Iris is try to get everyone the rink intent procedure,

305
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,740
by the way, maybe the rink procedure is not appropriate for her.

306
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:57,290
So maybe I think if I switch, I'm wondering if I switch to a rink and try and maybe only 80% of people get rink shine 20% more.

307
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:05,100
So I feel more so what does that new intervention mix look like for for budgeting, planning and then what's the cost of that new intervention mix?

308
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,070
And not only what's the cost of the intervention, so more expensive,

309
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:16,050
maybe that example because it's just the surgical procedure itself, but with some other conditions.

310
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,470
Let's say that some horrible disease, it's not only the pills you're giving people, but there are long term health costs as well.

311
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,540
So it's the use and costs of other health condition related health care services.

312
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,670
So what are those long term costs as well?

313
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,410
And actually, from from Medicare's perspective, if they could if they could cure someone's disability,

314
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,990
they'd have we'd think about what's the costs to of the intervention to cure that disability.

315
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:49,290
But then maybe Medicare would really zero out their spending on that person because that person would no longer be disabled.

316
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,970
They don't want to be Medicare enrollee.

317
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:58,200
And then Medicare would not have their long term costs of that health condition and treat related health care services.

318
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,129
But Medicare wouldn't count their productivity likely in this budget impact analysis,

319
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:11,940
so that wouldn't really affect Medicare as much as it would affect the IRS tax revenue, but it wouldn't affect Medicare's spending.

320
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,920
So again, it's important to understand that, you know, if you're reading about the Democrats,

321
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,960
you know, what do they consider to be the boundaries or the perspective of their analysis?

322
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,250
Any questions? Okay.

323
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,620
So when you talk about the size and characteristics of the affected population,

324
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,270
you know, one way you can think about is what's the current technology mix?

325
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:47,580
And I if we talk about a lot of drugs in this in this class here, but here we have might have, you know, 20% of the population is getting drug A,

326
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,940
which is actually a combination, drugs B and C, and then maybe 6% are getting drugs B and C at separate doses,

327
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,590
10% are getting drug B, 7%, half percent again, drug C, so forth.

328
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,940
And 21% are getting no therapy. And of course, that's something to consider here as well.

329
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,990
So what's the current technology mix or what's the current mix of interventions people are getting today?

330
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,959
So that's what you need to know as part of a budget impact analysis.

331
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,150
First is what are people currently getting?

332
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,740
Then you think what the cost, the current interaction makes up, you know, how much is it costing us to give people drugs, ABCDE and so forth?

333
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,440
Then you want to think about the new intervention mix. And actually the new intervention mix might not be a snap.

334
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:35,819
My fingers and everyone starts using drug D or whatever. This is kind of a part of an analysis.

335
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,600
I did, you know, ten or 15 years ago about some new treatments for degenerative diseases.

336
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:53,639
These new anti vascular endothelial growth factors were being developed about 15 years ago or 20 years ago, and they were new.

337
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,500
And so it wasn't just that people are going to snap their fingers and people were going to these multi eye injections.

338
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,549
So we looked at historical all kind of growth patterns and we actually weren't even completely sure about what that looked like.

339
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:16,860
But we saw some historical growth skewing the use of these things from like 5% in 2004 to about 60% in 2008, 2009.

340
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,990
And so we made some assumptions about how is this growth trajectory going to kind of continue.

341
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,719
And by the way, this we aren't at 100% it wasn't 100% of people were getting who had this condition.

342
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,380
We're getting these new injections that were going to help prevent blindness.

343
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,080
So we had to we had to make some assumptions about what is that future trajectory going to look like?

344
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,709
Yeah. And then kind of, you know, the cost of the nutrition mix.

345
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:57,450
And so, you know, think about, you know, what are the costs to to deliver, again, kind of in this case for ABC.

346
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,450
And then then you've got a certain percentage of people getting that today, a different percentage of people.

347
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,280
And it might be an evolution over time.

348
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,639
So over the next five years, we think people are going to ramp up using this new drug over the next five years, something like that.

349
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,020
Or a new vaccine or new procedure.

350
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,160
And then lastly, we want to think about the useful cost of other health condition or treatment of health care services.

351
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:29,959
So in this case of maybe this these injections that are going to reduce blindness, if you're a payor, you need to think about,

352
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,300
okay, I'm going to spend $1,000 a month for someone getting these thousand hour II injections, which are very expensive.

353
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,379
But then maybe I don't need to do some sort of laser eye surgery on them, which might cost a few thousand dollars, maybe.

354
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:50,590
I don't need to spend money on a low vision aids for someone who goes blind because these people can then, you know, continue to see and so forth.

355
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:57,469
So what are the the other health conditions of treatment and health care services that that might be spent under both scenarios,

356
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:03,450
the kind of status quo scenario and then in the U.S. By the way,

357
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,810
this budget impact analysis also in many ways is kind of similar to the cost effectiveness analysis where using mathematical

358
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:15,840
models to simulate where we think the long term outcomes are going to be and the long term use of these health care services.

359
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,200
So if I give someone these injections or if I don't get these injections over time with these people's vision

360
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,700
is going to degenerate over time and they're going to incur more health care services to take care of them,

361
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,170
whether they're losing their vision.

362
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,780
Maybe with these new injections, their vision is going to stay stable and they're going to need less of those things.

363
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,400
And then finally, this idea, this concept of think about things incrementally.

364
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,600
Remember we've been talking about the entire time here is you're making you're

365
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,050
helping someone make a decision about A versus B or A versus B versus C,

366
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:53,010
and we want to think about things relative to each other. So, hey, we don't care about really what the cost of a is, what the cost of B is.

367
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,010
We care about what's the incremental cost A, B, instead of A and a cost outcomes.

368
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:04,490
The Acropolis here also we want to think about the budget impact from going from the status quo to something different.

369
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:12,930
So what's that additional cost or maybe some savings that you'll see with your new intervention compared to the old way of doing things?

370
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,440
So again, to contrast, we're going to build upon cost policies.

371
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:27,020
In some ways, cost effective Celcius is similar, but again, we're using the same oftentimes using the same ethical models.

372
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,740
In some ways, the budget impact analysis is easier. So we're just looking at prices.

373
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,950
We don't have to worry about health outcomes, grants, opportunity costs, but some in some ways it can be more complex.

374
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,220
Think about that open cohort of how many new people are going to be joining our population or leaving our population each year.

375
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:51,930
And then reporting might be a little more complex because you're reporting what are the costs, you know, in each year?

376
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,540
So let's go through an example here. Again, we've had this example of some horrible disease.

377
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,280
Several times, just to recap. So this deadly disease, 20% of people die each year.

378
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:14,080
We have Dr. Oz's intervention to have a surgery that removes that terminal disease, but it does involve high mortality.

379
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,379
We have this pill that reduces risk of dying.

380
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:29,470
We take a pill each day, and the costs were about $5,000 per year with no treatment through $65 taking these pills, if you take the pills each day,

381
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,430
50000 hours with the surgical procedure, and if you survive this surgical procedure, you only have hundred dollars in costs each year after that.

382
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:47,260
So the cost effectiveness results look something like this. We have no intervention is the cheapest.

383
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:54,010
Then the pill of disease away is the next most expensive and then we have to get rid of it.

384
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,030
The surgical procedure, which is the most expensive but has the most qualities.

385
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,460
And when we look at this, it's about $5,000 per qualify to do that.

386
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,100
Take the pills. Everyone probably thinks that's a good value for money.

387
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:13,120
The surgical procedure is much more expensive. It is about $130,000 for quality adjusted life.

388
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,950
And that's more debatable. Some people might say that's a good value for money. Other people might say that's kind of expensive.

389
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,190
But that's a value question. And the next question now is, well, what would our budget impact be?

390
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:32,050
How much would if I'm Blue Cross and I want to give people these new pills instead of doing nothing at all or give them the surgery,

391
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,290
how much would I have to spend or budget or plan for that?

392
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:46,570
So if we wanted to think about Blue Cross, you know, let's say both this pill and the surgery are new interventions.

393
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,660
And historically, everyone's just had no intervention.

394
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:58,480
You know, what additional information would we need as Blue Cross to plan for, to budget for?

395
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:07,330
These new interventions. Time horizon is the time horizon.

396
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,610
So we'd want to think over what time horizon? We we want to consider this.

397
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:19,660
And what do you think is a reasonable time horizon? I have no idea about how long the patient need to take the.

398
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,550
You know, so so for the pills, people are taking those for the rest of their lives, let's say.

399
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,810
So that's something to to consider. Yeah.

400
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,610
Now, if you don't take the pills, though, if you face 20% mortality each year.

401
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:46,070
So, you know, on average, people are living, you know, just a few years with something of last ten years.

402
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,640
So but it's you know, a lot of people are dying quite quickly with that.

403
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,610
But presumably, people are living longer, though, if they take the pills or get the surgery.

404
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,570
So you might need to think about a longer time horizon than just a few years.

405
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,310
You know, I think the average life expectancy would be five years without the surgery.

406
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,170
Or the pills and might be six or seven years with the pills, and it might be much longer than that,

407
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,570
you know, eight or nine years like that with the surgery on average.

408
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,970
But of course, even on average, you know, there are some people who live longer than the average as well.

409
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,230
So you might want to look over a longer period of time. Yeah.

410
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,000
So it's something to think about is what is the appropriate time horizon.

411
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:35,460
And by the way, Blue Cross, though, might say, hey, our investors want to see want to see our our,

412
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,819
you know, revenues and stuff and costs within the next 5 to 10 years.

413
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,110
They might be more short sighted, maybe, I don't know.

414
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:57,650
So for say different of maybe for the surgery or for the drug, that time horizon might be different for the patient to take the intervention.

415
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:09,470
So from the Blue Cross Blue Shield, their perspective, I was going to consider their total the rise in occupancy this year.

416
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:16,520
So I think you well, whatever you do I think you want to have a consistent time horizon to evaluate all the interventions against.

417
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,940
And I think if you choose to short of a time horizon, for example, you might undervalue the surgery,

418
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,920
for example, because the surgery is quite deadly at the beginning, like 40% of people die at the beginning.

419
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,040
But then if they do survive, they live for a very long time.

420
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:43,010
So if you just had a one year time horizon, for example, you'd say the surgery is terrible because only 40% of people have immediately died.

421
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,459
And that's even you know, it's a higher mortality rate than the other two options.

422
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:52,940
So it's worse. But if you look over, I think in this example here, the cost basis is what was a ten year time horizon.

423
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,900
But if you extended the time horizon even longer, maybe the surgery would look better because those people would.

424
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,940
You'd be counting their life years lived in in years. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

425
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,490
So was there did you have a comment in the back about additional things we need now?

426
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,570
Yeah. I mean, I think the big unknown is like, what?

427
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,410
Take the the surgery. Yeah.

428
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,910
So. So you don't know.

429
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,220
Well, when we you know how many you are getting and maybe we do assume very few people are getting the pills or the surgery today.

430
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,879
But then yeah, a big unknown is what would people choose in the future.

431
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,820
And so and actually as we cross, you could, you could think about the budget impact under several different scenarios.

432
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:49,150
The scenario is we won't pay for anything which is which would kind of be where you are today or we we pay for both surgery and the pills.

433
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,630
And then it's uncertain whether people would which one people would choose.

434
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,110
Or you could say, hey, we're just going to pay for the pills.

435
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:03,300
And even if you do that, how many people will actually what will that take the of these these disease weight pills and ah,

436
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:08,590
we'll just pay for the surgery. We're not going to pay for the pills. So then how many will like the surgery versus nothing?

437
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:14,950
So yeah, there are several different scenarios you could, you could look at here and and is uncertain what people would choose.

438
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:33,400
What other information would you need to? But the first thing we need to know is the size and the characteristics of the affected populations.

439
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,570
We need to know how many people have this if it's just one person with some horrible disease.

440
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:42,240
The budget impacts can be pretty small. If it's 10 million people, it's a horrible disease, then this is very expensive.

441
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,780
So we need to know how big is our population. And not only that, how many people, new people develop it each year.

442
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:57,569
Yeah. So we need a current and actually intervention in the future adventure mix and and support for the cost effect.

443
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:04,830
By the way, for the cost effectiveness analysis we already have. We probably already have this and this and this.

444
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,030
So the new things you would need for budget impact analysis are the size of the population

445
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,230
and then the mix of how many who are getting different interventions today and when.

446
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,730
What do you think the mix would be in the future?

447
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:30,750
So let's say let's say BlueCross says it covers 10,000 people with this condition, but 2000 people develop it each year.

448
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:41,610
And what Senator Schumer makes is currently no one gets treated and then the new one, this case is just everyone's getting this pill disease away.

449
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,829
So let's do take a look at this.

450
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:57,980
And under the modules on our first website, we have disease way versus get rid of it.

451
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,620
Budget impact this is something we have the same file we've looked at before.

452
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:12,000
We haven't looked at the budget impact kind of part of it. So just to recap.

453
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:20,030
So this is disease away versus get rid of it budget impact. Under the modules in our course website here.

454
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,880
I think it's under week five just to search for the word budget.

455
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:33,220
You know, we hear. So just to recap, we've looked at things in the past here and we really just focus on the first tab,

456
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:42,610
the worksheet, which is the cost effective analysis tab. So here we have all those inputs of, you know, mortality and costs and quality of life.

457
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:49,960
Then here we had the model where we're calculating for a closed cohort, we start off with a thousand people.

458
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,629
How many people will be in different health states over time,

459
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:02,050
and what are the costs and qualities they would get under no intervention or disease away or get rid of it?

460
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:11,979
Can we simulate that over ten years and then we calculate total costs and qualities and develop this nice cost effectiveness plain.

461
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,180
And we have cost of equity ratios and all that good stuff for figure out value for money,

462
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:23,320
but for the budget impact analysis and we do something slightly different.

463
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,480
And so I've created three different worksheet tabs here for the budget impact analysis.

464
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:37,420
The first one is just the basics are kind of inputs and outputs for the budget, things that are specific to the budget impact analysis.

465
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,400
So here we have the size and the characteristics of the affected population.

466
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:50,560
So we have 10,000 people currently with the horrible disease and 2000 people develop developing in each year.

467
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,480
And then we have the mix without the new intervention. So that's kind of the comparison.

468
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:04,690
The status quo, if you will, of 100% of people are getting no intervention, 0% of people getting disease weight, 0% getting the surgery.

469
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:24,040
And then here is what we're doing is we're calculating the ten year cost of health care costs, total cost therapy costs over a ten year period here.

470
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:32,250
So we are because this is because no one's getting any therapy in the status quo.

471
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,890
With therapy, costs are zero and then health care costs.

472
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,900
All right. We said it's cost $5,000 a year to care for someone with some horrible disease.

473
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:50,800
And so we have 10,000 people. And so that's $50 million being spent the first year to care for people with some horrible disease.

474
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,610
And then the next year, we started out with 10,000 people.

475
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,580
A little over 2000 of them died from some horrible disease and other causes.

476
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:10,470
2000 new people came in. And so we have a little bit less than $50,000 being spent the next year and so forth.

477
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,370
Now, where do these numbers come from? Well, there's a new a different tab here called Big Current Therapy.

478
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:25,840
And this kind of looks similar to the cost effectiveness analysis worksheet here.

479
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,130
We have very similar things here.

480
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:37,690
The only difference is we are simulating alive and dead and here are alive is

481
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:44,920
that 10,000 people we started with this and it's 10,000 people times the mix.

482
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,940
And in this case, the mix was 100% and no intervention.

483
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:58,120
But I, I also have I could add that people start off with this easy way or get rid of it, whatever,

484
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,440
depending on what that initial mix is, people getting no intervention versus disease wavers.

485
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:12,850
Anyway, so we start off with our 10,000 people and they do follow the kind of miracles living and dying process here.

486
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:18,340
So 2150 people died from some horrible disease and heart attacks and strokes.

487
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,410
So those people left the cohort or they, you know, they died.

488
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,630
But because this is an open cohort, I don't have 8000 people left.

489
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,850
I actually have 9850 people because I have 2000 new people.

490
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:43,540
Scott, zoom in a little bit here. 2000 new people coming into the cohort who are developing some horrible disease.

491
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,940
So next year, 2000 new people are going to develop some horrible disease.

492
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,820
So the alive here is the previous people who were alive.

493
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,680
Subtract out the people who died, but then add in new people who joined the cohort.

494
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,120
Because again, this is an open cohort. So we have new people entering the cohort each year.

495
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,420
And so that's happening each year here. If I go know, you're five.

496
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,460
It's how many people had some horrible disease the previous year minus those who die,

497
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:15,460
but then adding in 2000 new people who developed some horrible disease and Blue Cross has covered population.

498
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,639
And then the only one thing is slightly different from the cost benefit analysis worksheet

499
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,810
is I'm breaking out therapy costs from health care and other health care costs.

500
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:39,079
Otherwise it's very similar. So we're just. And that's just for because the budget person might might care about those making that distinction.

501
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,160
We've just broken those two categories off. Actually, let me make a change here.

502
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:56,180
Let's say if if the current intervention mix was 9010, now this therapy would start off with 9000 people alive and a thousand people in disease away.

503
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:04,020
And then as those new people. Yeah.

504
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:12,490
Came in. 90% of them would continue to get no intervention and 10% of them would get disease.

505
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,140
Cancer. Let's switch is back to 100 and zero.

506
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,000
Any questions so far? Yes.

507
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:28,120
Cure. And then after a day at cure would would be recover and go to the disease again.

508
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,540
Well, in this in this example, we don't allow people to be cured.

509
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,200
But but in the real world, maybe you might.

510
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:46,960
And so let's say hepatitis C, hepatitis C, you get many thousands of dollars worth of treatment over, you know, a few months.

511
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,690
And then you're and then if it works, you're considered cured.

512
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,320
But then you could inject drugs again and get infected, reinfected with hep C and maybe need to be treated again.

513
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:04,420
And so you could, you know, for certain conditions, you could model that as people leaving the cohort but then coming back in.

514
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,060
Yeah. You know, I was thinking that because of the case like that,

515
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:20,260
so your population would change your and your new cases would change as well as the population change because people come back to the population.

516
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:29,890
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so that is potentially something to think about, is do you have people kind of leaving the population and coming back in?

517
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,860
Yeah. And in biology for any of these things. Yeah.

518
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:41,240
You need to use the appropriate model for, for how you think your intervention refactoring things.

519
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:50,440
So for something like HIV, we think that treating people is pretty good evidence that if you treat people with HIV,

520
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,780
you dramatically lower their viral load such that they're not as infections.

521
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:02,500
And so if you treat people, you benefit them dramatically, but also you dramatically.

522
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:08,230
You can affect the the rest of the population, which is less likely to become infected.

523
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:14,170
And so you might want a dynamic transmission model to evaluate an HIV treatment policy, for example,

524
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:24,250
versus something else where maybe it isn't it isn't an infectious disease and you're probably okay ignoring the transmission dynamics.

525
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,210
So this is. So here we have again going back to budget impact analysis.

526
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,320
Remember, we need to we need the size and the characteristics of the affected population.

527
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,780
The current intervention makes in the cost of the intervention.

528
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,600
So here we have the size and the characteristics of the population in the current intervention mix.

529
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,530
And here is our budget plan for the current intervention mix.

530
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,950
So here's what we're spending with the current. We think we're going to be spending with the current arrangements.

531
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,700
We think we're to spend our $50 million a year. Okay.

532
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,480
Then we can go on to the new intervention mix.

533
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,390
So here our new intervention mix we're going to explore is what if 100% of people get this disease way pills?

534
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:14,760
So they're spending $365 a day a year, dollar a day on these pills, but then their mortality is lower and the quality of life is better.

535
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:23,850
Okay, so here's our budget impact analysis for the the cost of the new intervention mix.

536
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,700
So we're spending we're spending 50 in the first year.

537
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:32,550
We're spending so many spending $50 million on some form of disease treatment because it doesn't the pills don't reduce that.

538
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,410
But now we're spending an extra an additional $3.6 million on these disease way pills.

539
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,160
And it might be useful for us to kind of add to that, calculate that separately and think about our pharmaceutical budget and plan for that.

540
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,540
And so we're spending $53 billion in that first year.

541
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:55,350
So it's that $3.6 million more than we would have without giving people disease away.

542
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:07,170
Now, you'll notice here, though, over time, these costs are increasing versus in the in the standard current intervention mix.

543
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,149
We spent $50 million the first year and we're down to $49.2 million the next year.

544
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:19,110
And so for slowly decreasing costs, we're spending each year here with the new therapy disease away.

545
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,880
Our costs are increasing each year.

546
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:30,510
Why do you think costs are rising each year with if we give people the disease weight pills and it's the costs of health care costs,

547
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,990
it goes from $50 million to $51 million to $52 million.

548
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:38,100
And this goes from $3.6 million, $3.7 million to $2.8 million.

549
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:43,110
Why are those costs increasing over time? Yes, people are living longer.

550
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:50,430
Yeah, the whole point of this is to keep people alive longer. And as people are living longer, we have to care for them, their care for them more.

551
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,020
They're more people to take care of. They're not dying. And when they when they die, Blue Cross no longer has to pay for them.

552
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,860
If they're alive, La Crosse is going to pay for them more.

553
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:06,210
And so from a budgeting perspective, Blue Cross needs to plan for slight increases in spending on this population over time.

554
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,390
It's a good thing we think it's we think it's a valuable thing. But Blue Cross needs to plan and budget for that.

555
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:19,880
And so this is this is simulating and saying, okay, again, we have more and more people alive.

556
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,710
So if we go to budget impact analysis, new therapy,

557
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:32,460
you'll notice we started off with 10,000 people and then the next you're going to have 10,250 people because slightly fewer people have died.

558
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,910
And we still have 2000 people developing some horrible disease each year.

559
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:46,170
And so this cohort is increasing in size over time because because more people are coming in that are leaving or right by dying, if you will.

560
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,640
So we have. So we need to kind of think about that.

561
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:07,160
Yeah. So that's what's kind of going on here is we're calculating not only what are the

562
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,510
costs and I think even just looking at kind of the first year is instructive.

563
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:16,210
You're getting a sense of, okay, how much are we spending on this new intervention?

564
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:22,870
But also I think it is useful to think about over time. So again, when Blue Crosses think about their five year plans or ten year plans,

565
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,480
they need to plan not only spend an extra $3.6 million next year on this pill,

566
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:34,330
but that's that the total amount of spending we're going to be spending on people with something like this is going to be increasing over time.

567
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:46,900
And so here is just a kind of graph of that current therapy we get current therapy,

568
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,809
our therapy costs, which basically under the status quo, no one's getting these therapies.

569
00:59:52,810 --> 01:00:00,010
Those costs are zero. If we add disease away now, we're spending that $3.6 million each year on that.

570
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,229
And then the green lines here and green and red lines here under the status

571
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,950
quo are spending going to be $50 million and slightly decreasing over time.

572
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:13,480
If we give people the disease, wait till we're going to be spending more.

573
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:21,120
And that's going to be slightly increasing over time. So any questions about this so far?

574
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:30,970
So this is kind of our budget impact. This graph here is kind of the final kind of result of that is is giving us a sense of,

575
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:37,660
you know, how much more are we going to need to plan for to plan for this population?

576
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:45,430
Now, this is this way is kind of this is kind of simple here when we're looking at this

577
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:52,660
disease way pill or we spend $350 or $65 per person per year on these pills.

578
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,100
The thing is, you actually can be more interesting is let's say, what if we what if we have a different mix here?

579
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:05,290
So what if we had everyone get the surgery?

580
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:14,630
Okay. Remember, that was a $50,000 surgery. So now I have to expand this here because our therapy costs,

581
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:24,830
we'd be spending $500 million on surgeries the first year if we gave everyone we had some of these surgery.

582
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:38,840
Okay. So again, big expense that first year, we have to have $500 million to pay for all those surgeries for that, those 10,000 people.

583
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:47,090
But then our costs would dramatically drop because we would have given those 10,000 people their surgery.

584
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,800
But each year thereafter, we still are spending $100 million.

585
01:01:51,810 --> 01:02:03,890
Why are we spending $100 million every year thereafter? It's not the new people coming in today.

586
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:08,310
Yes, we'll get new people. Think about 2000 people developing some horrible disease each year.

587
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,950
And we're going to give every one of them a surgery.

588
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:17,100
And so that's going to be you know, I need to plan not only for that $500 million of giving everyone surgery this year,

589
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:21,580
but also $100 million every year thereafter for the new people who develop HD.

590
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,030
And we say, oh, I'm really sorry, you have HD. Let me talk let me have you talk to Dr. Ozzie, who's going to give you surgery.

591
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:38,190
Okay. But interestingly, the the costs of the health care, the other health care costs are very small.

592
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,540
Remember, we're spending $50 million on other health care.

593
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,740
Some horrible disease costs under the status quo.

594
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,400
And now those dropped to just, you know, a few million dollars.

595
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,650
I'm just kind of other regular health care costs.

596
01:02:52,950 --> 01:03:02,610
So if you were if you had a special S.H. set of clinics that were providing specialized HD care to everyone, and now you're considering this surgery.

597
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,740
Well, now you don't have to have those big ADHD clinics with you spend $50 million a year on.

598
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,310
You'd have to move those bloated dollars into the surgery budget, if you will.

599
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,090
So this is kind of helpful to think about. You know, where do I reallocate?

600
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:24,240
Yeah. And also, you know, we could say, well, what if 30% of people get no intervention and 20% of people get disease and 50% get surgery?

601
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:29,490
I mean, you can explore different mixes both with the status quo, one for your new one,

602
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,980
and get a sense of where might my budget be if I had, you know, different mixes of people in different areas?

603
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:42,870
And this is kind of a simplistic it's assuming that under the new scenario,

604
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:49,110
we kind of snap our fingers and then all of a sudden it's 30% no intervention, 20% disease rates, 50% surgery.

605
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,780
You could have something more complex, which is kind of a ramp up that immediately everyone wouldn't choose to do the surgery.

606
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,420
Maybe 10% of people each year would get the surgery.

607
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,370
And so you could do something more complex like that if you felt that was was reasonable and necessary.

608
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:11,030
Other questions or comments. Yes.

609
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:22,910
Has anyone thought about doing a distributional budget impact analysis like similar to the distributional cost effectiveness analysis?

610
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:33,560
People don't talk about that much, but you're right, they could. And and so you could think about this for really everything here.

611
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:41,990
One is, what is this mix? And interestingly, you could have do it here.

612
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:50,960
You could think about. So let's let's say today this is the you know, the percent using disease way.

613
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:58,740
And let's say today it's 0% because this is a new pill that's just been developed.

614
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:08,370
And so that's, you know, 2022. And you want to think about the next you know, it's 20, 32.

615
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:19,920
You could think about, well, here's my trajectory. And I think, you know, we're down 90% by 2032, but you might be really uncertain about that.

616
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,350
So you might have like some kind of level of uncertainty about what that trajectory might look like.

617
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,780
And in fact, it might go back down to maybe, maybe in eight years,

618
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:37,349
we'll just discovered this thing is a horrible side effect to no one wants, you know, anyway.

619
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:44,220
So you could you could build some sort of uncertainty in, in what this uptake might be.

620
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,570
And of course you do you could put distributions on all the other things about and

621
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:52,300
especially where some of these costs might change over time and evolve over time.

622
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,790
The surgery today is $50,000. Maybe maybe next year it'll be $60,000.

623
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:03,390
Maybe you'll be $40,000. Maybe the pills will will change in price over time.

624
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:10,080
So you could you could do kind of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis on your on your budget as well.

625
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:19,860
And and and this year is showing kind of a single point estimate for this is precisely what your budget will be next year,

626
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:24,090
in the next year, next year. Whereas you're right, in reality we were uncertain about that.

627
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,590
And so you could yeah, I think I've seen people, you know, just, you know,

628
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:33,600
and the standard is really that everyone just produces these kind of point estimate budgets.

629
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,200
But it might be useful to also think about the uncertainty around that as well.

630
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:44,100
And that that is a challenge for budgeting is you you don't really know precisely what these numbers will be.

631
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:49,260
And so putting distributions on the inputs could be valuable for this in thinking about,

632
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,780
you know, what is this really a 59 hour budget or maybe somewhere between 104 hundred?

633
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,479
Yeah. And then, by the way, these numbers in the in years, five, six, seven, eight,

634
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,780
nine, ten, we're probably even more uncertain about what those numbers are.

635
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:10,710
Yeah. To the point. But people don't as far as I've seen, they don't really look at that.

636
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:18,320
But that could be, I think, useful. Other questions or comments.

637
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,230
Yeah. What about, like, equity?

638
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:34,940
I mean, is there a way to incorporate that into the budget impact analysis or is it like basically because our our health care.

639
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:43,350
The system is so segmented that your thinking is not really useful to think about equity within Cross, for example.

640
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,700
That's just like you're already the people who are affected by like the most depression, like don't even have insurance.

641
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:56,670
So they're like or they're on Medicaid. So it's like not you're not really thinking like a whole population.

642
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:01,530
Yeah. So that's a good question. I haven't really thought about that much.

643
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:14,210
I don't think people would do this and thought about that very much. I guess it would depend on what you think is important.

644
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:22,070
So first of all, I guess my initial thought is the equity analysis maybe is even more important for the cost

645
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:26,809
effectiveness and and for think about the health outcomes because I think those of us,

646
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:34,639
at least in this room, if you're in public health, you're interested in equity, equitable health outcomes and and to a lesser extent,

647
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,420
we're concerned about, you know, how much Blue Cross or Medicare is paying for this often.

648
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:43,490
And oftentimes in these analyzes, we we ignore the patient co-pay side of this.

649
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,490
So we just say, hey, let's try to get equitable health outcomes.

650
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:55,580
But it also and one thing I didn't mention on Monday was really I don't think you can look at is, is the cost to the patient.

651
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:07,729
And and so there might be value in in reducing the cost to lower income populations, something we didn't really talk about on Monday.

652
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:12,350
But that's something else you can look at is what are the kind of co-pays and maybe we should have, you know,

653
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:19,550
zero cost for low income people and higher cost to the higher income people to reduce the economic burden on people.

654
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:27,800
But anyway, going back to budget impact analysis. Again, typically we're thinking about this from the perspective of a payer.

655
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:35,690
And so we I guess I'm not maybe it's just me I'm not as concerned about.

656
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:40,250
Is Blue Cross's budget equitable or are they spending as much on black people as white people or rich,

657
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:47,540
rich people as poor people or young versus old or whatever? What I'm more interested in, what are the outcomes that we get from that?

658
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,670
Because we could be we could be spending equal amounts,

659
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,740
but it could be done terribly for one population and really spend the right places for another population.

660
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:03,710
So I don't know that I don't know that it'd be valuable to to break out our is our spending equitable across different population groups.

661
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,630
But I think it's more burden to think about those those health outcomes from population groups.

662
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:15,860
What could be valuable maybe from an equity perspective that would be to look at the patient budget impact.

663
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:24,770
And so, you know what what are my what are my what's my covered population spending out of pocket?

664
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,720
So and then try to think about equity in that dimension.

665
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:40,170
So again, you know, certain people, maybe young people spend very little out of pocket or people spend a lot out of pocket or vice versa.

666
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,030
But then it's also important you brought up a good point, too, that you also need to think about the population you're covering.

667
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:54,120
So, you know, for Blue Cross, maybe maybe there isn't much inequity in terms of out-of-pocket payments because it's everyone

668
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:00,180
is at least wealthy enough or has a job to get health insurance versus people on Medicaid.

669
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:04,290
They're in a very different situation. People have Medicare in a different situation as well.

670
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:07,140
And so if you fix equity within Blue Cross,

671
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:15,030
that might not might not mean very much because it's more important to think about equity between Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance.

672
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,370
So I think it raises a lot of interesting questions, I guess.

673
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:25,650
And and again, maybe from a just dollars and cents budget impact,

674
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:33,630
I might say that it's it'll be most interesting to look at out-of-pocket patient out-of-pocket spending if you wanted to think about equity.

675
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:38,550
And maybe then also because it's it's focused on dollars.

676
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:45,840
Maybe look at income inequality and say, okay, for people whose income is less than $10,000 a year, what are the out-of-pocket spending?

677
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,549
If we make over $100,000 a year, which they're out of pocket spending and and actually,

678
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:56,940
maybe you don't want equality of spending necessarily because a 2000 or medical expense for someone

679
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:02,040
making $20,000 a year is a much bigger deal than a 2000 or more expense for someone making under 20,000.

680
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:10,620
Right. So but but you could at least maybe the first step would be to quantify, you know, what is that out-of-pocket spending by by income?

681
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:17,520
And then next, ask yourself what might be the appropriate policies to reduce those that inequity.

682
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,240
And try to quantify that in some way.

683
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:32,030
And I guess I'll say also for something like that, there is some interesting questions about, you know, what are the out-of-pocket payments?

684
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:37,040
Are they out-of-pocket payments for some sort of therapy? And then you do have the long term costs as well.

685
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:49,070
And for that situation, if you really were concerned about equity, I would say, and if you're looking at the individual consumer or a patient or you,

686
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:55,700
then I think it would be important to look at or at least quantify productivity impacts if you think about equity,

687
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:03,770
because I think that is an important part of it too, is if you have an intervention that is maybe free to a low income person,

688
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:13,040
but it requires them to travel 50 miles and wait in the waiting room for a full day, take a whole day off of work and maybe stay overnight in a hotel.

689
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:19,249
I mean, that's a real you know, they live in Upper Peninsula. They have to come down to Ann Arbor and spend a couple of days here for some tests

690
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,620
in the university hospital that might not show up as a health care expense.

691
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:31,600
But that's a real cost to to people. And so those might be things you want to think about.

692
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,900
So one final thing here. We've been talking a lot about budget impact today.

693
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:44,760
And I think it's important, it's valuable for you to understand it's not required for class projects.

694
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,390
So don't worry about that that you have to. Oh, my God. There's this new thing I have to add or project.

695
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:52,680
I mean, if you really want to be my guest, but it is certainly not required, you're expected.

696
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,490
So what of the things is? I want to think about framing.

697
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:04,349
Oftentimes we think about a budget and especially even say Michigan is a fixed budget.

698
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:10,920
We say, oh, man, I can't pay for I have a fixed budget. But I think it also is valuable thing about a budget is being flexible as well.

699
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:22,140
So even when we say, oh, sorry, we have, you know, Michigan has a balanced budget, we mean we can't spend this because we got a very fixed budget.

700
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,780
In the end, it isn't really a fixed budget, right?

701
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:31,800
I mean, the state of Michigan can choose to raise taxes or cut spending in another year or something like that.

702
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:37,679
So really, in the end, I think budgets are are are flexible.

703
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,400
I mean, it's it's kind of a continuum between fixed and flexible and being.

704
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:49,620
And I would argue that if you can, you know, show that your intervention does not have a huge budget impact and you can argue it's really,

705
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:55,170
really valuable to the cost effectiveness, it's easier to advocate for bending the rules if you are,

706
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,559
okay, let's cut this part and give more money to you in this area,

707
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,410
or let's raise taxes to generate money for this or some sort of fees to to generate money for this new intervention.

708
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,020
You know that I think you have a better argument,

709
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:14,760
stronger argument if you can demonstrate a minimal budget impact and high cost effectiveness or high value.

710
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:23,340
So what we've been talking about, you know, in cost free resources and in budget impact analysis here is modeling in looking at this Excel model,

711
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,590
how can we take the outcomes are and it's I think what this is it's the development

712
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,820
of you know it provides a useful input to questions and decision making.

713
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:37,319
So we have some sort of question, should we do more or should we pay for disease?

714
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,530
Right. Or get rid of it? It helps us get to that solution.

715
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:45,299
It's not the only consideration, though. There are other things that were coming into this question.

716
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:51,030
So again, this easy way to get rid of it, you know, I might be able to I might pay for people to get that surgery.

717
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:55,700
But some people might say, hey, look, I don't want to risk a 40% chance of dying during the surgery.

718
01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:00,720
Right. That's that's another consideration that's outside of the realm of kind of cost effective spread of the technologies.

719
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:05,880
But anyway, you want to go. These models do have explicit value judgments and assumptions.

720
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:12,330
So even with the budget impact analysis, we are at least making our assumptions explicit.

721
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:17,790
Okay, here's the mix. Here are the costs of all the things we're being explicit, what those assumptions are.

722
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,080
So we have a lot of quantifiable factors here.

723
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:28,500
We have with cost factors or budget impact analysis, we have these kind of monetary cost savings with a cost effectiveness policies.

724
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,920
We can quantify health benefits to terms of quality adjusted life years.

725
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:41,640
We can even try to quantify equity in terms of here's how many what's the quality of adjusted life expectancy for this population in this population?

726
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:47,010
And we can try to quantify things with Atkinson's abstinence and so forth.

727
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:53,250
You try to do that. But keep in mind there are a lot of non quantifiable factors here too.

728
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:58,560
So things like ethical issues and socio political issues,

729
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:03,780
that might be other considerations outside of kind of cost effectiveness in budget impact analysis.

730
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:11,800
And just additional things that might be interesting are legal issues.

731
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,830
So some things like opioid substitution therapy might be illegal in certain justice jurisdictions,

732
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:22,150
might be just very difficult to do, even if they look really cost effective or might be illegal.

733
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,200
And then also interesting things are privacy issues.

734
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:35,890
So if someone gives birth and we do an HIV test on the baby, we find out the baby is HIV positive.

735
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:43,420
Who also we just tested. Yeah, exactly.

736
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:50,290
So there are some privacy issues here, too, some things that we need to, um, to consider now.

737
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:53,740
Actually, maybe, maybe today this is not a hot button issue.

738
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:59,260
That was 20 years ago or something like that. You know, maybe people say you're like, well, test for HIV from HIV positive.

739
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,809
There's not quite the stigma otherwise 20 years ago.

740
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:10,060
But still, these are issues to be considered outside of the realm of value and budgets and all that kind of stuff.

741
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:18,950
Quantifiable cost effects. So these types of analyzes budget impact analysis, cost cost sources.

742
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:25,929
They can evaluate and quantify some monetary and health consequences of programs and support decisions about

743
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:32,140
investment in these programs and guide allocation of resources and guide data collection efforts to help us think,

744
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,610
you know, where are places where we still don't have information that might help us make a better decision about

745
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:43,120
whether something cost effective strategies also show when a decision is justified despite data.

746
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:49,660
So we've seen in sensitivity analysis, sometimes some some parameters just don't make a difference.

747
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,630
They don't make an impact and say, hey, look, we can still make a decision,

748
01:18:53,290 --> 01:19:00,950
even though we're uncertain about some things, still doesn't make a difference. Are quite confident that the right decision is x oh.

749
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,319
But it provides input to decisions but doesn't replace the decision maker.

750
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,120
So again, keep in mind that we're in this entire class, we're doing a lot of quantifying of things.

751
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,950
We're quantifying dollars kind of quantifying health in terms of quality, just life years.

752
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:18,670
We might even be trying to quantify equity budgets and so forth.

753
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:24,830
Keep in mind that there are still some things we haven't quantified and they're still very important to decision makers.

754
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:30,579
So we've got a lot of things going into here and you want to provide decision makers with that, right?

755
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:39,470
So first. But with that said, you know, we think about value for money, but budget can be really important to.

756
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,620
Just keep in mind that the KEYTRUDA cancer therapy is $20,000 per six weeks is high.

757
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,280
We talk about the high cost cholesterol, PCSK9 inhibitors.

758
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:59,217
$5 a month or so. And also, you know, if everyone with high cholesterol got them it'd be know billions of billions of.
