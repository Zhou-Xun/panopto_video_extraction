00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,109
Welcome to part one of the session on Cross-sectional and Ecologic studies in

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:10,109
which we will focus on the design of cross-sectional studies in epidemiology.

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:16,109
Briefly, we will go over the design, as well as types of measures of association that can be estimated and cross-sectional studies.

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,109
And then we will talk about the end Heyns surveys as an example.

5
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:30,109
Across sectional study describes the relationship between an exposure and outcome as they exist in a population at a single point in time.

6
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:36,109
I've reproduced the figure here that I showed you earlier in the course that visually depicts

7
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:41,109
the design of a cross sectional study whereby we measure the exposure and the outcome,

8
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:49,109
of course, at a single point in time. And that is the key design feature of a cross section of the study.

9
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,109
One thing I would like to briefly note here is that conducting primary data collection takes time.

10
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,109
And so you may see when you were reading the literature that the time period of a cross sectional

11
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:06,109
study may actually involve months or even years when the data collection is actually occurring.

12
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:14,109
And at first glance, this may make it seem like a cross-sectional study is longitudinal or elapsing over time.

13
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:20,109
But that's not actually the case, because for an individual given person in a cross-sectional study,

14
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:25,109
their personal exposure and outcome are in fact measured at a single point in time

15
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:37,109
during the study interview. I like this slide a lot because it really encourages us to think about time as it relates to cross sectional study.

16
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:44,109
And it's really easy to forget about this because our exposures and outcomes are, in fact, measured at a single point in time.

17
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:53,109
So it's easy to forget about how a cross-sectional study relates to time that has elapsed in the period prior to when the study is conducted.

18
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:59,109
So here, this image is encouraging us to think about a cross-sectional study representing

19
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:05,109
a hypothetical cohort of people that was established at some point in the past

20
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,109
and then as time elapses before we're actually conducting our study,

21
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:16,109
people are developing and being diagnosed with the outcome that we're interested in.

22
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,109
And then time goes on and we conduct our study.

23
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:29,109
And the people who end up in our study would be those who have survived until the time of study with the disease outcome of interest.

24
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:34,109
Recalling that prevalence is a function of incidents and duration.

25
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:43,109
The prevalent cases that we capture in the time of our study are going to depend on the historical incidents as well as duration of the disease.

26
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,109
So we will see more prevalent cases at the time of our cross-sectional study.

27
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:53,109
The higher the incidence is because higher incidence equals higher prevalence.

28
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,109
We will also see more prevalent cases at the time of our study,

29
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:03,109
the longer the disease duration is. And of course, disease duration is dependent on two things:

30
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,109
One, the rate of recovery. And two, the rate of death from the disease.

31
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:16,109
And so it's really important to recognize that in a cross-sectional study, we are capturing prevalent cases.

32
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,109
So these would be existing ongoing cases at the time when the study is conducted

33
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:30,109
and the data are collected. And these prevalent cases have survived for a range of periods of time before the study was conducted.

34
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:38,109
And, often, these time periods that a person has survived with the outcome of interest are often unknown.

35
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:47,109
And so, if there is, and this is particularly important, if there is a particularly high rate of mortality from the outcome of interest,

36
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:53,109
if the individuals who developed the outcome but died prior to the start of our cross-sectional study,

37
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,109
unless, of course, we're not captured in our study,

38
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:08,109
if those individuals were differentially dying on in a fashion that is correlated with the exposure of interest or determinants of the exposure,

39
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:15,109
then we might have something called survival bias and that could affect our estimate of the exposure outcome relationship.

40
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:22,109
This is a form of selection bias that we'll talk about more later on in the semester.

41
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,109
So what types of measures of association can we estimate an across sectional study?

42
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:32,109
Some common measures include the prevalence ratio, the prevalence difference, the prevalence odds ratio.

43
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:39,109
We can also estimate differences in means of continuous outcomes. The possibilities and truth are nearly endless.

44
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:48,109
But the key to estimating a measure of association in a cross-sectional study is to remember that we are measuring prevalent cases of the outcome.

45
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:55,109
So again, prevalent cases have been diagnosed at a range of times in the past and have survived to the time of the study.

46
00:04:55,109 --> 00:05:03,109
And so when estimating measures of association, it's important to think about could this induce any forms of bias in our findings?

47
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:08,109
And what does this mean for our interpretation of the measures of association?

48
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:19,109
If survival to the time of study with the outcome is related or differential by the exposure under interest or determinants of that exposure,

49
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:25,109
we might have survival bias. So this is something I want everyone to keep in mind.

50
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:34,109
Let's move on to an example of a cross-sectional study. The NHANES study, or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,

51
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:41,109
is a population based survey designed to collect information on the health and nutrition of the US population.

52
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:45,109
It consists of a home interview and a health examination.

53
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:52,109
And NHANES is really important because the data have been used to influence policy and actually improve population health.

54
00:05:52,109 --> 00:06:00,109
This includes things such as getting lead removed from gasoline, creating and updating pediatric growth charts in the United States,

55
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:08,109
and establishing national baseline estimates for cholesterol, blood pressure and hepatitis C.

56
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:13,109
NHANES surveys have been conducted for a long time, going all the way back to the 1970s.

57
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:18,109
We are currently we currently have and Heinz ongoing.

58
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:29,109
And I will also say that it might look like and Heinz is a longitudinal study or a cohort study on the basis of its history going back to the 1970s.

59
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:39,109
But what makes NHANES a cross-sectional study and not a longitudinal study is the fact that in each of these study waves or study periods,

60
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:50,109
a new random probability sample of the US general population is collected rather than ongoing within person data collection,

61
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:56,109
where the same people are followed up over time as is done in a cohort study.

62
00:06:56,109 --> 00:07:05,109
The also thing the other thing I'll note here is that you'll see that there are time periods in which each NHANES survey is conducted.

63
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:10,109
And again, this is because primary data collection and conducting interviews takes time.

64
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:16,109
And so even though NHANES, let's say, NHANES to, for example, was conducted between 1976 and 1980.

65
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:20,109
It is still a cross-sectional study because the interview measures of the exposure

66
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:26,109
and the outcome for each individual person were taken at the same point in time.

67
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:32,109
Very briefly, I want to introduce sampling here, so sampling is very important not only for cross-sectional studies,

68
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:36,109
but in all epidemiological studies. In NHANES,

69
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:44,109
it is particularly important, because NHANES aims to have a representative sample of the U.S. population.

70
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:50,109
It achieves this through something called multi-stage probability sampling design, which is used to select participants,

71
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:59,109
representative of the civilian non institutionalized population of the contiguous United States, excluding reservation lands.

72
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:06,109
I'll note here that NHANES does not include U.S. persons living in institutionalized settings or abroad.

73
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:12,109
This is actually very common in most epidemiological surveys and cohort studies.

74
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:22,109
And so whether we think this is a limitation depends on how we see representation of people living in institutionalized settings.

75
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:26,109
And this is probably something we need to discuss a little bit more in epidemiologic research.

76
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:34,109
With respect to the exclusion of institutionalized persons from many epidemiological studies.

77
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:39,109
NHANES has a very complex sampling design. We don't need to get into the details,

78
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:44,109
but it's a geographic base sampling where essentially counties are split into segments

79
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:49,109
which are split into households and then individuals within households are sampled.

80
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:54,109
And so we ultimately go from the county level down to the person level with

81
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:59,109
various sets of probabilities and rules for stratifying in selecting people.

82
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:07,109
At each stage. And then what this means is that we need to use something called sampling weights. A sampling weight, in the

83
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:16,109
NHANES, is a measure of the number of people in the target general U.S. population that are represented by that single sample person in NHANES.

84
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:23,109
And it reflects the unequal probability of selection, nonresponse, adjustment and adjustment to independent population controls.

85
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:28,109
And with the we use these sampling weights to produce an unbiased national estimate of the

86
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:35,109
prevalence of the outcome under study or the exposure outcome relationship under a study.

87
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:44,109
And finally, I want to give a brief note that NHANES actually over samples certain population subgroups, depending on public health interest.

88
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:52,109
And this oversampling is done to increase the reliability and the precision of estimates of health status indicators for these population subgroups.

89
00:09:52,109 --> 00:10:00,109
So these include groups such as people of very low income, very young children, women of childbearing age and older adults.

90
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:07,109
And later and same surveys, different subgroups have been oversampled depending on public health trends of concern at that time.

91
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:14,109
And this is actually a very common sampling strategy in surveys. And that's the end of part one.

92
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:20,884
The next is part two ecological studies.
