Hello, I'm Dr. Cleo Caldwell, chair of the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:25,850
I'm delighted to share some of my research on fatherhood as a context for understanding African-American boys and men's health and health behaviors.

3
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,450
This presentation is part of the Curriculum for the Future Public Health Leaders Program at the University of Michigan,

4
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,260
and I thank them for this opportunity. As background,

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:46,590
I want to share that African-American boys and men continue to suffer from numerous poor health often influenced by factors beyond their control.

6
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:55,080
Available research has linked poor health outcomes for African-American men to; beliefs about masculinity such as

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:06,000
expectations of self-reliance, individual health behaviors such as underutilization of health care services, socialization processes

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
that is what they learn as boys about being a man,

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:19,630
and structural factors such as racial discrimination, negative stereotypes or economic disadvantage to name a few.

10
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:28,590
We now focus on social determinants of health to offer additional explanations for poor health observed for African-Americans men health.

11
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,730
These structural explanation, however, are not new.

12
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:42,000
Dr. WBB DeBois empirically examined the health of African-Americans in his seminal research called the Philadelphia Negro.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:55,740
This was published in 1899. He implicated both the social life and structural factors in contributing to their poor health outcomes.

14
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:04,140
The goal of this presentation is to highlight research on the influence of family relationships on African-American boys and men's health

15
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:22,330
using findings from our work with the Fathers and Sons program as an example.

16
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,840
The Fathers and Sons program was developed in Flint Michigan.

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,420
Flint is a small urban city that has faced many challenges over decades that have contributed

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,660
to economic decline and limited resources due to structural discrimination and racism.

19
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:47,800
Examples of structural discrimination in Flint that you may have heard of is General Motors leaving the cities in the 1970s, and more recently

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,820
the Flint water crisis. Flint also has many strengths,

21
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,710
including strong community organizations that support residents and a willingness to advocate for change. In my work

22
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:09,580
I engage in community based participatory research which means I work with community partners in Flint to address concerns affecting residents.

23
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,290
Our community academic partnership involves several community based organizations,

24
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,300
the Genesee County Health Department, and the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,130
Based on local statistics and knowledge from our community partners

26
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,890
we determined that African-American boys in Flint were experiencing exposure to violence,

27
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,640
early sexual initiation, and substance use at rates higher than other youth.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,580
We wanted to address these health risk behaviors for African-American boys.

29
00:03:46,580 --> 00:04:07,460
Here's a question for you. What would you do if you had to develop an intervention program for African-American boys in Flint to protect their health?

30
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,940
Did you consider mentoring programs for boys? What about sports programs?

31
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:25,370
How about diversionary programs by the police? All of these are good ideas, and they are often used in programs for African-American boys.

32
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,550
We had additional information from the literature that was helpful.

33
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,320
We found that 67 percent of African-American children do not live with their biological father while growing up.

34
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:47,130
This puts them at risk for poor health outcomes, especially boys, because they often don't benefit from having both parents present.

35
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:55,110
We know from past research that families can play a protective role for African-Americans men's health by providing access to social support,

36
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,940
resources and home environments that facilitate healthy living.

37
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:09,460
In addition, children learn through experiences in the home.

38
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:18,220
Therefore, we had a basic question, can African-American fathers contribute to the health and well-being of their children

39
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,600
when did they do not live together?

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,160
With funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we designed the Fathers and Sons Intervention Program,

41
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:41,050
which was developed to be a culturally relevant intervention for nonresident African-American fathers and their sons to prevent youth violence

42
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:51,070
prevent early sexual initiation and prevent substance use among African-American boys and encourage physical activity for both fathers and sons.

43
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,980
How we did this was we focused on strengthening the parenting behaviors of the

44
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:06,770
nonresident father and focused on the sons intentions to avoid risky behavior.

45
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,700
Participants in the study were drawn from both Flint, MI and Saginaw, MI.

46
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Families that participated in the Flint, MI intervention were the key families,

47
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:30,140
we were focusing on in this particular study. Families in Saginaw, MI where our comparison group that didn't get an intervention

48
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,830
but from the results perspective, we were able to compare the results from the families in Flint who participated in

49
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,530
the intervention program with those in Saginaw to see if we could make a difference.

50
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,240
The participants overall included African-American families,

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,530
biological sons ages eight to 12 years old, and the fathers and sons lived in separate households.

52
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:10,490
The mothers or guardian had to provide consent for the sons to participate, and fathers could not be functionally impaired by substance abuse.

53
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:18,890
We created the intervention curriculum, working with focus groups of nonresident African-American fathers, sons who did not live with their fathers,

54
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:27,410
mothers of nonresident sons and resident families to obtain multiple perspectives of the challenges these families faced.

55
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:34,890
And just as important, potential solution to the challenges.

56
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,320
The results of the focus group served as the basis for developing our curriculum.

57
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,510
We focused on diversity among families to demonstrate that there's no one type of family differences exist in family structures,

58
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,200
even for nonresident families, and different values and beliefs are also prominent.

59
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,100
We also focused on personal relationships and responsibilities. Here

60
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:07,200
fatherhood and comes with responsibilities, and fathers also serve as a role model for their children.

61
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,750
Another important part of our intervention was a focus on parent child communication.

62
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,700
How well fathers and sons can communicate with each other, particularly around risky behaviors,

63
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,710
is an important strategy for trying to prevent those behaviors in African-American boys and also social support.

64
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,810
This is support both within and outside the family.

65
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:47,400
And as I mentioned before, key to what we were doing was developing the parenting skills in the father and the refusal skills in the sons.

66
00:08:47,400 --> 00:09:00,570
Findings from the study show that we were successful in improving the parenting behaviors of fathers in the intervention program in several ways.

67
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:11,190
First, and key to what we were doing, is that fathers increase their monitoring behavior of their son.

68
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:18,810
This is important because they do not live together, so how do fathers monitor when they live outside of the household with their sons?

69
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:27,720
This is a part of our curriculum that we focused on, and it was very successful as we were able to increase the father's monitoring skills.

70
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Talking about sex with his son was also an important parenting strategy that improved.

71
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Here we were concerned with if we are trying to prevent early sexual initiation,

72
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,030
there has to be communication between fathers and sons about sexual behavior.

73
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:52,830
Another key area was race socialization. This is how the fathers teaches his son how to be a black man.

74
00:09:52,830 --> 00:10:02,100
This is an important strategy within black families, and we incorporated it as part of our intervention as well and parenting satisfaction.

75
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,650
This was another key dimension. Fathers became more satisfied in their own parenting ability.

76
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:18,150
Often people don't have much expectations for nonresident fathers to be engaged in the socialization of their children.

77
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:24,360
And this is an underestimation of their abilities in order to parent their children.

78
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:36,900
Another key finding for us was fathers intention to talk in the future about these risky behaviors with their sons. In the process of doing this work

79
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,310
We also found that fathers who participated in the intervention when compared to those who

80
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:51,510
were in the comparison group were willing to ask for help when they had a drinking problem.

81
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,420
From the son's perspective, we also had some increases in success.

82
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,420
One was the fact that the son's also felt that they were being monitored more by their father.

83
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:11,310
So this maps onto fathers ability to monitor their sons. Sons are now saying that they are feeling more monitoring from their fathers.

84
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:19,470
Talking about sex with their father was another area of comfort that we were working on in order to prevent early sexual. Intentions

85
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,310
to avoid violence was another important one for us,

86
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,440
and from the son's perspective we were able to demonstrate this intention.

87
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:42,090
Critical was though we found that improving fathers parenting behaviors influence sons behavior and particularly around issues of aggression.

88
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:51,840
So the more fathers parenting behaviors improve, the less aggressive sons were with regard to their own behavior.

89
00:11:51,840 --> 00:12:01,590
We also found that improving fathers closeness, contact, and attention to exercise was associated with the son's attention to exercise.

90
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,270
So again, this is creating a family environment for improving mens health.

91
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:15,980
One of the things that we did have to be aware of is that when fathers came into the intervention there were some challenges that they face.

92
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:23,880
We found, for example, 47 percent of fathers had moderate to severe depressive symptoms.

93
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Depressive symptoms was associated with less contact with funds, less closeness to sons, less monitoring behavior and more conflict with sons.

94
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,100
All of this we discovered at the beginning of the intervention.

95
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,780
One of the things that we did demonstrate was the intervention itself address these issues and concerns.

96
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,190
We found that better relationships with their son was associated with less depressive

97
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:58,940
symptoms with fathers and in fathers asking for help with their drinking.

98
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,400
And that was an important part of our focus in this particular intervention.

99
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:17,380
One of the things becomes important is understanding the service needs of fathers as we work towards encouraging his parenting behaviors.

100
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,670
Question. Based on the findings you've heard from the study.

101
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:38,300
What are possible implications for change when working with nonresident African-American fathers.

102
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,280
Did you consider the role of fatherhood for health behavior outcomes?

103
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,410
What about additional research that is needed?

104
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:57,370
Any ideas for policy or service that could be beneficial to support nonresident African-American families?

105
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,960
We will discuss these issues in the next segment.
