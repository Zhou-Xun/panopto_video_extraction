00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,170
Hello, welcome to this lecture,

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,635
in which we discuss what
a probability model is.

3
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:17,039
Now, everything we do in
life has a probability,

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,170
whether it's simply rolling dice,

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,100
or playing cards, or
unfortunately figuring out

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,990
whether we will develop
high blood pressure

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,075
when we're 70 years old.

8
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,850
Now the shape of the
probability distribution

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,910
matters when we're trying
to make sense of the data,

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,650
or to make probability statements

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,525
like the one we just made.

12
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,280
So our learning
objectives include,

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,160
first to understand what
a probability model is,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,870
to then know that the
sample mean is used to

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,380
estimate what the unknown
population mean is,

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,880
to know that the sample
standard deviation is used to

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,930
estimate what the unknown

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,105
population standard deviation is,

19
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:52,400
to explain why probability models

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,935
are necessary for inference,

21
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,700
and then to comprehend
that we must

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,590
assume a probability model is

23
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,670
an approximation of

24
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,840
the unknown true model
in the population.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,830
We return one more time to

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,600
the big picture of biostatistics,

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,610
and focused on the remaining part

28
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,875
of this picture which is
highlighted in yellow.

29
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,140
We'll now use probability to make

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,940
inference from the data
back to the population.

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,370
Now for any given value,

32
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,630
the probability model
tells us how much of

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,550
the population would have values

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,010
below or above that given value.

35
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,100
For example, we might ask
what proportion of adults

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,765
living in assisted living centers

37
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:31,940
are aged 65 years or older.

38
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,725
We might ask what proportion of

39
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,060
uninsured pregnant women give

40
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,320
birth to babies weighing
less than 2500 grams,

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,010
or we might ask what proportion

42
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,300
of children living in poverty

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,650
developed tooth carries
eventually by age six.

44
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,620
All of these proportions
are known as

45
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,980
probabilities that
describe the population.

46
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,010
Now again the population
has parameters,

47
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,490
numbers that describe what
that population looks like.

48
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,410
The two most common parameters in

49
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,380
the population are the
population mean represented

50
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,240
by the Greek letter Mu and

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,025
the population standard deviation

52
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,575
represented by the
Greek letter Sigma.

53
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:12,620
Again, these parameters
are unknown,

54
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,885
but we would like to know
what the values are,

55
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,890
by drawing a sample of
data from the population.

56
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,490
From the sample, we get

57
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,994
a sample mean
represented by X-bar,

58
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,055
and we get a sample
standard deviation

59
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,755
represented by S sub x.

60
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,300
Now the sample mean,

61
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,310
if we have a
representative sample,

62
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,125
is an estimate of the
population mean Mu,

63
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,370
and the sample standard
deviation as S sub x if we have

64
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,725
a representative
sample is an estimate

65
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:43,070
of the population
standard deviation Sigma.

66
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,150
Unfortunately, the mean and
the standard deviation do

67
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,740
not summarize the distribution of

68
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,245
all values among the population.

69
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:52,880
Because although we now have

70
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,470
some idea regarding the center of

71
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,829
the distribution and how spread
out the distribution is,

72
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,420
we still lack information on

73
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,910
the exact shape of
the distribution.

74
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,680
The shape of the distribution

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,150
is important because it affects

76
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,655
probability statements
like the ones

77
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,095
at the beginning of this lecture.

78
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,540
So let's return to
my first question,

79
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,210
which focused on what proportion
of adults who live in

80
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,270
assisted living centers are
aged 65 years or older?

81
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,670
Many populations can have

82
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,595
the same values for the mean
and the standard deviation,

83
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,870
but have different shapes,

84
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,280
and therefore
different answers to

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,230
the question I just asked.

86
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,870
I show here a population
distribution,

87
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,955
the distribution of ages
that have a mean of

88
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:35,375
55 and a standard
deviation of 15.

89
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,430
We can see the shape
of this distribution

90
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,825
is fairly symmetric,

91
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:42,460
and has had his highest
peak at age 55.

92
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,415
In contrast, here's another
population distribution

93
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:50,330
still with a mean of 55 and
a standard deviation of 15.

94
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,580
But we can see that this
population distribution

95
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,125
is no longer symmetric.

96
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,125
It is actually right-skewed,

97
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,970
we see some ages off
to the right of 95 or

98
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,830
higher that were not as common

99
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,140
in the previous population.

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,450
Here is a third
population distribution,

101
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,355
also having a mean of 55 and
a standard deviation of 15.

102
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:10,640
But here we can see that

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,190
this distribution is fairly flat.

104
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,400
Every bar has the same
height for every age,

105
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,780
telling me that every age in

106
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,270
this population is
equally likely,

107
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,800
which is not true for the
previous two populations.

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,120
So all three of these have

109
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,190
the same population parameters,

110
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,935
but have distinctly
different shapes.

111
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:33,830
This shape affects
probability statements,

112
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,690
like the one I posed earlier.

113
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,260
In these three populations,

114
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,370
I have highlighted in blue,

115
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,265
the proportion of the population

116
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,995
that has ages of 65 or higher.

117
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:45,530
So again, there is a
vertical line of 65,

118
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,685
and I highlight all ages to
the right of that value.

119
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,175
Now the shape of
these distributions

120
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:56,165
affects how much of the
distribution is above 65.

121
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,070
In the leftmost population,

122
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,960
the proportion of
the population above

123
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,730
65 is just over 25 percent.

124
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,190
In the middle population,

125
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,880
the proportion is slightly
lower at 23.7 percent,

126
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,815
and the population of the right,

127
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,380
that answer is actually
almost 31 percent of

128
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,125
the population with
an age above 65.

129
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,880
So again, we highlight here that

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,920
the shape of the
distribution affects

131
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
the probability
statements that we might

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,640
try to make about the population.

133
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,530
Therefore, we would like to know

134
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,830
which shape is appropriate
for our population.

135
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,040
Now, we need to know which
shape is plausible for

136
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
the distribution
in the population

137
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,505
for us to answer the question.

138
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,555
However, we never do know the
shape of the distribution.

139
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,870
So as a solution, we have to
adopt a probability model,

140
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,330
that allows us to move
forward with our inference.

141
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,510
However, we do try to use
some judgment as to whether

142
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,260
our chosen model has any
biologic plausibility.

143
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,900
The most common
probability model for

144
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,790
a population distribution
that we use in

145
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,340
public health is the
normal distribution,

146
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,700
also known as the Gaussian
or bell-shaped distribution.

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,580
This distribution has a
mean that is equal to

148
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,475
its median because the
distribution is symmetric,

149
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:08,930
and the important property of

150
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,700
the normal distribution
is that once we know

151
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,170
the values of the population

152
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,885
mean and the population
standard deviation,

153
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,820
we know the entire shape of

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,590
the distribution as will be

155
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,714
highlighted in a future lecture.
