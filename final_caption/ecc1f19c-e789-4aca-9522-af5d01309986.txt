1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,430
Thank you. Good. So good to see everybody.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,040
Firstly, I want to apologize if I seem very tired. I got to Nairobi time last night.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,340
I got like 2 hours of sleep, so I am exhausted.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,030
But we will power through and good work on assignment number five.

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,810
Everybody is looking good and I will release those grades tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,520
Okay. Can anybody see my screen? Awesome.

7
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,460
Thank you. So today we'll be talking about minority health disparities and chronic diseases.

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,400
But to start off, minority health disparity is the term that's normally used.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,700
But while writing this lecture, I was thinking, I'm not sure if it's actually the correct term to use,

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,660
because you often have marginalized groups who face health disparities not often, but sometimes who aren't minorities.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,670
The classic example is in apartheid. In South Africa, the marginalized group which faced significant health disparities were blacks,

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,820
Africans who made up the vast majority of South Africans and the minority group, the white Afrikaners.

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,940
But a privileged group didn't face health disparities. And even even today, just off of my head, looking at the UAE, the United Arab Emirates,

14
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,650
the majority group there is actually migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent that make up about 60% of people living in the UAE.

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,590
And Emirati is actually the minority that only about 12% in the UAE are Emiratis.

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:57,870
But the minority group them Roces is the privileged one not facing health disparities, whereas the majority is just something to think about.

17
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,879
So we'll talk today about the burden of chronic disease, causes of major common diseases,

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,800
and then we will touch on minority health disparities or marginalized group health disparities, which lead into a small group discussion.

19
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,920
I know there's a lot there's a lot of interest around certain groups in this presentation.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,580
So I just want to show you the discussion groups over here.

21
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:34,290
And if you have any topic which are really interested, then send Jonathan a message and I'll make sure that you're in that group.

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,240
Sorry to make your life difficult, Jonathan. Not a problem.

23
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:49,640
So I'll go back to the beginning now. So why is this important?

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,150
Let's look at the graph on the left.

25
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,080
Just need to hide this panel. There we go.

26
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:08,440
Between 1990 and 2010, the number of daily disability adjusted life years lost due to communicable diseases has gone down, which is great.

27
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,460
And that's because of innovations in water and sanitation and hygiene and vaccines and and those kind of things.

28
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,520
But the burden of NCDs has gone up, and there are quite a few reasons for that, such as urbanization,

29
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,900
growing disparities and also people living longer, which you would touch on later.

30
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,540
And this is projected to continue in the future. The burden of communicable disease will go down and down and entities will just go up and up.

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,340
And this has really been amplified looking at the graph on the right in low and middle income countries,

32
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,340
more than high income countries between 2000 and projected up until 2030.

33
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,870
That's in high income countries. And NCDs haven't changed that much and on projected change that much.

34
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,080
But in low income countries and low middle income countries,

35
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,780
it's going to grow to become more than half of that's more than half of deaths attributable to NCD.

36
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,920
So this is a topic which is really important at the moment, but especially for the future of global public health.

37
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,300
I'm just a quick overview and this is directly from W.H.O.

38
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:30,620
NCDs kill 41 million people every year, and of all those, that 77% are actually in low and middle income countries too.

39
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,100
Lack of treatment and late detection of disease as well as a generally high burden.

40
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:45,710
Most NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancers and respiratory diseases and diabetes.

41
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,479
We'll touch a bit on this, little bit more into the lecture.

42
00:04:50,480 --> 00:05:04,520
But behavioral factors are some of the biggest risks and studies of tobacco use, physical inactivity, alcohol use and having an unhealthy diet.

43
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,820
As with most other diseases which you talk about often in this class,

44
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:23,090
detecting and screening for disease early on and treating early on is the absolute best way of addressing entities, you know, other than prevention.

45
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,480
But palliative care is also a very important factor, especially when they progress quite a bit.

46
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,750
Globally, pretty much everywhere, except for a handful of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

47
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:47,130
NCDs are the cause of a majority of deaths, particularly in the more developed countries.

48
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:55,760
So North America, Europe, Australia and in the Middle East over here.

49
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,380
But even in Africa, NCDs make up a not insignificant amount of deaths.

50
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,240
If we look, for example, in southern Africa, so in Namibia and South Africa, in Zimbabwe,

51
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,820
NCDs are still attributable to about to close to half of the deaths in the countries.

52
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,350
And as this as time goes on, as we saw on the first slide,

53
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:32,780
you'd expect the amount of deaths attributable to NCDs to just go up and up and in in sub-Saharan Africa to become the prevalent cause of that.

54
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:44,820
This this table, this graph shows worldwide which which NCDs in blue and which communicable diseases

55
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,060
in red are the most prevalent causes of deaths or for both sexes of all ages.

56
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,050
Heart disease is the biggest one, as well as stroke, but not insignificant.

57
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:07,050
All the different cancers of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, as well as diabetes and different respiratory illnesses.

58
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,240
Infectious diseases still aren't insignificant number, but definitely much lower than NCDs.

59
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,900
And of course, we still see some from injuries, from traumatic injuries.

60
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,170
Looking at Lmics, you see similar trends, even though as you expect right now,

61
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,230
you're seeing a few more you see a bit more that's attributable to respiratory disease.

62
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,590
But still you see the big players as you did globally.

63
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,219
Heart disease and stroke cancers.

64
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,880
Diabetes and respiratory illness.

65
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:54,959
And as you'd expect in the high income countries, the non-communicable diseases really take over as the prevalent cause of death attributable to,

66
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,640
I believe, over 90% of deaths in high income countries.

67
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:13,100
On the left will be here. We can see in 1990, globally, the ranking of causes of that first cardiovascular disease, followed by neoplasms,

68
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:24,110
which are essentially tumors, then a handful of infectious diseases, and then a splattering of other NCDs, IEDs and injuries.

69
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:38,120
In 2019, though, infectious diseases when when quite a bit lower in that list in 1990 reasons people in five all IEDs.

70
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,920
But now in 2019 only reason number four, eight and ten under top ten of IEDs in 2019.

71
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,100
And all of these different entities are advancing up the rankings, a trend which you continue to see.

72
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,360
This also happened in low and middle income countries.

73
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,500
Yes. In 2019, you still have IEDs as the fourth, fifth and sixth most important cause of death.

74
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,860
But one, two and three are now NCDs, which you didn't see in 1990.

75
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,670
And again, a trend you'd expect to continue. So what are the causes of chronic diseases?

76
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,190
The W.H.O. discusses three categories of chronic disease causes modifiable factors or

77
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,630
behavioral factors that think about smoking and poor diet and that kind of thing.

78
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,620
Environmental factors. So air pollution and other factors like that.

79
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,040
And metabolic factors like high blood pressure or high blood glucose levels.

80
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Most causes of chronic diseases, though, are the behavioral modifiable causes tobacco use, alcohol use, diets and lack of exercise.

81
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:01,850
On the top. We can look at the behavior. We can look at the behavioral factors and which diseases they attributable to.

82
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,140
And we won't go on this graph in too much detail.

83
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:13,340
But behavior factors are attributable to cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms and pretty much everything on this list.

84
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:24,020
The metabolic factors as well are pretty important, particularly for those cardiovascular problems, which is to be expected.

85
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:34,310
And environmentally, you're going to be looking at a lot of what's it called, respiratory NCDs.

86
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,780
This is not breaking it down into those different factors. So here we are looking specifically at the environmental factors.

87
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:50,770
Air pollution is by is by far the highest, which causes a burden of disease around the world, including NCDs.

88
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,080
Then you have wash. That's primarily for the kids occupational risks.

89
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,240
So what's your work environment right now? A really interesting one, which is temperature.

90
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:08,260
Working in extreme heat is actually a major cause of stroke, especially among migrant workers.

91
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:17,110
The World Cup is starting next week in Qatar, and the amount of migrant workers there who had heatstroke is absolutely staggering.

92
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,720
A lot of migrant workers done the least because of heat stroke and unsafe working conditions.

93
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,330
This is examining the behavioral risk or modifiable risk factors and the impact of those on disease.

94
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,549
Malnutrition primarily infects. It affects infectious disease burden.

95
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,460
Tobacco use and dietary habits have massive, massive implications for non-communicable diseases,

96
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:53,960
as is alcohol use and also unsafe sex, food and its causes for cancer, particularly through HPV.

97
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,260
And then also, as you'd expect, drug use and physical activity and in a little bit from violence,

98
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,560
both intimate partner violence and childhood violence.

99
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,049
And then the metabolic factors which pretty much exclusively influence.

100
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:16,500
And so no surprise, high blood pressure, which can cause strokes and cardiovascular events.

101
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:28,460
High fasting blood glucose, which can cause diabetes and other problems, as well as high BMI and high lipid levels and kidney dysfunction.

102
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,170
But it's really important to consider what is the root of these factors, these causes of NCDs.

103
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:43,530
I'm sure you've heard in the other classes, which also Dr. Pai touched on last week,

104
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,940
more than half of your health is determined by whether you were born in the US.

105
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,430
They say it's determined by a zip code, by a bomb and there's a lot that goes into it racism, sexism and other isms.

106
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,799
Something which I ask you to consider when you're writing your papers, doing the MPH.

107
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,160
And afterwards, as people often say, race is a is a factor.

108
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,520
And in indices, for example,

109
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:20,730
people might say being South Asian increases your risk of diabetes or being black increases your risk of high blood pressure.

110
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,649
The reality is it's not the race that increases your risk of those is actually racism.

111
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,040
So racism against black people increases the risk of high blood pressure.

112
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:37,260
Racism against South Asians, increases risk of diabetes are also important as well, you know,

113
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:47,820
looking at sex and sexual identity and gender as well as xenophobia and and national origins.

114
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,660
Immigration is a big factor when it comes to NCDs.

115
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,959
And these also all feed into income as well as access to can services and education,

116
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:08,070
although those factors can also be important apart from race and sex and and national origin and all the other demographic factors.

117
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,930
I found a great paper today which I want to walk you through.

118
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,120
I wish I found a few days ago a second of sun it as a reading, but it classifies three different levels of racism.

119
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,830
And it uses this really interesting analogy of a gardener.

120
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,989
So the story it tells is a gardener moves into a new house.

121
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,940
And in this house there are two bottles, one with good soil and one with bad soil.

122
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,450
He has to back to the scenes one regret seeds and one with pink seeds.

123
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,470
Now this garden prefers red flowers to red seeds.

124
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,920
So he puts the red seeds into the good pot and the pink seeds into the pink pot.

125
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,140
Because of this, the red seeds flourish. They do well.

126
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:07,290
They grow. They grow big. And the pink seeds don't. And this represents institutionalized racism, which is a difference in access to goods.

127
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,900
And so this is an opportunity the pink seeds couldn't access good soil and good nutrition over that.

128
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,970
Just like how some groups can't access to the and access healthcare.

129
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:25,440
And this institutionalized racism can be a result of legal structure barriers or even societal norms.

130
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:33,190
Okay. So the gardener looks at these flowers and he thinks to himself, Well,

131
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:39,160
I was I was right to put the red flowers and the good pot and the pink flowers and the bad apples,

132
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,959
because the red flowers are doing much better in the pink flowers and even goes as

133
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,430
far to just pick the petals of the pink flowers because they don't look very nice.

134
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,320
And what he's doing is it's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

135
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:06,730
His perceived differences because of the institutionalized racism led to led to these these these effects, which then caused a confirmation in him,

136
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,020
which is what is called personally mediated racism, where somebody, you know,

137
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,550
embodies that racist spirit as all those racist thoughts without considering the full picture.

138
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,760
And then finally, what happens? And to be honest, in my opinion, this is where the analogy falls apart a little bit, even though it still makes sense.

139
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,590
Is the pink flowers. They they they don't attract bees.

140
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,270
But it's true smell or color. Instead, they send the bees and the pollinators to be bred flowers.

141
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,530
And what ends up happening over time is true through different crashes.

142
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,150
Those pink flowers turn red.

143
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:06,700
And this is the analogy for internalized racism, which is acceptance by by marginalized groups, that that they are lesser than the privileged group.

144
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:14,020
And that you can see quite often people using whitening cream or, you know,

145
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:21,570
migrants coming and trying to assimilate as quickly as possible to to to the surroundings.

146
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,920
Oh, it's just not believing in oneself as a result of their race or their or other demographic factors.

147
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,340
And now we are just going to touch slightly on minority health disparities.

148
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:42,940
This is a great video I found from Johns Hopkins talking about health disparities in Baltimore.

149
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,390
So I'll just play that now. The world has got to change.

150
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,100
I lived in a community that was so prescient that politicians.

151
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:09,280
Now we have drug dealers in corner stores that they don't sell anything with the wrong things.

152
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,460
But you cannot deny the impact that has on people's health.

153
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,860
I have been in West Baltimore an entire life as far as money.

154
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,050
My mother didn't have any money. I don't want to say she was poor.

155
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:33,490
I'll say low income poor. We were, though. In the fifties, we didn't have any choices.

156
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,790
And as far as health care, the health care system then was limited.

157
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:46,520
It was not good for us. And medicine cost so much that my family sometimes will at eight or will I pay for my medicine.

158
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,580
What's on your mind? Oh, I just love my daughters when they come home, when we get together and we cook up our meals together.

159
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:00,040
It's helping me. When my oldest went to college, she came back with a different diet.

160
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,450
Now, what happens is if I do a meatloaf is turkey instead of ground beef.

161
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,920
You know, I make spaghetti. I make stuff like that. It's what, turkey and chicken.

162
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,639
We grew up. We ate pork. We ate bacon.

163
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,910
We ate for a show. We ate pork chops.

164
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,430
I did not think it was that healthy because this is what people are accustomed to.

165
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,080
I was in denial. I didn't want to face the fact that I was becoming a guy,

166
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:35,230
that the impact was the fact that my family ended up with heart disease, emphysema, diabetes, cancer.

167
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,450
My mother's sister, her daughter died from diabetes. She was an amputee.

168
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,130
My mother died of a massive heart attack and.

169
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,940
To address health disparities, we need to understand why they exist, that they're not due to one single factor.

170
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,450
They're the result of policy decisions we make as a society.

171
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,410
They're due to the environment, health, education, insurance, and access to care, access to healthy food and stress.

172
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:14,280
Those stresses are actually experienced disproportionately by people who are poor and people who have been historically disadvantaged in this society.

173
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,300
Solutions to these problems cannot just be medical systemic.

174
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,460
So I think everybody has to get involved if we want a nation to be strong.

175
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,990
But people in that nation have to be healthy. They have to be well.

176
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,930
If there's anything that we can do to stamp out disparities, we need to do it by any means necessary.

177
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,770
I'm a single parent. East Baltimore Medical Center.

178
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,400
Most of patients are underserved. Opportunity by Steve Kroft Coming up to your mouth.

179
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,610
Michelle's a terrific success story. There was actually a year where she had lost her job and before she found a new one,

180
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:57,200
she had no health insurance and she still managed to buy her medicines out of pocket, paid out of pocket to come and have doctor visits.

181
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,420
She was really invested in her own health.

182
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,560
That's something that Dr. Cooper's research is looking at, why patients don't invest in their health like we wish they would.

183
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,840
The next thing on the agenda is the community update. So Michelle joined our Community Advisory Board in 2011.

184
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:23,300
We provide education to the community about health and about research and offer training programs for community health workers.

185
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,659
We can be sure that we are meeting the needs of people appropriately and that we're not leaving out certain

186
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,850
groups of people that have traditionally not been included in conversations related to health and health care.

187
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,260
Our strong relationship with the community is just essential.

188
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,829
There's no way that we could do what we're doing without their input.

189
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,640
And my work is just one of many initiatives here at Hopkins.

190
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,150
Simmons is a great example of what happens when we get it right as clinicians and as an institution.

191
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,320
I am a fighter. I am a believer. I stand for what's right and what's right is people's help.

192
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,680
I will never give up as long as I have breath in my body.

193
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,750
One of the things that is so important is that people have what I call a liberated picture, and it's hard to be liberated when you're not healthy.

194
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,170
When I say liberated, I mean freedom to be all excitement.

195
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,230
We have to be clear. We don't deal with disparities.

196
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,910
What we're doing is denying people an opportunity to give back to the world.

197
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,300
So we've got to fight it. We've got to fight it off everything we've got.

198
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,740
Like I mentioned at the beginning, the section.

199
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:51,480
It's important to consider that minority health isn't just about race, that immigration also isn't a big part down to sex and gender.

200
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,840
So Jonathan will just discuss briefly sexual and gender minority health disparities.

201
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,740
Awesome. Yeah, I am. So this is a sexual and gender minority health disparities research framework,

202
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:15,220
and it's meant to demonstrate both intersectional and interdimensional levels of minority health disparities.

203
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,680
And the factors that you can see on the graph and the image there are both positive and negative factors.

204
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,010
So there are both risks and protective aspects that could both improve or worsens health.

205
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,690
So starting at the individual level, we're looking at things like minority stress, intersectional identity.

206
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:42,100
So we do also want to be very conscious here about like the specific experience of racial and ethnic minority LGBTQ people,

207
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,460
self-acceptance or your own perspective of yourself coping mechanisms that you might use so that could,

208
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,389
you know, having healthy coping mechanisms can be a protective aspect here and then moving outwards.

209
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,160
So looking at your interpersonal relationships, what is your relationship like with your family?

210
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:07,810
Do you have a support system, whether that's a GSA or a chosen family, what with your coming out experience like?

211
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:16,120
And then these things kind of interplay with each other too. So we have community factors like like religious institutions.

212
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,349
And what does affirming community look like in your area?

213
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,319
Can you access prep? But those things are also directly related to some of these interpersonal factors, right?

214
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,480
Like what is your family environment, right?

215
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,760
Like while that's pretty clearly also could be related to what is your religious

216
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,689
institution look like and then kind of moving outwards to societal factors.

217
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:46,389
Then we're looking at things like data collection, law related to hate crimes or health care policy,

218
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:52,570
which kind of goes back to community factors like can you access prop well, what does public funding look like for prep?

219
00:24:53,530 --> 00:25:03,640
So this is just a way to think about kind of unique stressors or protective things for LGBTQ people and then thinking through the way that there's,

220
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,830
you know, at both an individual level of societal level and an interpersonal level,

221
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,410
the way that these can create unique health disparities and inequities for LGBTQ people.

222
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,120
But thanks to him and I, it's really important just to echo what you mentioned on the intersectionality.

223
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,840
And people are all having different experiences to think what we get trapped in in public health so much as.

224
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,290
Is lumping people into categories and trying to treat groups as a whole,

225
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,190
which is tough because public health is by nature public and and it's doing to some extent,

226
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,780
but still making sure that people are still treated to some extent as individuals.

227
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:59,190
So there's a lot of interventions to address health disparities in in minority populations.

228
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,560
But some of the best I've seen grassroots interventions,

229
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:10,440
these interventions which have been formulated and conceptualized and carried out by people in the community a lot of times,

230
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:18,870
especially when it comes to seeking care beyond the structure barriers such as not being able to afford care,

231
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,090
being scared to go to clinics or those kind of reasons people might not trust your authorities.

232
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:34,920
Imagine for a lot of groups, you know, the person telling you to get a COVID vaccine, for example, looks just like the person who.

233
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,180
The example that they'll give on these videos carried out the Tuskegee experiment.

234
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,190
So, you know, it makes sense to go and listen to them.

235
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:54,090
So these grassroots interventions often take trust in community members and have them try to intervene to improve health.

236
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:01,590
And this is a great one from, I believe, the black coalition on the COVID vaccine.

237
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:09,870
Respect for our black bodies and our black lives must be a core value for those who are

238
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,780
working to find the vaccine for this virus that has already taken so many of our loved ones.

239
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:27,000
They are black America. We love you. That top us love letter from hundreds of black medical professionals, doctors and nurses.

240
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,180
That's how this letter begins as COVID 19 cases rise again in a pandemic that has disproportionately impacted people of color.

241
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,180
So the letter actually comes from a historic coalition of black medical experts trying to spread

242
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:49,110
information about the pandemic and the fight against COVID that they really hope a vaccine is coming.

243
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,930
The Morehouse School of Medicine is part of this coalition that has put out this beautiful love letter.

244
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,200
The school's president tells us she wants black Americans to know that they do have representation at the table.

245
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:11,610
We have black scientists who are very much involved in the vaccine development at these companies and at the NIH as well.

246
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:21,390
We have black scientists who are going to be on the FDA vaccine panel that is going to review the data for the emergency use of the word.

247
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,020
So we are, as we say, are in the room where it's happening.

248
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:33,210
So historically, in the past, that may not have been the case, but I feel very confident that that's the case now.

249
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,270
Dr. Valerie Montgomery. Rice says she pushed for major drug companies to conduct clinical trials there,

250
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:48,260
including historically black medical schools, and has really personally been on calls with them all throughout the process.

251
00:28:50,330 --> 00:29:04,100
And another really amazing grassroots interaction I saw during the COVID vaccine was from the families of the Tuskegee Airmen and the video,

252
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,960
it's in the link at the bottom of that if anybody wants to watch it later by in the slides on campus.

253
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,600
But they made this whole school of videos essentially talking about the Tuskegee Airmen.

254
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,020
But bringing to your attention the fact that for the Tuskegee Airmen,

255
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:29,360
there was a lack of treatment or the treatment being withheld, which was which was which was the great issue over that.

256
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:39,170
And actually getting the COVID 19 vaccine, you know, completely goes along with the spirit of of the learned lessons from that.

257
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:48,620
And there's actually a whole set of slides on on grassroots interventions for the COVID vaccine, which I'll post on campus as well.

258
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,829
So before we move on to the discussion, just any questions.

259
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:08,389
And I do also just want to say, I am aware that a lot of people over here would have experienced health disparities by by by virtue of who they are.

260
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,290
And if anybody wants to share their own experiences or say anything, I would also welcome that.

261
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,910
So let's move on to the group activity then. Jonathan, if you could help with setting up the groups, please.

262
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,350
And we will spend about 25 minutes on that before we report back.

263
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,810
Did anybody request a group? Yeah.

264
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,460
So Marcus asked to be in group one.

265
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,480
Rahul asked to be in group three. Yeah.

266
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,900
Now I've asked to be in group four. Okay.

267
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,170
Mm hmm. So I saw that email.

268
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,410
So we're we're going ahead with you, is that right? We're just doing too. And sudden.

269
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,030
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Perfect. Should I send her this zoom link?

270
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,770
Oh, yeah. That'll be really useful, please. Thanks. Okay, well, do.

271
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,799
On assignment supply will be quite straightforward for grading.

272
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:52,250
It'll just be if they did three activities as long as they fill out each one completed the point three Ohio.

273
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,680
Yeah attainment went pretty quick to. And Benson already resubmitted his.

274
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,070
So I and I graded that already, so it should be all good.

275
00:33:02,890 --> 00:36:20,360
The next. Mm hmm. And I just sent you Simon six when you get a chance.

276
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,490
I didn't have an example, so can you just make an example of that, then maybe next week we can discuss them.

277
00:36:28,490 --> 00:39:24,450
GROSS Yeah, absolutely. They wanted to check.

278
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,319
Did you want me to post the video?

279
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,100
An article that Dr. Python in the chat last week.

280
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:47,259
Yes. I'm just trying to think about how. I guess you can just make a discussion post that, but don't make it a discussion.

281
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,540
Just like make a discussion process and say, see, say this is what you put into it.

282
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,370
I haven't I haven't gotten that far. I'm wondering if you can add me to the group three.

283
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,620
I'm on another computer, but I can't access. I make on my computer.

284
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,310
I associated in three. Yeah, I am on another level.

285
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:32,220
Okay, I see it. I got it. Yeah. Neither of which I declined.

286
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,070
But, guys, this is why. I don't think so. Okay.

287
00:40:36,080 --> 00:51:29,890
Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks, Sophia. I'm just looking over the assignment, Ryan.

288
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:37,450
Besides complete the following table, or, if you prefer, provide the same information in a brief paragraph.

289
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:44,150
That's how you want it. And do you want cable in paragraphs or.

290
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,640
No. They can do one or the other. I just trying to think about a way of making it not confusing.

291
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,100
I just. Yeah. I feel like they're going to be confused by that.

292
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:03,469
Yeah, it's a. Okay.

293
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:09,230
Let's take out if you can take out the paragraph, but say something along the lines of.

294
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:22,520
The table should include. Between 500, 800 words of text.

295
00:52:22,520 --> 00:55:37,550
Just they put it up on the web. Everybody is back.

296
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,350
So let's start with Group One. And start us off.

297
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,080
So we were doing access to care among Latin immigrants in Michigan.

298
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:57,880
And so a lot of the big causes surrounding lack of access to care is immigration and enforced immigration rules.

299
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:02,610
So the increased immigration enforcement has resulted in a lot of like deferred doctors visits,

300
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:07,860
mainly because a lot of the clinics are located really close to areas in which like law

301
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,780
enforcement officials are located and where there have been like pick ups to like deport people.

302
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,060
So there's a lot of fear of contact with the law enforcement traveling to and from the clinic.

303
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:25,919
There's an article that we were linked to. There's a lot of like stories of people who had had family members or close friends be picked up by law

304
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:33,060
enforcement while they were on the way to the clinic just by the proximity to the law enforcement officers.

305
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:39,300
Also, financial pressures of trying to like pay for things, especially if you're uninsured.

306
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:47,620
Health care can be really cost prohibitive that lengthy wait times when you finally get to a health care facility.

307
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,570
So a lot of people have work or have kids that they need to take care of.

308
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:56,910
And so taking that time to try to go to a clinic, sit down, wait in there, like have your appointment,

309
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,790
pay a lot for that appointment is prohibitive to a lot of people,

310
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:04,710
especially immigrants and a lack of available Portuguese and Spanish speaking translators.

311
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:13,799
They're at a lot of clinics. There's not like translators available to help facilitate doctor and patient communication.

312
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,090
And so people will go once have a really bad experience where they're unable to understand their doctor

313
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,410
or their doctors aren't able to understand why they're there or their primary complaints or anything.

314
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,569
And so they want to come back because it wasn't a useful or helpful experience.

315
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,180
And then I don't know if you all can see it, but if you go to the jam board or whatever there,

316
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,260
each of the things at the bottom have like a story attached with them.

317
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:44,630
And so by personal testimony from people, because a lot of that research from the article that we read was like interviews.

318
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:52,380
And so it just a way to sort of illustrate like the three primary concerns with.

319
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:09,320
Yeah. Lack of access to care. And yeah, so those were actually like patient comments that were made that appeared in the article that we wrote.

320
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,530
And so for impacts on non-communicable diseases,

321
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:25,290
we had a few kind of general impacts that came as well as some that were made to address these issues for our next communities and machines.

322
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:32,780
And the first one was to increase the number of cases, since many then people avoid seeking care.

323
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:38,990
Actually, due to many disparities that they face and then a lack of plan,

324
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,850
representation of medical professionals prevents clients from accessing care.

325
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:53,870
So and then the lack of health care impacts chronic disease as key intervention is key for managing the disease.

326
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:58,850
And PCBs are often the first and how to sustain doses of CDs.

327
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:05,270
But if people are preventing the seeking of care, the step is missed until the disease becomes worse.

328
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:15,060
So this can usually happen with specialty care and then occupational related to the exposure it can cause NCDs.

329
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:22,400
So this is usually attributable to a kind of danger seeking behavior from Lennox Community.

330
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:32,159
Yeah. Oh, sorry for interventions.

331
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,880
I'm going to be kind of reiterating some of what Rachel had mentioned for causes.

332
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:41,999
So a big part of the article that we read focused on just like public funding

333
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,959
allocated to medical resources for the Latin X community and to just lobbying

334
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:59,280
for appropriate support that can be used to spend on especially like transportation services and just getting people to where they can access care,

335
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:04,410
especially for folks who might not have driver's license or something appropriate.

336
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:12,360
Transportation is a big barrier there. And then also kind of like what Rachel mentioned as well, increasing representation in the medical field,

337
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:20,910
making sure that there's a wide variety of languages spoken in primary care clinics so that people can effectively communicate

338
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:28,410
and be medically literate with their primary care providers and an emphasis on also culturally competent care as well.

339
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:36,120
And then something else that I thought was interesting that the article mentioned is that expectant mothers experienced

340
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:43,290
delay in prenatal care due to local law enforcement's involved involvement in the promotion of federal immigration laws.

341
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:54,270
So something that I knew a little bit about was 87 that allows local law enforcement to kind of jumpstart arrest and deportation processes.

342
01:00:54,510 --> 01:01:00,720
And because that's specifically relevant to expectant mothers, I know that there are groups working to try to dissolve to 87.

343
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:05,880
And so that's definitely a relevant aspect as well.

344
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,390
And then I think Mark just wanted to say something. Yeah.

345
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:17,150
Just as has been said, a lot of a lot of the issues around don't like the lack of representation because

346
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:23,120
we often don't see Latin doctors among medicine because they're discouraged.

347
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,450
Since the immigration bill passed, they don't have legal accommodations to go to school.

348
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,570
They become, you know, your hospital aid workers.

349
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,620
They're just become like the most low paid jobs of Canada think of.

350
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:43,100
And that increases the. And there's, of course, not only that and, you know, one issue that bothers me a lot of zwane, they have translators,

351
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:48,590
but only Spanish speaking translators, and they forget that Brazil is the only country that speaks Portuguese and they totally forgot about it,

352
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:54,140
even though you have them says airport parking is one of the critical languages according to the agreement,

353
01:01:54,170 --> 01:02:03,409
they have to give them funding instead of abroad. So and then, you know, one thing that I study along the mind of that,

354
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:09,020
I talk about committee and applicators where the hospital staff for hire people that know the language

355
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:15,200
and no health care and have like a very intersectional personality and say to the hospital worker,

356
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,980
navigate around the health care system with this person that does not know anything about the U.S. health, health care system or stuff like that.

357
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:25,639
But isn't it often seen only in big cities?

358
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:34,100
There's no programs. In Michigan, there's no funding. And I personally ever experienced this, but I know my grammar data at MSU.

359
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,560
I had the hospital nearby because she does not speak English,

360
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:42,830
just diagnosed with cancer and a translator there spoke Portuguese from Portugal from 1800.

361
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:46,970
So my grandma was looking at me confused like, what's happening? What's this talking about?

362
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:52,430
And I cannot say anything because they don't allow the federal member to speak to that person.

363
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,230
Word and care has to be the translator, the doctor, and in that case, my grandma.

364
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,950
So this is a really hot topic. It's not brought up a lot of times.

365
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:06,460
So. Thanks so much and especially Marcus for sharing that.

366
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,770
It's really. Amazing in a bad way how bad the US is at these things.

367
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:19,610
And pretty much every country you have community health workers from the community who would do exactly what you were describing,

368
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,270
that, you know, your grandmother needed you, but you don't find that at all.

369
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,280
Just one question for this group.

370
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:36,710
Did you find any evidence of healthcare staff so doctors or nurses actively referring patients to to ICE or other immigration authorities?

371
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,650
I don't think I'll work at a hospital before.

372
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:47,740
I haven't seen that. But what I have seen, I've seen a lot of microaggressions towards those patients.

373
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:52,989
Right. Like a lot of nurses were like, can you come and help me with this patient who don't speak English?

374
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,210
And I know you speak Spanish. Like, can you come help me?

375
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,320
Like, I don't understand. They're saying, like, can you help me?

376
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:06,220
And what I have seen often and often said on and off is the police are only around hospital.

377
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,840
They tend to be around the places, bedrooms.

378
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,510
And I have to mention most of the time they're white dementia patients.

379
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,200
They do get security, but not as often as the people see people.

380
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:24,999
But I note that not another hospital currently in said I have like the 27 G or one of my friends that's from Brazil.

381
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,300
They used to live in Michigan. The local police started a process of what a part of him and he got the part from the U.S.

382
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,760
So that's the thing that happens in Michigan nobody talks about.

383
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:39,520
And another thing related to immigration stuff is that when people come in, ask me if I can vote,

384
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,480
and I say, no, it came out and it just dropped their faces like, Oh, okay.

385
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,760
Life goes on and I want to tell them why I cannot vote.

386
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:53,140
And they don't realize that by law I'm mainly a citizen, should not be called a citizen at this point.

387
01:04:54,530 --> 01:05:00,159
I should have the right to vote primarily and locally, but they don't even know we pay taxes and all that.

388
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,090
So it's another issue that I can see being brought up to the health care field as well.

389
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:13,210
Yep. Thanks, Marcos. The reason I ask that question as well is because I've seen in other countries in Malaysia especially.

390
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:20,790
Doctors calling the police when undocumented immigrants came in to to their clinics.

391
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,020
So, obviously, you know, if this happened to us, like you mentioned, still, you know, you have the police over there.

392
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:33,000
But something to keep an eye out as well is how complicit other health care staff escaped.

393
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:39,570
Thank you so much for sharing. Group number two, some really quick comment, Ryan, on the first one.

394
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:46,379
One other thing to think about, it wasn't in the article, but just related to policy is that people who are undocumented and don't have

395
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,910
citizens citizenship status are also excluded from Medicaid and Medicare.

396
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,520
So that would be another cause of them being underinsured and not being able to afford care.

397
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:07,700
Yeah. That's a good point. Thanks, Jonathan. I'm sure the same thing in in other countries, but in the UK it's, it's often the same thing as well.

398
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,480
But also it's like healthcare system group number two. Yeah.

399
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:21,210
So I can kick us off. We looked at birth defects among our Pakistani community in Bradford, United Kingdom.

400
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:27,000
So this like little pocket here it is, has a really high prevalence of birth defects.

401
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,840
And we found that this is caused from hereditary genetics passing through marriage of cousins, primarily through first cousins.

402
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:43,650
But this is pretty common. Even in Pakistan itself, about 60% of the marriages there are between first cousins and about 30% in this community,

403
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:50,309
I believe, are also between first cousins. A paper I had looked at a little bit from 2014.

404
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:55,709
So this is probably due to like transnational marriage where they have like one person who

405
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,790
is in the UK themselves and they marry their first cousin in Pakistan and bring them over.

406
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:07,680
And this kind of keeps like respect and tradition within the family and elevates the family both in Pakistan and the UK as well.

407
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:26,270
I can go next. So the for the burden of this is I think the the article that was linked to it said that about 300,000 infants are born in

408
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:35,360
Pakistan with severe birth defects and about in UK in this this pocket in Bradford 37% of the married couples are first cousins.

409
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:43,759
And so moving into possible interventions, really there's nothing behaviorally that you would want to change.

410
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,239
It's just about giving education campaigns so that genetic testing is more available and people are more likely

411
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:56,270
to go in for genetic testing to know what are the potential risks about having kids after they're married.

412
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:00,139
And we discussed some access, some barriers to screening.

413
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:08,150
And really the main thing is that genetic testing can be really expensive and they might have to miss work to see a genetic counselor.

414
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,640
And that's just not something that everyone can do.

415
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:21,380
And so it's about making genetic testing more available and cheaper so that these communities have more information they can work with.

416
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,110
And you touched me slightly. But anything else on the possible interventions?

417
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,010
Yeah. So for possible interventions.

418
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:50,740
One of the key things is kind of offering counseling and helping advise parents that may be in like a cancellation.

419
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:55,340
I don't know how to pronounce that word. Consent, tenuous relationship.

420
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:02,730
And another thing is reducing stigma and encouraging couples to get genetic testing.

421
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:09,590
So those are just a few ways that we can intervene with this community.

422
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:16,520
It's just difficult to kind of suggest interventions because the likelihood of a birth defect,

423
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,960
while it's like 6%, that is not an insanely high statistic.

424
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:28,820
So couples who are trying and have had success on like prior children with no defects, it doesn't really deter them from trying again.

425
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:34,520
Whereas in studies where the couple was likely to have a child with a birth defect upon their first birth,

426
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,750
they're more likely to kind of wait and consider repercussions upon the second.

427
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,690
But because the statistic of it occurring is so minimal, it isn't really impeding people from that.

428
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:50,100
But. Perfect. Thank you. Something else to mention.

429
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:54,450
I'm not saying it's it's a perfect solution.

430
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:59,310
And the solution, which should be considered, is family planning services.

431
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:15,400
Some may argue. Some may argue with the validity that that borders on on eugenics, especially when you're targeting a certain ethnic group.

432
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:23,409
But among the Pakistani British community, especially in Bradford, unwanted pregnancies,

433
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:28,690
unplanned pregnancy rates are credibly high because there's almost no use of contraceptives over there.

434
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:33,370
So just something to think about. But like I mentioned, there's a lot of ethics behind that.

435
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,850
So great. Thanks so much for giving us an overview.

436
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:43,440
And that was a really interesting documentary on this as well, which I'll share on Canvas Group Number three.

437
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:52,740
Yes. Sorry. The sun. You can hear me on, right? Yes.

438
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,710
Okay. I'm looking at my screen. That's where my computer, my face is this way.

439
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:07,410
But I'll talk a little bit about the causes. So we're looking at chronic diseases among members of the weaker ethnic group in China.

440
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:14,489
And just for reference, like this article was published in 2014, so we're not exactly sure of the causes of change a little bit.

441
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:23,399
Seems like like the ethnic cleansing of wiggers in China, which, according to Google, occurred like began in 2017.

442
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,479
But we're not necessarily believing that it could have occurred earlier.

443
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,990
It could have occurred by the time this article was published in 2014.

444
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:39,960
So anyway, some of the causes include that the article mentioned low consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables and garlic.

445
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,360
54% of individuals had an elementary education or education.

446
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,840
Religious individuals also had higher odds of entries,

447
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:58,940
which we found to be interesting because there was like a low a low prevalence of like alcohol consumption,

448
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,839
but there is a higher odds also among smokers.

449
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:13,250
So their smoking is certainly affecting someone like cardio cardiovascular and seeds that have that are prevalent in this group.

450
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:22,159
And then individuals living in rural areas and individuals that reported they were unsatisfied with their daily life experience,

451
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:28,620
increased risk of and CDs and we're not exactly sure what is causing the satisfaction in daily life.

452
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:32,540
That's like a matter of like poorer social protection,

453
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:42,919
perhaps if they're informal workers or if that's also a product of like stirring sort of feeling of of well,

454
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:51,980
certainly oppression by that time as well. But then also like worries about ongoing ethnic cleansing if it had occurred or started occurring in 2014.

455
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,080
And then lastly,

456
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:03,200
we have what is it some say having three or more negative events in the past two years was also positively associated with development of entities.

457
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,139
It's a little unclear what negative events are, but that's pretty broad.

458
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:16,160
And again, we're not sure like what underlying social, political and economic causes might be introducing those into that population.

459
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,190
And then for the burden of disease in this population overall, based on this article,

460
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:31,919
41% had at least one and CD and entities of focus for primarily metabolic and cardiovascular diseases with

461
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:39,690
hypertension being the highest at 27% and then cardiovascular diseases and cancers also being prominent.

462
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,899
And the participants were 60 and older,

463
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:49,620
but individuals that were over 70 had a significantly increased risk of hypertension compared to those that were 60 to 69.

464
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:57,250
Okay. So access barriers to screening treatment.

465
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:01,089
So there's lack of education, lower life standards,

466
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:06,940
lack of awareness and poor access to health care amongst the population is also lacking

467
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:11,200
the ability of them to be able to take care of themselves because they are older.

468
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:19,690
And also there was like a section where it says not being and not being involved in farm work was associated with higher in kids.

469
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:29,140
This wasn't necessarily mentioned in the article, but we figured possibly the Chinese government being an access or being a barrier to

470
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:34,360
screening and treatment because of the current ethnic cleansing and cultural genocide.

471
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:42,250
And we have here like 1 million ethnic leaders in China have been held in reeducation camps.

472
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:48,459
So that also could play a big role in barriers.

473
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:57,310
And again, like we're not exactly sure like in terms of like when those reeducate, quote unquote reeducation camps were first enacted.

474
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:02,890
But we think that it also might play a role in screening and things like that.

475
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:13,270
So then going off of the article, they say that some of the interventions would be like the policymakers,

476
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:18,560
to implement effective intervention strategies, increasing access to farming.

477
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:26,860
And then one would mention, to increase social protections for the elderly, because this article specifically looked at the elderly population.

478
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,100
So looking at Social Security, health care, things like that,

479
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:38,200
and then I thought of interventions to help control the entities through education, mobile clinics and affordable medication.

480
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:48,160
But my whole thing with all of this is because the Oger ethnic group, the biggest intervention would be the Chinese government,

481
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:56,870
because none of these interventions would be, I guess, even achievable since a majority of them are in the concentration camps.

482
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:06,190
So I know that the article was published in 2014, but the whole policymakers thing made no sense to me personally.

483
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:11,900
Yeah, that's that's what we got. That's a really good point.

484
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:17,170
And it actually goes back to all of these health disparities, the best interventions already,

485
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:23,330
you know, to get rid of the racism all or all the transphobia or xenophobia or whatever.

486
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:29,570
But obviously, that's that's pretty difficult and it's probably far, above all, a lot of work.

487
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,740
So, you know, kind of doing these things, you know, in the interim, as you know,

488
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:41,000
we work towards, you know, reducing racism and and and all these other.

489
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,810
And all the other forms of discrimination. So great.

490
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,840
Thanks so much for that. And finally, group number four. Yeah.

491
01:16:52,840 --> 01:17:03,880
So we were looking at transgender people in India, specifically in south of south or Southeast Asia or southeast in Missouri.

492
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,870
And so transgender people are exposed to behavioral risks.

493
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:16,870
And I think this is prevalent, like regardless of geography for NCDs, because of certain risk factors like smoking, alcoholism.

494
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:24,340
And a lot of that is just like as a coping mechanism because of the stigma, discrimination and social exclusion that it is.

495
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:32,620
And so the researchers found that 90.5% of the transgender people that they looked at a

496
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:37,870
fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables in a day and 74% consumed junk food,

497
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:42,910
which could contribute to the prevalence of obesity being about 34.5%.

498
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,370
And then about 84% of the study population were also found to be physically inactive.

499
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,860
And a lot of this may also just deal with social exclusion, because they can't go out to parks,

500
01:17:53,860 --> 01:18:01,630
to go for walks or really anywhere without facing some sort of discrimination.

501
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:11,629
And to emphasize that some of the behavioral risk factors that transgender people

502
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:16,700
are exposed to daily due to the stigma and discrimination that they face,

503
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:29,280
includes physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, unhealthy eating habits, tobacco and alcohol use, high blood pressure and abdominal obesity.

504
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:36,500
And there was a fact in there that said that 35% of transgender people have not been screened for diabetes.

505
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,600
And they also don't know their blood sugar levels. So there is a lack of.

506
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:47,970
Knowledge for that. Like, they don't they're not aware of that either.

507
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:53,399
And then I went on a different study to just get some numbers.

508
01:18:53,400 --> 01:19:00,410
But 80% of mental health and substance use conditions, 80% of the burden of disease.

509
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:12,360
From this study, they had 93 different studies and 665 data points, but any 5% was or 80% was mental health and substance use disorders.

510
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:18,300
And then like cardiovascular cancer, liver and kidney disease or there as well.

511
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:32,110
Okay. So I kind of did access in barriers to screening and treatment in general.

512
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:41,440
There are major problems like accessing general health needs in general, not just the specific gender specific needs.

513
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:48,460
And a lot of people in this community have a fear of stigma, that stigma.

514
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:56,410
They fear gender based violence. I read an article that says that sometimes they're afraid that their physicians are going to assault them,

515
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,610
which has been reported at an alarmingly high rate.

516
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:15,249
And so they almost start using like almost black market care to like address like hormone therapy and gender affirming surgeries,

517
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:19,900
which is very high risk as opposed to going to an actual hospital.

518
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:27,400
Yeah. And there was the like a lot of people citing that physicians and providers would

519
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:32,830
even refuse to treat them or even like touch them or examine them and provide that,

520
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,030
like, quality care.

521
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:45,280
And there's a lot of other issues, such as lacking health insurance and having low health literacy, which also like compounds these factors.

522
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,819
And then for the possible interventions, inherently,

523
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:58,060
there definitely needs to be a lot more work done in mitigating the stigma and lack of knowledge

524
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:02,379
within the health care system itself or treating members of the transgender community.

525
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,240
But for those individuals directly,

526
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:11,020
definitely a recommendation for interventions would be education dissemination around what health care services you need,

527
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:18,069
where you can access them safely, why they matter for you, how to do health management around nutrition and exercise.

528
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:21,790
And I think that's why it would be important to expand this outside of just a clinical setting,

529
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,379
but also work with community based organizations on the ground who are already engaged with these

530
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:31,810
individuals and they might be more willing to trust them rather than going to a clinician.

531
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:40,900
And then definitely sensitizing primary health centers for regular surveys around health informatics information.

532
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,070
Okay. Thanks so much and great work as well, bringing up the community based organizations.

533
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:57,360
I'm sure that would be really impactful intervention. So just to talk about the next couple of sessions of class on Thursday,

534
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:07,290
we will have the scheduled lecture from Brandon Conner on parental leave and southern African countries, which should be really interesting.

535
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:12,030
July 22nd, we are changing that to a Zoom lecture.

536
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,340
So if anybody wants to go home early for Thanksgiving, they can and they'll be really interesting.

537
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:24,990
On a mental health from Pemberley Lay, literally, who's a visiting scholar from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.

538
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:32,790
And she studies, I believe, depression and other and other topics in mental health.

539
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:40,680
And then Thanksgiving after which to reconvene in person again for the last few sessions.

540
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:48,930
So that's all like always. I'll stick around for a few minutes after class in case anybody has any questions.

541
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,540
But if not, take care and see you all on Thursday.
