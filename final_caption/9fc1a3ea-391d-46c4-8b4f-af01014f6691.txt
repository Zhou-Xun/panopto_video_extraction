1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:01:06,310
It was really important for me to see why he didn't stop targeting the military.

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,550
All right. All right.

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:57,270
Just a reminder, our homework part of this week is to offer the best in getting you on Tuesday nights, which is great.

4
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:08,460
And also, I also want to mention that the course evaluation link has been sent to your emails.

5
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,120
If you have a chance, please take some time to evaluate the course.

6
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,310
What do you like about the parties? What you don't like about the pause button on the valuation?

7
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:31,230
So by the count of three proving I teach the future and the future, I also know how to improve in this course.

8
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,070
All right. Enjoy our future cohorts.

9
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:44,970
All right. So today we're going to talk about a very important definition that is a convergence of random variables.

10
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,170
We're going to introduce three different types of convergence.

11
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,760
Three different modes of convergence and talk about the relation opposite of this different types of convergence.

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:08,010
And this is a very important topic that lays the foundation for what you will learn in that semester in six on two.

13
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,550
And that is the statistics.

14
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,240
As I mentioned, there are three different kinds of convergence of quantifiable available we properties.

15
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:26,340
We're talking about a sequence of right about converging to something you need to have a sequence of right about first.

16
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,660
And we develop that sequence as this.

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:40,950
And so that's the general notation where the subscript and just in that index, the, the order of the last model in the sequence.

18
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,020
But there's nothing mysterious about this notation.

19
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:56,930
All that means is we have a sequence of random. And that's think about this can be infinite and goes to infinity, basically.

20
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,860
What do we care about here? When we talk about convergence is as and goes to infinity,

21
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:10,010
how does that statements other than statements approaching a particular distribution or knowledge,

22
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,170
if it is approaching a particular distribution, how is it approaching distribution?

23
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,380
Is it approaching a particular event variable or is it just approaching a distribution?

24
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,450
Without specifying what Americans might be about, different kinds of convergence.

25
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,080
Okay, so let's introduce those different kinds one by one.

26
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,180
First column is called Convergent Convergence, almost surely.

27
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,600
Or a shorthand notation. Is this as almost surely.

28
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,990
Okay. And this one is the strongest convergence.

29
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,700
It's also called convergence is probability one. So it's denoted using this notation 11 sideways.

30
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,390
This sequence explained with this arrow, meaning convergence approaching.

31
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:12,990
And now the random variable acts. Almost surely with this a dot start on top of arrow, meaning this is almost sort of convergence.

32
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,120
And what that really means is the following equation.

33
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:29,880
That is, if you calculate the probability that the limit has angles to infinity, all of this that's equal to acts, that probability is equal to one.

34
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,799
And when we talk about probability, it has to be the probability.

35
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,090
All the events that the one these events,

36
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:53,490
that is all the events or outcomes such that if you take the limit of this edge w that is equal to at all times you.

37
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,650
They recorded this as trying to establish what a roundabout means when they first introduced

38
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,310
the roundabout and all goes back to how we define the roundabout in the first place.

39
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,670
I define a run on Marvel run available as just a map. I have probably already drawn sample size to the real space.

40
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,130
It's a Far East outcome in the original type of space mapping to a point.

41
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:31,150
This is really the original representation of the roundabout, and I need to have an argument and map a particular outcome to a number.

42
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,559
So now we re-use this in the notation to think, to define this event inside the probability.

43
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,510
What do we really want to help with that event?

44
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:53,050
What do we really want to characterize as the event such that all of the outcomes are such that this limit of access w is equal to astounding.

45
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,630
Okay. So all of the outcomes suggest that.

46
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,750
If you apply these random barrel and two of those out of that number,

47
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:14,860
it matches as a limit equal to the number that is out at a rate that I'm talking to.

48
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,620
This W is a sequence of numbers, right?

49
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,150
Numbers not from the original sample space from it.

50
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,820
So the number is determined by this rhinovirus. That's why that's two us three all the way to infinity.

51
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:43,870
That number is equal is the limit is equal to this outstanding, which is another number matched by this random variable x.

52
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,400
So that's what it means inside. It's possible.

53
00:07:51,140 --> 00:08:04,430
So as long as the probability of this event limited and it goes to infinity as equal heights is equal to one, we say X and converge to acts.

54
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,640
Almost sure that's the definition by saying a second.

55
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,860
Some come with some concrete examples to demonstrate of what it really means

56
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:25,040
and how it actually calculates the probability of this event equivalently.

57
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:33,650
Also, we can also say that for any absolute greater than zero, the probability of this guy,

58
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,690
this event, the limit of the absolute difference between that says X, is less than absolute.

59
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,050
This event has probability one. These are equivalent representations.

60
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:58,640
The bottom line is just to use them that absent language of translating what this means of this limit about equal to us.

61
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,220
This is the event that.

62
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,370
How of the.

63
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:25,840
Is perhaps the most important thing that all the w that w minus x w the absolute value of the limit is less than absolute this event as a probability.

64
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:40,200
These two are equivalent representations. Very potent in the sense that if the top is satisfied, the bottom also satisfies vice versa.

65
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,490
Always satisfied. The top also satisfied, very cleverly.

66
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,810
It's just a different way of expressing the same event,

67
00:09:48,990 --> 00:10:01,530
using this absolute doubt on which I hope you are familiar with this recommendation from your analysis.

68
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,590
Cos real analysis or outputs.

69
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:16,380
All right. So that's the definition. Any question before we move on to see a concrete example, a question about this definition.

70
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,719
All right. So let's take a look at this example. Hopefully it will make things clearer.

71
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
So we'll see more and more examples to clarify this definitions.

72
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:43,770
So the first example, I assume as is a it's a random variable that take this interval that is 0 to 1 with uniform distribution.

73
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:53,069
So as is a roundabout and we construct a sequence of running variables based on this

74
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:00,180
as in the following form that is X and is equal to as close as to the power of a.

75
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,450
Right. So that's how we construct that sequence of random parables.

76
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,700
And we also define another run of our lives just to be a.

77
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:22,430
So that's how we construct a fence. So we first construct that sequence around available to be as plus as MN.

78
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,300
And then we construct another maneuverable ax to be just as a cell.

79
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,649
As a cell is a random variable in the zero y interval which takes a uniform

80
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,990
distribution and we construct our segments and another run a variable in this way.

81
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,240
So if we construct the roundabout this way,

82
00:11:47,770 --> 00:12:00,770
then we know we can prove that this as and this sequence will converge almost surely to this particular random variable x.

83
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:12,810
And now let's say why that's the case. Okay. And to show that I converge almost surely to this right of our eyes, we need to follow that definition.

84
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:25,380
We call that we need to show that the probability of this event, the limit of X and angles infinity is equal to, as this event has probably one.

85
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,190
First of all, let's try to understand what this event is.

86
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,850
In this case. These acts and.

87
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,510
First of all, we need to understand what this event is all right.

88
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:07,030
For a w such that the limit of X and W is equal to establish based on how as an ox are constructed.

89
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,270
This W has to be a value from 0 to 1 is beyond 0 to 1.

90
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:23,470
It doesn't make sense and only takes arguments from 0 to 1, right?

91
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,640
And for any value for adding this small value, small as in this interval, 0 to 1.

92
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:41,230
If you think about how X and is constructed, x and small house is equal to as small as plus small as to the power of n.

93
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,310
And if you take the limit, that goes to infinity.

94
00:13:49,380 --> 00:14:01,440
What would happen, this adds, is a number from 0 to 1, and it can take about a zero, but not exactly equal to one.

95
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,630
Now, if you take the N goes to infinity. What's the limit of this guy?

96
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,800
That's the calculated limit of a sequence of numbers. Right? Okay.

97
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,830
I know what the limit is for this of this. Popular.

98
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,580
What is the angle so that anyone at the bottom of this house has to buy this house?

99
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,930
Because as to the end goes to zero, the base is a number not between zero and one.

100
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,570
So if you take infinite power, that goes to zero.

101
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,560
So this is just a small house at a record.

102
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,900
How we define is excellent amount marvel at all as is equal to us.

103
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,150
So this house is equal to that house? Oh, that's right.

104
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:59,680
So that is to say, for any small rise in this interval, 0 to 1, we always have this equation.

105
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:08,900
That is, if you think I'm going to infinity, this as small as is always equal to in this house cosmos.

106
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,940
Right because of how you construct this to the sequence, everyone memorable and this particular event of our lives.

107
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:31,910
So now we can take a look at the event that we care about all the W value such that this element holds.

108
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:43,160
So this is what? 0 to 1 antibiotic in this interval.

109
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:49,880
This always holds. And for as equal to one.

110
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,560
What we know is that the probability so says as is a uniform distribution,

111
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,640
the probability of this one of us taking this small value has equal to one is always zero.

112
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:17,500
That single point does not make a difference. So to put everything together, we know that the probability of this event.

113
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:44,550
The probability of this event limit and goes to infinity is equal to the probability of is not reduced as that only an w.

114
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:54,480
I. W. And that event is.

115
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:06,620
The probability of this as. And it's as maneuverable in zero one in a row.

116
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,580
Is that close? Right over here.

117
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,740
And that one has probably one. So that completes the crew.

118
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,720
With that, we can conclude that this and in fact, converge almost surely to this runabout box.

119
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:40,680
Hey. Really if you think about how to show that almost, almost 40 converters is to figure out what that particular event set means.

120
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:49,920
And once you've got on to it and all that event set, you can calculate the probability of that and now probabilities equal to one.

121
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,010
Then you can conclude that this convergence is was short and it's almost four versions.

122
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:17,890
Questions about this latest. So we'll see more examples later this fiscal year.

123
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,050
This example, I'll give you a sense of what this a short convergence means.

124
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,890
I just need to figure out what that event is, limit of equal access.

125
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,860
And then in view of that probability, that probability is one.

126
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:40,310
It means you have convergence. Almost. Sure, but that's the first time of convergence.

127
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,520
Now, let's move on to talk about the second time, which is similar but not the same.

128
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,100
It's called convergence in probability. This is not to be confused with the first one,

129
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:05,620
which also has a name of probability convergence with probability of one convergence which probably won't mean emergence of sure.

130
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,120
Now, this is a different type of scenario.

131
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,130
It's called convergence in probability, and perhaps this is the most commonly used convergence in statistics.

132
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,140
So one of the most important convergence type convergence in probabilities did not live this way.

133
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,250
Again, we have a sequence of random well and we have another roundabout and convergence in district.

134
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,470
In probability, you just put a P on top of this arrow.

135
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:43,480
Okay, so many this sequence converge improbability to us, and the definition of that is the following.

136
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,090
If you take the limit of this probability, then it's it goes to one.

137
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,290
And inside this probability is the event such that the difference between the absolute

138
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,540
difference between us and an act is the than half or any alcohol greater than zero.

139
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:18,579
And the other was inside this probability calculation where talking about the event such that at any W minus x,

140
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:32,710
w has absolute value last the outcome for any absolute and expects that is greater than zero to quantify these events that calculate as probability.

141
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,959
You've got a number and not numbers but have a subsequent and in because it's a

142
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:45,550
number that involve this as the number and right of arrival in the sequence.

143
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,580
So you've got a number, not probability.

144
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:56,170
And if you have that number close to infinity, if you allow the sequence goes to infinity, that number should approaching one.

145
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,560
If that's the case with high convergence improbability compared to the previous ones,

146
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,140
the main difference is now it take this limit outside of this probability calculation.

147
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,790
That is not equivalent to convergence with probability one or convergence, I'm not sure.

148
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:25,610
What's your take? This limit outside, this probability combination, it becomes a different type of convergence.

149
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,739
And later we will show that this is weaker than convergence.

150
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:43,410
I'm not sure. A clever representation of this convergence in probably the following, which is you,

151
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:53,460
instead of calculating the probability of x and minus x plus the absolute, you calculate the probability of x minus x greater than epsilon.

152
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,750
Again, I give you a sequence of probabilities, right? If you take the limit out of that sequence, it goes to zero.

153
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,390
And the equivalence between those two is sort of.

154
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:22,940
Easier to say because this event is if you consider continuous random arrivals, this event is just a complement of the above event.

155
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,660
I take the compliment of the above event.

156
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,050
They got this event. So in terms of the probability is equal to one minus the above probability.

157
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:40,280
So the above has a limit equal to one that this one should have a limit equal to zero and vice versa.

158
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,840
Slightly more complicated, more discreet around animals.

159
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,040
But for now, as long as you can understand the case for continuous running model, that's good enough.

160
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:08,460
So this is what it means to me to have convergence, improbability and emergency improbability.

161
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,810
You first calculate the probability of a particular event set and then take the limit.

162
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:22,749
Say whether that goes 2 to 1. And the relation between those two.

163
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:35,740
As I mentioned, they are not equivalent. And in fact, almost a convergence implies convergence and probably a stronger type of convergence.

164
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,480
And so this guy implies this guy.

165
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,650
So if you have access, converge on surely to ask,

166
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:57,260
you know for sure that access also converge improbability to us but not out of in general convergence in probability.

167
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:04,120
It does not imply a shorting Americans, but it's a one way relation between the two.

168
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,670
And we consider two examples to demonstrate that point.

169
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,390
First. Consider this example.

170
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,460
Again, all these examples, we need to construct this sequence in order to have a sequence of amount of variables.

171
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,320
Okay. So I help with this examples as well as the exercise from the textbooks.

172
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,090
You will be familiar with the concept of constructing sequence of roundabouts,

173
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:45,210
and we are going to need that sequence of random variables for future lectures as well.

174
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:53,130
When we talk about large numbers, they are large about large numbers, central element theorems.

175
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:58,760
We would construct a sequence all run of our wheels using our samples.

176
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,290
Recall that when you have a random sample size and you can construct all kinds

177
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:09,360
of statistics and then your arm goes to infinity or sample size infinity,

178
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:17,400
naturally, your statistics of interest would be a sequence of random animals, right?

179
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,620
In that regard, we do have sequence of rhinovirus.

180
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,200
That's why we need to consider the convergence of the sequence of roundabouts.

181
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:33,540
All right. Now, coming back to this example, assuming that we have a sequence of binary random animals,

182
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,940
x one, x two, all the way through is going to be, which is defined as follows.

183
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:47,310
Okay. So all it takes two values one and for the ends run of animals.

184
00:25:49,160 --> 00:26:01,820
With a probability one minus one over N for x and equal to one, and the probability one over here for sequence.

185
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,280
The arms run of our behind takes two values one ahead,

186
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:19,430
and the probability of X an equal to one is one minus one overhead, and the probability of ascending is just to one over.

187
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,770
As a binary. Okay, so now that's the binary that we are familiar with, but still it's a binary.

188
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,700
And if it's and it's a binary. Okay, now we have the sequence.

189
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:50,830
So first of all, we will say that we want to prove that as we all converge improbability to this constant.

190
00:26:51,340 --> 00:27:03,310
One constant is also a run of our right and maps everything to that constant mapping and that constant just the is that is a point mass.

191
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,020
All right. With probability one that one available taken by one.

192
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,799
So that's what this constant means. So what are we going to show?

193
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,620
Is that a sequence of random variable? Well, converge in probability to that to generate random variable.

194
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:26,139
And to show that again, we need to referred to that definition in order to show convergence.

195
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:37,150
In probability, we need first we need to fix absolute any absolute greater than zero and then try to evaluate the probability of

196
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:45,970
the difference absolute difference between you are and and that limiting run available greater than absolute.

197
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,320
We need to have a place in expression of that probability.

198
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:58,400
Then we can take the limit, see whether that goes to zero or goes to one, which should probably the entire.

199
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,220
So that's the steps. Okay, so first step.

200
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,850
Choose any alcohol and repeat arousal greater than zero.

201
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,730
And in this case, we only need to consider ourselves less than one second.

202
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,990
I'll say why that's the case. Okay. So you choose any absolute less than one, greater than zero.

203
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,850
Second, we need to evaluate the probability.

204
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:36,890
Okay, so this is the format of the probability that we need to evaluate the probability of X minus one.

205
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,230
Now, one is our limiting distribution that we need to prove, right?

206
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,790
So that's a minus one that's a little greater than an absolute that we just fixed.

207
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,980
We need to evaluate that probability in order to verify the definition.

208
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,990
Now, McKay is ready to evaluate this probability.

209
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,450
In order to evaluate that probability, we need to use the fact of how this sequence is constructed.

210
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:16,879
So for any Epsilon creators of zero less than one, what is the equivalent event of this?

211
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
X minus one? Absolute about a greater than absolute.

212
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,920
Recall that our accent is a binary right about right and only takes to about one hour.

213
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:36,570
And if it takes about a one with a difference between us, [INAUDIBLE], it won't, right?

214
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,230
If it takes memory one, then the difference is just zero.

215
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:47,669
There is no way that is greater than zero. So the only scenario that is going to be greater than that absolute the

216
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:54,780
difference is greater than absolute is one and takes two value that makes sense.

217
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,420
So the equivalent event that we need to evaluate here is.

218
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,500
I am equal to it. Right.

219
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:18,880
So any apps along greater than zero minus one, the absolute value greater the absolute is equivalent to say x and equal to.

220
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,010
And the probability of an encore. And we know exactly what that is.

221
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:35,140
By definition, that's one over nine. So that's why we have this exquisite evaluation of this probability.

222
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:45,190
And finally, the third step is to take the limit to the limit of that probability that angles to infinity.

223
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:54,640
See? Well, whether that goes to zero. And in this case, it's pretty clear that if we take and it goes to infinity one over and goes to zero,

224
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:03,640
then we can conclude X and converge improbability to one just following the definition.

225
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,990
All right. And now let's look about why we need an epsilon less than one.

226
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:20,560
If an apple is greater than one, then occasionally we will have we will have we will have a problem.

227
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,560
If your household is face to be, let's say, the minus one.

228
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:45,010
Right. So for any or any sequence plan, any order of the on any index of the sequence that's beforehand, I'm minus y will always be last the absolute.

229
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,680
So the probability that is greater than epsilon is always zero only for a sequence

230
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,570
that is in the later of the sequence that we were to have this equivalent,

231
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,690
these inequalities.

232
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,150
All right. So notation wise, it's a little bit more complicated.

233
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:16,610
You cannot directly write it this way because this equation only holds well and is greater than that particular absolute value.

234
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,760
But the logic holds you still have the same result.

235
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,700
It's just the way you write it. It's a little bit more tedious.

236
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:35,610
You have to separate it into two cases. What would be the equation for less than a certain number one?

237
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,060
It would be the equation for a greater than a third a number.

238
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,610
But since we only care about what end goes to infinity, actually we only have to care about the second part.

239
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:50,030
So the same result holds just a little bit tedious.

240
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,170
So that's why we fixed Epsilon to be less than one.

241
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,060
You got an idea for an absolute. Where's that? Zero. There's always hope.

242
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,150
So that's why. Go ahead and converge. Improbability to this random variable.

243
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,170
Generate random variable and only take quantum at one.

244
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,710
Question about this example of why we have this convergence in probability.

245
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,030
Okay. So this is how we can improve convergence in probability for this case.

246
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:45,350
And now let's say weather event converge almost surely to one or the same sequence in front of our recall that in order to show converge,

247
00:33:48,320 --> 00:34:09,200
in order to show us converge almost surely to one, we need to show the probability of the limit angles infinity x minus one x and is equal to one.

248
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,880
Right. This guy has probability one.

249
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:28,100
That's the definition. Or equivalently, we need to show the probability of damage as an minus one.

250
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:38,200
So value. Plus the App Store is equal to one app.

251
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:48,950
So either way, that's what we need to show if we want to show up and converge according to one.

252
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:03,140
So now take a look at this. Probably this equivalent form is easier to demonstrate again and minus one is less than half.

253
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:17,250
So for any epsilon greater than zero, that would require the same this as on minus one last one half.

254
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,410
So that would require the end to take value exactly equal to one.

255
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:35,340
Right. So this limit, as you take the limit, we can consider it as a sequence of events.

256
00:35:35,910 --> 00:36:00,920
So let's define. Event video and then minus one has absolute value greater are equal to this absolute okay and it's

257
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:11,390
not hard to say this is equivalent to say an event of an equal to in any absolute greater than zero.

258
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:21,410
I think I'm so glad that zero always define this event even for I said that as an minus one

259
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:27,190
absolute about a greater unquote obstacle that is equivalent to say an equal to earth.

260
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:33,740
And this event, what do we know about it is that it has a probability one over.

261
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,440
Right? So now think about what this event is.

262
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,290
This limit angles infinity at minus one last.

263
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:49,980
I have some. So that is.

264
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,350
The probability. Inmate, Anthony.

265
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,110
Minus one. How strong is the probability of.

266
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:43,780
The probability of this sequence of events and the limit of the sequence of events complement.

267
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:52,450
If you think about that, you can see that in the complement on the plus and minus one plus the absolute.

268
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,160
We are talking about the limits of that sequence of events.

269
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:10,030
Okay, so this individual event is here one over N and the summation of this individual events is equal to infinity.

270
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:17,350
It's diverging. So we can use the alarm on the parallel.

271
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:28,240
Can tally lama. Which we want to cover in this lecture.

272
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,110
How do you refer to this Lama alive?

273
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:38,590
And Dalai Lama just tells us if the individual probability is one overhead and

274
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,020
this events are independent with the summation of the individual probability,

275
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:52,990
it goes to infinity. Then the limit of the probability of the limit of the event is approaching is not equal to zero.

276
00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:00,970
In other words, the probability of the limit of the complement of event is not equal to one.

277
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,530
So that's a direct result from this moral dilemma.

278
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:17,740
And since the probability of desire of interest is not equal to one, we can now conclude that and converge almost surely to one.

279
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:24,820
In fact, this is a high example where you do have convergence, improbability, but no convergence.

280
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:37,810
I'm sure. Again, it all boils down to use this around outcome tally lama which directly tells us that individual probability sum to infinity,

281
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,380
then the probability of interest won't be equal to one.

282
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,620
Again, the details you have to refer to,

283
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:58,690
they set up a real fatality level and this is a direct application of that lama so that we do not have these probabilities equal to one.

284
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:09,410
So that's one example. Showing the convergence improbability does not imply convergence assuring.

285
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:21,450
Any questions? It's another example, like a continuous run of animal.

286
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,900
Again, we need to first construct the sequence.

287
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:38,680
And same as the previous example, we first have a uniform run of our of what has zero one.

288
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,020
And then we define our acts one as to us and in the point parts.

289
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:54,470
Okay. So x1. Conditionals as this random variable has.

290
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:03,740
If for any small ass matter in zero one, it takes this functional form that is for anybody in zero one.

291
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:08,989
This acts one is equal to one. An antibody outside this is 0 to 1.

292
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,160
Interval is equal to zero. Okay.

293
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:20,239
This is one one in the map. Everything outside the 0 to 1, two zero and map.

294
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Everything in this is zero 1 to 1.

295
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:36,020
So that's why it's binary, right? Why? It's two out of zero and one for any value provided zero and one and mapping to one.

296
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,740
Anybody outside of this zero to enable a map to zero.

297
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:57,590
That's what one is as two is also binary and map two is this zero R1 but it only map 0 to 1 half, this interval to one and anything else to zero.

298
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,050
Let me draw a situation here.

299
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:13,270
Reason why we have this as running of all who take uniform distribution on this zero y interval.

300
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:20,890
Right now we construct the sequence of another binary random variables, which only takes about zero one.

301
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Based on the arguments provided to how to run a variable.

302
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:33,309
So x one takes and takes value one or any value is zero one as argument and zero

303
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:42,550
everywhere else x two only takes one when the input is from 0 to 1 half and

304
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:49,540
everything else is going to be about a zero at three taking one if the input

305
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:56,709
is from one half to one and everything else is zero and as four is divided,

306
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:10,180
this interval is three equal parts. Anything that's from 0 to 1 third is going to take one and everything else is going to be 055 and it be 12.

307
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,220
One third on two thirds could take one, otherwise zero and so on, so forth.

308
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,650
So that's how we construct that sequence. All right. Very.

309
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,680
It's a little bit stretch to construct this sequence.

310
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,930
But you got an idea, right? The first one, you take the entire interval, set mass, not to one and everything to zero.

311
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,940
The second and third, you break it into two halves, two halves.

312
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:47,290
Break this zero white into two halves and it only takes one and one half of it three,

313
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:52,240
four and five, four or five and six to break the interval into three equal parts.

314
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,360
It's one part of the equal to one and all the cards equal to zero and so on.

315
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:09,580
So once. And finally, we define another run Marvel, which again is a theme generated by Marvel, which always averages to zero.

316
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,640
So it has a point. Mars has zero.

317
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:24,530
Then we can come and we can prove that this sequence and well converge improbability to this the rewrite of our lives.

318
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,250
But it does not converge almost sure.

319
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:42,100
To this day General around about masks. Okay. So first of all, let's try to prove why it converged improbability to us.

320
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:53,890
I'll give you a couple of minutes. Think about how to follow the stops through that in a converge improbability to us.

321
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,389
What is that equation that I wanted to tell you?

322
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,350
Not to show that ax and convert in probability to x.

323
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,820
Did. They got it. I mean, I think it.

324
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:21,740
Let's take a break and you can continue thinking about this problem at Wal Mart about how to show that.

325
00:49:31,350 --> 00:50:04,590
You know, you can't you may not feel that people will be killed for you.

326
00:50:10,610 --> 00:51:09,960
The Socceroos have been among the highest levels of smokers and every time you come to the conclusion that you need to do something the.

327
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,370
Who knows you?

328
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:38,470
Which means much better talking to him while he was telling me all the facts.

329
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:50,480
Check Take them so far road.

330
00:51:52,040 --> 00:52:10,040
You've got to give them just offers for another reason.

331
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:42,500
You call or you might want to think about how you would not let it happen without winning a lot of attention.

332
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:57,550
Given that we don't really know what we are waiting for you when you do what you need to

333
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:25,360
go good time to do it because we all of you should know that when it comes to think.

334
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:47,120
It's just like a game. Oh, sure, you don't want to be controversial.

335
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,670
You know,

336
00:53:49,670 --> 00:54:34,730
Barack Obama made you go crazy because it was clear in words to the people who might be insulted on Friday night here in Chicago if it happen.

337
00:54:34,860 --> 00:55:08,000
So that means you have to make sure you have to, you know, take it to the Chinese people, see what happens.

338
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:27,440
I think, you know, you will want to keep the name of the school.

339
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:47,330
So I think she will tell you the truth.

340
00:55:52,240 --> 00:56:38,430
So what's amazing is that you might be able to use the stones the way they were, which should be social entrepreneurs who want to help those who.

341
00:56:41,700 --> 00:57:11,960
We were just about to inform you about this particular test, which was within 100% of your time.

342
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,590
Which is your time. You say six, ten.

343
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:40,860
I have no idea what's going on in your life in order to coach one of those kind of test sites,

344
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:53,910
which unfortunately you can't, because shots involve something you can't currently.

345
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:09,350
Google samples, it was like sigma. I just need to know what you mean.

346
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:40,380
The only reason that you have to make these waivers means that, you know, I'm not just reading something that I was doing, so I'm using general.

347
00:58:40,440 --> 00:59:16,830
Like if I if it makes sense, it means test score is I'm trying to consider how we do things like these.

348
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,370
Therefore, you know, you're going to have to look at your world.

349
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:39,280
Number one, there was no imminent warning that would happen and how this is going to kill you.

350
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:43,260
Can you do this to me?

351
00:59:43,290 --> 01:00:04,770
I mean, I don't I don't know what they're going to do with that kind of stuff, because we're not going to tell you today.

352
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:11,370
Have you had a chance to look over this problem?

353
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,940
Hopefully you got it. So let's look at this.

354
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,940
I gather in order to show that this act and this sequence converge improbability

355
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:26,700
again with all of the steps and all of the definition and showing that,

356
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:36,090
first of all, calculating the probability of interest and then think that'll be 101 depending on how you define the probability.

357
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:42,750
So first of all, we need to take any out so we're zero, right?

358
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:53,220
And second, right now, the probability of interest that is the probability of X minus x absolute value greater than ourselves.

359
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,060
This is the probability that we want to evaluate. And you know, the value of this.

360
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:05,520
We do need to look into how this acts and acts are defined.

361
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,740
And in this particular case, I recall that acts and is always binary, right?

362
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:18,180
Either zero or one and I ask is just degenerate.

363
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,810
You don't want to think about a zero. All right.

364
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:27,420
And that's the very first one that I can notice. That is binary as zero.

365
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:36,660
So you are one of these acts minus X, so about to be greater than or something absolute zero.

366
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,650
That just means that's the probability of this.

367
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:49,740
And equal to one right, because they are equal to zero.

368
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,030
There is no way that that absolute difference is going to be greater than absolute.

369
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:00,510
So the same argument as that they exercise that I have done before that equivalent.

370
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:06,630
This is this probability is equivalent to the probability of an equal to one.

371
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,330
Now, all we need to do is to evaluate what is the probability of an equal to one.

372
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:21,270
All right. So now let's take a look at how I constructed Class one.

373
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:27,090
What is the probability of x? Y one is one, right?

374
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:36,300
Because you are, as is always within this zero one interval and x1 one that every between this zero y interval to one.

375
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:40,230
So the probability of x y in 4 to 1 is one.

376
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:45,210
Okay. So the probability is equal to one.

377
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,730
What about x two? What's the probability of 2.21?

378
01:02:54,190 --> 01:03:00,550
Wow. Right. Because that's the probability of as busy as I was as an animal.

379
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,580
0 to 1 half. Then got two equal to one.

380
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,080
And the probability of as in that interval is just one half.

381
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:14,800
Similarly, box three is one half. What about RS four one third.

382
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:23,620
Right. And similarly for 511 third and five, six one third.

383
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:30,879
And based on this construction, you can say you have one equal to one, two equal to one over two or three,

384
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,410
four, one over three, four is equal to one over four and so on and so forth.

385
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:41,070
If you take the limit of that sequence. I can't say.

386
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:48,210
You take the limit angles infinity of the segments, one will be the limit.

387
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:59,640
It's always the crazy, right? And it's depressing. In this one over rate.

388
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,710
So I'm going to say infinity. These will be equal to zero.

389
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:12,300
Although this probability you cannot easily write it out using this one over n or something like that.

390
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,690
But you can still get this explicit formula.

391
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:22,799
And in this case, you don't even need to go that far by just considering how this sequence is going to be,

392
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,110
how this sequence is going to continue with increasing index.

393
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,220
It's not hard to say that I'm gonna say infinity,

394
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:39,840
this sequence for approaching zero and I complete the proof if the probability of this by an absolute greater than zero,

395
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:50,180
if the probability is always approaching zero and infinity, that it just means that converge in two acts.

396
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,260
Improbability. That's the destination. All right, so now completing the proof.

397
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,950
Any questions about this? Right.

398
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:06,090
Got three steps, right? First takes an arbitrary epsilon greater than zero.

399
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:10,680
Second, calculate that probably interest. Third, take the limit.

400
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:17,350
If all of the three stops you can prove convergence improbable.

401
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:24,370
All right. So that's a very typical timeline for proving convergence probability.

402
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,700
All right. And for the same example, we can show that as and does not converge almost surely twice.

403
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:42,910
And here is why. So I'll give you a couple of minutes trying to say why that's the case.

404
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:50,260
And in this case, actually, you do not need that around tally llama.

405
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:56,470
You can actually show that explicitly why it does not converge on my short two acts.

406
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:04,480
So to give you 3 minutes, I draw out the sketch of the truth.

407
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:17,360
That's not. Yes.

408
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:26,000
All right. You got it. So let's look at this together.

409
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,970
Why? That's not the case. So the order to show convergence, almost surely this is what we want.

410
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:39,500
We want to evaluate the probability of that event such that the limit of this x is equal to x.

411
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,540
This event has probability one, then that means convergence.

412
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:50,300
Otherwise it's not. So all boils down to what this event is.

413
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,569
What is the limit of X and is that going to be considered?

414
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:04,910
How X is constructed is binary and always equal to one or a sort of animal is 0 to 1.

415
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:09,230
And that entomologist got smaller and smaller as that goes.

416
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:16,520
And it also is alternating between different different areas of a 0 to 1 animal.

417
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:22,430
Right. And if you face any as any as in this.

418
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,900
And to consider the limit of this sequence. Okay.

419
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,590
So the right hand side is very simple. The right hand side is a concept.

420
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:36,100
That's how we define us. Right.

421
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:42,460
That's constant on the right hand side. So all I need to say is what this limit is on the left hand side.

422
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:56,890
Really? It takes us. The value of this ax and has it alternate between zero and one or some outside is equal to zero

423
01:09:56,950 --> 01:10:05,080
or some I said is equal to one depending on whether the interval cover this small is or not.

424
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,750
All right. So it's either zero or one.

425
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:20,170
And as angles infinity, it doesn't stay as zero or it doesn't stay out of one in isolation.

426
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:24,910
No matter how far you go, it will always alternate between the zero and one.

427
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:40,680
Because of the way that we designed this this sequence, we always separate this interval into this equal in equal as small intervals.

428
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,230
So no matter how small the interval is,

429
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:53,190
there are always going to be one hour and intervals that will cover this small and in that small interval lapse.

430
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:58,970
And we'll take by one. And say that a universal accent will always take a zero.

431
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,560
So no matter how far you go in terms of this and the one never converge.

432
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:10,190
Right. So as animals infinity it does not converge.

433
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:15,830
So the limit and goes to infinity. All of this x unasked does not converse to anything.

434
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,620
And of course, it doesn't converge to zero. So that's why they sent this guy.

435
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:32,950
This event inside is a probability calculation is a null set, right?

436
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:40,960
There's no asthmatic in this, a 0 to 1 interval such that the limit of asanas is equal to zero.

437
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,850
None of us in this scenario actually satisfy that.

438
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:52,420
Limit the equation, humpty, so that the probability of that in the set is zero.

439
01:11:52,690 --> 01:12:00,350
Of course it's not equal to one. And that's why this accident now compares to ABC's obituary.

440
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:12,290
And this proof boils down to evaluate what that probability is and the order to say what that probability is.

441
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:21,380
We need to know what that event is. And the event is all about how we construct the sequence.

442
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,540
We combined equivalent event and evaluate probability.

443
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:35,720
And that is another example where convergence probability does not imply convergence ensemble chart.

444
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:41,430
And in practice there are numerous examples like this where you have convergence

445
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:47,040
probability but no convergence on the chart above the reverse is always true.

446
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,110
If you have a convergence, I'm sure you do have convergence in probability.

447
01:12:52,440 --> 01:13:08,430
Okay. And to say that, well, we won't prove that in this course, but you can find the proves in in more about the box.

448
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,260
So another example before I move on, any questions about this.

449
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:20,880
Yeah. So when we want to do this in general sufficient to show that the sequence of random variables doesn't converge.

450
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:28,730
If you want to show that it does now conversion, it's almost 40.

451
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,880
Yeah. So this is one way to show it. It doesn't have a limit.

452
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,840
Now, of course, you cannot have this equation.

453
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:43,120
Right. But I'll turn it on. It could have a it could have a limit.

454
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:53,920
This sequence of run available could have a limit. That limit is not equal to your desired limit then, and also doesn't have the probability of a one.

455
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:59,290
So it also means that it does not converge on some in the short. So saying that it.

456
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:03,310
So if it doesn't have a limit though, we can just say that it doesn't converge.

457
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:09,220
And that's why you need to evaluate this probability and a sigma that that's equal to one.

458
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:15,100
The only way you can conclude is almost surely convergence is not probability or one.

459
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:19,130
Anything else is not. Does that make sense?

460
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,550
Any other questions? All right.

461
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:32,950
Another example and also this example, I'll give us another commonly used technique to show convergence in probability,

462
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:38,740
especially to a child that is using the sharpest tabish of inequality.

463
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,720
So I hope you still recall the format of the shabby shops in the quality.

464
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:55,629
So that just says and I ran available with me you and Barron's center deviation sigma we always have the

465
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:07,810
probability of as my new absolute value greater than a sigma is less than or equal to your one over square.

466
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:16,990
So that's chubby inequality or some equivalent version of it.

467
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:28,070
So we can use that in many cases to show convergence in comparability, especially to accounts,

468
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:34,520
because as you can say, in this probability, what it tells us is the difference between a random variable.

469
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:40,550
Andy Coulson Greater than an arbitrary positive a number, right?

470
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:43,670
This K coming out in this case can be any positive number.

471
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:50,300
So, so only eight times sigma also be any positive number.

472
01:15:51,380 --> 01:16:00,560
So this just tells us about what this probability and this probability exactly what we need when we show convergence in probability.

473
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:10,220
All right. If that operation is controlled, then, of course, this probability will be controlled.

474
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,020
So let's say how to use that in practice,

475
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:20,950
assuming we have a sequence of random error by following this distribution comma with parameter and not a one over here,

476
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:28,330
we want to show that this sequence converging probability to this can be generated right about a one.

477
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:36,490
From what we've learned about gamma distribution, we know the mean is one variance is one over.

478
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:45,790
And so the view is that alpha has been a variances this one over here in this in this case.

479
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:56,729
So thematically using this Travis shops inequality or what do we find is the probability

480
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:05,480
of this and minus the mean of which is one absolute value greater than a times?

481
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:12,870
The standard deviation which is square root of l is less or equal to what one over?

482
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:24,400
A square, pier, square and a maze of an escape greater than zero.

483
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:37,020
Right. Directly applying to this grant by applying the charity shops, the quality.

484
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:41,889
In this case, we got this inequality. Now think about it.

485
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:49,900
What do we need in order to show convergence in probability? We need x and minus one absolute value operator than absolute.

486
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:54,160
We need to evaluate this guy and there are still some gaps.

487
01:17:54,820 --> 01:18:00,130
We need to replace this k times one over square and five is absolute.

488
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:09,080
So how do we do it? Hey, it's free, right?

489
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:18,670
Because to be honest, I just said it to be somebody that gave you hands, one over a square root of man equal to absolute.

490
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:28,360
It's nice to say if you're sad, then able to work it out and conceptual.

491
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,690
That's also a positive number. I mean equality.

492
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:42,310
Call it a cell host. So on the left hand side of exactly have this on the right hand side of what you have one over absolute square and.

493
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,240
Okay. So now you can take the limit.

494
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:55,690
If you take the limit angles embedded in the right hand side, the upper body was shrunk from a zero.

495
01:18:56,230 --> 01:19:00,910
The probability is always non-active if the upper bound is shrinking to zero.

496
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:04,750
Now we know for sure this probability shrank to zero.

497
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:12,220
So that's complete. The proof that shows a working probability to this.

498
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:22,810
How much of this body can be very handy? Improving convergence in part because it is partially in this degenerate case is that this is something

499
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:30,370
also to keep in mind when you are asked to show emergency probabilities especially to a constant.

500
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,790
And the key here is you can says it's okay to be obvious to a number.

501
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:44,980
So it could be anything that you desire, you know, to show it.

502
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:52,940
Questions. Not a murder is improper about it.

503
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:58,200
Lastly, the third type of convergence is convergence and distribution.

504
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:07,020
So this is the weakest among the three and also the most different among the three.

505
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:16,140
So convergence in distribution means if you have divide, it's a small D, it's also a convergence in law.

506
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:23,190
What that means is that if you take the limit of the clear function for this sequence of random rivals,

507
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:29,110
it will converge to the CDP of this limiting distribution limit.

508
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:37,800
You run a battle for all the continuity points of the limiting distribution.

509
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:46,770
So the continuity point means the points where this out of access is continuous.

510
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:57,750
So for any random animal, the key function is is continuous at most in a carnival, in carnival points.

511
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,830
So this continuity in points will be the majority of the points in this happens as a function,

512
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:12,240
as long as for all the continuity point for this limited distribution, we have this equation.

513
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:19,800
Then we call and converse in distribution to ask our house conversion law to x.

514
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:28,150
So that's the definition of convergence in distribution.

515
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:36,430
If you think about this convergence compared with the previous two convergence that we have talk about.

516
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,590
It means very different things. First of all, we don't really care what this is, all right?

517
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:48,389
All we need is this CDO yellow words.

518
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:53,880
Who can get an independent and replicate this acts from the same distribution.

519
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,870
Now, we still have the same convergence in distribution.

520
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:03,300
We don't really care which particular amount of trouble this limiting write about is.

521
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,030
We just care about its distribution.

522
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:14,550
Now, like the previous two, the previous two, I actually do care about the specific amount available in the limit.

523
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:27,480
You cannot justify an independent replicate of that run run available to satisfy the same convergence, improbability or convergence of assured.

524
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:34,530
But you can't do that in this case in the convergence distribution, because again, we only care about the distribution.

525
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:39,200
So in that regard, it's very different. Right.

526
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,980
Previously we care about that exact run of our.

527
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:48,879
And now we only care about the distribution. And later,

528
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,990
when will say that this is also the weakness in the sense that convergence of

529
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:59,040
emotion and a convergence of probability both imply convergence in distribution.

530
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:04,990
Now vise versa. So before that was first.

531
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:09,549
Take a look at the example that we actually have already sent this example before.

532
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:21,460
That is the binomial has a approximating distribution of photons and now we can formally define what we mean by approximating a puzzle.

533
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,100
So that approximation is actually convergence in distribution.

534
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:33,670
In particular, we define a sequence of binomial x and with this setup,

535
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:41,650
the number of trials as end and the probability of success in each trial is lambda over that lambda is a fixed number.

536
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:49,330
So now the words you have a sign of urging a number of trials and a decreasing success rate.

537
01:23:51,320 --> 01:24:02,080
So that's how our accident and. And that accent converge and distribution to acts where access is a person running by.

538
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:16,990
With params allowed. And if you think about the plus our unavailable the function as opposed was right available only takes value.

539
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:22,000
The support is all the down that to be integers. So the CDF function.

540
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:36,500
Is what? Stop motion. All right. So it has a a first jump at zero, right?

541
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:43,950
Side. And then the second jump is at a one.

542
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:49,530
And so on. So it was meant to.

543
01:24:52,680 --> 01:25:02,740
And finally it's approaching. Approaching one, never reach one, but is approaching more.

544
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:08,650
This is what the city of culture look like across all distribution.

545
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:20,730
And in order to show that this is an converging distribution to us, all we need to show is that for every point other than as positive integers,

546
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:25,780
because by the positive integers is actually a challenging point, is that these these contain everything.

547
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:35,470
What we call the definition only require us to show that what continuity point of as limited distribution the city of convergence.

548
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:45,470
That's what we need to show for any acts. Not equal, not blind to this.

549
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:50,090
Now, I'm not interested in any acts.

550
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,430
Not in this stuff.

551
01:25:52,580 --> 01:26:05,510
This is the interest that as long as we can show that they see our function and emerge to the city, our function for us on right now,

552
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:15,560
and that we can draw up a real the city out of it and we can ride out the city out in this format.

553
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:26,740
Which is the summation of the zero 2 hours and in this case have to be a little bit careful as it should be.

554
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:33,040
They caused the largest cost and below x.

555
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:48,170
I think our house is a decent integer, any integer below the largest integer below acts and the minimum of that with you can see that.

556
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:53,890
So that's the, the most rigorous way of writing this CDF function.

557
01:26:54,790 --> 01:27:01,510
Okay. So for any ads, if this guy converts to this guy, no way or no.

558
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:12,970
Here is. So if you think about this, this this limit, that's the summation limit.

559
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:17,870
It actually is the same. And as angle's infinity, die well goes to infinity.

560
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:30,220
So that's not a problem. All we need to show is that inside this summation, this product is approaching this product as an infinity.

561
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,830
And that is we actually have already shown that in previous slides.

562
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:40,410
If you break down this entrance y notation, you have this a.

563
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,640
You have the lies order and right.

564
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:53,430
So that's Ontario over and minus five, Ontario with Ontario.

565
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:59,430
So that's why Ontario is a constant recall that in this limit operation.

566
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:02,820
The only thing that's changing is, and I don't know, stupidity.

567
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:16,560
So the difference between this and Victoria and over and over and my one battery as the order of why is has the equal order

568
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:25,890
of and to the power of why not multiply the second term that will give you lambda to the power of line which in this term.

569
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:33,090
Okay. And this guy itself is e to that that development as opposed to the affinity.

570
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:43,500
And finally, this y factorial is the constant that you just does that the additional calls that you have from this edge was y notation.

571
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,030
So is a little bit more terrible derivation.

572
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:56,309
You can actually show that that can be the case for any acts outside this integer set and goes to infinity.

573
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:59,070
The city. Our function always converge to the right hand side,

574
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:13,060
which is to say to all of the plus on minimum so that the proof of y binomial in this set up is approaching or is converging to console distribution,

575
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:18,890
distribution and distribution. Right.

576
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:25,879
And similarly, we also had another result, if I recall correctly.

577
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,950
We have a hyper geometry distribution which also have a limited distribution.

578
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:44,210
So again, think about proving that using this CDP convergence, the all convergence and distribution, I sense.

579
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:54,630
All right. So the most important thing is, again, is the relation between these different types of convergence.

580
01:29:55,580 --> 01:30:01,110
As I said, convergence in probability is stronger than convergence in distribution.

581
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:10,110
And we have this relation gave us and converge in probability to acts that must converge in distribution networks.

582
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:24,530
And here here is an example where x1x to the sequence is a uniform and we define x and it has parentheses then to be our own x,

583
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,200
which is the mass of samples.

584
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:32,270
So from last time we know the exact distribution of this accident.

585
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:42,870
Right now, let's examine if at a converge in distribution, if it does convergent distribution where it converts to.

586
01:30:44,270 --> 01:31:07,460
Okay. So before we actually derive this think about how I that the math statistics out of this random sample of sample size were to converge to.

587
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:18,540
If you have a random sample from the uniform distribution, it's just a randomly allocated officer 02y animal.

588
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:31,020
And this end just means the maximal maximum value of those and ideally random samples as your angle severity.

589
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,479
What can we say about this x print assistant? What can I say about this?

590
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:42,670
Max Statistics? Yes.

591
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:50,860
Shouldn't they converge to one? Are you going to push it away from zero and closer and closer to one?

592
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:51,850
Right.

593
01:31:52,030 --> 01:32:03,520
The more random samples you have on this as to why involved, the larger the maximum going to be, because actually it going to be approaching one.

594
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:09,250
So to solve this problem, first of all, you need to have a target.

595
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:19,210
And that's a reasonable target to assume in the first place, because if you want to prove any type of emergency, you need to know what that limit is.

596
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:22,840
Otherwise what? I can't prove it. Right.

597
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:27,210
So in this case, you can get a reasonable guess.

598
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:32,780
A well, that convergence should be not could be a degenerate, a random variable.

599
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:43,450
Right. Then you can verify your assumption whether indeed converge in distribution to one.

600
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:55,810
Right. So I'll give you a couple of minutes and see what I can prove that this limiting distribution

601
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:03,160
for this match statistics on a sample size and converge in distribution to one.

602
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,770
And actually think about two ways to prove that. One is using the definition.

603
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,290
Okay. And the second is using this remark.

604
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:26,330
If you can somehow show converge in probability to one.

605
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:31,100
Also dropping could not accent converting distribution towards.

606
01:34:49,510 --> 01:36:26,710
Sure. All right.

607
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,520
So let's look at how to prove and prove this result in two ways.

608
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:42,020
Okay. First, let's consider using this this theorem to show the convergence in probability first.

609
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:45,470
And then theoretically, could this converge just in distribution?

610
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:52,310
Because in this case, you will see that convergence in probability is actually easier to show.

611
01:36:54,160 --> 01:37:01,459
You want to show that this and order statistic for the max statistic convergence converge improbability to

612
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:08,690
one we need to evaluate an absolute greater than zero plus the probability of max and minus one greater than.

613
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:19,220
All right. Evaluate that. Take the limit so that equal to zero and not complete the approved.

614
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:28,850
So x and minus one absolute value greater is absolute says x and is the maximum of uniform rate of random samples.

615
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:39,620
So x and minus one greater is absolute is equivalent to say as and is less than one minus possible.

616
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:44,780
Right. That's a thing. But does it say same event,

617
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:56,630
equivalent event and the maximum is less than one outside one minus epsilon is equivalent to say each sample in that random sample

618
01:37:57,170 --> 01:38:12,830
is less than one minus absolute the same argument as as how we derive the PDMP or or CDP for this X and this max statistic.

619
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:21,140
And that is the equivalent event. So we can break down this probability into the product of individual probabilities,

620
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:33,080
each having the probability of one over one minus absolute or one minus absolute.

621
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:45,670
Okay to the power and. So far anything any absolutely greater than zero this guy y minus epsilon is always does not want a greater than zero.

622
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:49,420
Okay. Now, you do not have to have to be too big.

623
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:55,480
Just consider I absolute problems as a zero 0 to 1 interval.

624
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:01,190
And I also agree that one is trivial. This probability is always okay.

625
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:11,890
Now you can say if you take the limit on both sides of this equation, this probability y equal to zero, and that would be the proof.

626
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:19,120
And this give us and for you probability one.

627
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:26,070
Well, there is a command distribution, right?

628
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:38,910
So that's one way to do it. Alternatively, we can follow the definition of a CDP for this exact and from the last lecture or the one before.

629
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:59,740
We know the period of x and as this after factorial the minus one bacterial one bacterial acts acts to the power of a minus one,

630
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:06,310
where this half of a smaller power acts as a PDA for uniform run of Apple.

631
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:21,780
And this control app is a CDP a unit right available so simplify it and times so this is one this acts as one acts zero and one.

632
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:31,000
Hey, this CDP is the formula that we gave in previous lectures and from there you can write out the CR function.

633
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:50,940
For this max statistics, which is essentially the integration of this PDF from zero tracks that that'll give us zero or X sorry zero one is

634
01:40:51,050 --> 01:41:10,810
rhetorically you want an X to the problem and it's between the zero and I draw that CDF zero one start at zero.

635
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:24,470
Then I talked to one. Seattle one as and becomes larger.

636
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:32,750
You can say this function cannot be pushed down and have a steeper slope towards one.

637
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:39,320
And so as an economist, larger the ship going to be shifting.

638
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:48,320
Twice this year increases.

639
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:56,800
This. The city function is still going to be continuous, but it going to be a push towards this corner.

640
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:02,680
Now we can consider what's the limit of this function.

641
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:13,320
All right. You take the limit and it goes infinity of this CDP function for any access.

642
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:20,570
What can we see? It's got to be equal to zero in access as or equal to zero.

643
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:32,030
And what about on this interval? There are 211i1 don't want it is between zero and one.

644
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,260
What's the limit of the power of it? Zero.

645
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:42,350
Right. It's going to be a stop function.

646
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:49,190
So anything that's below one is always going to be zero. Anything above or equal to Y is always going to be one.

647
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:52,820
And now think about this discharge function.

648
01:42:55,550 --> 01:43:06,920
These acts equal to one. But this decelerated random variable.

649
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:20,349
It's also a stop function, right? This equal to zero attacks is less than one and equal to one.

650
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,770
It acts as greater equal to one. All right.

651
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:30,460
We don't care about this this one point, because that's that this continuity point.

652
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,030
We only care about any and not equal to one.

653
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,049
And that's not equal to one the limit of this city.

654
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:43,240
Our function by this extent is always equal to the city of what is this generated run available.

655
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:50,370
So that also complete the proof that is X and converge to one in distribution.

656
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:57,520
All right. In this case, it aligns perfectly.

657
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,610
But you can't we don't care about this particular point,

658
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:06,670
because this particular point is that this this continuity point for the limited distribution.

659
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:15,910
So we only need to check all of the other ones to see whether the limit agrees with this limited distribution.

660
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:23,890
And in this case, it does. So that also been approved. So two different ways arriving at the same conclusion?

661
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:35,550
Yes. Does it matter whether the point of discontinuity is only right continuous versus it doesn't matter for this container.

662
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:40,090
Their point for this limited distribution, we call them all together.

663
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:50,820
So the definition only requires a convergence or continuity point of the limited distribution.

664
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:58,360
Right. So says convergence.

665
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,360
Improbability implies convergence in distribution.

666
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:12,760
We can also extend that. Combining that with the fact that almost sure, almost surely convergence implies urgency and probability.

667
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:18,190
So we also have almost surely convergence implies convergent distribution.

668
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:26,260
I've got a sense of the stress level of the three different types, and the strongest is almost surely convergence.

669
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:33,970
The weakest is convergence and distribution, and the middle is convergence to improbabilities, as I have argued.

670
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:40,239
Convergence and distribution is quite different from the other two in the sense that it does not have any

671
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:45,790
constraint on this limiting distribution on this particular random variable for the limiting distribution.

672
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:57,010
You can take any copy of that as long as it has the same distribution, it is on to a convergence.

673
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,920
You do have a lot of constraint on that. Limit the amount of power and.

674
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:11,930
One special case where we can establish a equivalence between convergence distribution

675
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:18,080
and a convergence probability is when that limit in distribution is to generate.

676
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:26,600
In other words, if you have that same merging distribution, to have an axis is to generate meaning.

677
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:32,120
It only has a point that's like the example that we have sent so far.

678
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:38,570
Then you can also conclude that erm converting probability to that particular channel rerun available.

679
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:48,590
In other words if your access, if you eliminate distribution as a constant is important as then convergence in distribution,

680
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:56,210
convergence in probability they are equivalent. And the reason for that is to consider the continuous run available.

681
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:01,910
This is what do we want? What do we need to show for convergence incomparably right?

682
01:47:02,210 --> 01:47:09,470
If you have a degenerate limit, that is a constant.

683
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:14,120
Right. So this is what we need to show. The limit of this probability goes to zero.

684
01:47:14,690 --> 01:47:19,130
So you can break down this the this probability using the CDF function.

685
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:28,850
Again here we assume it's continuous so we do not have the issue with this at last now or less or equal to as time and as and goes to infinity.

686
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:33,140
As you can see, these becomes one.

687
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:40,120
So the difference between the two becomes one. All right.

688
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:53,450
Because these are facts and welcome words to have any continuity point or disappointments, nanowires anywhere outside this,

689
01:47:53,450 --> 01:48:03,370
that a point of these well converse to have these well first the difference is going to be equal to one.

690
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:12,270
Okay. So that two lines I'll prove establish the equivalence between convergence and distribution.

691
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:16,680
Convergence of probability only if that is degenerate.

692
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,470
So in the last point, two points.

693
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:37,450
The City of Mission L.A. ran a marvel, has had the most horrible number of discontinuities.

694
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:48,580
So then we also have a theorem without a proof that convergence in distribution is equivalent to say, for any bounded, continuous function.

695
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:58,960
The expectation always convergence of converging distribution two has known for any bounded continuous function.

696
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:06,880
Expectation of t is always converge to Asia of objects and vice versa.

697
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:16,910
But it's generally hard to use this to prove convergence in distribution because as you can imagine,

698
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:22,010
you have to somehow show that or found that continuous function base always helps,

699
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:29,720
although you only need to evaluate the expectation, but you have to evaluate for any validated continuous function.

700
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:34,310
So typically we do not use this to prove convergence and distribution,

701
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:40,610
but rather use it as a result from this distributed convergence in distribution.

702
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:46,850
If you have convergence and distribution, then this is a nice result that you can theoretically take advantage of.

703
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:54,750
Okay. All right. Convergence and distribution does not mean PDF will converge.

704
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,130
Okay, so we have a fine example of that.
