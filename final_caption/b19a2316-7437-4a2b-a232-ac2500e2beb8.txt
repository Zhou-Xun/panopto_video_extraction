00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,812
Hello, today I'm going to give you an overview of the human genome.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,726
The learning objectives for today are to describe the structure of DNA, genes and

3
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:12,570
chromosomes.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,047
To use cytogenetic nomenclature to describe chromosomal abnormalities and

5
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:25,530
to interpret southern blot gels of Variable Number Tandem Repeats or VNTRs.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,390
As you know, DNA makes up the human genome.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,585
So the human genome is a sequence of about 3.2 billion DNA bases,

8
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:39,141
including Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine ATGC.

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,709
Remember that A and T pair together and G and C paired together.

10
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:49,759
And combined the two DNA strands form the double helix.

11
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:53,450
Chromosomes are highly condensed DNA.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,435
Here's a picture of the cell, you can see here the nucleus and

13
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:00,126
inside the nucleus are the chromosomes.

14
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,776
Here's a chromosome it's shown replicated,

15
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:09,165
you have two copies of the chromosome joined here at the central here.

16
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:13,671
And each of these copies each arm is called sister chromatid.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,020
So the DNA Here is highly condensed.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,988
You can see that it's wrapped around proteins like histones and

19
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,289
other structural proteins,

20
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:31,170
that actually allow the DNA to condense very highly inside of a cell.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,007
If we unravel it, we can see that each chromosome is really

22
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,990
just this really long piece of DNA.

23
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,801
That's tightly coiled inside the cell nucleus.

24
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:49,520
Condensed chromosomes can be stained to create dark and light bands.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,140
So this is an idea Graham or a cartoon version of guys MMA stained chromosomes.

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,659
The guys miss staining will make dark bands where

27
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,184
there are areas that are really rich in As and Ts.

28
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,860
And it'll make light bands in areas that have mostly G's and C's.

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,026
So, each of these bands of course contain millions of DNA nucleotides.

30
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:18,200
And each chromosome has a unique banding pattern.

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,630
You can see that chromosome one here is the longest chromosome and

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,368
the chromosomes decrease in size as you get over to the end

33
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:31,545
here with chromosomes 21 and 22.

34
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,333
And here are the X and Y.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,310
Here's a picture of an actual human karyotype.

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,790
So the karyotype is an entire chromosome, a constitution of a person.

37
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,530
So, this person had inside their cell nucleus.

38
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,830
All of these chromosomes, they were condensed, they were stained.

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,889
And you can actually see what that looks like molecularly.

40
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,210
Remember that normal karyotype have 46 chromosomes.

41
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,928
We usually get 23 chromosomes from each parent,

42
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,871
22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.

43
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,961
So you can see here all of the chromosomes have been laid out in order.

44
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,067
So one of these is the chromosome one that the person got from their mom and

45
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:22,581
one of them is the chromosome one that they got from their dad.

46
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,380
And down here, you can see the sex chromosomes.

47
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,173
This person has two X's, which means that the person is a female.

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,235
Here's a picture of the nucleus of the cell.

49
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:39,271
Inside the nucleus of the cell is the DNA and

50
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:43,900
the condensed DNA forms what we call chromatin.

51
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,915
The chromatin is the DNA And all of its associated proteins.

52
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:54,871
Euchromatin is regions of lightly condensed DNA, shown here.

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,330
The Euchromatin has a lot of genes and

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,789
the genes are being usually actively transcribed.

55
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,863
So these are areas of chromosome that are more open,

56
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:09,846
that allow the transcription machinery to get in,

57
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:14,587
get to where the genes are and start transcribing the genes.

58
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,769
The areas that are more condensed are called heterochromatin.

59
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,482
These are usually composed of repetitive DNA elements that we're going to

60
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:23,992
talk about in a minute.

61
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,732
As well as things like centromeres and telomeres.

62
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:31,319
And this this DNA, the heterochromatin is really shut down to transcription or

63
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,418
gene expression.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,146
There's an international system for talking about places on the chromosomes.

65
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:46,900
So here's a cartoon of chromosome, here's the centromere.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,947
This is the bands that are on the short arm of the chromosome labeled p,

67
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,596
the p arm or petit.

68
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:58,173
The long arms of the chromosome are labeled Q and

69
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:02,840
then the bands within the chromosomes are labeled by number.

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,801
So for example, this is band P11, P12 P13.1.

71
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:14,222
The terminal ends are named TER and you can see that as you move

72
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:21,248
toward the centromere to the terminal, the numbers get higher on both sides.

73
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,500
Genes are also located on chromosomes.

74
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,921
So for example, if we look at chromosome five,

75
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:38,900
there are 45 total bands on it, it contains about 2000 genes.

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,290
It's about 182 mega bases long or 182 million base pairs.

77
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,426
And we can talk about genes or

78
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:51,978
other regions of the genome by their chromosomal location.

79
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:57,499
So for example, the MCC gene is located at 5q21.

80
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:00,943
So the 5q arm and band 21.

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,150
There are two types of abnormalities that can occur on chromosomes and humans.

82
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,670
One is structural abnormalities and the other is numerical abnormalities.

83
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,553
For structural abnormalities, it means that we have a missing extra or

84
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,800
rearranged genetic material on a particular chromosome.

85
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,001
For example, deletion of 100 base pairs located on chromosome 6p.

86
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,187
For numerical abnormalities, these are deviations and

87
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:35,340
the total number of chromosomes that an individual has.

88
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,653
So remember I talked about how normally people have 46 chromosomes.

89
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:46,717
But for example, someone could have three copies of one chromosome,

90
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:49,917
say chromosome 21 instead of two.

91
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,222
This example is trisomy 21 or down syndrome.

92
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,981
So, when we talk about changes in chromosome structure,

93
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,993
we can use this cartoon picture as an example.

94
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:09,392
So here you've got a chromosome, here's it's banding pattern I colored in this

95
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:14,890
region right here just to help you follow it as we do different manipulations to it.

96
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,306
When we talk about changes in the structure.

97
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:22,576
So for example, if we take this colored region and we delete it,

98
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,780
that's called the deletion.

99
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,711
So some genetic material on the chromosome is removed.

100
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,079
Maybe we can take this colored in region instead and duplicate it.

101
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,260
So, we have the chromosome has extra genetic material,

102
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,369
because this region is actually in the chromosome twice, that's a duplication.

103
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:50,040
So, another thing that could happen is that you could have an inversion.

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,340
So instead of the bands reading red, green, red, green,

105
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,902
purple from the centromere, they read purple, green, red.

106
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:03,663
This is called an inversion where some of the genetic material on the chromosome is

107
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,290
inverted or flipped, and then reattached.

108
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,719
You can also have what's called a trans location, where you have genetic

109
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:15,310
material between two different chromosomes that are actually exchanged.

110
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,120
Sometimes you can get an equal exchange where you keep all of the genetic material

111
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,870
in the cell and the genetic material just transfers to a different chromosome.

112
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,986
Like here, you still have all of the blue material and all of the red material but

113
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:32,654
they're not as they should be.

114
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,887
So this is normal where you have blue and a red chromosome and

115
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,511
here's the translocation.

116
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,995
This is called a reciprocal translocation, when there's no loss of genetic material.

117
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:46,882
But you can also have a trans location where for

118
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:51,707
example, you've got the blue chromosome and then the red chromosome here.

119
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:54,019
So we keep the red genetic material, but

120
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,020
this part of the blue material was lost for example.

121
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,521
And that would not be reciprocal, it would still be a translocation.

122
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:09,870
So there's a nomenclature for the structural abnormalities.

123
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,760
What you want to specify is the total number of chromosomes that the person has.

124
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,288
What their sex chromosomes are, the type of abnormality.

125
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:22,740
The chromosomes that are involved in the exact location of where

126
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,313
something happened.

127
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:30,456
So here for the deletion, we could say that they have 46 chromosomes.

128
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:34,168
There X,Y so they're male, but

129
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:38,809
there's a deletion on chromosome six and

130
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:45,715
it happened at 6p 16.3, that's the exact break point.

131
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:49,820
For a duplication, you would use the terminology DUP.

132
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,252
Here's insertion where you have an insertion

133
00:09:55,252 --> 00:10:01,947
of chromosome 5q21 to 31 into chromosome 2p13.

134
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:06,920
So just this piece 5q 21 to 31 was actually

135
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,680
inserted into chromosome 2p13.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,330
This is the nomenclature for a trans location.

137
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,790
And this is the nomenclature for an inversion.

138
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,700
You don't need to know how to write these.

139
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,254
You would just need to be able to recognize them when you're looking through

140
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:32,580
the literature Here are nomenclature for chromosomal abnormalities.

141
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,010
So remember the chromosomal abnormalities are when you have too few or

142
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,530
too many chromosomes.

143
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,621
So here typically someone could have.

144
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,990
46 x.

145
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,580
X.

146
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,530
So that would be female or for 46 Xy.

147
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,080
That would be male.

148
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,211
If you have Tripp Loyd it means you have one extra copy of every chromosome.

149
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,120
So you'd have 69 chromosomes total.

150
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,910
And these could be your different sex chromosome.

151
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,331
potential options, Triple D.

152
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,000
Is not compatible with life.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,159
but it does sometimes happen in early zygote or

154
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,220
fetus stage of pregnancy.

155
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,380
And that usually results in a spontaneous abortion for a miscarriage.

156
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,961
You could have a trisomy where you have just one copy of one extra chromosome.

157
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:29,940
So you've got 47 instead of 46 total.

158
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,210
And here you've got an extra chromosome 21.

159
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,041
So you've got three copies of chromosome 21.

160
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:41,880
And in this case is this is known as down syndrome.

161
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,990
You could also have monos omi where you're missing one copy of the chromosome.

162
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,895
So here we have a person with only 45 chromosomes and

163
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:54,171
they only have one sex chromosome.

164
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,970
So they have one copy of ACTS and nothing else.

165
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,260
This is called turner syndrome.

166
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,520
You can also have moses is where there are two types of cells in the body.

167
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Some of them have the typical chromosome composition for example, and

168
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,291
some of them have an extra chromosome.

169
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,050
And here this person has an extra X chromosome.

170
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:20,019
So different cells in the body will have either the typical composition or

171
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,821
will have this extra chromosome.

172
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,140
So what do we know about the human genome sequence?

173
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,730
So as I said before, the human genome is about 3.2 billion nucleotide bases long.

174
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,131
The size of jeans is highly variable.

175
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:42,621
So you can have really long jeans that are about 2.4 million base pairs.

176
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:46,790
For example at the at the far extreme that's a very big gene.

177
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,800
And you can have really tiny jeans.

178
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,646
So there are some transfer RNA is for example that are only 76 or

179
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:56,890
less than 100 base pairs long.

180
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,540
There's about 20,000 or a little over 20,000 genes in the human genome.

181
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,866
And when we look across people we find that over 99.9%

182
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:12,490
of the nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people.

183
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,701
And that is a number that we can get into in a little bit more detail.

184
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:21,512
But basically what you need to know is that for

185
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:26,641
the most part everybody shares very similar sequences of D.

186
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:27,320
N. A.

187
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,166
We'll get into more about how mutations or

188
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:37,418
other variation in the genome are distributed

189
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:45,520
later the human genome is arranged in gene dense and gene poor regions.

190
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,011
So gene dense regions, what we call kind of like urban centers.

191
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:54,667
So they're making a lot of proteins are they're making a lot of RNA that gets

192
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,440
translated into proteins.

193
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,141
Gene dense regions generally have a lot of G.

194
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:04,681
M. C. Bases and gene poor regions usually have a lot of A.

195
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,870
And T. Bases.

196
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,717
Genes are concentrated in sort of random areas along the genome

197
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,471
with vast expanses of non coding D.

198
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,200
N. A. In between.

199
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,040
And we also know that there are these things called CPG islands.

200
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,701
So these are regions with a really high G.

201
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:27,770
And C content and greater than expected.

202
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,290
Sea bass is followed immediately by G bases.

203
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,252
These occur near the promoter regions of genes a lot of times and

204
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,220
help regulate gene activity.

205
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,984
So when we talk about epigenetic sex will be thinking about things like

206
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:45,539
CPG islands because these are important regions for

207
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,511
the Epp egy gnome to come in and regulate gene expression.

208
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,229
When we look across the chromosomes,

209
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:57,677
we see that chromosome one has the most genes with almost 5000 genes and

210
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:01,100
the Y chromosome, which is really small, has the fewest.

211
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:09,688
Remember that there's this sort of central dogma to DNA, right?

212
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:12,950
You've got DNA in the nucleus of the cell.

213
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,753
It's transcribed into RNA.

214
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:23,356
The RNA is spliced, or the entrance of the RNA are cut out to make the messenger RNA.

215
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:28,947
The messenger RNA is exported from the nucleus of the cell into the cytoplasm.

216
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:33,167
And that's translated into an amino acid chain,

217
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,792
which is folded up and made into a protein.

218
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:44,063
So, you guys I'm sure all familiar with this central dogma DNA to RNA to protein.

219
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:49,280
And then we think that the protein is what influences our physical traits and

220
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,350
our diseases.

221
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:58,731
So, this is sort of our typical way of thinking about the human genome.

222
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:04,366
So, we think about these protein coding genes, DNA to RNA to protein.

223
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:09,351
But, also remember that the protein coding pieces of the human genome

224
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,304
are really less than 2%.

225
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:16,665
So, 98% of the genome doesn't code for protein at all.

226
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:21,910
So you've got the coding region, is 2%, the non-coding region is 98%.

227
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,690
Of those 98%, about half of it is these repeated sequences.

228
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,563
So repeated sequences shed light on chromosome structure and dynamics.

229
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:39,438
Over time, these repeated sequences reshape the genome by rearranging them,

230
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:43,479
creating new genes, modifying and shuffling genes.

231
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:48,416
And these repeated sequences were very active in the early

232
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,740
years of the human genome.

233
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,497
But in the past 50 million years, there's been a dramatic decrease that has

234
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:59,911
occurred in the rate of these repeat accumulations in the human genome.

235
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:05,345
So, the repetitive sequences are really these sort of important

236
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:10,977
sequences ancestrally in the early evolution of the human genome,

237
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:15,443
but they're not as important now, we don't think.

238
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:18,519
Just a little bit more information about repeated sequences.

239
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,548
So, repetitive DNA, we've got a couple of different kinds.

240
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,972
You have highly repetitive DNA.

241
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:28,137
For example, satellite DNA.

242
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:35,487
And this is mostly near centrum ears for example.

243
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,254
It really helps the chromosome kind of condense.

244
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:47,076
And it really helps with the structural dynamics of the chromosomes.

245
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,991
This middle repetitive DNA sequences.

246
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:53,580
One thing that's gonna be important for us is tandem repeats.

247
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,876
So these are things like mini satellites, VNTRs, microsatellites.

248
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:07,984
These also are around usually the centromere of the DNA.

249
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,069
So we'll talk about them more in a second.

250
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,900
And then we have this other category,

251
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,977
that is interspersed retro transpose.

252
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:22,240
So these are things like LINE elements and SINE elements,

253
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,764
which we'll also talk about now.

254
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:28,413
So we talked about satellite or simple sequence DNA.

255
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:33,172
It's about 6% of the genome, found near centromere and telomeres.

256
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:39,264
The repeats are anywhere from 1 to 500 bp, and they can repeat for a long time.

257
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:47,968
So those repeats can be found back to back to back up to 100 kbp in length of DNA.

258
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:51,856
And so these are the satellite, mini satellite and

259
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:55,118
micro satellite DNA that we talked about.

260
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:58,530
These, like I said, form the basis of VNTRS.

261
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,938
Or variable number tandem repeats.

262
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:06,890
The retro transposons and transposons are really interesting

263
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,447
because they share features with viral DNA.

264
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:15,336
So, historically, in the human genome, these were mobile elements that

265
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:18,993
could move around in the genome and reshape the genome.

266
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:23,304
And, now, we have remnants of them in our human genome.

267
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:27,967
So these can be full viral sequences or partial viral sequences.

268
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,847
The lines are long interspersed elements.

269
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,395
They're about 6kb in length.

270
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,850
There's almost a million copies of them in the human genome.

271
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,590
And the short interspersed elements like sines are about 300 bp in length.

272
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,469
And there's about 1.5 million copies of them.

273
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:50,353
The most common sign element is called Alu.

274
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:55,058
This actually composes about 11% of the human genome.

275
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:58,997
So, when you're thinking about your genome,

276
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,938
a lot of it is these ancestral viral sequences.

277
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,056
Why are RVNTRs important?

278
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:13,753
One thing that we can do with VNTRs is we can \use them to identify people,

279
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:17,838
and distinguish between people.

280
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:24,878
So, for example, when we've got these variable number of tandem repeats,

281
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:29,104
different chromosomes that each person has,

282
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,806
can have a different number of repeats.

283
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:38,591
So, for example, say that these are four different copies of chromosome one.

284
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:43,914
On this first copy of chromosome one, there's a variable number

285
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:48,772
of tandem repeats, where this chromosome has two copies.

286
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:53,213
Another Another chromosome one could have three copies.

287
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,405
Another chromosome one could have four copies.

288
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:57,096
Another could have five copies.

289
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,160
That's why it's called variable number of repeats.

290
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,226
Because in the population, when we look at people's chromosome ones,

291
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:08,297
they could have either two ,three, four or

292
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:11,966
five copies of this particular repeated sequence.

293
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:16,993
So what we can do, is we can actually use, what's called, a restriction enzyme.

294
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:23,340
So this is an enzyme that usually comes from bacteria.

295
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,856
It can actually cut the DNA in specific places.

296
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:32,148
So if we cut the chromosome one downstream of the VNTR,

297
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:37,106
and we cut the chromosome one upstream of the VNTR.

298
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:43,482
You can see that, depending on how many repeats each of these chromosomes have,

299
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:47,250
will dictate the length of this segment of DNA.

300
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,038
So if the person only has two repeats,

301
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,884
the segment of DNA that's cut here, is about 2kb.

302
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:57,367
But if the person has five copies,

303
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:02,786
the length of DNA that's cut here is about 3.5 kb.

304
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:03,702
So what?

305
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:04,750
So what does that mean?

306
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,573
So, what we can do, is we can actually put these cut out pieces of DNA.

307
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,781
We can run them on a gel, and we can stain the gel,

308
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,983
which is called Southern Blotting.

309
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:25,151
We can stain the DNA that's in the gel, and we can actually see from that,

310
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:30,830
how many repeats each person has at this particular VNTR.

311
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:36,823
So here, this is the gel for person 1, 1, let's say.

312
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,718
So this lane is for person 1,1.

313
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:45,050
This person has a big band here at 2,

314
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,150
the DNA size is 2kb.

315
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,620
That means that the person has two copies of this

316
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,478
kind of chromosome where they have two repeats of the VNTR.

317
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:07,003
This person, person 1,2, has a band at 2kb, and a band at 2.5 kb.

318
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:12,903
So that means they had one copy of chromosome 1 that had two repeats,

319
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:17,600
and one copy of chromosome one that had three repeats.

320
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:22,813
Here, we can see it a little bit better.

321
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:29,825
So, this is a pedigree, you've got your dad and your mom and their four kids.

322
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,640
This up here is showing you what these bands look like on a gel.

323
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,231
Here, there are the banding patterns for each of these people.

324
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:47,756
So that this parent had a band at six repeats,

325
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:51,715
and a band at four repeats.

326
00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:58,530
This person had a band at five repeats and a band at three repeats.

327
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,892
Okay, these kids inherited one chromosome from their mom, and

328
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:05,085
one chromosome from their dad.

329
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:12,455
So this person here, has a band at six repeats, and a band at five repeats.

330
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:17,030
We know what they got from their dad, and what they got from their mom.

331
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,425
So dad has a chromosome that has six repeats, and four repeats.

332
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,869
This kid has a six and a five.

333
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:28,740
That means that dad must have given this

334
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,324
child their chromosome that had six repeats.

335
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:38,474
And mom must have given the chromosome that had five repeats.

336
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:42,938
For this child, they got the five repeat band from the mom,

337
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:46,433
and the four repeat band from the dad, right?

338
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:51,715
So we can actually see how the chromosomes are segregating

339
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:58,419
within this family by studying these variable number of tandem repeats.

340
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:03,411
Segregation of the chromosomes in the family is easy to follow

341
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,332
using this technique.

342
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,121
So, why is this important?

343
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:10,971
One thing that makes it important is because we

344
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:14,433
can use VNTRS as DNA evidence and crimes.

345
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:20,638
So here is an example of a gel from a sexual assault case.

346
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:25,279
So this is just one VNTR that's been

347
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,773
genotyped in each of the samples.

348
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:35,288
So the DNA samples came from the victim, two different suspects, and

349
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:40,631
other people that might be involved like the victim's boyfriend.

350
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:44,740
Then we run, we take and we genotype this VNTR.

351
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,037
And we run it on this gel along with some other things.

352
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:52,206
So we've got controls where we know exactly what

353
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:55,569
the banding pattern should look like.

354
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:56,937
We have ladders and

355
00:25:56,937 --> 00:26:01,907
the ladder's actually give us information about the length of DNA.

356
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:08,245
So these ladders have known lengths for each of these bands.

357
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:11,614
And, so, if we get a random length of DNA,

358
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:15,746
we can compare it to the ladder to know how long it is.

359
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:19,050
Here you've got female cells and

360
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,777
the female has a banding pattern here and here.

361
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:28,916
Then you have DNA from the sperm that was found on the female.

362
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:35,621
And you can see that the banding pattern is having here and here.

363
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:38,421
Lengths of DNA, here and here.

364
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:43,363
That matches suspect one but not suspect two.

365
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:45,597
And it doesn't also match the boyfriend.

366
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:51,313
So, just from this VNTR, we could see that suspect one is compatible with

367
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:57,781
having the same pattern of VNTR DNA as the sperm that was found on the woman's body.

368
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:07,219
These VNTRS actually formed the basis of the combined DNA index system or CODIS.

369
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:12,008
This is the DNA database that's funded by the FBI.

370
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:17,119
The FBI actually stores these DNA profiles that are generated by federal state and

371
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,430
local crime labs to assist in the identification of crime suspects.

372
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:27,470
And it holds, right now, at least 5 million offender profiles if not more.

373
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,503
When you ever hear someone talking about a DNA fingerprint,

374
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:38,534
this is typically composed of 13 VNTRs and one sex chromosome marker.

375
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:41,887
So this is showing you on the ideogram,

376
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:46,673
the different places where these VNTRs are genotyped.

377
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:53,351
These 13 VNTRs are each very highly variable in the population.

378
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:56,828
So there's lots of different numbers of repeats that you could have.

379
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:58,340
That each of these VNTRs.

380
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,741
So if we genotype you at each of these 13 VNTRs, and

381
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:07,045
the one sex marker, that is enough to almost always

382
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:11,966
uniquely distinguish you from anyone else on the planet.

383
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,085
One other thing that we wanna touch on,

384
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:20,608
is how the human compares with other organisms.

385
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,518
So, compared with humans,

386
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:27,778
other organisms have a more uniform distribution of genes across the genome.

387
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:30,672
They actually have less protein diversity in general.

388
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:35,896
So humans have an average of three times as many proteins as the fly,

389
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:38,012
for example, or the worm.

390
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,843
This is due to alternative splicing.

391
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:46,109
And also to chemical modifications that are made to the proteins.

392
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:51,742
However, there are a lot of different protein families that are shared between,

393
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:56,817
for example, humans and other organisms like worms, flies and plants.

394
00:28:56,817 --> 00:28:59,899
So, for each gene family,

395
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:05,667
humans tend to have a greater number of genes in it.

396
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:12,673
So, for example, there are developmental genes called hawks genes.

397
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:17,756
Humans have many more copies of different kinds of hawks genes,

398
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,930
for example, than flies.

399
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,377
Just to touch on some of these basic concepts, I wanna make sure that

400
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:34,111
you remember what we're talking about when we're talking about exons,

401
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:36,496
introns and alternative splicing.

402
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:42,030
So recall when we're talking about the protein coding regions of genes,

403
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,375
here's the DNA.

404
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:49,025
Inside the DNA, we have exons, which are the protein coding regions of a gene.

405
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:54,787
And introns, which are regions between the exons that don't actually code for

406
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:56,001
protein at all.

407
00:29:56,001 --> 00:30:00,690
In a regular gene, humans will have exons, and

408
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,982
then longer introns in between.

409
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:08,616
Remember that the RNA is completely transcribed.

410
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:12,920
So that when we start with the messenger RNA,

411
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,470
it will be having both sort of the flanking sequences, and

412
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:25,519
then the exons, introns, exons and introns, all will be transcribed.

413
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,656
But then, the RNA can be spliced into different final messenger RNAs.

414
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:37,761
So the introns can all be spliced out, and we can have exons one through five here.

415
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:42,629
We could skip exon three, and that would be an alternative splicing event.

416
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:48,648
And we would only have exons 1, 2, 4 and 5 or we could have a different combination.

417
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:53,028
All of these, when they're translated, make different versions of proteins.

418
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:58,585
And that's how humans can have one gene that makes three different proteins.

419
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:01,442
It's due to this alternative splicing.

420
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:08,911
When we look at introns and exons across species,

421
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:14,610
humans have an average of about nine exons and eight introns per gene.

422
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,032
About 80% of the of the exons are less than 200bp.

423
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:23,037
So most of the exons are very small in humans.

424
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,331
On average, it's about 170bp.

425
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:29,082
The average in intron is really long.

426
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:32,000
So about 5500bp.

427
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,174
And in general, humans have much shorter exons, and

428
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:39,158
much longer introns than worm or fly.

429
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:43,184
So here, we can see the percentage of exons.

430
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:46,812
Humans, the exon length is really pretty short.

431
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:50,236
And we have almost none that are over 300bp.

432
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:53,108
Whereas worm and fly have a little bit.

433
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:58,545
They have some shorter exons, but they also have some of these much longer exons.

434
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:00,134
And here's the intron length.

435
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:05,361
And you can see the reverse, humans have generally really long introns.

436
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,567
Whereas worm and fly tend to have much shorter introns.
