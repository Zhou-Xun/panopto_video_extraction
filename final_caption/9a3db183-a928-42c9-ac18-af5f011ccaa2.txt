1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,129
Okay.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,870
So now we recognize that thermal stress can lead to fatalities and is absolutely something that we need to manage, particularly in the workplace.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,590
What standards and guidelines are out there to help us protect workers from experiencing excessive thermal stress?

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,340
Well, as is often the case, OSHA actually doesn't have a specific permissible exposure limit for heat.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,710
They do have, however, the general duty clause, which, as we've talked about previously in class,

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,780
does allow an ocean inspector who enters a workplace and identifies a situation,

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,210
is unacceptably dangerous to cite the employer and in some cases stop the work being done because it's too dangerous.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:56,010
The general duty clause essentially is OSHA is requirement that employers provide workplaces that are free from recognized health and safety hazards,

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,080
of which, of course, heat stress is one.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,740
Again, as is often the case, ECJ does have a threshold limit value related to heat and it's pictured here in Figure one.

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,910
And so like many twelves, the heat stress 12 specifies a true threshold limit value that should never be exceeded,

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,779
an action limit below which we're not concerned.

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:30,090
And then the area between these two limits is the area where we need to be sort of at elevated concern in monitoring our workers.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,700
We're going to revisit this figure shortly. But I'll just mention here that on the Y axis, we're looking at the BGP effective.

15
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,330
So that's a BGP temperature modified to account for clothing that the worker is wearing.

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,790
And then on the x axis, we have the metabolic rate, how hard the worker is working.

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:59,610
We will dive into both of these things shortly. So this particular 12 four heat stress was actually just recently modified by HGH.

18
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,200
And the limits here are intended to allow healthy workers to achieve thermal

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,870
equilibrium so that TLC itself is intended to be applied to acclimatize workers.

20
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,310
The action limit is intended to be applied to acclimatize workers.

21
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,270
Now, of course, you probably recognize already that if thermal equilibrium cannot be sustained within an individual worker's body,

22
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:28,890
that worker is going to experience an increased likelihood of experiencing either heat exhaustion or potentially even heatstroke.

23
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,710
Something else to keep in mind is as workers edge up closer to the level at which they can no longer maintain thermal equilibrium,

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:47,160
they are increasingly likely to have errors in their judgment, to be acutely injured and also to be at risk of other adverse incidents.

25
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:56,430
I'll also say that the TLC is intended to be applied to workers, assuming that they've completely recovered from any previous exposure.

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,420
So what does the TV tell us?

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,190
Well, one reasonable first question here is when would I start evaluating workers to see if they even are at risk of heat stress?

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,230
And there's a couple of different cues here that HGH provides.

29
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,149
The first is if workers are reporting that they're experiencing discomfort or other symptoms associated with heat stress, that's a huge red flag.

30
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,110
We want to act on that. The second is professional judgment.

31
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,589
So if as an experienced industrial hygienist,

32
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,079
you are working with a group of workers or an activity that sort of suggest to you that they may be at risk,

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,380
you trust their professional judgment and want to do further evaluation.

34
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,490
And finally, a more quantitative or objective metric here.

35
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,040
When the heat index or the air temperature is above 27 degrees Celsius or 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,550
that's when we start worrying about the potential for heat stress.

37
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,920
And when heat stress is suspended, we always want to establish a heat stress management program.

38
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,170
In other words, we don't just want to deal with the problem.

39
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,060
Occasionally, we want to have a program in place that lets us sort of proactively handle this issue.

40
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,720
So let's dive into more details on the 2021 top four heat stress here.

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,479
Step one that we would go through if we were assessing workers for heat stress potential is to consider, well,

42
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,580
what kind of work are they doing and how much heat, more specifically are they generating through that work?

43
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:26,510
And so the TLT document provides table one here that gives different example categories of the heat generated from different activities.

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:35,100
So if we look at table one here. You can see we've got different categories of work from rest to light, moderate, heavy and very heavy.

45
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,420
We've got different assigned metabolic rates. So this is how many watts we anticipate a typical worker to be generating through this work.

46
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,630
And we've got just some examples of what types of work are we talking about.

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,489
So if we start with rest, you can see that might have an assigned metabolic rate of maybe 115 watts and this would be like sitting or laying around,

48
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,280
not really doing any work. Sounds like a great job to me.

49
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:04,410
The next category is light and so the assigned metabolic rate here is 180 watts for this worker.

50
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,260
And this might include sitting but actually doing some light manual work or maybe standing and doing some late arm work,

51
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:18,959
maybe occasionally walking moderate metabolic rate might be around 300 watts and that would

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,270
be more sustained and kind of moderate intensity hand in arm work or maybe arm and leg work,

53
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:31,110
maybe some light pushing or pulling or just normal walking heavy would take us up to 415 watts.

54
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,999
And this would include more intense work with the arm or trunk, maybe carrying, shoveling,

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,819
doing some other manual material work or pushing and pulling heavy loads or maybe walking in a very fast pace and very heavy.

56
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:53,100
Here is 521 estimate. So this would be basically working very hard at your fastest, maybe even your maximum pace.

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,670
I'll also note down here at the bottom, the effect of body weight on the metabolic rate, as you see,

58
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,390
can be accounted for by multiplying this estimated rate by the ratio of the worker's actual body weight to 70 kilograms.

59
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,650
So that's just another way to reflect and acknowledge that bigger people tend to have higher metabolic rates and heat generation.

60
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:23,340
Now, depending on the conditions that the workers are working in, we're going to choose to assess either the outside,

61
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:34,259
if the workers have direct solar exposure or WBC inside or if they're working in the shade or indoors, then we're going to estimate the WBC effective.

62
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,839
And that term, as I already mentioned, is actually going to allow us to account for the clothing that the worker is wearing.

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,409
And for this, we can turn to table two in the TLB.

64
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:51,450
So you can see we have clothing adjustment values that basically we apply or add to the WBC to estimate this effective CGT.

65
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,260
What do I mean here?

66
00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:00,719
Well, if a worker is just wearing sort of standard work clothes, a long sleeve shirt and pants, we consider that to be a zero addition there.

67
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,010
So we just consider the object to be equivalent to the effective.

68
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,389
If a worker is wearing short sleeves and maybe very light pants,

69
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:16,500
we might actually reduce the WBC effective by one degrees Celsius to reflect that and account

70
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,050
for the fact that they are having probably a very good potential for evaporation cooling.

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,970
On the other hand, if they've got, for instance, polished green coveralls on, we're going to actually add a half a degree Celsius to the BGT.

72
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,739
If they're wearing Polyolefin coveralls, we're going to add one degree Celsius.

73
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,960
If they've got double layers of woven clothing on, we're going to add three degrees Celsius.

74
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,460
And if they're in sort of a Tyvek limited use, you know, a vapor barrier, chemical resistant coveralls with a hood,

75
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,970
we're actually going to jump this up 11 decibels higher as the object here,

76
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,120
effective compared to the object, just to reflect the fact that once you're inside that fully encapsulating Tyvek suit,

77
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,450
there is essentially zero evaporative cooling going on.

78
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,670
The next step here is we apply the object effective to the actual work conditions that the workers are in,

79
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,380
and that basically is laid out here in table three.

80
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,210
So if our BGT effective is below the table three criteria here for an acclimatized worker,

81
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,190
sort of our most vulnerable fraction of the workforce, we've got really little risk of of heat stress.

82
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,760
On the other hand, if the BGT effective is above these table three criteria for unemployment test workers,

83
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,580
but below the criteria for acclimatize workers,

84
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:49,900
then we need to implement just some general controls to the workplace to reduce the risk of work related heat stress.

85
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,750
And then if BGT effective is above these criteria for acclimatize workers,

86
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,280
we need to have general controls and we also need job specific controls as well.

87
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,740
So what are these criteria? Let's look into these a little bit more. Again, the left hand portion of this table here refers to acclimatize workers.

88
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,100
The right hand refers to and acclimatize workers.

89
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,690
We've got the metabolic rates that we take from the previous table.

90
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,210
And here we're looking at light, moderate, heavy or very heavy, assuming that people at rest probably are at risk of heat stress.

91
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,050
And then very importantly, on the far left column here, we're looking at the percent of time in a worker's hour,

92
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,870
for instance, that's spent working versus in recovery.

93
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:45,220
So maybe this person or this job works 75 to 100% of any 60 minute period, or maybe they only work 50 to 75% and they rest for the other 25 to 50%.

94
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:54,070
You know, here's a job that's working 0 to 25% of any hour and resting for 25 excuse me, 75 to 100%.

95
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:05,310
So then you can see for the given combinations of work, rest, recovery cycle and metabolic rate, we've got allowable effective.

96
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:13,180
So if I've got somebody who's doing light work and they're working 75 to 100% of the time interval and recovering for the other fraction,

97
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,310
then that would be effective as 31 degrees Celsius.

98
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:25,850
On the other hand, if they're doing very heavy work and they're doing the 75 to 100% work in any given period.

99
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,469
There's a dash here, meaning you can't work safely in those environments.

100
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:38,770
In fact, if you're doing very heavy work, you need to be working only 25 to 50% of any work interval and resting for the other 50% or so.

101
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:46,629
And even so, your effective there is 28 degrees Celsius and you can see the very same relationship here

102
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,490
for unexamined ties workers on the right and as we might expect an acclimatize worker,

103
00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:01,150
as we allow slightly less exposure than we do exposure in terms of an effective than we do for the acclimatized workers.

104
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,729
Now, in addition to these screening steps that we've just done,

105
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,240
we can also conduct physiological monitoring to actually assess within the individual workers what is their heat strain.

106
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,910
And so HGH provides a table for here that gives us some guidelines if we want to go that extra step and actually do some monitoring of the workers,

107
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,230
not just at the environment.

108
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:31,590
And so things that we could look for here, for instance, if we've got people who are sustaining a heart rate greater than 180 beats per minute,

109
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,870
minus that individual's age over the period of several minutes or more,

110
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:46,590
again, among individuals with normal cardiac response, that is essentially an indication that that worker's exposure to heat should be discontinued.

111
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,730
If we've got a workers measured core temperature that goes up by more than one degrees Celsius from their pre job temperature.

112
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,040
If that pre job temperature is less than 37 and a half degrees Celsius,

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,739
if we've got workers who have taken a minute after a peak work effort to recover and their heart rate is still greater than 120 beats per minute,

114
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:17,120
then we should discontinue exposure. And then, you know, regardless of those objective or quantitative measures, we need to stop the exposure.

115
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,590
If a worker is giving signs or symptoms of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, or if they're just requesting to stop.

116
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:39,329
Now I mentioned if workers who are under climate ties are exposed above levels that are specified in the criteria for the last table,

117
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,559
but those levels are below what's allowable for acclimatized workers.

118
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,500
We're in kind of that in interpreting the action limit area.

119
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,040
And in that case, we want to implement some general controls.

120
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,460
And so these are very helpfully provided in table five by CGI.

121
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,970
We've got things like training, we've got heat stress, hygiene practices, you know,

122
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:11,370
taking in fluids regularly throughout the shift, self-monitoring for symptoms, taking appropriate breaks.

123
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,580
We've got policies that could be put into place. How are we going to make sure that workers are getting acclimatized?

124
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,680
What are we doing to recognize early any signs or symptoms of heat related stress?

125
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,709
Doing actually some environmental surveillance.

126
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:33,360
So, you know, constantly monitoring the temperature to see if and humidity and in general to see if conditions change.

127
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,459
We might think about getting medical clearance and counseling by a health care provider,

128
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,680
especially of camp workers who appear to be an extra risk of heat stress.

129
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,509
And then we absolutely want to have an emergency response plan.

130
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:54,660
So if we have workers who turn up with signs or symptoms of heat stress, we want to treat that essentially as a medical emergency.

131
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,300
We need to have the capability to do aggressive cooling and get those people to a hospital as quickly as possible.

132
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:08,400
So that's what we would do if people are exposed above the criteria for unemployment test workers, but below the criteria for acclimatize workers.

133
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,620
And if we've got exposures that are actually above what's permitted for acclimatized workers, then we need these more job specific controls.

134
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:22,380
So now we're going to implement engineering controls that are either going to reduce the intensity of the work and in doing

135
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,550
so reduce the metabolic rate or just provide more air movement and cooling through evaporation through the workplace,

136
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:38,220
trying to reduce workers exposure to heat from processes or release of water vapor that increases humidity, providing shade,

137
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:44,730
providing shielding for radiant heat sources, and maybe adjusting the clothing that's required for the job.

138
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,980
We can also think about administrative controls here. So limiting exposure time,

139
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,840
making sure we're allowing sufficient recovery time for workers and just generally limiting physiological strain through self-monitoring,

140
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:06,270
certainly personal cooling. So giving people access to air conditioning, liquids, ice, those can be very effective.

141
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,090
And finally, we can consider physiological monitoring just to confirm that things are working for individual workers.

142
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,720
So I haven't really mentioned PPE.

143
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,230
And you may be thinking PPE for heat stress. You know what is there?

144
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,040
And in fact, it turns out there are a variety of options here.

145
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:32,510
So particularly for folks who are working around radiant heat sources like molten metal or heating lamps, for instance,

146
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,780
there are reflective clothing sets like you see here that are designed to shield the worker from that radiant heat load.

147
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,719
There are so-called phase change vests, which are vests basically that you put a bunch of ice into.

148
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,150
And as the ice evaporates over the course of a work shift, it provides cooling to that worker.

149
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,549
There's also closed loop heat exchangers that you can wear underneath protective gear and there's in clothing, air cooling.

150
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,690
So essentially there are vests that you can buy that actually plug into a compressed air system and they blow compressed air around through that vest,

151
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,530
which provides tremendous cooling through convection.

152
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,260
Now we've been focusing on the workplace, but let's recognize that the community also can very much be at risk from heat stress.

153
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,459
Now, unlike the occupational setting,

154
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,200
where we can go in and collect measurements and that is considered the gold standard

155
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,409
object actually hasn't been employed so commonly for public assessment of heat stress.

156
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:40,250
Rather, there's something called the heat index that is used, and that's something that's put out by the National Weather Service.

157
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:48,379
It operates in a very similar way to what we've talked about already in terms of considering both temperature here on the x axis,

158
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,090
as well as relative humidity.

159
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,140
And you can see in this heat index here, we've got temperature and humidity combinations that might be in the caution zone.

160
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,540
That might be an extreme caution, might be in the danger zone or the extreme danger zone.

161
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,309
And the implication here is if we've got temperatures in Fahrenheit below 80,

162
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:12,500
we don't have a heat risk, which is consistent with something I said a few slides ago.

163
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,859
So if we have relatively low temperatures between, say, 80 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit and relatively low humidity from,

164
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,280
say, 40 to 80%, you can see we're in the caution zone here.

165
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,639
It's something to keep an eye on, but not not immediately worried if we have slightly higher air temperatures from 90 to 96 degrees and again,

166
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,350
relatively low humidity from 40 to, say, 70%.

167
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:47,120
Then we're in this extreme caution zone. We want to keep a better eye on this if we are at much higher air temperatures from,

168
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,230
say, 98 to 106, even at relatively low humidity levels, we're going to be in danger.

169
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:02,840
And then again, if we have very high air temperatures, even with pretty low humidity on the order of 40%, we're still up in the extreme danger zone.

170
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,630
And just to define what those mean here,

171
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,350
so caution is light yellow means fatigue might be possible from heat with prolonged exposure, physical activity,

172
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:21,560
extreme caution is there is a possibility for heatstroke or heat cramps or heat exhaustion if you have prolonged exposure or physical activity,

173
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:29,420
danger is the danger is these things are no longer possible, but actually likely after prolonged exposure.

174
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,960
And then extreme danger is you are very likely or highly likely to get heatstroke if you're sort of

175
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,280
exerting yourself or doing physical activity in any of these red temperature and humidity combinations.

176
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,290
If that figure wasn't overwhelming enough. There's also an expanded heat index that I'll share with you.

177
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:58,299
Here again, this comes from the National Weather Service. And you can see this just essentially gives us somewhat more granular estimates.

178
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,240
It includes lower fractions of humidity down below 40% all the way to 5%.

179
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,720
And an expanded temperature range here all the way up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit.

180
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,960
I'll just make one final comment here, which is, of course,

181
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:23,740
many of these heat indices in the BGT were developed some time ago and have been relevant for sort of current climatic conditions.

182
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:31,390
But as Earth's climate shifts and warms, we're going to start to find more and more workers up in these higher categories,

183
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,799
as well as more and more community members up in these higher categories on the

184
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,200
heat index and at more and more risk of having heat related health effects.

185
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:47,111
So finally, let's compare the WB GTI to the heat index.

186
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:55,521
Both of these things are commonly used in the workplace heat index in the community and we need to consider how these things compare.

187
00:19:55,541 --> 00:20:01,781
So the table on the left shows us that BGT is measured in the sun, whereas the heat index is not.

188
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:08,561
Both of them use air temperature in relative humidity, but BGT also accounts for air movement in terms of wind speed,

189
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:13,151
and that accounts for cloud cover and sun angle through its measurements of radiant temperature.

190
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:22,811
So how do these two things compare? The two colorful graphs here are showing BGT temperature in the center here and heat index on

191
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:29,801
the right for an area around Oklahoma on a particular day and time that you can see listed here.

192
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,361
So I'll make a couple of broad comments here.

193
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:39,461
One is you can see some of the lowest temperatures, according to the BGT here, here in the upper right hand corner.

194
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:43,431
And the same is true here for the heat index. These are the lowest temperatures here.

195
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:53,921
On the other hand, for the highest temperatures here, the BGT would predict that they're over here around the Interstate 44 highway marker,

196
00:20:54,671 --> 00:21:05,081
whereas with the heat index, you can see the highest temperatures are here in the lower right corner of this geographic area around U.S. 71.

197
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:10,811
So these things generally agree, but they are definitely not in perfect agreement.

198
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:17,741
Just to reiterate, if we are doing occupational assessments, the heat is really what we want to be measuring.

199
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:23,381
The heat index is really only appropriate for estimating community exposures and even so,

200
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,481
we would always prefer to have BGT information compared to the heat index.
