1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,494
In this session, we'll be discussing samples and statistics for

2
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,662
genetic association studies.

3
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:12,479
Here, the learning objectives are to describe the sampling strategies for

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:17,220
different types of genetic association tests to identify the appropriate

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,697
statistical tests for genetic association studies.

6
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:23,162
And to describe how to code and

7
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:28,991
analyze genomic data under different assumed modes of inheritance.

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,905
So when we're thinking about sampling for our genetic studies,

9
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,880
we can think about a couple of different things.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,714
The most important thing really is are we going to choose a family based study or

11
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,960
a population based study?

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,038
So genetic studies have historically been conducted in families and

13
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:53,420
that means twin studies, heritability studies, and linkage studies.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,394
But genetic association studies can be conducted in families,

15
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:02,650
but are usually conducted in unrelated individuals.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,391
And these are more population based studies.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,848
We actually have the most power in genetic

18
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:14,411
association studies when we have a sample of unrelated individuals.

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,151
When you have a qualitative outcome,

20
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,680
you can also sample based on the status of the outcome.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,411
For example, in case control studies, where you sample of set of cases,

22
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,546
people who have the disease of interest, and a set of controls.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,382
The appropriate statistical tests for genetic association studies are determined

24
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:42,901
by the type of sampling and the type of outcome that we've just discussed.

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,753
Family based association tests are sort of a special group that have to account for

26
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:55,250
the correlation of the genetic data and the phenotype data within families.

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,401
So, if you're doing genetic association tests in families,

28
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:04,256
you need to use special regression techniques or a specific kind of test,

29
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:07,857
like the FBAT or the Family Based Association Test, or

30
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:12,610
related methods that specifically are targeted towards families.

31
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,305
We're going to talk here about genetic studies that are done

32
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,445
in independent populations of people.

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,010
We're gonna talk about statistical methods used in these population based studies.

34
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,180
And I don't really want you to know all the mathematical details about the test.

35
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,852
What I really want you to understand is knowing which tests are available and

36
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,620
when they are appropriate.

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,458
And I really want you to specifically focus on the tests that we do when we're

38
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,861
assuming different types of modes of inheritance for

39
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:53,491
the genetic factors, which we'll discuss near the end of the lecture.

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,702
So, the statistics for qualitative phenotypes are really meeting

41
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:06,629
the goal to compare genotype, allele or haplotype frequencies between people

42
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:12,660
who have the phenotype or the disease of interest and those who don't.

43
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,428
And so if we find a difference in allele frequencies or genotype frequencies

44
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:22,567
between cases and controls, that implies that there's some kind of correlation

45
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:27,860
between the genetic polymorphism that we measured in the phenotype of interest.

46
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,965
So for example, these are people who carry some certain allele in yellow and

47
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:37,828
people who don't carry the allele are in red, and here you can see that if

48
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:42,740
we look at controls, most of them do not carry that a little of interest.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,035
But when we look look at patients who have diabetes, a lot more of them do.

50
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:52,578
And so, there would be a correlation between having the yellow allele and

51
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:56,023
being diabetes case and that's what we're looking for

52
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,308
when we have qualitative outcomes.

53
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,185
Some of the statistical tests for

54
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,350
qualitative outcomes can be thought of as follows.

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,890
So, let's say that you have an observed sample here.

56
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,822
You've got your cases that have the disease controls that don't and

57
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:18,226
here are the number of people that have each of the three genotype sat some snip

58
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:22,931
of interest, and you've got your totals on the right hand side and at the bottom.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,233
What we can do is we can look at, for example,

60
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,040
the genotype frequencies in cases versus controls.

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,604
And so for cases, what's the frequency of cases that have

62
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:38,790
the AA genotype at the snip of interest?

63
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, there are 601 cases with the AA genotype in 896 cases total.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,840
So the frequency of the AA genotype in the cases is 0.67.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,111
And the frequency in the controls the 0.69.

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,944
If we look at the less frequent genotype group here CC,

67
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:04,591
in cases the frequency is 0.07 and in controls its 0.04.

68
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:09,500
So 7% of cases and 4% of controls have the CC genotype.

69
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,328
And, so this suggests maybe a small difference in the genotype

70
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,950
frequencies between cases and controls.

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,854
And we can test whether this difference is significant formally

72
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:25,941
using statistical tests that evaluate the probability of getting

73
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:30,932
a difference this large based on chance alone, or if it looks like

74
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:36,240
the people with the CC genotype actually are more likely to be a case.

75
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,593
For quantitative or continuous outcomes,

76
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:46,125
there's a different set of statistical tests that we can use.

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,705
For quantitative traits,

78
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:51,827
oftentimes the goal is really to compare the mean values of the trait for

79
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:56,680
each of the genotype groups or for each allele or for each haplotype group.

80
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,407
So here in this example, we've actually got an enzyme

81
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:06,090
that is called human red cell acid phosphatase.

82
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,870
And we're looking at the enzyme activity for this particular protein.

83
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,837
So, the enzyme actually has three different alleles, A, B and C,

84
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:21,170
and they have different rates of enzymatic activity.

85
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:26,671
And so, if you've got three alleles for this particular enzyme and

86
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:30,820
each person has two copies of the gene of interest,

87
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,838
then you have people who are AA homozygote, BB homozygotes,

88
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:40,399
potentially CC homozygotes or that are heterozygous.

89
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,210
This person is AB, this person is AC.

90
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,350
For example, this group of people is BC.

91
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:54,556
So what you wanna do, is look at the average value of the enzyme activity for

92
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:59,310
all of your different genotype groups and compare them.

93
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,211
So for example, this distribution here is the enzyme activity in the full sample.

94
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:09,892
It looks kind of like a normal distribution and

95
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:15,370
the mean is about 163, something like that.

96
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,299
But then if you look at these different genotype classes,

97
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,770
you can see that the means are really different.

98
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:28,281
So the AA genotype mean is about 120, the BB genotype mean is about 190.

99
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,520
And that's a pretty big difference here.

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,402
And you can see that actually, what's kind of interesting is that each of the normal

101
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:40,218
distributions of these genotype groups, actually, when you put them together,

102
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:44,552
it looks like the whole population has a normal distribution of this enzyme

103
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:45,280
activity.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,890
But actually the genotype very strongly influences the trait value.

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,951
And so for example, what we might want to do is compare the mean value for

106
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,521
one group versus another.

107
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,843
And so, here you've got the mean for the people who have one copy of B and

108
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:08,240
one copy of the A allele, and we're comparing them to people who have two

109
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,946
copies of the B allele and we see how much this difference is.

110
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:16,831
And we look at the variability in the AB genotype group and BB genotype group and

111
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,792
do a statistical test to say is the mean value for

112
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:23,286
BA significantly different from the mean value for BB.

113
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:28,092
And you could do that for each of the different genotype groups.

114
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,777
One thing that's really important in genetics is to specify the mode of

115
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:39,452
inheritance because that will determine what kind of statistical modeling you're

116
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,250
going to do.

117
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,944
So, when you're testing for the genetic associations,

118
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:50,020
a mode of inheritance can be assumed and modeled or not.

119
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,290
So one thing you can do is is doing allele based test.

120
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,451
This doesn't assume any particular mode of inheritance.

121
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,223
And when I talk about motive inheritance,

122
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:04,470
I'm talking about dominant recessive, co-dominant.

123
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,349
The allele based test is just looking at the number of alleles in each of

124
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,460
the groups and it does not assume a motive inheritance.

125
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,248
There's three different kinds of genotype based tests that do assume

126
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:20,721
a mode of inheritance and we'll talk about each of these in turn.

127
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,909
So allele based tests are going to look at the frequency of the big allele

128
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:30,974
to the small allele in each of your groups of interest and there,

129
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:34,780
as I said before, it does not assume a motive inheritance.

130
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,557
And, the risk of the heterozygote genotype doesn't have

131
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:44,450
to be in between the big A big A, or the small a small a group.

132
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,387
We don't make any assumptions about the risk of the big, A small a genotype class

133
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:54,060
because we're just looking at alleles, we're not looking at genotypes.

134
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,204
So, for example, here's our table of cases and controls and

135
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:00,607
the genotype data we got from them.

136
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,217
To do an allele based test,

137
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:06,850
we would actually just count up the number of each of the alleles in the groups.

138
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,936
So for cases, the number of big alleles is going to be 601

139
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:19,660
times two because each of these people have two copies of the A allele plus 235.

140
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,280
And so there's 1437 A alleles in the case group, and 355 C alleles in that group.

141
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,000
In controls, you have 1820 A alleles and 388 C alleles.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,040
And so you just do this 2x2 table.

143
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,814
And you could do, for example, a Chi-square test and actually, just

144
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:50,190
see whether these cells are distributed as you'd expect under chains alone.

145
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,784
I'm sorry, are distributed as you'd expect based under the allele

146
00:10:55,784 --> 00:11:00,720
frequencies alone and the proportion of cases to controls.

147
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,801
So this is similar to the way that we did it with testing hardy Weinberg.

148
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,420
It would just be a simple Chi-square test on this table.

149
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,675
And again, we're just looking for

150
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:13,680
differences in allele frequency between cases and controls.

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,736
We don't really care about how they're distributed into genotypes.

152
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,150
There are three different kinds of tests that look at genotype specifically.

153
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,230
So one is the genotype, the three genotype model.

154
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,718
And so here, we're not going to assume a genetic mode of inheritance,

155
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:39,310
but we are going to look at the genotype groups themselves.

156
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,170
So again, this is similar to the allele based test,

157
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,291
because we don't assume a genetic mode of inheritance.

158
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:50,104
And because the risk of the heterozygote doesn't have to have any

159
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:56,310
specific relationship to the big A big A or small a small a homozygotes.

160
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,630
What we're gonna do is look at each of these three genotype separately.

161
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,826
So for qualitative outcomes,

162
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:07,160
we're gonna classify the outcome in the genotype status in a 2x3 table.

163
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,680
And just go ahead and apply that Chi-square test statistic again.

164
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,256
And or we can do logistic regression.

165
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:18,601
For quantitative phenotypes, we can use T-test to compare all of the combinations

166
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:23,731
of the genotype specific means like I showed you for that quantitative outcome.

167
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:28,857
So, looking at the mean of the big A big A versus the big A small a group for

168
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:29,650
example.

169
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,361
Or you can use least squares linear regression where you have dummy

170
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:39,251
variables for big A small a, and a dummy variable for small a small a.

171
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:43,657
So you're allowing each of these genotype groups to vary

172
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,331
independently of the other ones.

173
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,690
The next mode of inheritance is the dominant or recessive model.

174
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,204
And so, in this model we're gonna test for genetic association,

175
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:02,873
assuming a dominant recessive relationship.

176
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:07,032
And this is really powerful if the model that you're assuming is true but

177
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,920
it's often difficult to know that ahead of time.

178
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,398
And so the dominant recessive test is going to either test

179
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:18,504
that your big A big A and your heterozygote genotypes

180
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:22,815
have the same effect on the mean versus small a small a.

181
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:29,930
So in this case it takes two copies of the small a allele in order to see an effect.

182
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,151
So this is what we would call a recessive model.

183
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,510
So small a small is recessive.

184
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,782
And you only see the effect on the phenotype if you have two copies of

185
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:39,410
small a.

186
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,178
Or, you could also group the heterozygote class in with small a small a and

187
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:49,179
in this case the small a allele would be dominant and

188
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:53,739
the big A allele would be recessive, because here you have

189
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:58,520
the same phenotype if you're heterozygous small a small a.

190
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,210
But you have a different phenotype if you're big a big a.

191
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,457
And so, what I'm trying to say about this test is that it assumes that

192
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:11,523
having a particular allele is dominant and having, you would need

193
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:16,700
two copies of the other allele in order for the phenotype to be true.

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,340
And so you can combine these genotype frequencies using a 2x2 table.

195
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,950
And this could be a Chi-square or logistic regression again.

196
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,906
And for quantitative phenotype,

197
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:34,510
you can compare the mean values after combining the genotype classes together.

198
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,131
So the mean value of big A big A plus big A small e compared to

199
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,838
the mean value of small a small a.

200
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,949
And you could use a single T-test to look at the mean values or

201
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,091
you could look using linear regression.

202
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,194
And finally an additive model is looking for association between the genotype and

203
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:54,030
the outcome.

204
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,770
But it's assuming that that heterozygote or big A small a genotype has

205
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,100
the intermediate risk compared to the big A big A and small a small a genotypes.

206
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,170
And so this is what we think of as a dose response.

207
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,808
So here you've got the genotype score where you have 01 or

208
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:15,811
two copies of some particular allele of interest.

209
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:20,291
So this is the, let's say big A big A homozygote,

210
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:24,370
heterozygote, small a small a homozygote.

211
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,860
And we're looking at here the proportion of cases out of the total sample.

212
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,622
And so it looks like people with no copies of some particular

213
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:39,790
allele are more likely to be a case than people with less copies.

214
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,860
And people with one copy tend to be in the middle.

215
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,524
And so this is we really use this genotype score 01 or

216
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:54,081
two copies to be The dose of some particular allele.

217
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:57,574
Do you have a dose of zero a dose of one or a dose of two for

218
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:59,305
some a level of interest.

219
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:04,136
And we try to draw a linear regression line to show the relationship

220
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:09,666
the linear relationship between that dose of and some outcome of interest.

221
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:14,615
And so in this case it would be a logistic regression.

222
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,675
The probability of being a case.

223
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:23,541
So for qualitative phenotype you can do a chi square or logistic regression here.

224
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,020
Sorry the chi square trend test or a logistic regression.

225
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,821
And for quantitative phenotype.

226
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,770
So you can use linear regression.

227
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,975
But the important thing is that you assume this relationship that the hetero

228
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:40,461
zygote is halfway in between each of the homo zygote trait means.

229
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,451
And so let's look at the results for the additive model for quantitative trait.

230
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,961
So for example here's some snip of interest.

231
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,401
You've got your genotype here.

232
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,721
C C C.

233
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,471
G. Or G.

234
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,386
G.

235
00:16:54,386 --> 00:17:00,740
You could also code that genotype as 01201 or two copies of G.

236
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,351
Right?

237
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,080
So let's say we're looking at systolic blood pressure and millimeters of mercury.

238
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,501
This is low, this is high here.

239
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:13,021
Our box plots for some specific sample for people who had the C.

240
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:13,580
C C.

241
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,151
G. Or G.

242
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:15,480
G genotype.

243
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,889
And what you can see is that the median value on the box plots is actually

244
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,410
increasing slightly.

245
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,988
And so you could do it.

246
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:27,070
A test of the mean values and

247
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,640
hear each person is indicated by dot.

248
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,785
You can actually draw a linear regression line across these three mean values and

249
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,471
get the coefficient.

250
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:41,551
The beta coefficient for this regression line.

251
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:47,691
So the beta coefficient here is 1.25 which means each additional copy of the G.

252
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,510
L. E. L.

253
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:55,013
Increases your systolic blood pressure by an average of 1.25 millimeters of mercury

254
00:17:55,013 --> 00:18:00,734
we can also look at the standard error on estimating that beta coefficient,

255
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:05,501
and we can do a test of statistical significance using the beta and

256
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,402
standard error to determine whether the slope here,

257
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:14,604
this increase in blood pressure with each additional copy of the allele

258
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:19,530
is more steep than what we would expect based on chance alone.

259
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,481
And, you know, just incidentally, because the standard error here is so

260
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:27,321
big, this slope is not significant.
