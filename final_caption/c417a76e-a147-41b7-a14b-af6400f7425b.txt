1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,330
We started, he said, okay, we go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:21,990
Thanks for being here. Last class session. Any questions or problems with uploading the assignments you'll get about getting them done on time?

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,329
Let me know if there's any issues. No more office hours.

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,620
But if you want to set up a meeting, let me know if you run into any problems.

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,490
I'm happy to set up a zoom call or a meeting in my office if I'm around, but probably isn't going to be more convenient for most situations.

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,709
But so. Before I start. Does anyone? Does it sound like there's any issues?

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,800
So go ahead and let me know if something pops up, though I predict that we may get a little bit early.

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,780
We'll see how it goes depending on, you know, if we get into some conversations.

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,050
We've been having some really good conversations the last few sessions, so that's totally fine.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,100
But don't have like a ton of slides this time, so we'll just kind of dive into it.

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,360
I think this is where we left off. We were talking about a lot of the lecture last time I was talking about like these

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,790
gaps and these challenges in accessing chemicals in different contexts for safety.

13
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,680
And we left off talking about drug development and how there's like a high percentage

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,690
of projects like drug development projects that closed because of safety issues.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,790
And so in addition to pesticides and like other environmental, you know, chemicals that are used in manufacturing that end up in the environment,

16
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,690
we also have like the drug development pipeline and understanding toxicology with potential new therapeutic drug products.

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,060
So hopefully this gives you the sense of like the scale of the challenges that

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,580
we're facing as toxicologists and in overall the assessment of chemical safety.

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,499
And so the rest of this talk is going to basically be about how we're thinking about addressing those

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,410
challenges and the new sort of methods that we can bring to bear to address some of these issues.

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:24,420
And like, for example, with preclinical safety testing, like, you know, our main goal is to limit and manage risk to the human volunteers or patients.

22
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,089
And the question there is like, how well are we doing that?

23
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,600
And how well are our current approaches allowing us to do that, to limit that risk and manage the risk?

24
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,049
This is an interesting article that looked at the use of dogs in predicting human toxicology and drug safety.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,370
So we use dogs for predicting drug safety in certain contexts.

26
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:56,609
And the authors of this article, basically the main point is here the resulting likelihood ratios show that the absence of toxicity

27
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,550
in dogs provides virtually no evidence that adverse drug reactions will also be absent in humans.

28
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,550
So just because it's safe in a dog that doesn't predict that it can be safe in humans very well.

29
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:18,629
They do mention that there is the that the presence of toxic effects in dogs can provide evidence for potential adverse responses in humans.

30
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,670
So if there's a toxic effect in a dog, that's a little bit better at predicting that there's going to be a problem when it goes to a human.

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,490
But ideally, what we'd like to be moving towards, you know, no one, you know, in general, we want to be using less animals.

32
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,190
And so we'd like to be able to understand and get a better a better get better at

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,440
predicting safety based on if we see safety in whatever modeling and talking about human,

34
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,730
in vitro, whatever that that's going to predict safety in a human right.

35
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,260
So that's, you know, another sort of so we have this like lack of concordance, as I say,

36
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,980
at the top of the slide here between some of our models and how well they're predicting the safety of chemicals.

37
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:08,190
Right. And I wanted to just sort of call your attention to this journal that the study was published in.

38
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,890
It's called Alternatives to Laboratory Animals. If you're interested in toxicology, like as a field,

39
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,470
this is a whole journal that's dedicated to helping to develop alternate methods of basically conducting toxicology tests without the use of animals.

40
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,010
And there's a number of reasons for that, you know, based on like ethical considerations, cost considerations, etc.

41
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,629
I wanted to point out this journal because I've read some really good articles in here because of the nature of the journal,

42
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,710
it's geared towards like forward thinking and toxicology.

43
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,700
Like, like I've read a lot of good articles, like not even necessarily in the,

44
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,950
in the field or in the domain of like wanting to find alternatives to testing per say.

45
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,220
But just how do we incorporate all of this toxicology data in the most meaningful way?

46
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,270
And so if we're doing that to the best of our ability, we're going to gain a greater, better understanding of the biology.

47
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,300
And overall, the idea would be that we'd be using less animals in order to conduct these toxicology tests.

48
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,270
So you could see some really like cutting edge ideas, if not technique and techniques as well.

49
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,180
There's a lot of wildlife science that's talked about in this journal,

50
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,169
but also just like reviews are like kind of scoping out the field of toxicology because you have to necessarily

51
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,030
be sort of like forward thinking when you're thinking of like alternatives to our current practices.

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,389
Does that make sense? So if you're interested in toxicology as a field, I'd scan this this journal every once in a while.

53
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,140
Just see kind of what the latest stuff people are talking about is. It's pretty cool.

54
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,260
It's a little bit of a side note, but so the idea, you know,

55
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,240
is how do we close the gap in predicting safety in environmental health and in drug development?

56
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,730
And we talked about this a good amount already, but it probably bears just diving into it one more time.

57
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,350
We have limitations on our current risk assessment methods and toxicology.

58
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,909
So again, we're dependent on animals as surrogates of exposure effects in humans that we know.

59
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,969
We've talked quite a bit about the sort of limitations to that these in vivo bio assays,

60
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,209
as we also call them, animal studies of our time consuming limited in terms of assessing the outcome,

61
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:30,130
as we just talked about with that the dog situation limited in assessing the outcome they were designed to predict in addition.

62
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,910
So if we're doing like a bio assay for a chemical causing a liver cancer and we're just going to be like sort of focused on that outcome,

63
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,980
it sort of limits our ability to not discover potentially like new mechanisms of toxicity.

64
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,600
So there's not that discovery angle as much in our current approach.

65
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:56,489
So it's sort of another limitation. All of this kind of adds up to because of the cost of the time,

66
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,270
we have just kind of like overall a low testing capacity based on compared to

67
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,110
what we're trying to do in terms of assessing the safety of all these chemicals.

68
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,100
So again, you know, you see this kind of bearing out like 92% of new drugs fail in clinical trials.

69
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,070
Registering a new pesticide requires the use of like 10,000 new animals, millions of dollars years of time.

70
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,970
And then you also have like consumer concern over animal testing, especially for cosmetics and consumer products.

71
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,810
So, you know, you have these ethical considerations as well. You know, I work with animals in my lab.

72
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't sometimes it has to be done for like the experimental question we're asking, but it's not my favorite thing to do.

73
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:42,690
I'd much rather use like cell lines and some of our other models that we can and other approaches we can use.

74
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,970
But sometimes there is no current substitute for certain aspects of biology.

75
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,250
So all of this, you know, this has been quite a few years now.

76
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:04,069
Sort of inspired the National Academy of Sciences to look at this and publish this document or this report, toxicity testing in the 21st century.

77
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:13,460
And this really spurred a ton and spurred like a ton of thought and a ton of reevaluation of how we're doing toxicology since its publication.

78
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,669
I started grad school shortly after, you know, a couple of years after this was published.

79
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:27,560
And in many of the many of the papers that I read throughout grad school were like colored by or in some way like referred to this study.

80
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,769
So the idea is like we want to drive towards a new generation of risk assessment,

81
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:41,480
develop new approaches and move away from what we sometimes call apical endpoints identified in vivo or in human population studies.

82
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:51,180
Does anyone know what I might mean by ethical and endpoints? Any guesses?

83
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,670
So that's basically like the ultimate endpoint, the ultimate adverse health outcome.

84
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,620
So like if we think a chemical is a carcinogen,

85
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:10,770
difficult endpoints going to be like development of a liver tumor or lethality mortality, if you know, that's that's typical.

86
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,359
So it's not it's not one of these like biochemical like markers we can measure that, predict some kind of health outcome.

87
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,680
It's the health outcome itself.

88
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:30,420
So we want to move away from just assessing values to understanding basically what goes into what predicts that apical endpoint.

89
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,830
So the idea is like move towards using the toxicity pathways.

90
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,700
At the cellular and molecular level, because we know and we've talked about it and gone through many examples throughout this class

91
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,360
that there are cellular and molecular effects that precede and lead to these health outcomes.

92
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:58,530
And so if we can understand those better, we can then predict these toxic outcomes and health effects better make sense.

93
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,430
And the overall goal and goal would be to move toxicity testing towards an evidence

94
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,720
based framework based on understanding the biology of this toxic and disease.

95
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,959
You're not just giving an animal in this in this scenario, you would you're moving away from like, oh,

96
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm just going to give mice arsenic and then measure how many of them develop again, liver tumors.

97
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:31,300
Right. You're going to understand each of the each of the molecular and cellular events that cause that link arsenic to liver tumors.

98
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,940
Which like historically a lot of regulatory, you know, in a lot of like risk assessments were done in that sort of way,

99
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,530
like, oh, this chemical is it causes cancer, so we're going to regulate it in such and such a manner.

100
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,270
This is going to help us understand the actual underlying biology better.

101
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:59,830
And so this idea is like we want to move towards in Silico or like, you know, computational or in vitro replacement of animal methods.

102
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,840
So like here we're like relatively like, well, I guess we're here, you know, in 2022.

103
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,750
But you know, in general, the idea is like right now, a lot of what we're doing, whether it's EPA or FDA,

104
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,210
a lot of what we're doing is animal data, plus some in silico or in vitro methods.

105
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,310
A lot of it's rooted in animal data.

106
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,860
We want to move this so that we're moving more up the scale towards, you know, the other basically extreme or not extreme,

107
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:34,540
but the other end of things towards uh, solely using in silico in vitro approaches and like moving steadily.

108
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,089
We know it's not going to happen overnight. Like we're talking about a decade scale of potentially moving towards this.

109
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,860
So the idea would be like we'd be replacing for a lot of purposes these animal

110
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,749
data with like in Silico or in vitro data and even at like a decades long scale,

111
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:58,030
we're talking 20 years from now. That's a pretty aggressive, ambitious approach and we'll see how we do.

112
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,470
And the idea again here is like as we're moving this way, we're going from an observational type of approach.

113
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,709
Again, like if you think of the example of like counting the number of tumors in an animal

114
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,350
study versus a mechanistic understanding using these in vitro in silico methods.

115
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:26,080
So the molecular mechanism underpinning this cancer effect or endocrine disrupting effect of a chemical.

116
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,240
Makes sense. And you'll see this like in Salt Lake.

117
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,500
You know, this is going to be different by region in terms of like how it's applied in a risk assessment context.

118
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,760
Like in Europe, they use in silico in vitro only.

119
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,910
Already for some purposes like personal care products.

120
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,770
So this is not something where it's just sort of a pipe dream like you're seeing it actually applied in real life right now.

121
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,850
So, you know, it's a it's a it's a noble goal to be working towards.

122
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:11,430
So just a few sort of, you know, terms and things you might see as you like go through the literature when people are talking about this like tax 21,

123
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,850
this tax 21st century approach, you may talk about, you know, understanding toxicity pathways,

124
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:23,550
meaning what are the key biological pathways whose perturbations result in toxicity.

125
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,800
So we talked about how, um, an anti-androgen might suppress the levels of testosterone in an organism.

126
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:40,060
So the organism organisms not able to synthesize testosterone, which is going to potentially impact male reproductive endpoints.

127
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:48,450
And so and which I showed you, if you go back to the repro developmental slides there is like the steroid biosynthesis pathway.

128
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,370
It's a molecular pathway catalyzed by a series of enzymes. And so the better we understand that, the better we might be able to predict, you know,

129
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,160
a chemical that might cause similar effects to what we see with like, say, phthalates or something.

130
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,930
So is the other. Another point to think about is like multiple pathways.

131
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:15,060
What happens if we're altering multiple pathways in the body? And what can be expected if we're perturbing like multiple, multiple pathways?

132
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,430
What does that mean in terms of the apical point?

133
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:27,780
So again, going back to phthalates, they're endocrine disruptors, but they also how can like stimulate inflammatory responses in certain contexts?

134
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,910
So what happens when you're perturbing both of those in a broad sense?

135
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,630
Endocrine pathways and inflammation pathways at once.

136
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:46,560
And so this is like, again, just towards the idea of like understanding the mechanisms that underpin toxicity in a better way,

137
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,450
adversity like what adverse effects are linked to specific toxicity, pathway perturbations.

138
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,050
We want to link these to actual health outcomes. What patterns and magnitudes of perturbations are predictive of adverse health outcomes.

139
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,139
So there could be a case where you're treating cells with a really low dose of a

140
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,900
toxic chemical that causes some kind of like real brief like uptake in an enzyme,

141
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,680
for example. But it actually doesn't really predict what happens to the cells.

142
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,729
The cells actually kind of just like go back to normal as they metabolize the chemical.

143
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:25,430
So you want to understand where those thresholds where you're getting like an adverse response are in a better way because cells can adapt,

144
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,700
animals can adapt. Like our bodies are kind of made to adapt to different changes in our environment.

145
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,050
And so just any exposure isn't going to be detrimental to our health, right?

146
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,210
So we want to understand where those thresholds are and sort of understanding again,

147
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,450
the idea of being like there is an adverse outcomes that we're interested in here.

148
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:54,070
Life stages is another one. How can perturbations of toxicity pathways associated with developmental timing or aging be captured in vitro?

149
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,340
So we've talked about how over the course of a life you go through many biological changes from,

150
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,120
you know, the fetal stage to the neonatal stage to the adult stage.

151
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,750
How do we model that in a dish?

152
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,390
That's a real challenge. And there's a lot of people doing interesting work in that space as well.

153
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:24,810
The effects of exposure, duration, a lot of toxicity studies like say in cells are kind of designed to be to go for like 24 hours.

154
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,500
You know, you treat the cells and then look at the events, the effects, 24 or 48 hours later.

155
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,340
You know, I've I've personally done a little bit of work, you know, taking exposures out a little bit longer.

156
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,379
What happens in 24 hours?

157
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:47,810
What happens then at five days of exposure in order to understand the dynamics, not only the developmental dynamics in terms of developmental biology,

158
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:55,220
but then the dynamics of how the body responds over a chronic exposure versus a surprise exposure versus an acute exposure.

159
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,610
Low doses. We're seeing a lot of a lot of interest in like low dose response and understanding what happens

160
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:10,580
biologically at much more like relevant levels of toxicants than we've seen kind of historically used.

161
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,260
Yeah. And then human variability.

162
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,630
We know that there's a lot of genetic variability in the human population.

163
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,370
How do people differ in their expression of toxicity pathway constituents,

164
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:30,239
in their predisposition to disease and impairment based on like some kind of exposure to a toxic?

165
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,600
It all makes sense. This is just like, you know,

166
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,800
there's this what we want to do and what we understand and then there's how we model it in the lab is this like continued?

167
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:51,340
And again, you have lots of publications pushing forward new ways of like modeling this either in vitro or computationally, etc.

168
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:03,700
So this idea of toxicity pathways, is it like it didn't come out with this 27 report that says it wasn't the first time anyone had talked about it?

169
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,470
We had been talking about toxicology pathways as early as like the eighties and nineties.

170
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:16,180
Back then we referred to a mode of action or MLA approach to understanding the effects of chemicals.

171
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,750
So a mode of action is a biologically plausible sequence of key events,

172
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,430
leading to an observed effect supported by robust observations and mechanistic data.

173
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:33,520
A mode of action describes key psychological or cellular and biochemical events that are both measurable and necessary to the observed effect.

174
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,340
Like the logical framework. So very similar in a lot of ways.

175
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,020
We'll talk a little bit about the differences between this approach,

176
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:46,490
this kind of definition and some of the more later concepts that have been coming out.

177
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:54,120
But again, the mode of action. You'll still hear people talk about mode of action or maybe mechanism of action sometimes when we're

178
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,620
talking about toxicology and this is an example of a mode of action proposed for benzo retiring,

179
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,870
which is a chemical we've talked about a few times.

180
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,179
And it really just it's kind of just logically going through the steps that lead to an adverse health outcome.

181
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:17,310
So in this case, the exposure would be to the chemical benzo appearing and then the adverse outcome would be like the formation of a neoplasm,

182
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,770
you know, ostensibly continue that would be contributing to like of cancer carcinogenesis.

183
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:31,520
And so we know that. So you're just kind of tracking the key events in this mode of action for Pennzoil prior to the carcinogenicity.

184
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:40,070
So we know Pennzoil firing is metabolized to multiple metabolites in the body and they're going through the main, the three main metabolites here.

185
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,130
And we see that all of these form DNA attacks that bind to DNA basically disrupt the structure of DNA.

186
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:59,419
One of them causes oxidative damage to the DNA, causing like mutations in key genes involved in cancer biology, leading to, in this case,

187
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:06,740
the proliferation of initiated cells that remember, one of the hallmarks of cancer was that the cells are proliferating, kind of, apparently.

188
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:16,720
In addition, they're tracking this other phenomenon where Pennzoil pylon binds to this receptor, the air receptor, which we talked about,

189
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,860
which leads to its onset of like gene expression changes with genes related to metabolism and growth and differentiation.

190
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,880
And then this guy, this metabolite is causing like cytotoxicity and inflammatory response.

191
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,010
All of this like so you can see like you're really if you go back to the cancer lectures, this is really tracking.

192
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,860
You're like hitting ticking the boxes of what the hallmarks of cancer, causing inflammation,

193
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,440
causing damage to the DNA, disrupting cellular growth and differentiation, etc.

194
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,980
So you're really kind of like tracking it all out. So pretty important to do.

195
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,010
More recently, I want to say around 2010 or so,

196
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:11,250
that this idea of like the adverse outcome pathway started to be brought into at least into my world of like mechanistic toxicology.

197
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,330
So it's kind of similar to the MLA approach.

198
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,870
The only thing that's different is these what we call adverse outcome pathway or APIs are different in that they're

199
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:31,500
chemically agnostic and they describe what any chemical that causes a certain molecular initiating event is likely to do.

200
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,250
So you're tracking the it doesn't matter what the outcome. The one the example I showed before was specific depends on a high rate,

201
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:45,620
but this is really understanding from this molecular initiating event, so binding to the HRR receptor.

202
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,310
How does that essentially contribute to some kind of adverse outcome?

203
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,939
The idea here is you have your molecular your initial molecular interaction and then you're

204
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,129
going to follow through what this molecular interaction does in terms of effects at a level of,

205
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,440
say, a cellular organelle, the mitochondria, for example, or the cells,

206
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,380
you have like a number of steps that eventually presumably are going to manifest at some kind of Oregon effect,

207
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,950
some impact on the liver, some impact on the brain.

208
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:27,450
And then, you know, you'll see your individual effects here, which would be something like disrupted neural development or again,

209
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,140
in terms of like higher risk for the correct organism or hyperspace is in the male reproductive space.

210
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,370
And then you could even take this in terms into an eco toxicology context, where if we see effects of the individual organism level,

211
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,680
that happens in a wide enough area, what's it going to mean for the full population, say, of us?

212
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,160
We're talking about a lake, the population of fish in that lake.

213
00:22:50,880 --> 00:23:00,210
This this concept was actually pulled from the ecology approaches initially and then applied to more mechanistic toxicology.

214
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,090
So. Makes sense. We'll talk through a couple examples.

215
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:15,579
But then there's actually this like AOP wiki where they've like defined certain APIs that you can go look into if you want to interested in.

216
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,440
And there's a lot of areas where people can contribute like new information as well because we by no means mapped out all of the Aoki's at this point.

217
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,810
Yeah. So please help us understand how chemicals cause adverse outcomes.

218
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,490
Integrate and understand complex data and prioritize resources.

219
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,870
So you can imagine how you could maybe approach this by, you know,

220
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,689
taking things to like a pretty high level in terms of like throughput of screening a bunch of chemicals.

221
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:53,190
So if you can develop some kind of test that you can conduct and there's some pretty sophisticated in-vitro tests where you can test,

222
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,810
you know, thousands of chemicals at thousands of doses in a relatively short amount of time.

223
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:05,340
And we're going to test, you know, all of these chemicals for like this molecular initiating event of binding to the estrogen receptor, for example.

224
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:11,910
And so kind of being more efficient. And what we're looking at and how we're sort of characterizing these chemicals is, you know,

225
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,900
that's sort of what AOP inspired is meant to do to sort of inspiring a lot of us to do.

226
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,710
Um, yeah. So again, you're just going as like molecular interactions organelle cellular or again, individual effects in the population effects.

227
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,850
And this is where this is where going from individual to population.

228
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,130
That's where you're going to have to take into account things like differential susceptibility,

229
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,850
because this individual is not the same as all of these people.

230
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,880
So that's where you have to start to bring in what we know about genetic variability, polymorphisms, etc.

231
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,850
So if you dive into the adverse outcome pathway literature,

232
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,960
some of the terms you'll come across will be like, am I e or molecular a molecular initiating event?

233
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:07,300
That's the initial point of interaction at a molecular level. By nature, except for probably the easiest example, there are two or key events.

234
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,350
So these are like the key events you're going to track each of these key events

235
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:16,230
that are important for understanding this LP and then the key event relationships.

236
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,890
So these are like these. The in between.

237
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:28,420
So what what about this event leads to this event? And so you want to be able to basically document that scientifically based on experimental data.

238
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,430
And then your adverse outcome here at the end is an outcome that's generally accepted to be of regulatory significance.

239
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,030
So the regulators not as interested in all of these steps as you could imagine.

240
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:51,070
They want to know if a chemical is a hazard or presents a risk for baby or health outcome.

241
00:25:51,280 --> 00:26:00,130
They don't necessarily care if it causes an increase in a particular enzyme, if that enzyme has no bearing on some kind of adverse health outcome.

242
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:10,960
So this is really where the rubber hits the road in terms of, you know, does help and this would be your apical end point as well.

243
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,680
And so that's how we can start to think about. You know, the research said, you know, we some of us do that.

244
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,159
I know I do. In my lab work, we're working with cells or, you know,

245
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:32,110
at the molecular level of how that might feed into ultimately like a risk assessment through this context, this like framework.

246
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,920
That all makes sense. Yeah.

247
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,930
It's like this method of methodological framework to understand chemical effects on health.

248
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,770
It's kind of, you know, some of these slides are really just restating the same thing, but.

249
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,150
So, again, just some examples of molecular interactions.

250
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:57,069
You could have a chemical causing some type of reaction with a receptor or like binding to a protein.

251
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,280
For example, at the organelle or cellular level,

252
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,190
you might be looking at say like gene activation causing oxidative stress in the cell for activating immune cells.

253
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,159
And these are the types of things that we can tackle with like high throughput screens subtypes,

254
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:22,360
because these are phenomena that we can model in like a multi well plate like, you know, oftentimes fairly well and then you're looking so these,

255
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:30,280
you know, ostensibly you're going to need to affect at the Oregon level so disrupted proliferation or disrupted homeostasis of the kidney,

256
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:40,719
for example, in the liver, some type of altered function. You know, we talked about various impacts like on the kidney or the liver that, you know,

257
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,350
what might maybe manifest at this level and then individual effects, altered reproduction, some kind of disease, maybe even lethality.

258
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:54,340
And then at the population effect level, this is where we're getting into where like regulators could take these APIs and,

259
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,360
you know, start to do something with them. Yeah.

260
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,429
And that again like has there been put aside is are kind of relevant here when we're looking at Oregon effects,

261
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,200
there's a lot of work being done in the field. Have you ever heard of like micro physiological systems?

262
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,350
So this is where you're trying to model like a whole organ or maybe a set of organs in vitro.

263
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,330
There's some really sophisticated,

264
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:26,430
interesting systems that people have come up with where you're even like doing like a flow through like kind of kind of modeling,

265
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,800
like the flow of blood for like kidney.

266
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:37,229
You'll hear organ on a chip sometimes like a kidney on a chip or like a small in vitro representation of a kidney using like a cell,

267
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,010
a bunch of different cells to approximate a kidney, the like flow into the kidney and then flow into like the next organ system.

268
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,240
And there's some really specific sophisticated stuff people can get into.

269
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,910
So that's kind of at the Oregon level or or even individual level.

270
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,150
And then you can see different types here don't necessarily have to go through all of these computational modeling really.

271
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:07,560
You could potentially tackle any in any part of the setup given the right computational tools.

272
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,830
So this is how our different models and methods sort of can be applied to this framework.

273
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,890
Here's an example. So if we activate a receptor called P part alpha.

274
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,350
Once that's activated in leading cells, which are the cells in the testes that produce testosterone,

275
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,570
that can cause decreased enzymes involved in cholesterol transport.

276
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,670
We know that cholesterol, if you go back to a reproduction, is the precursor for testosterone.

277
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,320
So cholesterol can't be transported efficiently within the cell.

278
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,450
That's going to cause a reduction in testosterone synthesis and leaving cells at the testes level.

279
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,590
Reduction in testes. Testosterone. We're right there to inverse health outcomes.

280
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,410
Right. You're going to have malformations of the male reproductive tract.

281
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,720
Hyperspace is CryptoKitties and you don't go through the list that we talked about in that lecture.

282
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,340
And all of that is going to affect male fertility potentially.

283
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,590
Right. So right there, you know,

284
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:17,760
pretty well characterized set of events that link disrupt link a receptor to an organ level effect or an organism level effect.

285
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,540
This is what you applied to fish. So it's like estrogen receptor antagonism.

286
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,780
So binding and blocking the estrogen receptor. And you see various effects here like in the liver cells.

287
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,079
You don't necessarily maybe need to walk through all of these.

288
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,040
But again, you know, culminating in decreased spawning and declining population trajectory in fish.

289
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,050
Right. So you could apply it in an eco toxicology context or a human health context.

290
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,180
Yeah. So AOP development is open source and uncertainty can be discussed in models.

291
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:04,389
So these effects like like, you know, there's maybe a lot that's like not necessarily captured on these which is like what's the threshold of a fact?

292
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,170
Like how much of a reduction in testosterone levels.

293
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,340
And, you know, we can look into the experimental data to determine this,

294
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,070
but like how much of a reduction in testosterone levels is going to lead to a male reproductive outcome?

295
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,020
And how certain are we of each of the like links within this chain of events?

296
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:28,910
Because we may be more certain in some cases and less certain in others. There's always that uncertainty in science, right?

297
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,750
You can walk through this real quick.

298
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:45,559
So this is just an example of an AOP. Every molecular initiating event here with your adverse outcome here and a bunch of events at the bottom here,

299
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,380
which one do you think would be the molecular initiating event if you looked across all of these at the bottom?

300
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:01,260
Just shout it out if you think you know. In addition, considering the industry's.

301
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,880
Uh. Yes, I agree. Inhibition of colon acetylcholinesterase.

302
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:15,960
That's like your initial molecular event. And then so the final outcome is going to be increased mortality.

303
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:23,840
So like a really severe effect. Right? So after we inhibit Acetylcholinesterase, what do you think the next step there is?

304
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:29,470
We know it's not increased mortality. He enjoys.

305
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,480
Accumulation of acetylcholine in the synopsis because we're not breaking down the acetylcholine.

306
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,860
And so we're going to get a set of choline. Accumulating.

307
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,660
And then the next one looks like we had it. So this is not this one.

308
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,270
Not this one. And it's not this one.

309
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:00,610
So do you think it's this or this? Which is closer to the ultimate.

310
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Increased Bronco construction. Yeah, I agree.

311
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:12,640
So you increase bronchial secretion of Bronco constriction and then that's going to lead to increased respiratory distress and arrest.

312
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,660
Know if that's bad enough, you're going to get increased mortality.

313
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:24,580
And so you could see how each of those steps links into the other one is basically necessary for the next event to occur.

314
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:35,440
So this is just a a figure, pretty kind of a busy figure.

315
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,610
But this is the idea of like integrating parser based approaches in risk assessment.

316
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,910
And you can kind of just maybe I'll just leave this to you to kind of walk through this,

317
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:51,700
but you'll see kind of like how we could formulate a sort of product formulation and scoping,

318
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:57,459
looking at like the, the context of looking at decision making options,

319
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:04,840
how that's linked to things like health determinants and interactions, characterization of risk and uncertainty.

320
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,170
And then eventually some level, you're going to have to make a risk based decision.

321
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,660
You know, given what we find, you know, doing the risk assessment, you see all the components of the risk assessment here.

322
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:20,170
Yeah. So this is just kind of like walking me through all of those risk assessment steps,

323
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,180
whether they be like at the level of the regulatory space or kind of done.

324
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,280
And what we've been mostly talking about in this class is the science of toxicology.

325
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,569
Change. Okay.

326
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,280
So I remember we talked about this before.

327
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:46,140
I mentioned how we need to identify and protect vulnerable and susceptible populations using toxicology and risk assessment.

328
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,870
And so just a couple of definitions. As EPA defines it,

329
00:34:52,130 --> 00:35:01,070
susceptible means differences in risk resulting from both variation and toxicity response like individuals being more sensitive and exposure.

330
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,440
This can be a result from like behavior, lifestyle factors. And then vulnerable.

331
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,790
When we say vulnerable,

332
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:17,560
differences in risk resulting from a combination of both intrinsic differences in susceptibility and extrinsic social stress factors,

333
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,010
and then in this case, we're talking about things like socioeconomic status,

334
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,530
exposure to like crime and violence, lack of community resources, access to health care, etc.

335
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,710
So you could define sort of like vulnerable populations as well as susceptible populations.

336
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,660
And we can talk about intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to susceptibility.

337
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,489
I think we've kind of maybe covered this a little bit, but we're talking about things like age and life, stage sex,

338
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:53,700
race and ethnicity or genetic polymorphisms trends that could be disease status, socioeconomic status, nutrition status, etc.

339
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,370
So just thinking about how there are certain sort of biological factors that may be contributing

340
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,859
to susceptibility and then also sort of where one is existing within the social fabric,

341
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:12,960
so to speak, in terms of, you know, making certain individuals more susceptible to environmental health impacts.

342
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,410
You know, intrinsic factors can be differences in like how we metabolize chemicals.

343
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,730
And those can be affected by age sex genetics.

344
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:34,720
It's a pretty interesting graph here showing differences in expression are differences in activity of certain classes of

345
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:43,840
metabolism enzymes from like the first three third trimester up through the first few years of life and then into adulthood.

346
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:50,560
So you can see early on this like this set of enzymes shown here, like these some of these steps.

347
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,950
Our expressions are not expressed at all.

348
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,840
And that starts to be expressed, you know, after birth and then continue to kind of increase and then later on kind of decrease.

349
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,120
And then some are like expressed pretty high prenatally and then drop off pretty quick.

350
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,170
So yeah, that's obviously something you really know. Then some are just constant across.

351
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:18,100
So this is like really challenging, especially for someone like myself as like reproductive developmental toxicologists,

352
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:25,300
like understanding the profile of metabolite metabolic enzyme activity at every stage.

353
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,450
It's like tricky question. You don't want to end up studying something and then you're like, Oh, I'm studying this like sip.

354
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,160
And it's like not even relevant for prenatal biology or something.

355
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:48,389
And then you're seeing a lot of the use of these like gene genome wide association studies where we where we can basically this is like data from,

356
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,380
I believe, Bangladesh, where there's a lot of arsenic contamination.

357
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:00,269
And so they're profiling like more than a thousand arsenic exposed individuals and basically looking at

358
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:07,590
whether any individual like genotypes were associated with higher levels of toxic arsenic metabolites.

359
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,880
We saw, for example, this one gene stood out as three empty, which is arsenic methyltransferase.

360
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:23,670
If we plug that into the arsenic metabolic pathway, you see there's a genotype here in which.

361
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:35,149
Essentially you get I'm forgetting if it's higher or lower activity of this enzyme, essentially you get altered activity of this enzyme.

362
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:41,780
I believe it's increased activity leads to an accumulation of certain toxic metabolites in the arsenic metabolic pathway.

363
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:50,149
Right. So. By assessing like the entire genome, we could pick up like new targets and new genes,

364
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,810
new genome types that might be marking like more susceptible individuals.

365
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,630
So we talked about some good examples of that, particularly with the pesticide lecture.

366
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:14,670
Again, this is just a different example with this anti-war one enzyme that again, helps in like metabolism and combat oxidative stress.

367
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,440
And we see that individuals with the CC genotype four and QOL one.

368
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:28,410
And this is predicting asthma across different levels of exposure to air pollution.

369
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:34,350
We see like increased prediction for asthma at higher levels of air pollution and with this phenotype,

370
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,960
whereas those with this other genotype seen plus the other,

371
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:45,300
you didn't really even see like much of an uptick in asthma with increasing levels of air pollution.

372
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,030
So pretty interesting stuff there. And there's many, many studies looking at these types of phenomena.

373
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,270
This is talking. So this is a map of hog farms in North Carolina.

374
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,820
And then we can compare that to some hog farms, as you may be familiar with,

375
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:12,309
are associated with certain environmental health, adverse environmental health effects.

376
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:19,660
In some cases, we see like drift of things off of these farms and, you know, these like big time,

377
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,970
like hog or like animal feeding operations, that sort of environmental concerns for a number of reasons.

378
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:34,750
So we see like the siting of these in North Carolina and then looking you can see how the siting of these like industrial scale farms overlaps

379
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:41,710
with the proportion of population in poverty and also the and as well the proportion of populations that are nonwhite in a given region.

380
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:49,210
So these. You can see how these factors like socio economic status,

381
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:58,720
things like geographic proximity to like sites of like environmental contamination or environmental concern, kind of overlap on top of each other.

382
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,660
These are the types of things, again, we're trying to bring in to our approach to environmental health and toxicology.

383
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,930
But it is a challenge. Make sense.

384
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:16,530
Any questions? So this is just getting at the environmental justice issue, which I'm sure you've talked about in other classes.

385
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:25,470
Right. And yeah, how do we design experiments and models to protect the most susceptible and vulnerable?

386
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:33,579
You can think about some ideas so we can conduct life stage specific in-vivo experiments when we do do in vivo experiments with animals,

387
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:39,170
like consider the life stage that we're that we're using use in vitro models of early life.

388
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,320
You know that we have like lots of stem cell models, stem cell derived tissues.

389
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:50,220
I work with placental cell lines in my lab, so that's like a very specific life of a pregnancy.

390
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,720
And so kind of focusing in on that, the biology of the placenta allows me to understand toxicant impacts,

391
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,590
you know, for this like really unique life of that.

392
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:08,730
And then including like sex is a variable ensuring that our in-vivo and in vitro studies are conducted with both sexes in mind.

393
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,390
In our power to detect differences between the two.

394
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:18,319
If there is some type of sex specific effect and then incorporating genetics using genetically diverse animals,

395
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,720
we talked about the collaborative cross with mice,

396
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,870
where we're breeding these mice to more closely represent the true genetic variation in the human population,

397
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:35,960
or maybe using primary cell line primary cells as opposed to cell lines actually, or primary tissues.

398
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:45,730
So I also in my lab will work with placental tissue that we derived directly from like cesarean operations and we're able to culture those in the lab.

399
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,209
And so that is going to get at some of this variability that's inherent in

400
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,290
genetics as opposed to a cell line which is all derived from one individual.

401
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,340
There's only going to have that one individual's genome.

402
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:08,280
And then we could think about geographic, socio economic lifestyle factors, understand the population characteristics.

403
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:16,020
I think we as toxicologists can probably do a better job of like understanding geographic, socioeconomic,

404
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,899
etc. factors when we're like scoping the problems and writing grants and thinking about which

405
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:28,560
direction we want to take our research and then always pay attention to exposure and exposure routes.

406
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,559
You know, you could possibly come up with a lot of these on your own measure the interaction between social factors and environmental factors,

407
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,100
you know, looking at different variables, not just the toxicant in isolation,

408
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,390
but how does that toxicant interact with some other event we look at in our lab again,

409
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:56,160
how certain toxicants can modify immune responses to microbes that can be problems for intrauterine infections during pregnancy.

410
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,100
And so you see and it's really interesting,

411
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:06,299
you see like suppression of a view pathways that are specifically like activated when an infection is in play.

412
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,280
So there's some type of inflammatory stimulation.

413
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:17,549
If you looked at that data that, you know that that comes out of our lab in absence of any kind of stimulation of this inflammation pathways,

414
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:25,430
it looks like the toxic it's not really it's not doing anything because that pathway wasn't activated in response to some type of stimulation.

415
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:33,810
So really thinking about what we're modeling and would we see the effect that we're actually trying to study.

416
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,050
You know, given the particular model we're using, it's like really important. Model.

417
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,330
The effects of the policies implement the policies designed to improve equity.

418
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,220
Um, you know, and then you know more about your,

419
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,750
you're hearing about this or seeing people talk about ensuring that environmental health policies benefit those most vulnerable.

420
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,090
Oh, yeah. So that's basically the end of all the material.

421
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,290
Um, it's been a pleasure to share this.

422
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,190
This information with you? Does anyone have any questions?

423
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,910
Comments? Last minute thoughts and I'll just wrap up with a couple extra slides here, but I'll stop there.

424
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,820
I've been getting a lot. None.

425
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:29,270
Okay. Thanks so much. I just want to say my son Hugo was born the second day.

426
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:36,739
We had class that night. And I think around the early part of the class, the second day, we probably felt a lot like him.

427
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,390
Curious about the world. And this is him this morning.

428
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,590
And hopefully we've moved a little bit more in this direction as well.

429
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:51,830
Eyes opened a little bit more, even more curious and very like, aware of our environment around us.

430
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:59,030
So it's fun to share that with you and yeah, but you know, seriously,

431
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:04,189
I just want to encourage you and wherever you go in your career to really think about like susceptible populations,

432
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:10,909
different life stages and overall like where people are again in the social fabric and how

433
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,460
that will contribute to whether it's an occupational situation or a life stage situation,

434
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,480
how that how the environment interacts with those factors.

435
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,320
And I think that will go a long way to helping us improve public health.

436
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,929
So that's it. If you have any issues, just email me and we'll set up a meeting.

437
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,310
So thanks again. It was a pleasure to talk about all this with you and have a good rest of your day.

438
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,030
We did get done a little bit early. Looks like the thanks.

439
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,280
Thank you. Thank you. You.
