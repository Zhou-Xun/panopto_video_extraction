1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,270
And recording and.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,370
This is yours. Wait till I go sit down so I can celebrate suicide.

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:30,219
Hi, everyone. For those of you who do not know me, my name is Ryan and today I am going to present, but on my own,

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,980
a $0.30 rotation project that I worked on last spring and is still working on it to try to finish it.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,340
The title of my presentation is Metabolomic Metabolic Alterations associated with Phthalate Exposures in pregnant women in project cohort.

6
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,069
I want to talk briefly about why we are starting in Paris with phthalates.

7
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,620
And again, probably most of, you know,

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:01,419
tell us that a group of chemicals used to make plastics durable and not flexible that present in consumer products,

9
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,910
personal care products, buoys, PVC, so on and on.

10
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,440
The entire body, mostly through injection and inhalation.

11
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:18,760
And they have very sharp packaging and which is to say they are eliminated quickly through the children in particular are at higher risk of that kind,

12
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,630
an exposure just because they have smaller body size and have constant exposure to plastic toys and so on.

13
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,040
And we are especially interested in starting palettes because they have been implicated in multiple health outcomes,

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,470
including reproductive health outcomes such as preterm birth, which is what we are interested in.

15
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:47,020
So the motivation for this study was to see if we can use methods in metabolomics

16
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,900
to maybe improve our understanding of how phthalates may cause different diseases.

17
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,480
Because although we know like there is some association between phthalate affords us and different diseases,

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,680
we do not know exactly how it might be causing those diseases.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,340
So briefly talking about the study population,

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:16,060
we are use case control study of 100 pregnant woman enrolled in product and this is a longitudinal cohort in Puerto Rico.

21
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm not going to talk a lot about this cohort because Savanah and Hailey talked about it last time in greater details.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,350
But we are interested in this specific population because Puerto Rico tend to

23
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,880
have a higher preterm birth rate as compared to the general U.S. population.

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,960
And they also previous studies also found that higher concentrations of some Talib metabolites among men enrolled in this cohort.

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:51,340
I was just going to talk about the workflow of metabolomics study, but since we don't have a lot of time, I'll just briefly go through it.

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,529
So the first step is just the sample collection for measuring metabolic markers.

27
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,810
We use the prenatal plasma samples collected between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,909
And the second stage is just a sample analysis and metabolites annotation.

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:14,380
This is when you analyze the sample that who collected and tried to identify the compounds that are present in the samples and also annotate them.

30
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,009
And doing that have like 33 and 37 metabolites and the last three steps are just a data preprocessing and

31
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,820
normalization marking metabolomics data with the urinary challenge data and just doing the statistical analysis,

32
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,230
talking about the transformation up into markers.

33
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,340
We have some of the metabolic markers using log transformation and normalized using auto scaling and we

34
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,730
imputed the missing data for metabolic markers that had missing information for more than 30% of samples.

35
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,850
No, actually, we excluded metabolic markers that had missing data for more than 30% of samples.

36
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:01,299
And when we did that, we had to exclude the metabolites resulting in analytical data set up to 27 notated metabolites and phthalates.

37
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,730
We measured phthalates in the 100 woman there in three different time points in gestation,

38
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:15,280
and we calculated the geometric mean of phthalate concentration just to use it as a stable measure of exposure during the pregnancy.

39
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,550
And also we looked, responded phthalate metabolites just to get to get up any outliers.

40
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,100
So that's all the methods now that we have combined the Atlas data which exposed data with the metabolomics data,

41
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,600
how do we identify like what metabolites are important are significant?

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,020
Well, to answer that question, we are using two different approaches.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,410
The first one is the Metabolome Wide Association studies.

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,120
And what this is, is the individual studying like individual associations between his palate metabolite and its metabolic marker.

45
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,760
And we did that using the multiple linear regression. And the second one is just a multivariate analysis.

46
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:03,520
And in this approach, what we are doing is we're creating clusters of different metabolites and running regression analysis on each cluster.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,530
And for all of our analysis, we adjusted from multiple, multiple comparisons using Benjamin's method.

48
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:21,490
So here are the results, preliminary results from analysis in this chart on the left,

49
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:30,850
you can see on the x axis we have different phthalate metabolites and the y axis we have different significantly associated metabolites.

50
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,790
As you can see, we have a lot of fatty acids.

51
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,620
Oh, by the way, the the the colored blue are green represents the negative association and red represents the positive association.

52
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,360
So you see have a lot of fatty acids, amino acids.

53
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,889
And so on and on this chart,

54
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:56,290
let's assume that different classes of the same metabolites and you can see like amino acids and anybody positively associated with

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,000
three different metabolite like that it metabolites and we also have a lot of possibly similarly based that were negatively associated.

56
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:11,290
And here are the results from the study is again we identified it different clusters

57
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,770
that were significantly associated with at least one phthalate metabolite.

58
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,090
And we have the dominant class for this cluster here.

59
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,890
And as you can see, cluster ten, which is enriched with four specific quality,

60
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,910
was significantly associated with 5 to 10 metabolic metabolic markers and cluster eight,

61
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:38,890
which are significant, which are enriched with long chain fatty acids, were significantly associated with two different phthalate metabolites.

62
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,080
And on the right, I just have the list of different metabolites within this cluster.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,600
So now I've talked about, you know, what, all these metabolites are like significantly associated.

64
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,760
Negatively are positively associated.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,140
What does that really mean for our initial motivation, which is to learn how like pilots might be causing diseases?

66
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,729
Well, we're still in the process of figuring out like, what all of this means.

67
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:16,600
But previous studies have shown that, like, excessive fatty acids in maternal blood have been linked with like inflammation and oxidative stress.

68
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:26,139
And also like the since the fact that we saw a lot of fatty acids, possibly single lipids in our study,

69
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,580
suggest that there might be some alteration in fatty acid lipid metabolism.

70
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,130
And that is important. And that will probably help us in some of the equation that we initially had.

71
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,890
And also, like we said, we'll share some with nucleic acid or amino acid and that might suggest like alteration in nucleic acid metabolism.

72
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:53,410
Again, what does it all mean? This study is ongoing and hopefully will answer in the future, and that's the end of this.

73
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,840
Awesome figures. I think you generated so many visualizations.

74
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,250
That's really cool. You might have said this, but I just didn't catch it.

75
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,309
How did you generate the clusters? Oh yeah.

76
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:20,780
I didn't mention it because I was trying to rush through it. So yeah, clusters generated using hierarchical clustering method.

77
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,950
And when we did that, we had a like criteria in its cluster.

78
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,390
We need to be pairwise correlation coefficient to be .15 and have at least five metabolites in this cluster.

79
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,570
So why do you choose those parameters? Well, our point on five is what has been published before.

80
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,790
We had to do something, you know, like how many clusters do you want? What's this?

81
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,240
For example, if we choose, like point five, we may not have enough clusters to work with.

82
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,840
So it was trying to maintain a balance.

83
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,240
And also I just went by what has been published. What's the advantage of doing that?

84
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,090
Cluster wise instead of just individually?

85
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,500
Well, we tried to do clustering because, you know, like in this field, you can see like a lot of metabolites that correlated with each other.

86
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:14,600
And also we want to see like, okay, do similar kind of like metabolites clump together and what does that mean?

87
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,250
Because sometimes if you just look at one metabolite that may not give you enough information,

88
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:27,770
but if you have like a lot of metabolites from similar class that might give us like class level information with respect to like kind of exposure.

89
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:37,560
Sure. Okay. Thank you. Yep. Questions.

90
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,940
I have a question because you are all familiar with the fintech cohort.

91
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,090
That's what you've been using for this study, right? Right. Have you done any obesity phenotyping markers?

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,480
No, I have not done fatty acid metabolism. So that would be an outcome that might be of interest for you.

93
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,700
No, I have not done it. But they use like the same data to look at the preterm birth.

94
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,310
So this is like a nested case control for preterm birth versus not, you know, preterm birth.

95
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,520
And the other people like there's is a paper that was published on that particular study.

96
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,680
But now I'm just looking at the exposures and the metabolites sort of trying to see if

97
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,810
they could act as like an intermediary between like phthalates experts and not let them.

98
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,800
Have you done a little search on preterm birth and how fatty acid metabolism may play in that?

99
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,040
I have read a little bit like I know like some studies have shown that excess fatty

100
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,320
acids might cause inflammation and oxidative stress and they have in this figure,

101
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:56,480
like an inflammation could result in like a membrane rupture which could eventually prevent spontaneous pregnant birth especially.

102
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:08,840
He. Thank you. Great job.

103
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,820
Oh, no, I think you.

104
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,870
Ready. Okay. Hi, everyone.

105
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,979
My name is Shindell. I'm a first year DHS Ph.D. student.

106
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,680
And today I'm going to talk about the three topics that I pick for my doctoral dissertation.

107
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,560
And I borrowed the top of the theme from the world of hearing day 2023,

108
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,720
which is two here for life lesson with care because and I'm going to explore some

109
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,580
exposure response relationship among noise hearing loss and also heart rate.

110
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,190
So some background information, if you're not you're not familiar with the noise exposure and the hearing loss.

111
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:15,870
So we are we have about 700 million people worldwide that will experience profound hearing loss by 2050, are estimated by the world hearing.

112
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,860
The World Health Organization and a 50% of American adults report some trouble hearing.

113
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:30,990
And 30% of U.S. populations are actually overexposed to to a daily environmental noise that is over 70 decibels,

114
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,460
which is a recommendation limit given by EPA and W.H.O.

115
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,939
So as we can see earlier, they're using electro to measure the noise exposure,

116
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:49,080
which is widely accepted by almost every agency when they are setting the regulations.

117
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:59,700
So it is actually averaging or smoothing fluctuating actual sound press or some pressure level into a constant one,

118
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,499
which we can see it loses a lot of information that we might have.

119
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,219
For example, it's an intermittent noise.

120
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:19,140
The what's the resting period and what's the exposure versus resting time, the ratio and what's the ketosis, what's the peak level?

121
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,150
So a lot of information is missing and we all know that noise can cause noise induced

122
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,110
hearing loss and the hearing loss can actually be tested by the pure tone audio imagery,

123
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,630
which you probably have experienced, and I'll show that later.

124
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,370
But what eventually it does is damaging all the healthy hair, hair cells into a damaged one.

125
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,700
Like they're all like the grass. When you stepped on it over and over, they will never get back.

126
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,090
So it is an irreversible progress.

127
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:05,580
And on to so I got three initially I got three topics, but because it's 5 minutes and stuff to get rid of the third one.

128
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:13,800
But the first one is to figure out how the app based a hearing test comparing to those of traditional PDA.

129
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,680
PDA is the peer to audio imagery, and the same is the speech and noise test, which is another hearing test.

130
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,980
And you can see, if you remember, some people would sit in an audio booth and when they hear the sound, the click it.

131
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,290
So that's how we know you're hearing threshold. But in collaboration in collaboration with Apple,

132
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,200
we are implementing an app based hearing test which is demonstrated in this

133
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,910
picture so you can find a quiet place and then talk about only here at home.

134
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,410
And that will give us feedback on what that level of hearing are having.

135
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,700
And the third question I'm having is what is the relationship between different noise matrix and the noise noise induced hearing loss,

136
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:06,540
as I just introduced in the previous slides? And the third question was to see how the acute noise exposure is affecting heart health.

137
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:15,659
And I'm not covering that today. So just an over the all of what I'm going to do for the first time and it is actually

138
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,680
a validation study and it is going to be a cross-sectional and experimental design.

139
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,110
It will happen hopefully next summer.

140
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:32,060
So if anyone is interested, if we've call just an advertisement for the exposure response part, I'm going to use regression models,

141
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,760
machine learning algorithms and a time series analysis to explore the relationship between the exposure.

142
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,580
Okay, at one minute, okay, I'll speed up.

143
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:52,140
But whatever it is, we are collecting data through the research app and the health app and also the noise can be collected through your Apple Watch.

144
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,999
And so this is actually a big data issue.

145
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,659
Why is that? Because it's us. It's just in the first year or two.

146
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,100
How so? Over 70000000 hours of environmental audio exposure and headphone audio exposure measured.

147
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,530
And currently we're having 160,000 participants enrolled at Baseline.

148
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:21,569
And here are some preliminary data that we have and especially in this statistics

149
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:27,240
that we have 20% people who attend a large event at last at least a month late and.

150
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:36,700
60% of them never wear hair and protection. So there are some challenges that we may face and need us.

151
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,129
A lot of go approach to solve that first is the amount of data,

152
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:46,340
so they're all stored in the cloud and we need to extract data from the structure and then adjusting the

153
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:53,810
population because apparently not everyone is using Apple product and it's kind of a biased population.

154
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,170
And the third one is the inconsistent data granularity.

155
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:04,820
And we need to do some imputation or congregate aggregation to find a consistent level that we can analyze.

156
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,090
Also, missing values and the device in closed activity will require some other analytical method.

157
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:22,459
But in the future, we are hoping this study could provide a new method for where wearable sensors in the field of exposure assessment,

158
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:29,810
for example, we actually now have some wearable sensors that can detect biological exposures, which is super cool to me.

159
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,919
And also by updating those exposure relationships,

160
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,290
we are hoping to promote health by updating the exposure limit to account for other exposure matrix.

161
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,200
And yes, that's it. So any questions?

162
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,980
I want to know more about how it affects the heart, huh?

163
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,140
Okay, so about that, I actually have.

164
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,330
Okay. So acute effect on cardiovascular system. It is.

165
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:14,430
Some study has shown that the nocturnal noise has been can affect both autonomic regulation and the vascular function.

166
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:24,480
And it can. So for autonomic regulation, it can be reflective or the heart rate, heart rate increase and blood pressure increase.

167
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:32,160
For the vascular function it has, it can affect endothelial dysfunction and reduce the heart rate variability.

168
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,579
And this whatever this kind of exposure and the response relationship could give us

169
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,310
prognostic values in people with the peripheral artery disease and arterial hypertension,

170
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,340
where people with a different coronary artery disease.

171
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,829
So like if you're measuring the noise exposure at this time and you can see what's your heart rate is and you know,

172
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,760
there is a time lag and how much it can increase your heart rate.

173
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,430
So this could give us a more insight on the relationship.

174
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,480
You mentioned endothelial function. That noise specifically?

175
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,280
Yes. How is that? This is going to be medical.

176
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,250
So, you know, during night, if you're sleeping and you have the noise, noise exposure, your heart rate is actually going to increase.

177
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:30,420
And actually your the internal homeostasis like is going to be disturbed.

178
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:41,520
And there were some hormones that can be like the production of that hormone can be disrupted and cause a like a different.

179
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,120
Sometimes it can even cause cognitive impairment but is like.

180
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,680
I don't know of confounding with other factors to go.

181
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,140
Is it known like what threshold noise you have to have for that to start happening?

182
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:03,630
Well, we wish we had have that, but since we don't have like a long term monitoring data on that, so it's hard to derive that.

183
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:09,780
But we're hoping if the data is complete enough in this study,

184
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,260
we're hoping to find that a relationship will be tough because you have to parse out whether it's the noise itself or the interruptions.

185
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,120
Right. You have to decide whether it's the noise or the interruption of the sleep cycle, right?

186
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:32,729
Yes. So, yeah, so the sleep is measured in in the wild to when they're updating the version.

187
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,970
But of course, the population could be limited.

188
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,860
If you probably read about this. So but are they saying that like it's a stress induced cortisol response that's causing your heart rate to stay?

189
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,780
Right. Right. The president's.

190
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,740
Good idea. I. So does this mean that, you know, all of us, when we work out, we listen to music?

191
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:14,879
Mm hmm. How loud can we play our music? Yes, that's actually a good question, because in the gym, it is actually a very noisy environment.

192
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:24,510
So a rule of thumb is if you can't if you have to raise your voice to talk to a person, then your potential ends for me.

193
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:35,670
Yes. But also it depends on the other duration, because you can stay in there for half an hour, but probably maybe an hour.

194
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,630
So it's also depending on the duration, we're talking about exposures and risks.

195
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,560
Thanks. Another go. Oh, go ahead. Oop.

196
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,770
Um, I don't know if you can answer this,

197
00:21:49,770 --> 00:22:00,120
but do you know of ear buds versus regular over the ear headphones are better or worse in terms of protecting your hearing.

198
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:09,930
Yeah. Overall, the physical muffling effect is better than active active noise cancellation because active

199
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,390
cancellation noise cancellation is actually canceling the noise at a specific frequencies.

200
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:26,100
Well, whereas the physical muffler is blocking if it is certified, of course, is blocking the noise at all frequencies,

201
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:35,310
especially at the low frequency and the frequency that we are mostly most likely to get increased up hearing threshold.

202
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,139
So yeah. And also looking for please looking for a certified hearing protection device

203
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,050
instead of using regular listening device because they're more professional.

204
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,600
How accurate is the phone at detecting voice?

205
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,889
Yeah, yes, that's a good question. Actually, we have a paper already published.

206
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:10,460
I don't remember exactly what's the standard deviation, but it is pretty, pretty accurate and can be used for statistical analysis.

207
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:19,520
But for the hearing test and we're not sure about that, that's why we haven't had any study published yet and that's why the validation study is for.

208
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,550
No more questions. All right. I'm going to give time to David.

209
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:46,680
If they need help, we'll see. We should be able to have them.

210
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:56,490
Okay. Try to see my notes and keep it on the projected.

211
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,040
Can you do that? Yeah, you can. This is what?

212
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:09,560
I don't know. It's been a while since Cowboy and I used to have a mac.

213
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,170
I would be able to tell you these things are so cryptic.

214
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,820
Yeah, but if you do that, the same thing.

215
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,370
So this is what happens to me. So hopefully I.

216
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,020
Oh, cool. Thanks. Interesting.

217
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:46,400
All right. Well, my name is David Aguilar, and I'm a first semester Ph.D. Student Environmental Health Sciences.

218
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,420
And I'm going to talk to you for the next few minutes about my research rotation project this semester,

219
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:58,160
which is characterizing hydroxyl methylation and the importance of the mothers of the infant peer cohort here at the University of Michigan.

220
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,459
So first, I got to give you little bit of context to the move to the next cohort,

221
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,480
as it's called, is a cohort of mothers and their children that was started here in 2011,

222
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:21,320
the women's hospital, they collected a bunch of blood and blood from mothers in the first trimester and blood from cord blood after delivery.

223
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:29,660
And they collected a ton of data. Is it from various or rather they collected a ton of data as a part of collaboration with various labs.

224
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,490
You got a few exposures here. Give us phthalates.

225
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:40,670
That's a biological data. But the one I'm going to focus on right now is methylation and hydroxyl methylation.

226
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:52,330
And so what is hydroxide methylation? It's an oxidative oxidative product of DNA methylation, which maybe most of you're familiar with.

227
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:06,600
It. So until recently it was thought of as just a transient product on the way to demethylation.

228
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,680
But studies have shown that it's actually a stable product and it should be looked at a little more closely as an actual regulator of gene.

229
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,790
Transcription. So DNA methylation mostly occurs at what's called CPG sites.

230
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,980
So you have these side of things that are followed by one of the things which

231
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,510
are actually concentrated in promoter regions which affect gene regulation.

232
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:40,980
And these CPG sites are also concentrated in what's called CPG islands and they're just heavily concentrated regions of the species in the genome.

233
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,229
So why is hydrocarbon legislation important? Well, it's not really.

234
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,270
The biological function is still relatively unknown,

235
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:59,700
but it's been found to be completely missing in various cancers and in most of the studies have been done in mice.

236
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,240
But it seems that when you delete the enzyme that actually oxidizes,

237
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:14,470
when you leave the enzyme that oxidizes methylation to hydroxy methylation, you actually get deleterious effects on mice in their development.

238
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,009
And so as environmental health scientists and environmental health scientists and training at the point to look

239
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:28,780
at these markers to see how exposures might mediate these effects and their effects on development in cancer.

240
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,250
So I'm just going to go over how hydroxy methylation is measured.

241
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,470
So traditionally DNA methylation is measured by this reaction called by sulfide sequencing.

242
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,559
So you treat the you treat the DNA with with by sulfide.

243
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:55,390
And that causes IGM methylated cytokines to change into timings.

244
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:06,340
And when you run it through the sequence, are those thymine show up as excuse me, it changes that changes.

245
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,400
The method aside, it's easy to use those and then they'll show up as thymine in the sequencer.

246
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,170
And so if they change that, that means you can know that that was the one methylated cytosine and then

247
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,680
whatever stays is either hydroxyl will be methylated as a cytosine or methylated.

248
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,730
And so there is other reaction that they do to that they treat hydroxyl methylated

249
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:38,040
side of things the oxidative first and they changed it to a floral cytosine or sorry,

250
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:43,510
a formal cytosine group. Then that makes it unprotected.

251
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:50,209
And then when they treat it with by sulfide, they, they change the timings as well.

252
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:56,530
And so they compare the three sequences and they're able to decipher which side of things were methylated and hydroxyl methylated that way.

253
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:07,710
This is just the technology, how the technology works. So they use this thing called a methylation epic beach of assay.

254
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,390
And so we have these bees that are basically smoothed out sand.

255
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:19,140
They cover it with a bunch of probes that are selected for these CPG sites and then they use laser excitation.

256
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:30,150
To excite probes that are extended with labeled base pairs to basically see what what's at that location.

257
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:40,430
And so the the data that we have was analyzed with A with a, B, B, chip assay.

258
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,140
And a lot of previous studies have been using this 450 K beaches.

259
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:54,630
So that just means that they're analyzing 450,000 CPG sites and these epic beaches are analyzing nearly double that and also covering.

260
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,740
Probably signifies that the other actually did not cover. And so that's where the novelty of this analysis comes from.

261
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:13,790
And so what I have is just a little bit of preliminary data to show where hydroxyl methylation is occurring in the genome.

262
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:26,960
And so here in CPG sites where hydrogen activation occurs in greater than 10% of CPG sites, most of them are located in the open sea region,

263
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:35,000
which I'm still not really familiar with what that means, but it's just a measure of where that location is relative to the CPG sites.

264
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,980
And I think open sea is more related to maybe being an enhancer,

265
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,259
which is basically it affects gene regulation, but it's not necessarily right at the start of transcription.

266
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,100
It can be kind of anywhere.

267
00:30:50,690 --> 00:31:02,210
It's also in rich or potentially rich and the CPG islands themselves and in promoter regions and in the body of genes as well.

268
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:15,149
So what I need to do next is actually formally statistically test these groupings for enrichment and then actually look at

269
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:22,620
exposures and how they might mediate these highly variable in these regions where there's a lot of hydroxy methylation going on.

270
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:35,970
That's it. We're.

271
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:55,000
Talked about enhancers. I was just reading a couple papers yesterday that that seems to be true.

272
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,170
Sort of. Opensea is like in regions.

273
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,030
Mm hmm. Cancer treatment or you. The interpretation is pretty good.

274
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,830
With that being said, can you use hydrazine affiliation as a biomarker?

275
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,090
I think that's the direction you're going at. Right? Right.

276
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:22,740
And that's sort of the cause of stopping it. Okay. Well, we don't know what it does exactly.

277
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:36,260
We can just find associations right now. Do you know how stable like hydroxyl metal is on the label?

278
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,899
No, we know it's stable. We don't know how long it lasts. It could be a few minutes.

279
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:49,100
And it just happened to be captured at the time of the assay. Or it could be longer than that, you know, weeks, lifetimes.

280
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,100
So there's still a whole lot that's not really known.

281
00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:03,280
This is an upcoming marker that's being taken a closer look like look at within the past decade or so.

282
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:15,260
Have you read any literature about how innovation could change the DNA conformation?

283
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:27,020
For example, enhancers have become orders to promote transcription and hydroxyl regulation is a signal for active transcription.

284
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,120
Right? So what do you think about that?

285
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,810
And I thought it when I read about it just in the sense that what you just said, basically that's as far as I know.

286
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,730
Any questions? Thanks.

287
00:33:48,090 --> 00:34:07,480
All right. Since we only have three speakers today.

288
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:25,030
All of them did a great job and I believe your feedback can be uploaded to the Google sheet on your website.

289
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,090
I can recite and I think all should be said and you can.

290
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,470
I think there's a one last class next week that will be the last presentations.

291
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:44,020
Great job. It was nice to see you all. And if you have any questions or anything you want to talk about, I will.

292
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,920
Hang tight for a little bit and we can chat.

293
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,230
Thanks. Happy holidays because I probably won't get to see you.
