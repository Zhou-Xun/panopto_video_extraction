1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,150
All right. So we left off last time talking about Sars-cov-1.

2
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,850
It was just in the summer as compared to SARS-CoV-2. And kind of like talking about y.

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,650
Yes, very true. Today we were just discussing that. Apparently a lot of people are giving exams today.

4
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,050
Maybe the presentation.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,240
So other like. But.

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:51,090
Yeah. So when you think about like in infectious disease epidemiology, we often think about like whether or not diseases can be eradicated,

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:01,040
which is when you completely get rid of the disease versus eliminated, which is where you'll get rid of it from a particular area.

8
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,170
But it might be in other areas of the world. Right.

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:13,980
The very few diseases that have been eradicated, both of them like where people are coming or controlled and the level of control.

10
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:24,600
And so at the start of you pandemic or what you're hoping will not become a pandemic, you want to be like, knock, knock that disease out completely.

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,220
Right. Which is what what was done with with stars one.

12
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,710
But in kind of thinking about what can be done, there are a few different things you need to think about.

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,470
So one of the big things is, is there an environmental or an animal reservoir like Ebola?

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,740
Right. There's a there's an animal reservoir. Right. So we we can completely end Ebola outbreaks.

15
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,030
Right. And then another one will just pop back up somewhere else later.

16
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,760
And then you have to kind of jump in and do it again. Right. So supercharge COVID one versus SARS-CoV-2.

17
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,670
They're both zoonotic diseases, meaning that they come from animals.

18
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,799
Right. So there's clearly a reservoir. Sars-cov-1, though, didn't you know, it didn't transmit as much.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,290
And if we didn't see it jump back into other animal species, at least that we're aware of it really happening.

20
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,589
Whereas SARS-CoV-2 seems to really easily jump into other species.

21
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,059
So domestic animals, so really early on there, all the articles about cats,

22
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,180
particularly getting SARS-CoV-2, but they've seen it in a bunch of other animals as well.

23
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,530
Obviously here in Michigan, maybe you've heard about white tailed deer.

24
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,070
There's been a big outbreak in the white tailed deer population and it's now very set up

25
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,440
how they came close enough to humans to transmit that because it hadn't come from humans.

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,129
Right. Somebody got that close to a deer that they managed to like transmit COVID to them

27
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,620
and then deer apparently get close to one another to transmit it on large cats.

28
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,720
So thinking like zoos, right, we've seen. And the large cats can get quite sick.

29
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,810
Mink. Mink are a big worry because there are mink clubs and so you get a lot of transmission going on.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,600
The list really continues. So the point of that is kind of like that.

31
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,530
Even if we could have completely if if we had, we managed to completely control SARS-CoV-2 and get it out of human population.

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,250
It would have still been out there in the animal population. At this point.

33
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,960
There's no way we're getting it out of the human population unless we come up

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,240
with a vaccine that actually prevents transmission and everybody gets it right.

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,190
But even if we did, it would still be in the animal population.

36
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,399
And there's always like the chance that like one of the big fears is that, you know,

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,040
one of the things about about viruses is they're usually pretty specific to like a particular species, right?

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:07,919
But there's some crossover and whatnot. And one of the things that makes them really specific is the way that they enter cells, particular receptors.

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,340
So there's a lot there is some level of concern that with SARS-CoV-2 out in all these animal species,

40
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:24,299
that it will figure out a way to get into our cells by a mechanism that doesn't use the RBD receptor binding domain.

41
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:32,070
Of course, that's what our our our vaccine is made, our vaccines are made against and also what we kind of predominantly generate immunity to

42
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,899
and that you could then have a virus that basically we we don't have any immunity to,

43
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,950
again, or at least the vaccine doesn't work against. But anyways, so there you go.

44
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,950
So that was one concern, right? Another thing that you think about is like how identifiable other cases were.

45
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,820
Sars-cov one there was definitely a range of symptoms, but a large proportion of the cases, at least those that were identified, were severe or fatal.

46
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,800
Do you remember that? I told you that we didn't have any testing for like six months because we didn't know what was causing it.

47
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:06,360
So it's possible some cases were missed, but even going back and doing sero surveys or serology testing,

48
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,450
it didn't look like we were missing that much of the picture.

49
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:17,420
Right. So. It was relatively clear for a lot of people who had Sars-cov-1 or SARS-CoV-2.

50
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,620
It's really got a range of symptoms from asymptomatic to severe disease and death.

51
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,449
That became apparent extremely early on in the pandemic.

52
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,779
Certainly by January, like the first week of January.

53
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,140
I think we already knew that or the second week.

54
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,560
That's that's a massive concern because any time that you have a lot of asymptomatic or mild cases,

55
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,250
that's going to be a disease that's much harder to control.

56
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:55,020
Although I think from like a population, a public perspective, people become much more concerned when it's a very severe disease, you know,

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:03,109
but if you told me, oh, it was super severe at 100% of the people got extremely ill, I'd be like, we'll be able to control that.

58
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,740
You know, you want to stay away from it. But like that's something that's going to be controllable, right?

59
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,669
Whereas something that is like can be mild, can be asymptomatic.

60
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,720
You can still transmit it all then and it's hard to recognize and has some proportion that's really severe and fatal.

61
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,780
You know, that's a significant proportion, but that's still a small percentage, say 1% or 2% or 3% or even half a percent.

62
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,509
Right. Like that's actually something that gets me as an epidemiologist much more concerned about, right?

63
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,600
Because I'm like, oh, that's going to be hard to control. Right?

64
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,340
So with SARS-CoV-2, that was one of the big kind of immediate red flags.

65
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,570
One of the things that you started to think like, Oh, we're in trouble, right?

66
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:59,000
There's a large proportion of relatively mild cases and also a decent proportion of very severe or fatal cases.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Right. That is an interesting side note.

68
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:11,389
Like the US had run a bunch of scenarios like for pandemics and kind of what do you think the worst case scenario is for the report,

69
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,730
the case fatality rate that the US had run, that kind of preparing for pandemics.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,860
Who thinks it was like 50%? 80%.

71
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,190
10%. 5%.

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,060
People think I should go up or down from 5%. Worst case scenario.

73
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,400
Some people are saying it's actually lower.

74
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,430
3%, 3% was the worst case scenario that the U.S. should run because that already was.

75
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,230
They knew it was going to be really catastrophic. You know, so.

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,420
So I remember talking to my parents, you know, about Sars-cov two and I said, oh, you know, we're going to have a pandemic.

77
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,030
You guys have like maybe two months, you know, so get whatever you want to do in right now,

78
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,480
but be careful about it because you never know how much of it is in the community.

79
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,260
And my mom was like, well, what's the, you know, what's it going to be?

80
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,360
And I was like, oh, you know, it looks like it's looking like less than 1%. She's like, Oh, that'll be nothing.

81
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,799
And I was like, Oh, no. Like, you know, it's I think it's hard to wrap your head around a little bit a little bit more for us now.

82
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,080
Right? Because we know what the pandemic was like. The case fatality rate for SARS-CoV-2 is less than 1%.

83
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Right. So there you go.

84
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:39,240
All right. Sars-cov one early report stated that 20 to 30% of individuals with sirs required ICU care and the overall fatality rate was about 15%.

85
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,680
They noted a real clear age dependance of disease, severity and mortality.

86
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,680
So this was in Hong Kong, right? For this particular study, 0 to 24 year olds.

87
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,709
There were zero fatal cases. Right. No.

88
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,110
But 0% of the cases were fatal. For 25 to 44 year olds, it was 6%.

89
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,059
45 to 64 year olds it was 15%. And 65.

90
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,800
And over it was 52%. Very similar distribution, although obviously the numbers are lower for SARS-CoV-2.

91
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,070
But we already knew this, right, going into the pandemic,

92
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,310
although no guarantee the other virus would have the exact same kind of age dependent behavior.

93
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,650
I actually now suspect that that's something very specific to coronaviruses in general,

94
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:41,290
and that should we have any future coronavirus pandemics, we will probably see like a very similar distribution of of severity.

95
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,040
Of course, the individual numbers may be higher or lower.

96
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:52,320
So none of the 1 to 12 year olds infected with SARS-CoV-2 one in Hong Kong, had disease severe enough to require ICU.

97
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,630
So a majority of those cases, not all of them were really mild or relatively mild.

98
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,089
Here's SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. So completely naive population.

99
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,390
This is actually from my study in Nicaragua.

100
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,680
And here, in light pink or subclinical or asymptomatic infections,

101
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:24,840
people who got infected but didn't know they had been infected or knew they had been infected, but just had one or two relatively mild symptoms.

102
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:37,080
So 69% of the infections overall were subclinical or mild to moderate was like you really didn't feel well.

103
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:50,159
The lower respiratory symptoms severe was death or hospitalization or you should have been hospitalized, but you were afraid to go to the hospital.

104
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,950
And so maybe you ended up on oxygen in your home. All right.

105
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:06,390
So real difference in the spectrum of severity there. And because SARS-CoV-2 was more mild, it was harder to control right.

106
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
Contagiousness. So Sars-cov-1 did not transmit particularly well.

107
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,550
It was actually primarily nosocomial transmission, which means mostly hospital health care related transmission.

108
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,750
However, there were some super spreader events. The Amoy Gardens is an example.

109
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:31,860
I'll go through that really quickly in a moment just because I think it's interesting and transmission did not really seem to occur.

110
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,190
Asymptomatically and really mildly ill people seem to be not very infectious.

111
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:48,239
For SARS-CoV-2. It transmitted very well and it became clear very early on.

112
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,740
And I'll show you one of the studies that showed that that transmission was occurring pre or asymptomatically.

113
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,570
That's also another big. Oh, right. We now have a mild disease in some individuals.

114
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:12,060
Right. But can be very severe where transmission can occur, pre-symptomatic or asymptomatically, much easier to control.

115
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,950
A disease that people are only infectious are mostly only infectious when they're clear.

116
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,280
Kind of clearly a case, something like smallpox. Right. Smallpox.

117
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,390
What we were able to. Eradicate smallpox because we had a great vaccine.

118
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,999
Right. And partly because there's seasonality.

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,800
But that's another matter, because it allowed you to kind of concentrate in on when you were putting your interventions into place.

120
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,080
Smallpox is a vaccine is a disease where you look at somebody and you're like, you have smallpox.

121
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,750
Right. It was pretty easy to put up posters and show people what somebody with smallpox look like offered them.

122
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,970
I think they were offering like a hundred bucks at the end, which was a lot of money back in the 1970s, you know, to to turn in any smallpox cases.

123
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,189
Right. And one of the good things was people were not infectious until they had symptoms.

124
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,890
Right. And then they just would go to a vaccination. So vaccinate everybody within a certain distance.

125
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,100
Something that could have worked for monkeypox early on had it been.

126
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,640
Well, I guess a little bit a little bit better handled, I think.

127
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,510
But we kind of let it get beyond that in the US, although it's now mostly under control.

128
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,380
All right. So four shots per one. This is from a New England Journal of Medicine paper in 2003.

129
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,729
However, one feature of this disease is that a few infected persons have been responsible for

130
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,200
a disproportionate number of transmissions the so-called superspreading events.

131
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:46,850
These results suggest that Sars-cov is sufficiently transmissible to cause a very large epidemic if it is left unchecked,

132
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,420
but that it is not so contagious overall as to be uncontrollable with good, basic public health measures.

133
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:01,969
So this is part of why, like there is a big kind of divide in the beginning of the pandemic right in January,

134
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,350
with some very well-known scientists kind of coming out and saying,

135
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,809
like, coronaviruses can't cause a pandemic, they're not going to cause a pandemic and think people coming out and saying,

136
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:18,620
like, better get ready because it's coming. Right. Like, this is already like we've already lost control of this situation.

137
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,860
Essentially, the cat's already out of the bag, so to speak. So Sars-cov-1 in Amoy Gardens.

138
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,000
Amoy Gardens is a housing complex, and there was an outbreak with more than 300 people who were affected.

139
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,070
Remember, Sars-cov-1 only had about 8000 cases worldwide, right?

140
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,100
So this was a big chunk of the cases. There was an index patient,

141
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,260
an index person who who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 one visited one of the units

142
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,760
on the middle floor of the building E on March 14th and again on March 19th,

143
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,660
and then and use the toilet. And this person had diarrhea.

144
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,049
There were subsequent cases categorized according to apartment unit were located in clusters and poor buildings at certain level.

145
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,050
So it was not just the one building he went to, it was other buildings.

146
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,090
And they were kind of trying to figure out, well, why?

147
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,160
So one of the big things they did, you know, as people do in outbreak investigations, is kind of mapped out.

148
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:23,900
These buildings, looked at what the prevailing wind was, etc., and then looked at when the cases occurred in each of the building.

149
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,340
There was enough data on the first 187 cases.

150
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,890
After that, it was harder to figure out what exactly had gone on,

151
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,770
but they figured out pretty quickly was that location was a risk factor for whether or not

152
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,130
you ended up getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 might have been as well for how sick you got.

153
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,470
I don't remember. And here's the kind of theory.

154
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:56,690
So they actually did this, how the wins would go. So here we've got building E, so this is where the infected person came and went to the bathroom.

155
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:06,139
And basically the theory is that the way the plumbing was set up, right, there are these stacks that go up, you know,

156
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,750
like in all plumbing where you've got a tube, like a tube or pipe that goes up to the ceiling out your roof.

157
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:21,200
You may not know that, but you do have one. Right. And it allows air to escape so you don't get your vacuums and whatnot occurring.

158
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,340
So anyways, air escaped out of that pipe, went in, was carried down through to the to the other buildings.

159
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,150
So the thought is that there was extremely high concentrations of of source

160
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,960
associated coronavirus that was found in feces and urine of the index patient.

161
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:46,580
That, coupled with the error, was a erroneous zation due to the hydraulic action inside the drainage pipes,

162
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,850
those vertical stacks most likely generated huge numbers of virus laden aerosols,

163
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,979
uh, that the amount of virus decayed over time from the plume right as it went out.

164
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,580
And that led to lower attack rates the further the buildings were away.

165
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,499
They also found when they looked at that the the concentration of virus in respiratory

166
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,430
secretions was found to be much lower than the concentrations in urine in school.

167
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,080
And this difference might explain the need for close contact with index cases in some nosocomial.

168
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:32,780
So of Sars-cov Sars-cov-1 right, because at the time it was just comparison to contrast that the diamond princess,

169
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,659
we all remember the diamond princess, right?

170
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:45,170
It was a cruise ship where one person got on to the cruise ship, was infected with with SARS-CoV-2, departed on January 20th,

171
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:57,740
2020, for what was billed as like a round four tour of Southeast Asia, had about 2600 passengers and a little over 1000 crew.

172
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:07,420
And overall, in the end, 19.2% of people on that cruise ship ended up getting infected.

173
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,730
Now, could have been a superspreader event, but it was already kind of started.

174
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,390
There were other evidence as well that it was clearly transmitting quite well.

175
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,880
Right. So so we've got something now that transmits quite well.

176
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,980
Relatively mild compared to SARS-CoV-2 at least. Has more mild presentation.

177
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,709
Not saying that it was mild. So for Sars-cov-1, we've also got this.

178
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,830
Although some asymptomatic and mild infections have been documented,

179
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,000
they seem to be uncommon and do not appear to contribute to the extension of the chain of infection among humans, meaning they didn't pass at all.

180
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,130
Despite numerous attempts, there has been no documented isolation of virus.

181
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,140
So when we isolate viruses, what we're trying to do is just as we'll take a sample,

182
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,110
try to grow that virus to show that you have a live virus, virus that's capable of being transmitted on.

183
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,620
So there's been no documented isolation of the virus from persons with asymptomatic infections.

184
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:14,090
And in recent serologic and epidemiologic studies, transmission from persons with asymptomatic cases to contacts could not be detected.

185
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,070
So they're not saying this necessarily didn't happen, but it certainly doesn't seem like it was very common.

186
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:29,180
They couldn't pick out that it was occurring. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2, this was super early, right January 19th,

187
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,540
right around the same time that the the diamond princess was was was leave or was leaving.

188
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:46,220
There was a person who came from China to Germany, and they reported that they had no symptoms at the time.

189
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,620
They went to a few business meetings. I think they were there for like two days or something.

190
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
That's a very brief interactions with a few people.

191
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:03,890
No symptoms, gets on a flight to go back, develops symptoms up during their flight back, and then tests positive for PCR.

192
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,310
Right. And then we see four people who had contact with that individual,

193
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,690
even though some of it was super briefly a ten minute standing in the same room, not necessarily next to them sort of thing.

194
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:26,000
Develop SARS-CoV-2. Right. So some of the first I think these were the first detected cases in Germany actually.

195
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,290
So kind of showing that asymptomatic or in this case this person's pre-symptomatic.

196
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,660
Right. Because they did develop symptoms are transmitting.

197
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:45,920
That's that was kind of like for lack of a better word, like that was the straw or the nail in the coffin or however you want to like say it.

198
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:54,050
Right? Like when when that, when we saw that was happening, everybody's like in the infectious disease world is like, oh, no.

199
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:02,540
Right. Because we now knew or at least a lot of us did like this, this was going to take off.

200
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,760
Right? Like this was coming for sure. So summary of factors.

201
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:15,350
Right. Like, contrary to what you would think lower severity is actually can be bad news for controlling an outbreak,

202
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,490
meaning it may turn into a large epidemic or a pandemic.

203
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,700
It's because it's harder to identify the cases. You'll also be less political will to to control it.

204
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,450
Right. And the population, maybe less, are less likely to comply as well.

205
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,680
High transmissibility is a big issue, right?

206
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,160
As efficiently spread by respiratory route for SARS-CoV-2.

207
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,710
Right. That was a big factor that led to it not being controlled.

208
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:56,420
And then, of course, transmission from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases guess were really the big factors and the differences that we saw.

209
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,460
I mean, you know, the question still arises like, was it controllable?

210
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,810
Clearly, there were several countries that did control SARS-CoV-2.

211
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,160
Right. China did a very good job of controlling it. Several Asian other Asian countries did.

212
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,340
New Zealand, although an island. Right.

213
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,870
Did an amazing job of controlling SARS-CoV-2.

214
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,879
So had there been the political will? Maybe.

215
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,520
Maybe not. Probably still probably not. Right.

216
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,489
Because all of, you know, not every country in the world might have had the ability to actually go in and do that.

217
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,780
But but there you go.

218
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:51,310
So any questions about Sars-cov-1 SARS-CoV-2 what you would look at in the future to figure out if we're in big trouble again or where disease?

219
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,630
Okay. So there you go. All right. So that's control of infectious disease diseases.

220
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,550
So dependent happiness. Dependent happiness is really what makes infectious diseases different from chronic diseases.

221
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,640
So dependent happenings are those in which incidence depends on prevalence.

222
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,380
So most infectious diseases are going to be dependent occurrences or happenings,

223
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,540
meaning that if I have that disease, the people around me are more likely to get the disease right.

224
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,060
So it's dependent on the prevalence in the population.

225
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:32,380
Some infectious diseases are not or are not dependent on the human population and thus are independent happenings.

226
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:41,230
So rabies, Lyme disease, tetanus would be examples of those, those sorts of diseases.

227
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:50,230
Right. So things that are transmitted by a vector have another reservoir or are transmitted, you know, by the environment.

228
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:03,050
So due to the dependency, interventions for infectious diseases are going to have both direct and indirect effects, right?

229
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,459
So the direct effects are going to be the effect of the of the interventions.

230
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,200
So the protective effect that it has for the person who receives the intervention.

231
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,770
The indirect effects is that it's going to alter transmission in a population.

232
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:25,400
So if a lot of the population receives the intervention or some large proportion, right,

233
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,800
there will be people in the population that don't receive the intervention and are yet protected.

234
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:39,830
Could anybody think of a disease where people really rely on this potentially?

235
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,070
So measles is a good one, right?

236
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:59,400
While the parents are not vaccinating their children because they're worried about the potential effects from the measles vaccine.

237
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,540
All vaccines do have some potential adverse events. Right.

238
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,569
You know, and they kind of like get this argument of like, well, but Winslow,

239
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,450
the last time you saw somebody with measles, why should I put my child at this risk, even if it's a really small one?

240
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,640
If there's no risk from this disease. Right.

241
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:24,390
Of course, the the problem is, the more people that do that, then this indirect protection rate drops down and then you get a problem.

242
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,700
You can also see clustering in certain areas where the rates drop really low and you get outbreaks.

243
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,400
So the direct effect is the difference in the outcome of an individual who received the intervention

244
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:46,680
versus an individual that did not receive the intervention that would be like in the same population.

245
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,430
Right. An indirect effect is the difference in the individual not receiving the intervention.

246
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:01,770
In a population where some individuals are receiving the intervention and an individual not receiving

247
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:07,530
the intervention in a population where no and no individuals are receiving the intervention.

248
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:16,020
We'll have that picture in a minute to compare. So it's the benefit that a person receives that does not get the intervention,

249
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,730
but resides in a population where other people are getting the intervention right.

250
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:30,030
That's that indirect effect. So here, you know, we're affecting the prevalence of those this source of infection.

251
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:40,560
So the PCE here decreases due to the vaccination or other intervention, resulting in a decrease in the overall infection rate here.

252
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,640
So that's what's happening.

253
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,380
One important thing to note is that there can be harmful indirect effects and people sometimes don't really think about these.

254
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:58,470
So indirect effects can be harmful. So some diseases have higher morbidity and mortality in adults compared to children.

255
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,610
Many indirect effects lead to a lowering of incidence, which means an increase in the average age of first infection for people who do get infected,

256
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,550
which may come with heightened risk for severe disease.

257
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:27,720
Right. So the total of fact is the effect of the intervention program, plus the effect of the intervention that the individual receives.

258
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:37,440
So it's that direct plus the indirect effect that a person is getting from the people around them being vaccinated.

259
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,000
But that's an individuals that were well or receiving the intervention, but mostly vaccinated.

260
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,220
So it compares the outcome of an individual receiving the intervention of

261
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,860
population that receives the intervention and the outcome of the same individual.

262
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,350
If he or she had not received the intervention and was part of a population that did not receive the intervention, that's the counterfactual, right?

263
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,820
Or it's the benefit of a person receiving a vaccine and residing in a population with lower transmission due to vaccination.

264
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,880
So they've got their their vaccine effectiveness.

265
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,160
But if the vaccine doesn't work as well in them, they've still got protection, right, from the people around them.

266
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:22,350
The overall effect is the difference of the outcome in an average person in the population receiving

267
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,060
the intervention versus the average person in a population not receiving the intervention.

268
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:34,980
Right. So this is an average rate will depend, of course, on the portion is vaccinated or has the intervention.

269
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,500
So it's a weighted average of the reduction of incidents in the population,

270
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,440
both in those that did and those that did not get or receive the intervention.

271
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:54,800
All right. So in pictures, what does this look like? So to look at a direct effect, we've got one population here, right.

272
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,079
Whose is this is of our vaccinated population.

273
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
But inside of that population, some people are vaccinated and some people are.

274
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,910
Over here we've got a population. B, these populations are not mixing.

275
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:13,050
They're on their own. Two separate islands, let's say. Right, where everybody's not vaccinated.

276
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:20,670
So you look at the direct effect of the vaccine, and this is what you often think of when you think of like a vaccine trial.

277
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:28,500
Right? You compare vaccinated individuals in that population to non-vaccinated individuals in the same population.

278
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,660
If you want to look at the indirect effect,

279
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:38,310
so what's the protection that somebody that's not vaccinated gets from the people around them being vaccinated?

280
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:45,209
You're going to compare non-vaccinated individuals in this population where some people are receiving the vaccine.

281
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,680
This could be another intervention, but.

282
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:56,060
It's easier to think about it with a vaccine for two people who are not vaccinated and then in the population where no one is receiving the vaccine.

283
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:09,590
Right. And then we've got the overall effect. These are the averages right here.

284
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:17,500
So this is the vaccinated and non-vaccinated average outcome here compared to the average outcome in this non-vaccinated population.

285
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,780
And then last but not least, the total effect down here, which is direct plus indirect.

286
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,910
So here we'll take a vaccinated person in the partially vaccinated population

287
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,790
and compare them to a non vaccinated person in the non vaccinated population.

288
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,660
So that is dependent happenings. This is a very good paper.

289
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,380
If you're going to read one infectious disease paper, I would definitely read this this paper.

290
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,820
I know it's a little old 1991, so you should read it for sure.

291
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,720
All right. So that's been happening. So are there any questions about dependent happenings?

292
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,560
We'll talk about some happenings a little bit in trial design.

293
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,160
So cluster run. So we're never going to go into some study designs, right, specifically for infectious diseases.

294
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,310
So we've got cluster, randomized controlled trials.

295
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,180
It's a randomized controlled trial where groups, rather than people, are randomized to receive the intervention.

296
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,600
And it may just be a proportion of the of the whole group that's receiving it.

297
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,570
Right. It's a useful tool. It's really useful for examining the total overall and indirect effects.

298
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,840
There's some factors to think about when you think about like designing cluster randomized trials.

299
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,390
First off, transmission of the disease of interest needs to occur within the clusters.

300
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,620
You want little transmission to the clusters from outside.

301
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:52,390
That's not always fully, you know, done, but that's what you want, as opposed to the other clusters and to the non study populations.

302
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,809
You want a little migration of people between the clusters. You need multiple clusters.

303
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:03,490
So if somebody says I did a cluster randomized trial of two clusters, that's not a cluster randomized trial.

304
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,830
Right. So, you know, you're going to need a bunch of clusters.

305
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:15,010
And then due to intra cluster correlation, the sample size that you need is going to be larger than a non cluster trial.

306
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:24,730
And your analysis also has to adjust for the cluster. So here is a good example of a cluster randomized trial.

307
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,560
It is a typhoid vaccine trial that they did in India.

308
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,329
And the placebo there is hepatitis A, so they were using like an intramuscular injection.

309
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,960
Right. So that's why do you think they gave a hepatitis A vaccine instead of like no vaccine?

310
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:57,510
But people think. Well, hepatitis C was probably a vaccine that people weren't commonly getting.

311
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:03,629
They're usually right when you you're going to be thinking about like a few different things in trials.

312
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:10,620
But two of the things that you'll be thinking about is like, number one, you don't want people to know if they got the intervention or not, right?

313
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,750
So if you give them another vaccine that looks similar and has the same dosing and the same spacing,

314
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,429
then they won't know that they didn't get the the intervention,

315
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,770
they didn't get the real vaccine because it could affect the reporting or going out and seeking care, all sorts of things.

316
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,799
Right. Another thing is like you want everybody in your studies, there's ethical reasons, right?

317
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,490
You want everybody in your study, if you can, to benefit from the study.

318
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:46,770
You certainly you could have given them an injection of saline. But if there is an effective vaccine, that is not going to you know,

319
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:52,830
it can't be against the same kind of rough outcome that like it's not going to affect your outcome that you're looking at,

320
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,750
then it's always going to be preferable to give them a vaccine so that the placebo group is benefiting from being in the trial.

321
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,930
So there you go. All right. So here we've got our blue hepatitis.

322
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,260
Clusters are kind of peachy.

323
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,950
Pinky color are our typhoid vaccine clusters.

324
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,150
And notice that there are a number a number of clusters.

325
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:25,110
Right. So in this paper, they have a really nice figure talking about the protection that they look at.

326
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,790
So they look at the overall protection.

327
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,540
So they look at that in the cluster randomized to the control agent compared to the cluster randomized to the vaccine.

328
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:40,920
So this is our typhoid vaccine people. This is our hepatitis A groups over here, they look at indirect protection.

329
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,760
So they compare people in the hepatitis A, clusters who did not get the hepatitis A vaccine or children,

330
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,980
I think, to children in the typhoid clusters that did not get the typhoid vaccine.

331
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,380
And then they also look at the total protection.

332
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,540
So here they're comparing people who got the typhoid vaccine in the typhoid clusters,

333
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,979
the people who got the hepatitis A vaccine in the hepatitis C cluster.

334
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,760
Right. Remembering that hepatitis C here is a placebo group.

335
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:26,040
They did not get an intervention of interest. And so they look at the the total effect, the indirect effects and the overall effects.

336
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,139
Right. And they adjust for a few different things.

337
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:38,670
I don't remember, but it's a nice paper that really gives a nice example of cluster randomized trials where they played it out quite well.

338
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,989
All right. So a cluster randomized trials are one thing that we only, only tend to see in infectious diseases tests.

339
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:53,340
Negative design is another another trial design that you only see in another study design that you will see in infectious diseases.

340
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:02,660
It's a modified case control design. It's used for vaccine effectiveness and it uses individuals that test negative for the disease of interest as

341
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:12,090
controls like the Monto Working Group here runs a test negative design study both for influenza and for COVID.

342
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,569
So the basic idea is that you can do it in a hospital, you could do it at the health center.

343
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:22,860
You get a bunch of people coming in who all have roughly the same symptoms and they qualify for an influenza test, right.

344
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:29,489
Or a Koven test. And then you take the people who test positive for influenza and you say, those are my cases.

345
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,379
And you take the people who test negative for influenza. Those are my controls, right?

346
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:43,590
That's the design. Some of the advantages of this design are it's cheaper than a cohort study or finding other controls.

347
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,190
That's always been a major issue, like finding who the appropriate controls are.

348
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:56,340
The health care seeking behavior is argued to be the same in the cases in the controls, and that's one of the super big arguments for this,

349
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,500
because there is a concern about differences in health care seeking behavior based on vaccination status.

350
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,730
And the feeling is that gets rid of that potential bias from health care seeking

351
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,170
behavior and then the controls are selected from the same source population.

352
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,250
Right. Because they're coming in for that for that illness.

353
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,790
They don't know if they have flu or not. Right. They just know what symptoms they have.

354
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,500
So here is the test negative design. We've got our cases or there's individuals who test positive for flu.

355
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,030
Here are controls are the individuals who test negative. We are off.

356
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,490
This is also the design for COVID, right that's being used right now.

357
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,520
And then you look in your cases, did they get the vaccine or not? And you're looking at controls, did they get the vaccine or not?

358
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:47,249
And then you're going to compare them. And it's kind of historically was done for people visiting like an outpatient thing for Eli.

359
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,550
But you also see it in a lot of like hospitalized studies now as well.

360
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:05,360
So what are people saying? Do you think they're good controls? We could go through the control selection principles on the next slide.

361
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,610
Right.

362
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:12,470
So first, controls should be selected from the same population, the source population that gives rights to the cases, the study based principle.

363
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,120
We feel good about these controls in that regard. What do you think?

364
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,240
Probably right. They don't know if they had flu or not. They just know they have a fever and a cough and they went in.

365
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,480
Right. So, you know, it had they had flu, you know, they would have gone there.

366
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,260
Right there. They come from the same study base.

367
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,850
Uh, control should be selected independently of their exposure status.

368
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,710
That is, control should be representative of the source population with respect to exposure.

369
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:58,080
What do you think? Some people are saying there are no I would say questionable.

370
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:04,080
Right. Like Brit, like I'm not sure I'm happy with that one entirely.

371
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:10,649
There's definitely a possibility of some selection bias occurring here, if that would occur,

372
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,719
if the physicians know the vaccination status and it changes whether or not they ordered the test.

373
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,770
Right. There's also this possibility of something called viral interference,

374
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,610
where the idea that one virus might protect from another virus for a little while,

375
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:31,409
you might be familiar with this like, right, COVID came and transmitted.

376
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,600
And even though some places were taking like very few precautions, right?

377
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,610
We'd get these massive waves of COVID. There were no other respiratory viruses.

378
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,800
Everybody was like, What happened to flu? Where did you go? Right.

379
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,339
So this idea that like some people think it was just the interventions.

380
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,940
The only problem with that theory is like even in places where there were very few interventions or no interventions put into place,

381
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,600
they still saw the same thing happen, even if there were random, sporadic, you know, flu cases, for example.

382
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,600
So we're still we're not entirely sure. But there you go.

383
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,559
Probability of selecting any potential control subjects should be proportional to the amount of time that he or she contributes

384
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,020
to the denominator of the rates that would have been calculated had a cohort study of the population been conducted.

385
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,410
I think we're probably okay there, and the time during which a subject is eligible to be control should be the time in

386
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,480
which that individual is also eligible to become a case if the disease should occur.

387
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,479
I would say we're okay there because they don't know if they had flu or not.

388
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,380
If they had had flu instead of RSV or whatever the virus was, they would have.

389
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,129
Then they had the same symptoms. They would have come in to that same place.

390
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:43,080
Right. We already know what their health care seeking behavior was and where they would have gone.

391
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:50,049
So it's good there. So possible issues we could have already talked about that.

392
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:56,490
So designs that rely on physician ordering of the tests, the selection selection bias may occur.

393
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,440
So that would be one of the big concerns here in test negative design.

394
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,710
Assessing the risk of illness symptoms that places the subjects into control should be independent of the vaccination status.

395
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,740
It's possible that viral interference would cause this to not be true, right?

396
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,440
And that would result in an infringement in the control series of persons vaccinated for influenza.

397
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:26,190
They're now doing something really interesting. Well, interesting would be a way of me saying I don't approve of it, I guess,

398
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,660
although we'll see what the latest publications come out saying where they are now.

399
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:37,530
They've got this control right. They've got the people for their cases right.

400
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,520
Who test positive and then people who touch negative.

401
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,910
But they're now excluding everybody who test positive for COVID here.

402
00:41:49,530 --> 00:42:05,550
Right. Saying that, um, basically that the probability, like people who get vaccinated for COVID are also more likely to get vaccinated for influenza.

403
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:13,049
Right. And so that these are and so because you've got so many COVID cases occurring here that it will bias the results,

404
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:20,400
that's probably true in a way, right, depending on how long that COVID vaccine actually personalized to getting coverage.

405
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:29,609
So they're excluding all those people. But then that actually means you're biasing it actually away from the normal, right?

406
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:33,150
So you would make it you would increase your vaccine effectiveness in that case.

407
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:38,880
And if you're going to buy something, remember, if you if you had no choice but for it to be biased in some direction or another,

408
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,550
you should bias that towards the null, you know, particularly for the vaccine effectiveness.

409
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,730
So there you go. But like last year, the way the influenza vaccine effectiveness was calculated,

410
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,219
it was calculated in COVID 19 cases excluded using the test negative design.

411
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,700
When you see the CDC estimates that that's what you're actually looking at.

412
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,310
All right. So that's test negative design.

413
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:14,860
Then we have vaccine probes, studies, vaccine probe studies all use a vaccine of known efficacy to estimate disease incidence.

414
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:22,990
It's particularly useful when a number of pathogens can cause the same outcome, such as pneumonia or mortality.

415
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,650
So it's kind of like when we want to know, like for flu,

416
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:34,240
it's actually really hard to know what the true burden of flu like for causing cases, ammonia for causing fatal cases.

417
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,219
So people have talked about vaccine probe studies for quite a while. One of the things, though,

418
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:48,340
for a vaccine probe study is you want something to a vaccine to be very effective and for it not to vary by from season to season.

419
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:54,160
And of course, this is a big problem because it's not you know, it's kind of moderately effective.

420
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,670
And the effectiveness of the vaccine varies from season to season,

421
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,170
which means you'd have to do one study that like is determining the vaccine effectiveness in that population.

422
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,840
And another study that has vaccine probe kind of in the same area opens up problems for flu anyways.

423
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:18,580
But for other diseases, you can do it. So here, vaccine group studies, we have vaccine preventable illness,

424
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,860
which is incidents in the control minus incidence and intervention of the vaccinated individuals.

425
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,850
We're looking at an absolute difference. You can also do a vaccine efficacy trial where we do a relative measure, right?

426
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:38,020
The incidence and control minus the incidence in the intervention over the incidence in the controlled symptoms done.

427
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,080
One minus the relative risk or odds ratio.

428
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,160
All right. So one example here is a study that was done.

429
00:44:49,970 --> 00:45:01,140
This was actually a study that was done to look at cholera. But then people went back and reanalyzed the data to look at tetanus and neonatal death.

430
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,960
And the reason that they did that was they just you know, there's something in the data.

431
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,359
They're like, okay, we should look at that.

432
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:19,129
And there was a big question around one versus two doses of tetanus vaccine and how much mortality would really prevent of the population.

433
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:28,010
Right. There's always a cost effectiveness calculation that occurs when you're rolling out any intervention, but particularly vaccines.

434
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,480
And of course, the calculation is different depending on a lot of different factors in different countries.

435
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:44,030
So here anyways, they compared here in black is cholera here in kind of dotted light or gray is tetanus.

436
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:51,589
And what you can see is that there's a period, particularly here from like seven up to like 14 days,

437
00:45:51,590 --> 00:46:02,600
maybe a little bit before that where or a day 4 to 14 are where babies that were born to mothers that have been vaccinated with

438
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:12,140
the cholera vaccine were at much increased risk compared to babies born to mothers who have received the tetanus vaccine.

439
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:19,760
And so that's a pro-vaccine probe study. So they weren't sure entirely what, you know, like what proportion of infant deaths are due to tetanus.

440
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:26,330
But using this study design, they can figure that out, and then they could do a cost effective effectiveness analysis.

441
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,160
They also looked at in this particular study,

442
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:36,290
they looked at one versus two doses because people because people were randomized to one or two doses of the cholera vaccine.

443
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,470
You also had people getting randomized to one or two doses of the tetanus vaccine,

444
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:45,140
even though that kind of going to rule for that vaccine was two doses.

445
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:52,339
Right. And so what they saw was there wasn't a big difference in the effectiveness, I think, for the first whatever period.

446
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,819
But then after 20 months, one dose of the tetanus vaccine did not provide any protection to infants born in the future.

447
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,250
Right. Because they're vaccinating non-pregnant women and then following them forward to see what happens.

448
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:10,550
There you go. All right.

449
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:18,080
So that's vaccine probe studies. We've also got clustering in cohort studies.

450
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,790
So sometimes clustering is purposely included in the design of a cohort study

451
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,280
that allows one to examine the roles of household versus community transmission,

452
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,520
for example. So if you want to look at what's happening in different settings, should purposely put clustering in.

453
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:39,770
But you can other other clustering as well. You could do schools and the general population, etc.

454
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,129
So seasonality in cohort studies, it's possible,

455
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:53,930
although I would say my ideal to limit cohort studies to follow up during the disease season for diseases that exhibit a strong seasonality.

456
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,560
One common design is to follow kids through the school year.

457
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:04,520
And one reason that that's pretty common is it's pretty easy to monitor for school absences, right?

458
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:10,870
Then to go in and like be like you, you know, Johnny or Sue or whatever, you know, they stay home today.

459
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:13,420
Do they have a fever? Do they have a cough?

460
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:20,630
You can kind of check for your your criteria and then go in and collect a sample if they meet your testing criteria.

461
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,200
So it's a little more efficient, kind of a cheaper way to do it.

462
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,790
It's going to require fewer resources than year round studies.

463
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,319
A limitation, of course, is that some cases are missed because even if there's a strong seasonality,

464
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:40,940
cases can occur outside of the season and then incidence will be expressed as cases per person season.

465
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,550
So with that, we will take a five minute break.

466
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,090
Well, actually, 8 minutes will take 8 minutes, come back at 11.

467
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:06,562
Then we'll come back, have a few slides, and then we'll have the in-class activity. Yeah.
