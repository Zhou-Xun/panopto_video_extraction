Welcome to Epit 634 as a module on estimating the reproductive number.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,820
This module at present different ways to estimate the reproductive number.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:26,070
The learning objective of this modules to describe three approaches test meet the reproductive number using individual data,

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:34,540
epidemic data and endemic data. First, let's start with estimating are not from individual data.

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,600
We can define a contact with the potential for transmission as a casual contact,

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,990
which is important for respiratory diseases, or we can define a contact as a sexual encounter.

7
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:54,820
Important for sexually transmitted diseases in general is always important to define with specificity.

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:05,160
The definition of a contact for covered this definition may be being within six feet of someone for more than 15 minutes.

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,960
Here's a plot of a social network that can be attained through conducting surveys.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,600
A survey may ask, for example, whom have you been within six feet for more than fifteen minutes in the past week?

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:30,730
This question then defines a social network. Again, we need a clear definition of contact to make this approach operational.

12
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:38,200
We can also estimate our not for vector borne diseases by collecting data on mosquitoes, including biting rate density,

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:48,610
survivorship latency and infectivity coupled with data on humans, including duration of infectiousness and infectivity.

14
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,060
Here we see the data needs for estimating there are not for two parts of transmission.

15
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:03,370
First is humans transmitting the mosquito's important data to characterize this includes mosquito density,

16
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:13,590
am biting rate, hay, duration of infection within a human daewon and the probability of infecting a mosquito.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,940
H to. The second part is mosquitoes transmitting to humans.

18
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:30,970
These data include the fraction of mosquitoes surviving latency here represented as E to the minus tower.

19
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:40,860
You to where Tao is the latency and U2 is the mosquito mortality rate.

20
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,780
The another piece of data is the mosquito biting rate.

21
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,150
Hey. And then there is also the duration of infection within a mosquito D2.

22
00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:04,080
And the probability of infecting a human H1. So we can use these data presented in the prior slide to create an equation for our NOT.

23
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:14,380
Again, the definition of our not is the number of human infections that one infected human causes while it is infectious.

24
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:23,380
The first part of the equation estimates the number of mosquito infections, one human causes.

25
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:34,980
Which is the product of the contact rate, infectivity and duration of a human, the duration a human is infectious.

26
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:43,570
The contact rate in this circumstance is the per mosquito biting rate times, the number of mosquitoes and times.

27
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:54,420
If we multiply this by infectivity of a human. We get the rate of biting that successfully results in a human infection.

28
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,500
If we multiply this by the duration in which a human is infectious,

29
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:09,240
we get the total number of infections due to one infected human or the number of mosquito infections per human.

30
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,760
Next, we want to look at the mosquito to human transmission.

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:26,520
If we multiply this quantity, the number of mosquito infections per human by the mosquito biting rate and the infectivity,

32
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,580
we get the number of successful human infections per time. If we then multiply this quantity.

33
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:44,570
By the duration of the mosquito. We get the total number of human infections caused by one infected human.

34
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:53,660
We need to multiply this quantity by one. This one added term heat to the minus Tao mue.

35
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,150
Which represents a portion of mosquitoes that die before becoming infectious.

36
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,260
Of note is that all the variables, except for the duration of infections,

37
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:17,290
is in humans and the infectivity of humans are internal logic variables and therefore requires data on mosquito behavior in biology.

38
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,710
So another approach to estimating are not using population level data.

39
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:32,150
For example, both the initial phase and final phase of an outbreak contain information that allows you to estimate are not.

40
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:41,030
First, let's look at the initial exponential phase of an epidemic. We go back to our DADT equation from our side, our model.

41
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:48,080
We can make some assumptions that allowed us to estimate or not during the initial phase.

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,760
We can both, one, ignore the vital dynamics, birth and death.

43
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:01,400
Since we're looking generally, we're generally looking at short timeframes where few deaths and births occur.

44
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,200
We can assume that most people are susceptible. Since the case count is small.

45
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:18,710
Therefore, we can assume that S is approximately one. So our DADT equation simplifies the data minus Delta Times, I guess, shown here.

46
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,320
This isn't as simple first order differential equation we have seen many times.

47
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,280
The solution is an exponential function where the rate of increase is Beda minus gamma.

48
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:41,180
With a little algebra and using the are not equals Beda over Delta relationship, the rate of increase is Delta minus Delta.

49
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,110
Times are not minus one.

50
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:56,290
As we have done with the exponential population dynamic models, we can look at the time TSD that when the infected population is doubled.

51
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:06,430
We do this by replacing I on the left hand side of the equation with two times I not, and we label that doubling time T sub D,

52
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,890
we can then take the natural log of both sides and solve for our not,

53
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:20,730
which equals two log to the natural log of two over Delta times the doubling time plus one.

54
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:28,890
What this relationship means is that if we can estimate the doubling time of an exponential increase in cases from the data,

55
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,530
we can then estimate or not.

56
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:42,800
This is basically the approach people have used to estimate are not for Kobe 19, which has been estimated to be around 2.5.

57
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:51,410
We can also estimate our not. If we have information on the final size of the satellite population after an epidemic,

58
00:07:51,410 --> 00:08:00,050
this equation for our NOT is a function of the number of initial susceptible pop number of initials susceptible.

59
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,450
Has not. And as infinity, the final number is susceptible.

60
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,200
We can get information on the set of the population from Cedro surveys.

61
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,230
This equation comes from a relationship that I presented in the prior essay, our lecture,

62
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:26,230
where we created a differential equation, DST are we're asked and of receptacles and are the number of removed or immune.

63
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:34,950
This approach is best used for relatively short outbreaks where the end of the outbreak is definable.

64
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,560
We can also estimate are not from endemic data.

65
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:46,580
Based on the estimate of this steady state, fractionate susceptible is which we get from serologic data.

66
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,400
We know from our Nelkin analysis that R is equal to one over the fraction susceptible.

67
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:02,070
That steady state. If we remember in the essay, our model has infinity is equal to Bay Delta, plus mbewe over data.

68
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:14,120
And we realize that are not is equal to BITA over Delta plus new therefore are not as equal to one over the fractions susceptible as steady state.

69
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:25,550
Alternatively, it turns out that based on age, specific prevalence data are not as equal to one plus the average lifespan of an individual.

70
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,850
Well, divided by the average age to infection A.

71
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:40,440
We can heuristically derive this relationship by referring back to the steady state value of high, high infinity from our I say our model.

72
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:50,880
Here we here it is written out. Given that the average life expectancy al is one over the mortality rate mewe and that

73
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,910
the average age to infection is one over the force of infection or Beda times infinity.

74
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:06,900
We can make the substitution. So that's equated to this equation and get the following equation for one over the average age to infection solving.

75
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:17,650
For our NOT, we get the relationship that are not is equal to one plus L over a deetz shows a more rigorous derivation

76
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:26,985
of this relationship and this juristic derivation which I presented as shown in the heath code reference.
