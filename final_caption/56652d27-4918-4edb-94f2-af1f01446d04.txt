1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,300
Okay. I'm ready. Make interviewing Jordan Clements for this position.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,610
Jordan, why are you interested in this position?

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,549
I'm really interested in hospital work because I would like to eventually go into the health care field.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,980
After I complete both of my master's degrees. I found that through my studies in sustainability and public health that there's a lot of upstream

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,940
measures that could be taken in health care to have better health outcomes down the line.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,710
I think health care is a little bit deleterious and then it waits until the very, very diagnosis and points of disease in order to treat people.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,260
And I want to be a catalyst in making that change.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,510
So I'm hoping to come into the university health services and sort of get a footing in how health care works.

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,970
I don't have a ton of experience in health care logistics,

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,190
so I think that getting that footing and then going to medical school after I finish up this job position will be super beneficial for both me,

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,150
myself and the health care field in bettering health care for patients.

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,760
Well, that sounds lovely. Jordan, what are some of your strengths?

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,990
So I'm a very work oriented person.

14
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,760
I also really love to learn and apply my knowledge and it's getting two master's degrees before coming into the work field.

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,770
I think I can use my wealth of knowledge in order to apply unique perspectives to issues.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,249
I think a lot of people in health care very focus on health care specifically,

17
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,270
and I bring in outside factors such as sustainability and environmental science that I can use to provide better outcomes.

18
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,620
I'm also a big team player. I love working in teams of people.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,490
I tend to gravitate towards leadership roles, so I would love to have that opportunity in this company if possible,

20
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,540
and sort of just have it all work together and bring their unique perspectives to fruition.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,259
Oh, you sound very capable of this position, but can you tell me some of your weaknesses?

22
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,580
Yeah, so weaknesses because I tend to take leadership positions.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:08,910
I can be very hard headed and very focused and on my own perspective and have a tendency to think like my way or the highway.

24
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:16,379
I know this is an issue about four years ago or so, like during my undergrad career to combat this,

25
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,530
I actually at the University of Michigan created a workshop that goes on to this day called Interprofessional Panel.

26
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,360
I was specifically focused in health care where I brought in nurses, pay social workers and physicians,

27
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,910
and they all spoke about what they can do in the health care fields and how they can better health care itself.

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,970
And so just acknowledging that my peers do also have unique perspectives and unique backgrounds

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,320
and using them to my best ability and not just sticking with my way or the highway.

30
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,180
Very nice. And the last question I have for you is why should we hire you over other capable applicants?

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,110
So I already have some experience working with Michigan Medicine.

32
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,550
I worked through the medical school in the ob gyn department over the past summer, and I've been continuing to do that work up until today.

33
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,190
And I'm a very dedicated person.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm going to have three degrees from there and two master's degrees, which I think makes me a highly competitive applicant.

35
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,890
I also have experience working with UVM faculty.

36
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,700
This past year I presented to all the faculty at the medical school about sustainability practices in medicine,

37
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,700
so I already kind of have that footing, understand what is already done at the hospital right now and understand what could

38
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,300
be brought in so many perspectives that I could specifically bring into this role.

39
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,440
Well, Jordan Clements, thank you for your time. Thank you.

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
We'll get back to you soon. Thanks.
