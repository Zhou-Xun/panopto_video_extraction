1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,050
That's fair. Has he been letting you out earlier? No.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,530
Well, you know what else they charge for?

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:15,360
I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, I guess he's right now.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,170
They dropped ten points yesterday.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:36,540
Supply and demand is very little conversation for both of us.

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,920
First, let me ask you, you any.

7
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:10,079
And I was going to say, you know, started with what skills, if you have any you know what, we are going to start working on preparation.

8
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:20,310
Our knowledge is forecasting. And in order to do that, we are going to work for free.

9
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:40,320
And so I would open free we are together right type of thing one today and they are they are problems being preventing a linear linear programing,

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,260
rapid progression prevention and seasonality.

11
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,890
So we're going to be in Cincinnati also on tomorrow.

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,540
Tomorrow evening, I'm going to send you a tweet.

13
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:08,870
And for you to be done with that, there is be a first person who delivered that.

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:22,350
Well done, really well done. Gets ten points in the midterm exam, much better than brownies, but it's just one price.

15
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:41,940
All right. So one thing I would like to point out is you have a notice.

16
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,360
We have something called my learning analytics here in my learning analytics.

17
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,230
So it shows me what kind of resources you are using in this site.

18
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,470
Like, for example, the problem, 97% need to access the problem set or forecasting.

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,680
If I if I just take the files out and I go to the videos.

20
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,290
Introduction to Forecasting Only 55% from you, right?

21
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,660
Video Simple moving average 34% weight.

22
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:32,729
Wait obviously 4% and so you see that they that immediately file and the engagement data so get to it

23
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:43,230
please that's that's the idea because if you don't go on this scheme that we use to use your phone,

24
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:55,650
I'm not ready for it. So you think you go in here and listen to me and then remember that that is your 3 hours in a week?

25
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:04,170
And in order to master these these technique and understand them well, you need to practice, practice, practice.

26
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,800
And it needs to that from many different angles.

27
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:22,980
So really beneficial instruction here so that the any in the videos I have more time to go through the problem is 3 hours per week here so you have.

28
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,030
You know, it is. I would say it's more rounded.

29
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,209
No. And it's still exposure to the topic.

30
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:43,110
If you to me, I said you would think that would be fine.

31
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:54,480
So I keep I will keep monitoring it and I will keep to all the old things about how what kind of resources are used.

32
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,860
But right now, I am very impressed with your participation in class.

33
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,550
I'm not that impressed with the engagement with the venue.

34
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,450
And so. All right.

35
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,910
Okay, let's. Let's go.

36
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:29,580
I'm going to. Former number three on any notice to try to hover over three.

37
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,400
We are going to we have a different problem to solved.

38
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:45,210
So we're going to start with, let's say 1110 and go into Chapter 11.

39
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,910
So is use for regression analysis to be a linear operating model to the data.

40
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,760
That is, the small business data they want that we've been using since the beginning of life.

41
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:19,740
And what is the estimated regression function in third grade where your model for a paragraph comparing it to etc.?

42
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,140
Okay, so let's, let's get to go one by one.

43
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,460
And if we cover what we going to fail?

44
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,540
Okay. And then we're in small business here.

45
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,030
And now we are going to go into.

46
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:20,400
And what we have done in the past is we just simply copy the data or either replicated the page or in this case, the musical data.

47
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:30,860
And then you see these figures.

48
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,570
And we have our data set. And if you remember, we want to remember how the data looks like.

49
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:58,100
I am going to highlight the dataset I highlighted by selecting then all become visible and then we can all see that now and then.

50
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:06,470
Right now I can go on a monthly insert and.

51
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,990
It's got a lot less to do with the market.

52
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:26,830
So we have done several forecasting will use several forecasting techniques with with this data set.

53
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:34,780
The first of all, these techniques that we use, we're moving up records that we decided that were not good for.

54
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,070
They were not they were not good for this data.

55
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:56,440
The data said with trend because in this case we now are using an average of the previous observation economic forecast in order to hear what he said.

56
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,870
And then three of these these two observations, the average will be here.

57
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:15,160
So we all will be always behind trying to catch up with the Time series.

58
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:24,819
Right. So so what we know is that moving average, it will always going to tend to underestimate in this case time series.

59
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,309
So because it's not a stationary time series.

60
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,299
So stationary techniques are not good words either.

61
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,250
Exponential smoothing? No, you know, weighted moving average.

62
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:51,900
Not that. Okay. But we used last time all movement like and involvement of we were able to model the time estimate in the interim.

63
00:09:51,910 --> 00:10:04,750
And in this case you remember that the end for all the trend is the the tendency or the amount that the time series growth will be vehicle.

64
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:18,010
That's what the definition of trend is, is, you know, how much the tendency is growth or or the our decline from one year to living in this.

65
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:25,630
And so we can extrapolate the trend over here or here depending on what time to we we got

66
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:35,020
you know this is after a huge that not you keep instead of related that trend but that's

67
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,530
one technique currently works well another technique that we can use is look at these time

68
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:50,770
series and try to fit in straight line through that time series that best fit the old,

69
00:10:52,270 --> 00:11:10,240
you know, all of these. But so we are going to try to come up with something on the form of equal to the constant.

70
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,390
Low, low, high peak.

71
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:28,960
So this is going to be a constant that the intercept of that line that I'm going to

72
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,920
and I'm going to just give me and be want is going to be this low over that line.

73
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,730
So I'm going to try to get that baseline that looks like.

74
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,490
Straight line that just might be, and then somehow move that line.

75
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,420
So it's as close as possible to the observation.

76
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,450
So I wait to minimize them. It's the people that you want.

77
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:06,260
In this case, I'm going to be changing me, not being able to minimize them.

78
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,379
So I'm going to do that right now two ways.

79
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,730
I'm going to use the same method that we have been using before women all use.

80
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:30,410
So they're only going to get the best of it. See that it is more or less obviously we can we're going to get the best line that we possibly can

81
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:38,870
and then we are going to use that regression package that is in Excel to do the same operation.

82
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,890
But what I want you to to understand is the same thing.

83
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,690
So what we have been doing before minimizing the regression rate.

84
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,420
So and again.

85
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,770
So if I tell you that because.

86
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:23,580
Yeah. I'm going to I'm going to get two parameters B zero, which is going to be the intercept and the one that's going to be the slope.

87
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:31,170
And those are the two numbers. And I'm going to start by making that up.

88
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:38,520
If we know that the B note is the intercept intercept.

89
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:47,399
So that's where that line and my axis, let's say 250.

90
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:54,300
So, you know, look, that's a reasonable line that here going to be so vulnerable.

91
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,860
You're just guessing this low from one period.

92
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,340
This is stable slope here.

93
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:15,330
So from one year to the next, beta from 4 to 5, when do 390 to 400.

94
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:23,129
So let's say that is ten and you'll see us eyeballing and totally gets.

95
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:30,810
Indeed. But it doesn't matter because I'm going to start by guessing that line.

96
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:40,780
So now I'm going to put it per my progression forecast at any time.

97
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:54,090
Right. Okay.

98
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,830
And in the linear trend, what I'm going to do is I'm going to replicate,

99
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm going to use the Formula B non plus be one times I and I will be as thick as the equation are I want to fit so.

100
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:27,260
The sales. You've got to love your eyes.

101
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,980
He loves what, blue?

102
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,260
And they're a term that I kind of forecast.

103
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,900
Right. So what needs to be in an equation?

104
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,629
The invalid equation.

105
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:55,020
So I'm not going to be able to get that line perfectly because there are some things that I cannot account for and that's ever apparent.

106
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,630
And that's why they. Missy's going to be perfect. I'm going to do so.

107
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,340
And then I'm going to put my in.

108
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:15,960
Seeing here is going to be equal to the speed of the linear transfer.

109
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:40,270
And so this is going to be equal to E not and this is going to be done and I am going to drop that with function for what's in one of these images.

110
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:51,359
And then I coming in here, which is what I want to do is get in only short of time.

111
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:00,810
So if I know the time, I know approximately where they say I'm at right now.

112
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:16,200
So one thing that I need to speak here and just to make sure I don't have a lot of decimals, I'm going to press of the decimal point.

113
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:26,340
So this is going to be a number we need to know all this, you know, just in case I'm going to use this thousand separator,

114
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:36,030
know that we're going to get to the thousand and then I'm going to you replicate the formula.

115
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,080
And then we got our forecast and we have our linear regression forecast.

116
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,580
And now I'm going to plot that to see how it looks.

117
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,090
Here they your screen.

118
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:27,860
And we hope to activate the grant and going to is based on series columns, series names in the first row, its values in the first column.

119
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:39,410
Not very good. So in the end, apparently the slogan was The Death Rate and the Intercept.

120
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:49,690
So let's see now. So so the idea is that if you change this number, let's say oh to 60.

121
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,590
And we both know what it does to.

122
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:13,300
So, you know in the line walk certainly bed and let's say if I increase the slope instead of 1015.

123
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,190
So we change the slope of the debate and that should be making things better.

124
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:27,300
But we don't know how much better they are because we haven't completed it's the right sort of thing.

125
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:40,390
Equal to some of its line lines for their open parentheses.

126
00:19:41,230 --> 00:20:00,270
And then I would compare the sales and he was number over and something was printed and I would be right about income.

127
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,120
Anybody they can look.

128
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,450
In this case because I'm trying to minimize nine.

129
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,570
I can not be by the count because it's a constant.

130
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:34,590
And then they just are minimized in some of a square area, which is the same they may see is important.

131
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,790
So divide it by the number of observation is important.

132
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,300
When we want to compare different methods and different methods by use,

133
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:50,940
different number of observations because like moving average means discard so many observations in the past.

134
00:20:51,780 --> 00:21:01,409
So you don't want your measure of the goodness of field to be affected by the number of observation that you have.

135
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,809
You want to get information in this case,

136
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:13,260
what we trying to do like that is the same if we minimize the ABC or simply not divide by the count and minimize the is asleep.

137
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,720
It's almost wherever but we are. We are used to the way we see and that's what we're doing.

138
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,760
So look at these numbers, 12 to 20.

139
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:33,719
Let's see if we can make it better about if I go with 20, here now is 3314.

140
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:43,670
So we made it worse, right. So the idea is if you start playing around with these two numbers, then, you know,

141
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,860
you stop when you are kind of satisfied that this number is as small as you can get it.

142
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,730
But we are not going to do this manually, not we solve them.

143
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:03,300
So we are going to minimize them and see by changing this to another data.

144
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:25,379
So the convenience of what we want to do, see, I at least minimize these eyes and we want to change e one and and that's it, right?

145
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:35,130
So we don't have any constraints. So we know that we want B one can be positive or negative, which is this low in terms of the nine,

146
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,030
as we know, all of these names are said to be not the is where the time is serious in zero.

147
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:53,130
And that can be positive or negative. Right. Because what we're saying is, you know, these series didn't you know, wasn't he said,

148
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,899
you know, what's in that round or or at times zero within the observed out of zero.

149
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,200
We observe it on video ten and 11. So what happens is just an extrapolation so it doesn't apply.

150
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:18,250
So you didn't have to put any constraint here. Being in make constraint very vocal or negative less clear is because we didn't can

151
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,960
they can be negative and then that's it so minimize they're busy by changing you know

152
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:34,410
be one and I think we get this is the best fit of the data and it says that B not

153
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:45,540
a first step is going to be three 12.1 the best intercept and the B one is 12.22.

154
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:57,929
So it's time series zeros by 12.22, units A for every every year, whatever it is, the unit that we're standing on,

155
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:11,490
the demand that we're looking for, whatever and the best MSE that we have is for 35.71 thing and so.

156
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,750
Yeah, we could do that. And you know what we just did?

157
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,600
We did a regression analysis. This is linear regression.

158
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,910
That's it.

159
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:35,380
And then when you you get into a package and put, you know, I want to do a regression that these are my trigger answers and this is my data.

160
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:45,160
And so what they're doing is that minimizing the ABC, getting the best fit for your data, for the function that you are, you are feeding.

161
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:52,810
And most of the time we have a linear function with a trend, linear trend.

162
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,520
So we make it a little bit more complicated, but it's exactly the same thing.

163
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,550
All right. So now let's do the same thing.

164
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,409
But using their regression model and use, remember these numbers.

165
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,990
So you know what I'm going to do.

166
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:31,410
I'm also going to get that is as e the sum of the square anchor not sure your name is that c the sum of that square adder is going to be the.

167
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,850
So I'm okay. My life where there's nothing.

168
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,330
And then I sail.

169
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,520
I'm doing the highlight. And so it's the same as the impossible.

170
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:59,900
Without dividing by. Without normalizing that by the number of observations, not an average is going to be the sum of the square.

171
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,040
So 87 for dealing these things.

172
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,320
Now I am going to copy these numbers.

173
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:24,300
Well, maybe. Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to copy this number, but also I am going to be the word I will not copy.

174
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,140
I'm going to copy this page so we don't lose that.

175
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:37,550
I'm to. Code that you never want to point that to the other side.

176
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:56,960
And then now what I'm going to do is I'm going to try calling you, and I want the table and place where it doesn't bother me.

177
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,730
The observations will not pay special. That's going to be only values, right?

178
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:21,550
That's what I want you to remember what those values were. And then I'm going to erase those values from my information.

179
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:27,370
And they're like the forecast in light of the immediate threat.

180
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:34,130
And I'm going to reconstruct that later on.

181
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,120
But right now, I'm going to just the Eagles.

182
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:49,910
Right. All right. So in me now, we don't need all of these columns.

183
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,740
Yeah. That's one.

184
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:18,260
Okay. Sure. Okay. So I have my linear trend and automatic sale and alignment and I don't want to throw labels to the label.

185
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,760
So those are questions. Yeah. So do we not need the values or the linear trends?

186
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,830
Well, we're going to reconstruct those, but using that regression package.

187
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,210
So with is it kind of manually or a manual regression?

188
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:41,810
So we're going to have we do the regression with that package in Excel and post-graduation.

189
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:53,240
So you can see we're going to say, okay, okay, so now I am going to do data.

190
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:03,680
Then you have an on top of solver of something called data analysis.

191
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,260
If you don't, you need to install the data.

192
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:19,710
And in order to do that, in these important pieces, there's, you know, instruction to wait for all the pieces you go to function.

193
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:31,820
Right. And then. In and then go on.

194
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,050
You should have an analysis to back and you have the analysis to capital check.

195
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:47,780
Just. And then, for God sake.

196
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,540
And then you should have environmentalist. A very good one.

197
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:10,700
I know this is an easy way to get the analysis to back change, you know, for oil sold or for sale in England.

198
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:17,550
But. So now when you have that this going into data analysis.

199
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:32,820
And a lot of things that you can do in your movie now or in Instagram and Cetera.

200
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:39,040
But I want to go into the aggression. Aggression and.

201
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,940
And then think, okay. No.

202
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:59,890
So if you remember from your basic stats and what we just did, what we're trying to get is try to explain the the Y range.

203
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:11,110
A, Y, the observations by a linear combination of the X is a in fact, sort of what we call the independent variable.

204
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,660
So we are trying to use the independent variables, combine them in a linear manner.

205
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,290
So we are going to use the constant times then the these X values and then we're

206
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:32,290
going to produce an estimation of my Y Republicans might say specialty zone.

207
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:43,670
And the so we have chosen in our case to represent that Y line sale by a linear print.

208
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:49,750
Right. So we're going to say we're not trying to think advanced straight line through the data.

209
00:31:50,140 --> 00:32:00,430
We could have used another functional form, but we use with the x one that will allow us to interpret the data.

210
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:06,790
So what we know in this case, what we want is, oh, he's not wanting to know this from one, right?

211
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:15,460
So and then we can see how good those forecasts are or, or not.

212
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:21,010
So I am going to get a wide range and a wide range is sales.

213
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:34,130
And I'm going to try to explain their way range by using just one X when you use time in this case here.

214
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:45,590
I want to make sure to note that my time series has labeled those two year and sales those are labeled.

215
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:56,260
If I don't do that, it is going to be interpreted as numbers and is going to it's going to give me a narrow audience,

216
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:03,740
but upward is year over year and is going to distort that regression.

217
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:15,680
So if I put labels in Excel, understand that the first line is it belongs to the names of the column, the name of the variable.

218
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:23,420
Now the output range. I can place my outs in another worksheet,

219
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:34,390
but I would like to place the output in the same spreadsheet and I want to ensure that I put that in place that goes in,

220
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:41,209
erase anything that I have written before. Then what do I want?

221
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,520
The output rate is fine. You are good, right?

222
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:56,850
Label on, but people pay.

223
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,840
And then I get my money.

224
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:11,250
So if you remember one over the weekend before three one, well, one and 12, 26, 23.

225
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,329
And those are the same thing we got into the regression, right?

226
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,490
Because they're gradually doing exactly the same with you before.

227
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,370
So but you give us a lot of more detailed statistics, at least to November three, 13,

228
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:35,640
12.1 and 22, and exactly the same number that we got, you know, we sold better minimized.

229
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,190
Then it seems like we were doing regression all along.

230
00:34:47,450 --> 00:35:03,130
And let's see. We see that some of the square area here is the same.

231
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,260
So all of this square at or you have. Yeah, right.

232
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,910
So this is the total sum of square.

233
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:26,410
This is the total sum of the square. And that this is that received well, some square and it's number two.

234
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:34,300
So I'm going to I'm going to show you. What is that what we what we mean by that.

235
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,370
So I.

236
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,060
So I'm going to do a very sketchy plant here.

237
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:08,350
On. I'm going to point out several data points when we do these in.

238
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,750
Right. Those are going to be my data point here.

239
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:21,620
You know, here we are here.

240
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,910
And then I am going to do my regression analysis, the best line that characterize all these information.

241
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,490
And I mean, we have been. Yeah.

242
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:47,980
I say that. My best line to make. That's the best regulation line.

243
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:59,930
I minimize amendment. So now what I want you to notice is that that line is not perfect.

244
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,570
It doesn't go through all the big data points.

245
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:13,400
So we have errors where we have to appear.

246
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,030
Here. No error here.

247
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:28,630
Right. It will always be that this stems from that line, too.

248
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,180
I made the observation.

249
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,940
Is this what we call an error rate? So it is my my error for each observation.

250
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:52,490
Now, now, let's imagine that there is is a horizontal line that goes through the average of all of this observation.

251
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,510
And that is going to be doing.

252
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:19,650
That's a horizontal line. So this is a horizontal line that goes through the observation.

253
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:33,220
And let me get back to this observation here.

254
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:48,630
All right. So if. If you take a look at the.

255
00:38:51,910 --> 00:39:00,240
Those are the observations like this is that we have competition.

256
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,400
They enter time in different forms, in competition, in different groups.

257
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,700
And let's, for example, they can look at these narrow term.

258
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:23,319
So these are our terms. Has it been a part of that?

259
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:35,720
Or it goes from the line, right the line to the observation from the line to the observation.

260
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,680
This is what we call the triangulation pattern with.

261
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:59,090
So they did the line that aggression dealing captured and they were their real observation was.

262
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:21,470
And then we also have the distance from the line so we have the distance from the regression line to this center line.

263
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,090
And we call that the.

264
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:54,480
It's a function. And then we have the old doll in the end, or from the observation to that center line.

265
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:11,400
And we are going to hold that for some, you know, later, we're going to pull that pulled the arrow.

266
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:31,540
And then what we want to show here is that the total sum of square.

267
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:44,920
That the total sum of the square. Is equal to the functions somewhat squared.

268
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:09,840
And it you on one square which is going from these number these is going to.

269
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:22,450
It's going to be close. The.

270
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:43,299
Migration some. I mean, let me make let me do it and do this because sometimes these you know,

271
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:51,190
you we use, you know, positive or negative lessons from these number two,

272
00:42:52,330 --> 00:43:04,050
these number that's going to be let's say that that's going to be my total sum of squared, which is is the ratio.

273
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,150
So this is going to be the ratio of some square.

274
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,630
And then after the square.

275
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:25,680
But the point is that I want to part with when I partition those two elements.

276
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:32,400
I get the element. I get that they or divided in two parts.

277
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:43,860
I want to figure out what is the portion of the total sum of square that is explained by that regression?

278
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:53,610
And what is that? Then there is out of all the all the variability here,

279
00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:01,889
what is the proportion of that in terms of the total sum was where it is explained by aggregation.

280
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:07,920
So these these point is here what it should be here and the average.

281
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:21,300
And then what we have done is try to explain that point by the regression line and we have then the rest is going to be.

282
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,810
And you know, and after that, we cannot explain. So what?

283
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:39,920
Part B is explained by the regression line is what we are, you know, what we were concerned about.

284
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:48,890
And that in PI is is this part these parts that are dimensions on those.

285
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:58,700
Well and if we just divide that animation somewhat squared by the total sum squared and we figured out what is

286
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:06,920
the portion of the total regression that is explained by the total error that is explained by the regression.

287
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:15,530
That's what we call the R squared over much of the regulation line.

288
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:30,410
So these numbers here, so let me go back to the prediction of these number and try to do some forecast with this.

289
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:40,920
You feel like you're. U.S.

290
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:00,840
So the point is that we what we tried to do was minimize this number.

291
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,640
We tried to minimize the right ratio of someone squared.

292
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:15,720
And for me and minimize we we actually we tried to minimize the receivable somewhat as well.

293
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:21,690
And by making all their or be explained by that regulation.

294
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:27,000
So, okay, these numbers are not within a straight line.

295
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,820
They are not horizontal because we can explain they weren't driven to be because of that regulation.

296
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:43,050
That's not that's the point. If you think about the straight line, the average line is here.

297
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:09,620
I think that this is the line and these these and this is they say this is a.

298
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:26,490
At least this is a straight line that we find fit to the point he's built on point built on that front will be up to that point.

299
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,780
Here are these partition that we have in total.

300
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:43,310
As long as we're trying to say before the total sum square is equal to the progression, some square, these are mentioned somewhat squared.

301
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,910
Plus the anchor of some square or some the square.

302
00:47:51,870 --> 00:48:00,010
And what you want is that? Are you gonna change that?

303
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,160
Don't tell me.

304
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:12,850
What you want is to get the hydration somewhat squared as high as possible on the smallest possible called deferred to the total sum square.

305
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:22,840
So the so you can explain pretty much the viability of the time series by that regression and there is no more to be explained by the air.

306
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,900
So you can predict more accurately.

307
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:40,750
And if you divide that regulation sum squared by the total sum where that is what we call the are square.

308
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:52,540
That's probably the point. And so we do that for all the points and add them all.

309
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:10,830
No. So now that we have that our regression point here.

310
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,960
Let's go into our linear time and replicate that trend that we had before.

311
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:28,260
So if you remember, it was me, not enough is the intercept here.

312
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:44,790
And then I'm going to and for that he was the one and when was delivered here and multiply that times a year.

313
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,880
And I can. Replicate this.

314
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,580
I kind of it right over.

315
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:11,810
A lot of the activity, the crowds in Venice Beach feel.

316
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,180
And it's bodies in the first column.

317
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:44,750
And then here. And so now let me ask you this.

318
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:55,460
Suppose that I get all the points, all these blue points on average them, and then I get these these is the level.

319
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:03,110
So this is the average of all these blue dots that that horizontal line.

320
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:19,200
And how do you call the where if point is what is this to the.

321
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,980
I feel like I know these better because it doesn't have the issue.

322
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,850
Can you design how the call?

323
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:48,750
These hold these things from the blue line to the horizontal line.

324
00:51:52,470 --> 00:52:03,560
If I if I start is is that totally right does it total ever that you have in pain in your the total body of aliens.

325
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,810
So what we're trying to explain is the variance of the observation.

326
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:17,670
And the hypothesis is that first is why are these observations not in horizontal line?

327
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:24,150
Why are they? Why are they different? And then he's going to say, well, they're different for two things.

328
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,830
First, that's an explanatory thing, and they change with time.

329
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,660
And the second thing is that they so matter like.

330
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:45,900
So what we try to do is use regression to expand the first part and hope that does not explain most of the variability of this.

331
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:57,120
So what these number here here represent the total variability of the series.

332
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:12,000
And so if you do that for each one of those points then and then square them and some, then you get the total sum of squares.

333
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:26,070
But we know if you look at this, is that we are dividing, we are we are partitioning that total sum of squares into two different components.

334
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:32,300
The first one is here and the second one is here, too.

335
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:47,460
And component, the one I'm going to call the B from from the straight line to vs from from the horizontal line to this log, the one with this load.

336
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:53,360
I'm going to call that regression sum of squared or regression.

337
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,970
So that part of the total variability that is explained by that regression.

338
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,710
So we're going to call that our. Is it?

339
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:10,570
And then then the rest.

340
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:20,559
That is going to be from these point to this point is going to be my error term in the regulation.

341
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:28,180
Right? So I didn't catch it. But the difference between the two is that the error of something square.

342
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,780
So we've got the sum of squared.

343
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,280
Yeah.

344
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:54,130
And what you are going to be well served in these number accounts for all these three obviously because if these number is huge compared to this one,

345
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:04,180
then you are not going to be able to forecast accurately because this is when you are trying to find the best progression possible.

346
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,840
So in order for us to figure out how good your forecasts are going to be,

347
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:21,070
what we trying to do is find the proportion of the total sum squared that is explained by the integration.

348
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,230
What is the proportion of the variance of the information that is explained by that?

349
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,640
And then now we just need to do that.

350
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:45,310
Station some was where divided by the total sum squared is a proportion and we called that R squared,

351
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:54,160
which is they are proportion of the total in the total variability of the period that is

352
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,380
explained by that regression and is a number we both cause is how we can do this number.

353
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,230
The. Just how low can these numbers be?

354
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,670
They are they are all squares, right?

355
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:19,549
So it's not often the square is divided by that based on someone's worldview, by the way, they focus on the square.

356
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,810
So how long we can be?

357
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:38,290
How low a not negative number can be. Zero in a negative number.

358
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,709
The low is zero, so it cannot be negative range.

359
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:49,030
So again, the lowest can be zero and is zero when the regression so squares is zero.

360
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:56,560
That means I'm not explaining anything. And what about how high it can be?

361
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,930
And one. Right. Because the same proportion of the total sum was squared.

362
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,520
So the highest it can be is one day regression.

363
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:19,980
Someone squares is equal to the square. I mean, set perfectly for MSE zero in this case.

364
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:24,569
Right. So they are squared in that case is equal to one.

365
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:31,800
So are squared that represent the proportion of the total variability of the theory of the total variability

366
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:40,090
of your observation that is explained by that regression you sent over between zero and one and the day.

367
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:51,770
The better your regression is. In explaining all these points, the higher there is always going to be an a perfect square.

368
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,749
It has to be equal to one, which means that you don't have any errors on the square.

369
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:04,140
And if you don't have any errors over square, that means that you are missing that case in zero three.

370
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:14,340
So that said, the same concept that is that is planing, but in this case,

371
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:21,810
you see that the in total the total sum was where it is going from these point,

372
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:32,939
right from this point to this line and then is the same equations, but it looks like they don't go so much square.

373
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,920
It is smaller than that.

374
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:53,400
And if I see what someone squares is from the I'm from the line this is very similar of square and this is B is this from here to here?

375
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,110
Is there a single someone square? Right. And then from the line to the regulation.

376
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:08,540
That's that regulation. Someone somewhere. I mean, those, you know, is the same equation.

377
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:15,350
But, you know, sometimes you get you know, you play with it.

378
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:29,420
The argument has to be made. There's some there's some a lot of positive numbers, but we can go minus that portion.

379
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:35,470
APPLAUSE God, fortune. Even though you know what that means,

380
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:45,559
that these you I think that these laws here is is that getting any class that

381
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:54,530
can be negative or positive any more algebraically is going to make sense.

382
00:59:54,950 --> 01:00:03,559
So the the issue that I had in the beginning is that I think important thing is that it was easier it more difficult to

383
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:14,980
explain these relationships now know when when the total sum of squares is in my being two three third and a receiver.

384
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:28,070
I've done that at the end of some square the total sum and it was easier to do pretty good so.

385
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:40,740
Let's get. Now that we know these these values, they can.

386
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:59,820
What is the estimated regression function on an indefinite square value for your model graph?

387
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,800
Comparing the linear trend predictions.

388
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:13,020
You know, what are the forecasts for the next two years using the technique and then feeding whether I can compare that?

389
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,890
So let me let me go through some of these points.

390
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:34,780
You need to go to some of these points that pass through here.

391
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,990
So what is the equation?

392
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:52,510
What is the regression function? That. All that aggression from Europe is what we're trying to do, what aggression function is a baseline.

393
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,610
And so this is trying to predict sales to sales.

394
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:10,470
I'm happy and I'm going to give you half here.

395
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:23,100
So he is the man himself. Meaning that we're not counting for the rights issue is important to have the nod which is 312.

396
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:30,730
41 laws 1.23.

397
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:44,889
I'm the. So you give me a D, I tell you my what?

398
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,970
The sales are going to be closest. Guess of what I would say.

399
01:02:51,550 --> 01:03:00,460
So if you if you tell me. Okay, I want to know what the sales for period 21 and 22 are going to be.

400
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:16,840
I simply have to extend this equation and it is going to be five, 69 and 45, 81.

401
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:27,740
Then you make sure that we have these forecasts and we know these these are two periods where.

402
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:42,330
Right. Okay.

403
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:54,660
And you want to see how they look over the years then that that trend line that's going through.

404
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:11,790
I like those two points and they may be the year I'm going to probably I'm going to activate the grab and paste special.

405
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:25,410
And the point. Right. And those two points are important.

406
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:30,810
And that's the points are my focus. All right.

407
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,720
So five, 69 and five anymore. So it says.

408
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:46,560
So I told you that, you know, we started with a different presentation of a straight line because is the easiest.

409
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:59,190
You only know the interface where the easiest function of the data to express liability growth in this case.

410
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:10,140
So remember that what we're saying is that the sales growth 12.23 year by year.

411
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:18,720
But what if the straight line is not the best way to describe the data?

412
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:28,160
So we can complicate the function. We can actually make the event the explanatory function instead of a straight line.

413
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,280
Keep more parameters so we can.

414
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:46,920
I just think for Richard Dieter, right after after a straight line, what is the next, you know, complicated polynomial that you can think of?

415
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,240
So if it is not linear and what is the next.

416
01:05:53,930 --> 01:06:06,110
My dreaded letter? I think so. We are going to use a quadratic thread to describe the data, so I need to see if it's worth it.

417
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:24,890
So essentially I'm trying to do something like this so that I and our equation is going to be something that.

418
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:39,150
Is equal to the union. On the one hand, he knows the two.

419
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:49,190
He's queer, right? So that will over time, this is a nonlinear function of time.

420
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:53,330
So it's a one routing function.

421
01:06:53,480 --> 01:07:03,140
And so we describe in time a series that is either going all faster than linear or is tapering down.

422
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:08,300
And the question is, what?

423
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:16,100
What type of geometric feature can you obtain with quadratic strength?

424
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:28,330
Whether I think from the first one is it was a straight line in one, those will not be one.

425
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:39,760
And this one when we put this where whether you think we get wet feet, you're going to be you're will see with our eyes.

426
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:56,560
If I look that way, the parabola is going to be about when I you know that the parabola itself is in the models so we can grow to a point.

427
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:03,190
The need for a gown or is it in there, opens up or open down this gate.

428
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:27,999
So essentially we are going to represent a function that is either goes to the who knows when inclined or is either you can be tilted a little bit,

429
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:46,200
but not in this case. Now let me then see whether I think trend and so times is you know is that sounds complicated because we're

430
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:54,990
using linear regression which means it will not be as linear in this case doesn't simply that regression is a.

431
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:04,170
And when we say the linear progression is that the parameters that we're going to

432
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:10,200
think of is a linear combination of the parameters from the observation going from,

433
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,320
say, sales.

434
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:26,760
It's important to not be one I used to be to Times Square.

435
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:32,260
You see these be not the ones that we to.

436
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:37,720
Those are the variables that we're trying to estimate.

437
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:46,640
And they are multiplied times. These numbers for us are constants because we know when they are.

438
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:59,780
Right. So and what we're trying to figure out is what we're trying to find is the best be one zero and the best two.

439
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:04,419
So these numbers are three previous constants.

440
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:11,410
And therefore, in, you know, in in the parameters, this process is linear.

441
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:19,110
So you can put B three times the qb4 times 2 to 4, whatever.

442
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:27,850
And it's still going to be a linear regression because things are amateurs that live in and try to fit on your own said linear,

443
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:34,690
linear fashion, even though the curve that they describe the trend that is great is not really.

444
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,710
And when that's through our weather, I think.

445
01:10:50,600 --> 01:11:01,360
So for doing that, what about the rain? We are we need to get the year next to the year square next to a year.

446
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:07,550
So all the X values, all the dependent variable need to be continued.

447
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:13,950
So let's insert. They went through the years where.

448
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:22,200
So you cannot control and then highlight different axes that they are adjacent in one word.

449
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,350
That's not an issue of progression,

450
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:40,160
is a few of the programmers that do this and in Excel and you can get more of the log than actually reveal that a feature.

451
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:49,040
Right. So you're. What do you.

452
01:11:51,880 --> 01:12:07,610
Now, I don't know where the eight year old is going to be able to do that here.

453
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:19,270
I know what I'm going to do is I am going to create a recreation and I want to produce clean sail with the year and years with.

454
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:24,250
Right. So I am going to call the regulation again.

455
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,060
It's going to be data, data analysis and then regulation.

456
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:53,100
And a wide range is going to be to a wide range that was going to be seen to see what's going to be explained so that the independent variables.

457
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:17,970
Are going to be during the years. 8 to 23 in the output and we need to put the output on plays of those and other video.

458
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:32,840
I have written before. So with my age 40 and again this number, my intercept is 21.

459
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:39,440
My year is 20 and the year square is 3.39.

460
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:48,720
That negative means that they are what I was going to be opening I to instead of going I know

461
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:58,460
from both of men is going to be old enough or maybe you will move very far in the future,

462
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:10,060
but eventually is better than nothing. So probably more than one can forecast in a in the future.

463
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:22,820
Too many, too many idiots because there's no reason to do so that these the blue points are going to decline after we give it.

464
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:28,010
The observation that we got is just we're trying to think that best friends or what we

465
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:39,380
have in view and extrapolate that if you produce these numbers now are going to be my new.

466
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:58,580
I knew and I'm going to go on and ride, I think the train.

467
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:35,330
And then I'm going to get into being not. We will function for those we want to see.

468
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:46,040
Your information for the year.

469
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:59,560
Lies. New York Square, formerly was used for the Times Square.

470
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:09,620
And let's get rid of this monster if you're going to compete with all that red

471
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:22,420
and white and let's actually forecast the medium these are going to extend.

472
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:37,820
These are the years where it's ten years from being introduced in the world that's worth having and working.

473
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:47,460
Now en route to drop in the blond. I'm going to look in your bag.

474
01:16:47,610 --> 01:17:00,890
Stick with me. I'm 19 years old and I think women are different from me.

475
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:16,460
To activate the special mode that's going to be new serious columns.

476
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,870
Names in the first row speaks volumes in the first column.

477
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,600
And. Yeah. So great.

478
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,910
Now, is is going to be my my quadratic friend.

479
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:38,890
So these are going to be these two numbers. I'm going to be like four guys with a friend.

480
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:50,310
So they're going to be go with a linear trend because according to the observations that I'm seeing, that the Time series is tapering down,

481
01:17:52,110 --> 01:18:06,630
you would see if that doesn't violate that assumption or it is worth including the one that I think is right.

482
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:13,050
So now I have my forecast with any New York trend is 569 and 581.

483
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:24,630
My forecast with what I think, because it's basically, you know, 542 and the question is which one we can use for God?

484
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:30,240
We are going to take a look at these statistics and see how they perform.

485
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:32,790
So look at these that linear trend.

486
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:45,060
They are where it is 192 some means that 92% of the variability of the series is explained by that frequency, by the linear path.

487
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:57,720
So it's YouTube. You'll do very well forecasting if the series continue through as the same as they went before,

488
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:10,740
because you were able to work 92% in the past the way you write them and this one 195%.

489
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:24,630
But you know, looking at Paris Square is not, you know, looking at R-squared compared to models.

490
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:35,459
It's not a sizable amount, which is not always really neat because the R-squared will always go up.

491
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:42,590
If you put more variables, it will never go down. Right. And you're pointing to more things to optimize for it.

492
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:52,740
And it will take advantage of that, even if they don't mean anything, you know, a random randomness, you your R-squared.

493
01:19:54,660 --> 01:20:02,100
But there is something else on the add jobs that are just weird and they are just scenarios where it can go up or down.

494
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:07,650
So and if you put more and more variables into your regression,

495
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:14,460
the adjusted R-squared can go up because you got explaining more of the variability

496
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,240
for income go down because you are making the equation more complicated.

497
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:28,889
So they said back to you is you take you look very well or you would know whether a regression,

498
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:33,930
a variable is worth 40 times the Times Square in the progression.

499
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:44,090
If you are just start it goes if it goes down and you find it previously I mean it pays less quickly

500
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:53,280
weekly used to I square based on 91 in the linear train and the I use that that's always point 83.

501
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,130
So whether I think it is and this is where they happen.

502
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:02,100
Great. So we'll continue our discussion next time.

503
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:11,080
I don't think we're going to be done with all the things that I went through on Thursday.

504
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,490
But I think we have with we've.

505
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:24,590
So I'm going to extend the deadline for you, I guess I.

506
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:38,150
I want to show you something.

507
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:54,600
I looked over here like 99, and I was like, oh, my God, I can actually see my face.

508
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,980
I wanted to see me.

509
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:26,950
I did actually like your first look at my mom's nightmare.

510
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:33,750
Something like that.

511
01:22:34,910 --> 01:23:06,560
Don't worry. Thursday night, somebody out on the street and I'm like, Oh, my God.

512
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:16,950
Yesterday I was like, Oh, my God.

513
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:24,680
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

514
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:33,530
I spent my summer out here. I will see you when I go back home.

515
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:38,230
I take a politician. I am on the other end right now.

516
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:51,020
But it has it seems that way out a.

517
01:23:52,260 --> 01:24:00,690
I mean, I know about it now because I talked about last night.

518
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:08,840
I think it was I have always been like very minimal.

519
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:29,980
Well, if you weren't really suffering yourself, you might use your recovery.

520
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,200
Oh.
