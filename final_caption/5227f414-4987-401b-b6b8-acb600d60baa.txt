1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,340
In this module,
we're going to delve

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,320
into more details involving

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,810
the Exposure-Disease
framework which again is

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,100
our tool that we use to link

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,440
exposures to health outcomes.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,220
So how often have
you sat and looked

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,330
at an article online or in
the newspaper and wondered,

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,470
"Well, gosh, they found
this new health effect from

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,720
some obscure chemical
in the environment.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,130
How did they actually prove to

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,560
themselves that that
relationship was true?"

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,870
The answer is our
exposure-disease models.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,340
So to get to that point,

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,675
we had to evaluate

15
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,120
a source of a contaminant
in the environment.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,940
We had to look how that
hazard or contaminant

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,230
moved through the environment to

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,940
come into contact with people.

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,710
Then, we had human exposure,

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,990
whatever made it
into people's body.

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,265
Was then the dose.

22
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:53,810
Then in the lower left corner we

23
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,440
have the adverse health effect,

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,365
whatever we're trying to avoid.

25
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:00,785
So again this framework is
very useful at letting us say,

26
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,660
'What is association between

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,670
this particular stressor and

28
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,625
this particular health outcome.

29
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,470
So I'm going run you through
a few definitions here,

30
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,880
because we haven't
really defined some

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,455
of these terms properly yet.

32
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,915
I've been using the word
hazard quite regularly.

33
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,580
What I mean when I say hazard is

34
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,575
a chemical, or a biological,

35
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,540
or a physical agent capable of

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,730
causing some biological response.

37
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,470
I put in set of conditions

38
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,300
there because injuries
are very much

39
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,940
relevant to environmental
health science and they're more

40
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,380
related to conditions in

41
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,195
the environment
not to a chemical,

42
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:34,985
or physical, or biological agent.

43
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,610
So I've given you
a few examples of

44
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,860
different types of
hazards in the past.

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,120
I'll give you a few more here.

46
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,805
A chemical, quite simply
is a chemical substance.

47
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,800
That could be something
as simple as water

48
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,050
which keep in mind
too much water,

49
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,590
or too little water are both
absolutely fatal to humans.

50
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,770
All the way to a more
complex chemical DDT,

51
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,610
or Bisphenol A, or another
chemical 1,4-Dioxane.

52
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,780
We're actually going to focus on

53
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,760
a lot later in the course.

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,500
A biological hazard is an animal,

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,110
or a plant, or a pathogen.

56
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,615
So we've already given
examples like tuberculosis,

57
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:11,150
or influenza, could
also be anything

58
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,320
from a monkey bite to getting
a rash from poison ivy.

59
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,855
In terms of physical
energy hazards,

60
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,590
these result from
energy that's being

61
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,395
transferred into your
body or within your body.

62
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:22,610
So we've already talked about

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,840
things like radiation, noise,

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,540
vibration, and to this I would

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,395
also add safety and
injury hazards.

66
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:31,290
In an earlier module,

67
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,715
we talked about some very
common day-to-day examples

68
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,890
of exposures to each of
these types of hazards.

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,149
So in terms of chemicals,

70
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:40,025
the cleaning products
in your home,

71
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,320
cigarette, smoke,
carbon monoxide,

72
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,240
all very common hazards.

73
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,460
In terms of biological hazards

74
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,930
from this list, unfortunately,

75
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,910
influenza is a common hazard

76
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,350
that many of us will encounter,

77
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,010
and unfortunately succumb
to during flu season.

78
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,150
We've also talked about
physical hazards.

79
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,280
I've gone through this list
already several times,

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,510
but this would
include things like

81
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,600
going to get a dental x-ray.

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,830
Again, we have to factor into

83
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,110
account all of these
hazards when we do

84
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,640
a comprehensive assessment of

85
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,170
the environmental risks that

86
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,975
a person or a population
is exposed to.

87
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,180
One of the key points that
we need to emphasize here,

88
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,560
and I've highlighted the
source as a red square here,

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,930
just like it is in the
Exposure-Disease framework,

90
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,490
is we need to acknowledge where

91
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,800
the hazards come from
in the environment.

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,870
I've already highlighted
the importance of

93
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,150
understanding sources and
the fact that we have

94
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,010
lots of different
sources we have to

95
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,580
account for: natural sources,

96
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,185
area sources, and stationary,
or mobile sources.

97
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,370
To this we can also add
anthropogenic sources.

98
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,855
So things can be from nature,

99
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,790
or they can be created by humans.

100
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,050
So again in EHS,

101
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,674
we need to understand all
the potential sources

102
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,180
of a hazard in the environment.

103
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,580
We also need to understand

104
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,860
the movement of pollutants
throughout the environment.

105
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,545
So here's an illustration
showing you,

106
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,360
for example, a chemical spill.

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,370
Those yellow drums
in the center of

108
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,380
the illustration are emitting

109
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,270
a cloud and also a puddle

110
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,640
of presumably a very
nasty chemical.

111
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,350
Well, how might people come into

112
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,370
contact with that chemical spill?

113
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,140
You can see a red arrow pointing

114
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,120
down showing that those
chemicals or that

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,890
chemical can leach down through

116
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,635
the ground into an
underground aquifer,

117
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,760
and we may then tap that
aquifer for drinking water.

118
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,230
So the person in
the upper right of

119
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,905
the illustration is drinking
now contaminated water.

120
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:30,320
Of course, the chemical
has gotten into the soil,

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,940
so on the left side of
the picture you can

122
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,920
see children playing in the soil.

123
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,810
They may get it on their skin,

124
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,815
and the chemical may get
into their body that way.

125
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,180
Finally, you'll see
an arrow pointing up.

126
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,995
So this chemical
could be volatile.

127
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:44,900
It may become a gas
or a vapor that

128
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,790
could float down wind and

129
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,110
ultimately get breathed in by

130
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,340
those children who are playing

131
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,915
on the right side of the picture.

132
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,705
So the movement of pollutants
can be quite complex,

133
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,550
but it's something we
absolutely need to

134
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,835
understand as part of our
Exposure-Disease framework.

135
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,630
The next box in

136
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,050
the Exposure-Disease
framework is human exposure.

137
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,430
So what I mean by that is

138
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,100
contact between
people and hazards,

139
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,710
and that contact changes
over time and it changes

140
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,590
over space making things
even more complicated.

141
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,090
When we think about exposure,

142
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,730
there's three key concepts
we need to remember.

143
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,305
The first is intensity.

144
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,290
How much of that agent is there?

145
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,430
The second is frequency.

146
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,320
So how often does
a person come into

147
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,740
contact with that
agent, or hazard?

148
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,290
The third is duration.

149
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,655
When they come into contact,

150
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:32,265
how long does that contact last?

151
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:36,090
So we basically multiply
frequency by intensity,

152
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,910
by duration, and the product of

153
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,780
those terms is human exposure.

154
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,470
Finally, we've moved to

155
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,410
the last two boxes of the
Exposure-Disease framework,

156
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,380
that's dose and
adverse health effect.

157
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,560
So dose as I've already

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,210
mentioned is
basically how much of

159
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,390
the agent or the hazard makes
it into a person's body.

160
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,370
Then the adverse health effect

161
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,170
can be very broadly defined.

162
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,960
It can be of any severity
and any longevity.

163
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,130
So it could be something that's

164
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,815
transient and
completely reversible,

165
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,910
or something that's permanent
and completely incurable.

166
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,950
We quantify this relationship
between dose and

167
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,205
health effect or response
using a dose-response curve.

168
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,470
There's one pictured in
the lower left here.

169
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,280
Actually, for a chemical that
we're all familiar with,

170
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,505
ethanol or drinking alcohol.

171
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,730
So the response is the
y-axis on this graph,

172
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,590
and the dose is the x-axis.

173
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,755
So what you can see
is even for ethanol,

174
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,635
we've got a range of health
effects we could consider.

175
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,990
If you have just a little bit of

176
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,920
alcohol, you have no effect.

177
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,230
A little bit more and you might

178
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,835
have an effect of giddiness,

179
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:41,070
a bit more, you may get
sleepy, more than that,

180
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,855
you may fall into a deep sleep,

181
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,380
and a dose higher than
that starts to lead to

182
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,090
some very unpleasant
health outcomes,

183
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,485
maybe unconsciousness.

184
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,060
maybe you struggled to breathe,

185
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,045
maybe ultimately the dose
of alcohol is fatal.

186
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,250
So you can see even for
a single chemical we can

187
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,955
consider lots of different
adverse health effects.

188
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,460
So wrapping it all
up and coming back

189
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,170
to our Exposure-Disease
framework,

190
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,380
we can use this framework to
help us identify sources in

191
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,090
the environment that contribute

192
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,145
to pollution and human exposures.

193
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,320
We can evaluate how
people are coming into

194
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,270
contact with those hazards,

195
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,790
and we can analyze the
associations between

196
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,005
exposures and resulting
public health impacts.
