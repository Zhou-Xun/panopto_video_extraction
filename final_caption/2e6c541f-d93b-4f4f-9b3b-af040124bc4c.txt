1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,900
Project that you guys have, so we have some some special guests with us from infection prevention and epidemiology

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,060
today who are going to be walking you through the hand hygiene projects.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,420
All you guys go ahead and introduce yourselves maybe here if you want to start. And then I'll let you guys did not believe.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:31,950
Oh, no. We know there are certain things that I'm carried, but I'm one of the infection prevention and the IP department at the hospital.

5
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:40,080
A little bit of history is I or background about myself is that I am also an MPH grad program, actually took this class myself.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,890
So I was involved in doing this project that you guys will be working on as well.

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,370
But after I graduated, I joined the department as our hand hygiene data coordinator,

8
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,190
doing a lot of focus on our program and managing the data aspect of it.

9
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,940
And then I transitioned to an AP role later on, really around the time of the pandemic.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,920
So that was a great introduction to a new role right in the middle of a pandemic.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,230
But OK, well, you know, kind of go over that kind of stuff, but I'll just let my colleagues in the back side of it to fix themselves, too.

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:26,770
So I guess I'm very well. I'm a manager and infection prevention program over the year.

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:34,770
Hi. I'm in the capital of Israel and I'm one of the U.S. Frenchness receive around a little more than currently.

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:44,550
They can handle it. Yeah. So, Ricky, in the future, it's going to be taking over a lot of the hand hygiene work that I'm up to her in the future.

15
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:53,560
She'll be also doing the place, so. Yes, so just we're going to kind of just briefly talk about just the basic stuff,

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,100
I mean, you guys know this, you guys are know public health students.

17
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,870
There are just certain things that we need to cover as they're going into the clinical setting.

18
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,320
Right. So obviously, you guys are required to complete your daily symptom screening and then whenever you're at the hospital,

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,730
you are required to have your badge visible. So you need to be wearing your ATM card.

20
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,010
We did bring some badge polls.

21
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,990
We don't have any folders, but if you do need a holder there,

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:28,450
you can go to the McCain Kennedy office at the hospital, and that's the rule number on the flight.

23
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,180
But you will be expected to wear your badge and have to be visible while you're at the hospital.

24
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,290
And then also, obviously, we do need to wear a mask since you will be in the clinical setting.

25
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:49,850
We are asking that you guys wear a medical mask that provided at the entrances into the hospital and rather than a clot or your own mask,

26
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,620
you're welcome to wear your mask going to the unit. But once you get on the actual you know,

27
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,980
we do ask that you switch out and the screeners will give those masks to you and then obviously

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:09,820
follow appropriate respiratory etiquette as well as social distancing while you are on the units.

29
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:18,190
So just to kind of touch base on our hand hygiene policy, which is an institutional policy for the health system,

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,730
and that just basically outlines what's expected of staff while they're providing care to our patients.

31
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,950
Right. So all staff are expected to clean before entry and then after effects of being in the occupied patient's face,

32
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,390
even if there is no actual patient contact that took place.

33
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:46,090
And then they're also expected to clean in between certain tasks. Those include the WHL five moments before and after donning or doffing PPD.

34
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,900
And then whenever a policy or procedure request itself after doing some specific procedure,

35
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,640
such as putting in central lines, putting a Foley catheter is required for those policies.

36
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,660
And really what we're going to be looking at from your standpoint in terms of collecting those observations,

37
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,960
is that before and after time you will be observing from a distance.

38
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,810
You won't actually be in the patient room, but you'll be in the hallway watching for those moments.

39
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,290
So to my right hand hygiene, obviously. Right. Soap and water and then hand sanitizer.

40
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,000
I haven't asked what that means because there are certain parameters around when that's appropriate to use.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,030
So maybe we'll talk a little bit more about that in a bit. And then also, you know,

42
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:37,720
just the importance of having hygiene policy and enforcement at hand hygiene during patient care is it is a requirement from accreditation,

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:48,070
regulatory aspects of the joint commission, which is I'm not familiar with that, but it is a hospital accreditation body that essentially,

44
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,490
you know, certified whether I have to go back to that hospital, provide patient care.

45
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,930
Right. So part of their requirements for any health system is if there ever a survey

46
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,030
at an institution and observed one individual failure to perform hand hygiene,

47
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,710
then the institution will be cited. And that requires an action plan, a follow up.

48
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:16,820
And that follow up action plan is not up to the standard. They can actually impose more strict restrictions on the health system.

49
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,440
And, you know, obviously the most severe being shutting us down.

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,710
Right.

51
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:35,530
So so, again, I mentioned that I had a little asterisk for the hand sanitizer and the guys may be able to guess just based on your prior knowledge.

52
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:43,540
So soap and water is OK when continuously dirty or contaminated or upon exit from a contractor doesn't leave room any time.

53
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:50,830
The hands aren't visibly soiled and alcohol based hand rope such as pure out can be OK for use.

54
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,690
So hand sanitizer can't be used, though, when patients are being cared for.

55
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,920
And the contact precautions theory that these deaths were diarrheal and it's usually received at the patient population.

56
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:12,590
So obviously see that being a spore organism, hand sanitizer, alcohol is not effective mechanism in terms of destroying the source.

57
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,600
So you really have to use soap and water and that mechanical action of the hand washing the hand, the right to actually remove those spores.

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,020
I think gloves are not a surrogate for Hampikian. So just because a patient or staff member is wearing any gloves,

59
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:35,560
they are still expected for a policy to clean before they put on those gloves because they don't want to contaminate beforehand and then afterwards,

60
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,620
when they take off the gloves, obviously, that contaminate Africa there.

61
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:50,110
So before we go a little bit further, in terms of what you'll be actually observing or how we measure hygiene plants,

62
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,500
I just want to briefly talk about our hygiene program that we have over

63
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,310
administer in medicine that really started in 2015 with the Clean Air campaign.

64
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:10,610
And that was a time where we really tried to create a culture in our health system with our staff to really be comfortable with,

65
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:21,310
you know, cleaning their hands, reminding other coworkers if they're they see that staff member about to not do hand hygiene to remind them,

66
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,780
hey, I noticed that you haven't done think you mind doing hygiene.

67
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,680
And then when somebody does get reminded that they do think that person reminded them and don't react in a hostile manner.

68
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,270
Right. Because at the end of the day, it's about patient care and safety. So really trying to create that culture.

69
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,170
With our staff members.

70
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:52,290
So I have a question for you guys, so we kind of started observing Hampikian compliance when we started this claimer mind thing campaign as well.

71
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,390
So in twenty fifteen, what do you think our overall hand hygiene performance was initially?

72
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:04,320
Just throw out some numbers and I'm going to ask Gretchen and to return that comment because they've they were children turns over the summer,

73
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,010
so they didn't know the answer. But just give me a couple of guesses. What do you guys think?

74
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:18,290
What have you seen from the literature or like 70 percent, 63 with a sixty three to be anything else?

75
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,590
Eighty, eighty. You're very, very right.

76
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:32,840
So forty five was our initial measured in compliance with the observer model.

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:43,010
So you can actually see and I guess the right thing is that we started observing by 2015 and we got forty five percent.

78
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,890
What you can see over time in this graph that we slowly but surely, you know,

79
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,560
made it up to ninety five percent and that was around August twenty eighteen,

80
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
I believe it's kind of was kind of a little scared,

81
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,100
but I believe it was around twenty eighteen of August that we actually first achieved 95 percent compliance.

82
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,910
And since then all the way up until February, twenty twenty or institution was able to maintain 95 percent greater compliance for this time frame.

83
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,920
So that was a really, really great work.

84
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,360
And I will talk a little bit more about how we got there. But the reason why I have this, you know, February twenty twenty bucks,

85
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,370
that is that is actually the last time point that we did observations because as you guys know, the following month was called that.

86
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:39,230
So we actually suspended our hygiene program at that time just to limit the amount of unnecessary people in the hospital.

87
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,540
So we told our drivers, you know, because they're not you know, they weren't critical to the patient care aspect.

88
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,790
So plus they were also students like you guys. And I believe around that time, much less if you have to go home so and so we had no observers.

89
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,110
So we were on a bus for over a year or actually out here on the dot.

90
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,710
We actually restarted just this year in March from twenty one.

91
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:13,210
So a follow up to my question now is, what do you think our overall energy performance was one year later after the 1998?

92
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,070
Do you still think we were ninety five? Do you think we went higher? Do you think we dropped some numbers?

93
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,650
Fifty five. Fifty five. Eighty eighty five.

94
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,270
OK, so we actually dropped to eighty six.

95
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,230
So you're close. So in the orange box,

96
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,710
it's our one year after that time frame and you can see over a couple of months

97
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:45,310
we were hovering around the upper 80s and in July twenty one we were able to

98
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:52,870
get back to 93 percent after starting a data driven approach following the same

99
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,620
kind of interventions we've done in the past and then going on to the future,

100
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,770
I think August twenty one, where around 92 percent right now.

101
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:07,450
So we were able to get back up into the 90s, but back to the ninety five percent that we were at before.

102
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,370
So and I'll talk a little bit more about what we plan to do in the future if we have time.

103
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,650
Right. So enough about that data so we won't get into what we actually measure.

104
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,690
So what do you what you will be looking for when you're actually on the unit observing?

105
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,850
As I mentioned earlier, our policy,

106
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,750
all health care workers are expected to clean in and out of every occupied patient room or bay and clean in between.

107
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,780
But that in-between aspect, you're not going to observe right now because,

108
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,590
again, you guys are not physically in the room to see all the opportunities.

109
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,590
You're really just looking for cleaning and cleaning out.

110
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:49,480
And that's really kind of the metric that a lot of health system use to measure the hand hygiene compliance.

111
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,000
So I got alcohol or soap and water. It's going to be effective and acceptable methods.

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,090
Again, if it's see to patient room soap and water is only acceptable when that staff member exits the room.

113
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:08,840
Right. So they could use hand sanitizer going into the not contaminated, but after they care for a patient to patient,

114
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:19,780
I see that they do need to use soap and water and just point out now that all our patient rooms do have a sink and usually they are by the door.

115
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,710
So it should be fairly easy to kind of see that action.

116
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,190
And for the hand sanitizer aspect, once you get to the actual hospital,

117
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,500
for those who have not been there before, you will see we have tons of Purell everywhere.

118
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:42,470
There is a dispenser outside every single room. There is our individual hand inside the room as well and also spread out throughout the unit.

119
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,960
So many opportunities for hygiene to occur.

120
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,010
And so, again, observations are collected only for hospital staff.

121
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,970
That's what we're focusing on.

122
00:12:51,970 --> 00:13:00,700
We don't do patients or the family of visitors at this time and really just focusing on those without anything in their hands.

123
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,370
So staff members that are entering or exiting rooms without preparing anything in the hands.

124
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:12,250
And the reason for that, that's just because from the standardization approach and a communication perspective,

125
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,970
it's easier to tell our staff this is what we're measuring.

126
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:23,080
And Philip, it's hard for a staff member to do something into a room or outside the room right at those times like we expect.

127
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:31,660
But the expectation is that they still do to together before they picked up that item or after they put that down in the patient room.

128
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:38,170
But usually you're not going to see that. So that's why we only measure staff members without anything in their hands.

129
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,520
And we'll talk a little bit more about that specifically. And so that was what we meant.

130
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,220
So when do we measure and talk a little bit about the entry and exit piece?

131
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,660
What what at what point in the room does that start or act?

132
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,840
Right. So we think about it in terms of thresholds.

133
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,300
So again, hygiene threshold for a regular patient room, which includes somewhere private, is the doorway.

134
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:09,490
So that means that hygiene is expected to occur immediately before or immediately after every time this threshold is crossed.

135
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:19,570
So I've got a rule of thumb is if a staff member enters in a room and they didn't use hand hygiene dangers, that hand sanitizer outside the door,

136
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,630
but they went in the room and used the same, that would be acceptable because they did it immediately after they entered.

137
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,170
It's really once they start interacting with the patient or interacting with the environment,

138
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,900
that is when we would kind of consider that being the cutoff, where we would consider the compliance.

139
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:46,840
They haven't done so yet. One special caveat with the threshold for these regular rooms is for patients on every precaution.

140
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,090
So usually we manage these types of patients in airborne infection, isolation rooms, and these rooms usually have the empty rooms.

141
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,930
I don't know how familiar you guys are with A.

142
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:07,240
But essentially it's their patient rooms with a smaller room outside that's connected to the hallway and so forth.

143
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,440
Patient that is on airborne precautions. And those all those for.

144
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,460
Indicated with signs both outside the door and we talked about that in a little bit as well, but those patients who are on airborne precaution,

145
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:28,070
the hand hygiene threshold for staff will be the entrance to the doorway from the hallway into the anteroom.

146
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:37,550
So the first door, not the second door, where patients who are not precautions slept in a room just because they might have been placed there,

147
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,830
because it's not the best available but don't need everyone precautions or that specific negative pressure room,

148
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:50,060
then the ante room is not considered part of the patient space. And that threshold for that staff member would be a second or the inner door.

149
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,320
So the door within the anteroom to the actual patient was that makes sense.

150
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:10,350
And again, we kind of have these thresholds defined in this way, so it's consistent across the different hospitals and areas that we observe in.

151
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,550
So they are not going to really be a big thing for you guys,

152
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:21,300
but one of the units or one of the floors rather than you will be observing on, some of you do have base.

153
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,690
So what's different about base? Obviously, as they laugh, you know, some walls, right?

154
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:35,580
Usually they are just one wall and then they have curtains around or they have, you know, three walls with no front wall.

155
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,290
Right. So the first for base is going to be red tape on the floor.

156
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,000
And there's an example of what that looks like or the crane shack in the absence of a red tape.

157
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,890
So and some reminders about hand hygiene for these areas in particular is whether the day whether the curtains

158
00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:03,030
is open or closed and hygiene is expected to occur every time before they cross that those thresholds,

159
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,900
you do have to be able to see that happen. So the hand hygiene happens.

160
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,900
So if somebody walks into a bay and they pull the curtain and they didn't perform hand hygiene right when they went in,

161
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,830
they still have the opportunity to perform hand hygiene inside the baby.

162
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:22,350
As I mentioned, there are hand sanitizer or hand hygiene products pretty much everywhere.

163
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,380
So if they pull that curtain, you don't see that happen.

164
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:34,140
You would actually not count that observation because you're uncertain of what happened, because they pull that contract.

165
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,100
One other thing to note is babies are often limited in space. So you may observe staff technically crossing the threshold to just move around to the

166
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,440
other side of the and say that at the foot of what they want to go to the head of the bed,

167
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,130
but they don't have the intent of actually leaving that patient care space or staff may partially cross the threshold of one leg over.

168
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,370
Something like that is not expected. Even if the threshold are crossed or partially crossed,

169
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,310
if the staff do not have that kind of leaving that care space just because a lot of times the days are very limited in space.

170
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:11,070
So it's pretty hard to maneuver with a patient, get in there and usually those patients pretty much stuff like that.

171
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,860
So as a reminder,

172
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:20,910
you you must be able to see the whole process of staff member going into or coming out of the gate or the observation to be reported.

173
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:31,500
So this is just a slide about the different transmission based isolation or precautions that our health system uses and outlines which ones,

174
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,630
you know, certain hand hygiene methods are required versus not.

175
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:47,070
So our kind of precautions as our basic precautions for MDR organisms, hand sanitizers up for entry and exit are hornstein all kinds of precautions.

176
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,170
These scientists, again, use for patients with diarrheal illnesses typically see them.

177
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,390
And that is where soap and water for exit is the only acceptable.

178
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:03,420
And hygiene then are yellow and pale yellow sign is a special pathogens precautions.

179
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:13,020
So that's what we are currently managing. Our Cobian patients in hand sanitizer is OK for both entry and exit.

180
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:21,610
Our light blue sign is what precautions are formerly known as respiratory isolation and hand sanitizer.

181
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:29,820
Look for that as well. Are purposeful, typical purple.

182
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:37,080
I think it's purple in real life. The colors right there, right there.

183
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,680
Like the lavender side or the one that the label droplet is what we usually use for respiratory virus.

184
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,910
That's not covid or are we use for flu patients?

185
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,520
I mean, hand sanitizer is OK for that. And then not really a transmission, I guess.

186
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:02,550
But our red line is a protective precautions. Usually poor are very immunocompromised or patients with recent transplants are managed that way.

187
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:08,040
And each of these lines also, in addition to telling staff members what type of hampikian they need reforming,

188
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,150
it also outlines what types of PPE they are expected.

189
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:21,840
So one thing that you guys will be here for the policy is that staff are expected to do before they die and then after they doctor should be.

190
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,150
Obviously, there are certain precautions that require hand sanitizer and different steps or special pathogens.

191
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:40,950
In particular, the way staff off their PDA is that they remove their gown and gloves within the room and exit the room, perform hand hygiene,

192
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,270
and then they're removing their face, protects the rights that removing their eye protection,

193
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,960
the removing there and 9:00 to 5:00 and putting on new PPE.

194
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,240
But every time they remove that contaminated PPE, they are supposed to be doing hygiene.

195
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,530
But you aren't necessarily required for those intermediate step.

196
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:07,410
It's really going to be the last the last step where where they put on that new mask that they're expected to do.

197
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:16,820
So really the last step of the PPE. Process in terms of doffing that, you're going to record, and that's just not mine.

198
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,460
So what is considered compliant observation? So this is just some bullet points of common scenarios.

199
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:30,380
So if you see a staff member upon entry into occupied patient space performing anhydride in the hallway before crossing a threshold,

200
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,430
that's considered a compliant observation that you would record performing and hiding the patient's room immediately after entering.

201
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,200
So, again, they don't necessarily have to perform it outside the room.

202
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,860
They can perform once they get into the room, that before they start interacting with the patient or their environment,

203
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,100
perform hand hygiene in the hallway and put on activity and then enter.

204
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:56,660
So that would be counted, performed in the hallway, grab supplies for just food tray and then enters.

205
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,280
You can't record those observations.

206
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,530
I didn't know earlier that usually we are recording things with staff members when they're holding things in their hands.

207
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,280
And that's usually because you don't see that entire, you know, picking up the supply or putting that supply down encounter.

208
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,970
What if you do happen to see that whole process? You can report it.

209
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,600
And really, most of these situations are going to be with our patient food and nutrition services staff.

210
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:29,740
So they will usually go to rooms with a giant metal carts that have patients that have the patient's food they perform,

211
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:35,450
and then they'll go into the cart and grab that food trade and deliver it to the patient.

212
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,540
That would be considered a compliant observation,

213
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:46,970
examples of Complan observations from the occupied patients faces when they perform and to hand over time before exiting into the hallway,

214
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,430
performing hand hygiene after dropping the PPE.

215
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:55,670
So that can be done either inside or outside the room, depending performance and hygiene supplies from the nurse server,

216
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:06,200
which is usually located right outside the patient room like a cabinet, and then hand hygiene with soap and water upon exit from a deprivation room.

217
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,400
We do have some exceptions or some I guess some rules to this is that staff may clean

218
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,360
out of one patient space and enter another immediately without having to clean again.

219
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,290
If they don't touch anything in between, you can actually count that as two observations.

220
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:29,180
One, as they exit and upon entry so many times you'll see providers rounding on their patients.

221
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,660
Right. So they'll go room to room to room.

222
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,630
Or you have nurses that care for several patients in the hotel room from room to room to room as they check in on their patients.

223
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,060
So as long as they don't touch anything in between, you can count that.

224
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,540
And then another example, Islamophobia on me.

225
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,740
So they usually have cards with all the cool bottom and blood draw supplies,

226
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,180
and sometimes they will push up into the patient room with them and then from farm hand hygiene.

227
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,300
So you can count that at some point if you see them perform hand hygiene.

228
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:06,410
What we're actually seeing a lot more recently is that they're just leaving the cart outside the room to avoid any contamination of that,

229
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,430
depending on what kind of we're going into.

230
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:20,600
So some examples of non-compliant observations and we'll actually go through some examples and scenarios towards the end of the training.

231
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:28,130
They just make sure that everybody understands everything. But some examples are performing hand hygiene and then they touch a phone page or

232
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,610
some other dirty item and that enters the patient room without cleaning it down.

233
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,560
So that's considered a non-compliant.

234
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:42,050
They bypass sanitizer, sinks and go directly into the patient's bedside to protect the environment because they're not compliant,

235
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,760
they don't perform in hygiene. If I go from one patient room and immediately into another,

236
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,450
some examples I plan to exit from an occupied patient's face is that they don't

237
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:56,090
perform hand hygiene before or immediately after exiting from PPE usage.

238
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,940
So Drosopigi does not perform hand hygiene or they actually exit a patient's face.

239
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,960
So in particular,

240
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,130
if they exit a patient room still wearing gloves that are non-compliant because obviously they can't use their hands if they're wearing gloves,

241
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,210
the form does not perform hand hygiene before grabbing items from the nurse

242
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,290
server does not perform hand hygiene after sitting down during the operation.

243
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,190
I don't doubt usually you will not see that this one in particular,

244
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:34,940
just because usually staff will be taking so instruments or soiled items down the hall to some sort of holding room or something like that.

245
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,510
You're really not going to follow that staff member or they use hand sanitizer from a separate room.

246
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,070
So some one thing to also notice, sometimes staff members, for whatever reason,

247
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:53,900
don't perform hand hygiene for a speedy room inside the room with soap and water, and then they'll exit the room and do hand sanitizer again.

248
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,090
That you can count that if they did do the soap and water, please just make sure that they are doing this over water, please.

249
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,220
I think it's just a habit that they do the sanitizer, that extra step on the way out.

250
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,840
But it's not yet some exceptions in particular to our.

251
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:17,570
Governmental services staff, or even as we call them short, is that they grab supplies from the cart to clean up patient space,

252
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,270
and so they usually go back and forth because they park their car outside the room.

253
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,980
And usually they will go back and forth in and out of the room to the car to grab certain supplies.

254
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:34,710
So all those back and forth, you don't necessarily need to record observations for it's really that first entry into the patient's space.

255
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,300
And then upon the exit, other patients face that you're going to be recording.

256
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,860
So you would need to see the member arrive and perform handwriting to count entry and

257
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,040
then also see them perform hand hygiene and then actually leave that patient room.

258
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:56,470
That kind of makes the operation. So there are some notes about non recordable observations.

259
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:04,840
So if you're unsure of what occurred so such as a door with close staff walk around a curtain divider,

260
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,340
you only saw Dispenser go off and you didn't actually see that hand hygiene occurred.

261
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,450
You and that required staff are holding clean or dirty.

262
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:22,600
So if I don't go across that threshold again, usually you're not going to see them put that down on and then perform hand hygiene,

263
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:32,410
stop entering or exiting ID rooms on location. So we don't need to observe for that when there's an emergency and need to quickly provide care.

264
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:38,290
So such as a patient is about to find a bed or a patient is about to code, you know,

265
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,780
you want to report in those situations, staff know you're collecting hand hygiene and make sure you see them perform.

266
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,900
So obviously they'll be biasing that right if they know.

267
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:54,240
And that usually make it pretty obvious if they know you're there to show you that they've done their hygiene.

268
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:04,090
Do you know right up to your face? Right. So if you suspect that they know you're there doing this, just move to a different area.

269
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:12,220
We don't record patients and our families, our visitors at this time, though, they should be doing hand hygiene as appropriately.

270
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,860
Staff just stand at the threshold at the door just as quickly as a staff member.

271
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,280
Another question or get a visual check on the patients are not actually entering or crossing poorly.

272
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,960
You want to record and then start restocking cleaning supplies and then they're serving up the patient because,

273
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:36,220
again, they're not actually in the patient care system outside. But hopefully that's that number to clean their hands before handling supplies.

274
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,670
So there's examples of non quotable observations.

275
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:52,090
This is just a baseline about what hand hygiene expectations are when it comes to certain items such as food supplies,

276
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:58,930
dirty supplies, soiled supplies, and how you would observe or actually record those observations.

277
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,550
So, for example, if it's a clean supply, you know,

278
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:11,590
the expectation per policy is that they did the hand hygiene before they picked up the item or that they do it so after they put it down.

279
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,970
But in terms of observations, you would actually not record it if you did not see that whole process.

280
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:26,460
Right. So you really need to be able to see that entire encounter of them picking up or putting them that supplied.

281
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:34,050
And this has been the response on campus, I'm going to go through all of it so you guys can take a look at that time.

282
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:40,620
So this is the form that you guys are going to be using to record your observations.

283
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,420
We have Pascoe's operators that everyone should have five copies provided.

284
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,060
This is also posted already will be posted on campus in the event that you need more forms.

285
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:58,170
But it's pretty self-explanatory. I think she can record up to 30 observations.

286
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm not going to go through the slide in particular, but one thing.

287
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:10,530
So the data that you are collecting and will be submitted to us, we will actually actually be sharing with the individual units.

288
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:18,090
So it is actual data that is being shared and being reactive upon base that compliance and noncompliance.

289
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:29,580
So just be aware of that. And so we do ask that you record room numbers and roles as best as you're able to,

290
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,050
because sometimes we do like to provide that additional drilldown data to the units.

291
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:46,330
And then in the last comments column, you can actually record some information about what people are saying for questions and stuff like that.

292
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:54,320
So your responsibility for this is really going to be collect accurate and unbiased hand hygiene observations,

293
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,390
only record observations that you see that are clearly compliant or non-compliant and don't make any assumptions of what you did or did not occur.

294
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,420
So you really need to physically eyes and see whether or not that happened and consider whether or not, you know,

295
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:15,610
all opportunities of Hampikian were or past flypast by the staff member before the last not compliant one performing.

296
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,660
Hide your observations. You should not be performing other tasks simultaneously as it can be a distraction and lead to unintentional bias.

297
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,000
Only record observations that are clear again. Health care workers have multiple opportunities clean before and immediately.

298
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,500
After all, you have to be able to see the health worker bypassed all opportunity to clean it in order to make them not compliant.

299
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,900
And then obviously, whenever in doubt, just don't count it out.

300
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:50,270
So you guys will be observing at Howard University Hospital, which is our adult hospital on our fourth floor.

301
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:58,480
So we thought that four six four seven four eight four. I mean, you guys would sign up for someone for these floors at the end of the class.

302
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:07,000
But how the hospital set up is that each floor actually has four specific units.

303
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,280
And that was a label at ABC and the units that typically our ICU units and a little bit more restrictive.

304
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,170
So for the purpose of this class, you guys will not be doing the unit, but you will be observing A, B and C for most of the floors.

305
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,080
The only exception is the sixth floor. For those who sign up for the sixth floor, you'll only observe about six B and C,

306
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,360
and that's just because six is actually one of our rehab units actually divided up to another unit at the time.

307
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:39,040
So just to make things a little bit simpler, you only focus on those two units.

308
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,880
So I believe the expectation is to do about two hours every two weeks,

309
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,740
which usually equates to about 30 observations or one observation sheet for each period.

310
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,740
You're obviously more than welcome to do more having more data for your individual right project.

311
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:06,490
So it's useful and helpful, but I believe that's the expectation that was set out by Dr. Chenowith and Dr. Stoltmann.

312
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,610
Unless otherwise indicated on your social this, what is your problem?

313
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:17,620
I don't know if it's still the case. And then some observers walk around units looking for staff.

314
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,200
And I get complaints before immediately after crossing the threshold that they shouldn't be holding things in their

315
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,950
hands unless you're able to see that building supply and counter since there are going to be other classmates.

316
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:41,050
Right. You guys are going to be working on several areas. It's always important to be aware that there may be other students also observing.

317
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:49,960
So if you do notice a classmate observe in a different area, if you see another observer to avoid double counting the same observation,

318
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,360
you should double check your observations before submitting them to us.

319
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,410
I believe these are your due dates this semester, September 17, October 1st and October 22nd.

320
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,210
Again, I defer to whatever level that I can. Is that right?

321
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,940
And then all collected data for a given might need to be submitted before the end of the month.

322
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,730
So really, I need data to collect.

323
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,100
That really shouldn't be an issue. That's all your due dates are going to be for that.

324
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,620
And then you will be submitting those observations to your instructors for further instruction,

325
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:40,900
but then also to have an infection prevention so you can go on to me and also include Ricky Brown in the back for for our purposes.

326
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:47,140
So some general observation tips, because you may perform a first few observations as a pair if you're not comfortable,

327
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,190
and then you can split up so you don't double observations again,

328
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,770
only observe health care workers with empty hands trying not to observe in a particular

329
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,270
unit for more than 30 minutes or at least move around or move to different units,

330
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,190
a move to the other side of the unit. Because if you just stand there for 30 minutes period,

331
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:13,600
I think people might get a little suspicious of why there's this random person just sitting there not doing anything right.

332
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:20,170
Avoid recording the same stuff for more than three or four hand hygiene opportunities to avoid skewing the data in one direction.

333
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,630
So you may observe one very non-compliant staff.

334
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:31,320
You don't want them necessarily to take the unit's compliance, but if you do, you can observe three or four noncompliance with that.

335
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,040
But then if they continuously are not complying, you can actually shoot us a separate email and just let us know.

336
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,550
We can follow up individually what they're doing that you're welcome to move around

337
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,800
the unit or the different units actually have to be assigned to floors roll type,

338
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,730
try to read the name badge extender or look at what the staff member is wearing, such as a white coat.

339
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,820
And to kind of identify what the real type is. There is a resource.

340
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,060
And I think I have on the next slide one of the posts that commits that kind of helps you differentiate different role types.

341
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:11,560
So obviously providers and these and they're usually going to be wearing a long white coat, right.

342
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,570
That students are going to help the short white collar pharmacy students will also wear short white coat,

343
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:25,150
but they do have a pretty large blue nametag that says pharmacy student with their name on it.

344
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:33,100
Nurses tend to have badge extenders that say are and are staff members.

345
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:39,130
They wear uniforms and they will always usually be pushing around cleaning supplies on a cart.

346
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,580
Our fans are patient protection services staff members.

347
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,400
They also wear uniforms. I think they wear black pants with a blue tarp usually.

348
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,080
And they usually have giant metal, stainless steel carts that they push around that have the patients food.

349
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:05,500
And then obviously, if you need additional information, you can refer to the resources on campus.

350
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,760
I would recommend dressing appropriately. When you're observing sleep, you have to go.

351
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,690
You can wear throughout the dress business casual.

352
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:19,000
I would refrain from wearing street clothes just to better fit in and not look like that random person.

353
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,340
Obviously. Wear your badges. Well, that will help you kind of one day.

354
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,860
So this is kind of a research I was thinking about, about those different prototypes and this is on canvas.

355
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:38,400
These are not a comprehensive list of all the different roles in the clinical setting, but the most common ones.

356
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,990
Well, some tips on how to identify them in the picture below is kind of an example of

357
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,620
what those badge extenders with the roads look like in this particular case,

358
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:59,250
where an occupational therapist. Um, any questions so far about expectations, um, process for collecting?

359
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,790
No. Yes.

360
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:08,790
So if I feel like it might be hard to figure out what role they might have, even if I don't catch their badges, that they are considered incomplete.

361
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,430
If I don't know, you can just make them as I know we do.

362
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:17,950
We just ask the best of your ability to so accurately, if you're not sure it's better to say unknown than mislabel somebody,

363
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,310
especially if it's a non-complying observation,

364
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:30,360
because sometimes we do have units or specific areas do reach out to ask what's their specific role type compliance.

365
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:37,080
So, for example, our fans that they usually, since they travel across all different units,

366
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:43,650
they're their compliance is really a total of all their staff members across those different areas.

367
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,950
So that's just one way we kind of help break that data out. Any other questions?

368
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:55,990
Yes. What do you want us to send you? Our data PDF would be preferable.

369
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,680
Is that like just scanning this? Just scan it out?

370
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,010
Yeah, you can scan it and, you know, with a scanner, with your phone, if you have an app and then just send it to us,

371
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,470
just try not to do pictures, because in the past some people have something very tiny little pictures or anything.

372
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,670
So. So if there's no other questions,

373
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:23,760
I kind of just talk about how we went from forty five to nine to five before we get into some case scenarios a little bit of time.

374
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,000
So again, obviously part of it was from that clever mind thing campaign, but also having improvement activities.

375
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,730
And I'll show a couple of slides in a bit where really it was kind of, you know,

376
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:46,110
asked to kind of focus or focus on hand hygiene that you need and come up with ways on how to bring attention to that for the staff members.

377
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:56,490
We did have quite an extensive incentive program before covid and everything when we did monthly recognition of the highest

378
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:05,880
performing units and we actually provided hundred dollars worth of candy to all areas that weren't actually 90 percent compliant.

379
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,260
And then we later bumped it up. So many units were achieving that to ninety five percent compliance.

380
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,920
So people have units had 95 percent compliance for a given month.

381
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,260
We would actually provide them with 100 dollars worth of Sandy and other goodies.

382
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:29,600
There was also a point where we were providing, I think, like a quarterly basis for some frequency, all those units that have the highest compliance.

383
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:39,670
We kind of entered into a drawing for like a three hundred dollar three hundred dollars for their unit to spend on whatever they wanted.

384
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:49,270
We also required action plans for the units that were lower than or at 70 percent compliance and actually required them to

385
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:59,530
present their action plan to our infection control committee as a method to kind of pull units accountable for ensuring hygiene.

386
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,460
We also had a pretty extensive hand hygiene coaching program.

387
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,010
So we our department actually used to have dedicated hygiene coaches where it was their job to go to

388
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:17,290
the units and provide just in time training and coaching and intervention and hygiene compliance.

389
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:22,390
We then later moved to a model where we had a unit where we embedded that into the units.

390
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:37,840
So we had unit staff, usually a nursing rep and then a physician as well, who functioned in that role at daily unit Huddle's.

391
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,590
They were expected to discuss hand hygiene compliance.

392
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:52,390
So they were asked to kind of do their own auditing and report out on some frequency just that, just internally on the units,

393
00:41:52,390 --> 00:42:00,970
what they saw that particular day against setting institutional goals or benchmarks and trying to attain those employment incentives.

394
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:07,120
We had a lot of support from our hospital leadership and then really a data driven approach to

395
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:16,480
providing as much as real time data to our units as much as possible through online dashboards.

396
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,180
So this is just some pictures. You probably have all seen something like this before on the Internet,

397
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:30,250
where one of the activities we did in the past was going to units and having members click through their Handspring and Washington Post handwashing.

398
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:40,190
Right. So I'm obviously seeing how effective it is and just how nasty some people's hands are before they do it in hiding.

399
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,320
Yeah. Do you ever like the technique or is it just about anything?

400
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:50,530
So most of the time that there's opportunity, there is a little bit about technique, but we're not really focusing on technique.

401
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,340
It is something that we probably will focus on a little bit more in the future.

402
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:01,950
But if it's obvious that they throw all the hand sanitizer dispensers outside the prison room are automatically detector,

403
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,520
if a staff member does a quick sweep and literally no hand sanitizer gets on their hand.

404
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,260
I would actually not consider that if there's nothing to clean with.

405
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:19,200
Right. So there is a little bit about the quality aspect of it, but for the most part, it's really just did they do it or not?

406
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:29,070
But that's a good question. Um, so this is kind of some of the activities that a lot of the units did at the early phases of our hygiene program,

407
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:36,610
which they just created these reminders to themself on the units posting on their boards, in particular this unit with the turkey.

408
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:45,940
They actually had this little meter that kind of measure their goals. This is just a slide about with some pictures of those incentives.

409
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:53,950
So we have to have this treasure chest that we would fill a hundred dollars worth of stuff for them and give to the units that were high performers.

410
00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:05,520
The one in the lower left or down here is that check that we would go on a quarterly basis.

411
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:15,600
And these are just some slides or pictures of our dashboard that units that have access to the kind of measures are compliant.

412
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,470
So this more colorful one is what we consider our hand hygiene at a glance, that sport.

413
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,580
And it's really one that we encourage units to print out and post on the units.

414
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:33,480
And it has a lot of different and useful metrics. Right. It's got your monthly complaint, a focus on the number of missed opportunities.

415
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,570
That was actually one of our one of our strategies to try to, you know,

416
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:46,720
go beyond ninety five percent since we did reach ninety five percent and maintain that for over a year before that.

417
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,910
That was just kind of read trying to think about how else to message this in a different way.

418
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,440
Right up until this point, we've been trying to chase ninety five or more.

419
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:05,100
But how about we think about it in a in a way where let's try to have zero missed opportunities there.

420
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:11,200
They've got weekly training, six months and compliance by different roles and then different shifts.

421
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:21,550
And then is engineer the kind of thing. Stuff like that, so we're going to get closer to the actual examples.

422
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm just an important reminder and be respectful and mindful of the things and stuff, because, again, you are in the clinical care environment.

423
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,950
Again, don't interfere with any patient care. Don't enter patient rooms.

424
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:41,290
If you are being asked by staff what you're doing on the unit, just let them know you're working on data collection project and believe unit.

425
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:46,420
If they get an idea, you can tell me they're correct. Like you can just leave.

426
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:52,570
If they have any other questions, you can just refer them to infection prevention Aboriginality to report any unusual events that

427
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,540
occur when you see a health care worker enter a contact for possible without putting out an APB,

428
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:06,490
do let us know about that so we can assure you that we're following the proper processes to minimize transmission.

429
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,580
Always wear your badge when you're at the hospital.

430
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,800
So honestly, I don't know how many of you people know how to actually get to the hospital in the past,

431
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,780
I would have recommended going through CDC, but there's a lot of construction going on there at this time.

432
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:30,660
So one way you could go through is through the Mexi or Tumin Health Sciences library and just cut through into the nearest hospital.

433
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,160
That's where a lot of signs everywhere. So you really shouldn't get lost.

434
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,040
Just remember that for two, it's kind of like the main floor of the hospital, and that's really what's connected everywhere.

435
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:52,480
You can also go through a lot through our comment center. Stuff like that, so this is just a matter of just the general layout of our adult hospitals,

436
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:03,400
like A. A, B, C and D and again, you're only going to be observing on a three C for each floor.

437
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,890
If you need further assistance, you we may be able to set something up with our current observers.

438
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,370
We also have our chief in last summer that you can ask a Gretchen.

439
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:17,660
And they you know, they've been trained on this. They did a number of observations during their internship.

440
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:24,700
So they're pretty familiar. Or you can contact myself or Ricky if you have any questions.

441
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:36,550
And then lastly, I do just want to put a plug that we are going to be looking for additional temporary and hygiene student observers and observers,

442
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:43,420
the observer, our three different hospitals, including our operating room, the procedure here, it's very flexible work schedule.

443
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,400
Great for those who are interested in going into this field to kind of get your foot in the door.

444
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,180
So we will be putting a posting soon. All right.

445
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:05,250
Any other questions before we kind of dig into something, someone to train and perform on the campus, what's before we got to go up there?

446
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:11,520
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, Carol. Oh, yes.

447
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:18,330
Yes, yeah. That's not way you want me to tell you, but then you can just go for it.

448
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:25,130
Any other questions or expectations about how you doing?

449
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:31,550
All right, so then we're just kind of go through some exercises, whatever is described up here,

450
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:37,190
as just pretend that's what you physically see, and then how would you record those observations?

451
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:42,470
So, for example, a physician pleads for hand with hand sanitizer,

452
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,340
heads toward the patient room at seven thirty eight a.m., her cell phone rings on her way.

453
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,950
So she stops and answers it and goes to a computer at the nurse's station to look something up.

454
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:57,770
After 10 minutes, the physician blocked into a patient room going straight to the bedside and places like hand on the battery.

455
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:05,990
How would you record that? Not quite correct.

456
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:12,190
No, not wearing no watch and see if you want to make a fine actually just went directly into the patient room.

457
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:21,910
The. Number two, a nurse enters a patient room and begins talking with a patient as she heads to the sink to wash their hands.

458
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:39,120
After drying her hands, she takes the patient's blood pressure. Yes.

459
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:48,810
Thumbs up or thumbs down? OK, so what's on number three?

460
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:56,970
A nursing assistant walks out of a patient room when we see him throwing his hands with a paper towel.

461
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:08,100
Unable to determine, correct, since you actually didn't see it actually happening or you have any doubts about it, you would not count it.

462
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:17,770
Number four, a nurse enters a patient room holding a clipboard in her hand, bypassing the hand sanitizer dispensers and introducing.

463
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:23,360
Correct? No, I assure you she is.

464
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:30,100
Oh, yeah, something like that. No, actually, I plugged the thing under her arm and went in.

465
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:38,940
She could have done it. Well, that's also another thing that I forgot to mention. His staff members can put that item away or kind of store it away.

466
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:46,150
But again. So, yes, but that's what they got in there, you that record. But when they're actually in the room, whatever they're going to do,

467
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:51,910
if they're going to touch the paint and whatever the expectation is, but they still do that hygiene.

468
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:56,080
People have forgotten most of the time. You're not going to see that. All right.

469
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:08,570
Number five, Lobotomist arrives through a patient room before bottommost puts on gloves and enters the patient room to draw a blood sample.

470
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:14,820
Thumbs down. Yeah. All right, you know what, I can change number six.

471
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:22,530
A staff member from food and nutrition applies and sanitizer to his hands and then enters the patient room to deliver a tray,

472
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:27,460
then apply to hand sanitizer again on his way out. Thumbs up.

473
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,620
Yeah, and that would actually comes upon entry and exit number seven,

474
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,930
you turn a corner and see a physician preparing to enter a contact, precautions the room.

475
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:46,930
The physician already has a gown on and it's grabbing gloves. The physician put the gloves on and enters the patient room.

476
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:53,180
Thumbs up, thumbs down on that record, unable to do, unable to turn correct because they already had the answer,

477
00:51:53,180 --> 00:52:01,150
you might have missed that piece whether or not they did the hand hygiene prior seven point five.

478
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,530
OK, so same scenario.

479
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:11,670
But now the physician then later removes their gown and gloves and uses the hand sanitizer by the door on their way to BiPAP, bypassing the same.

480
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:17,750
If they need to do soap and water up, David.

481
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:28,830
Yeah, so that if you're passing clean water into one room and as long as you don't touch anything, you can have the game play out right in court.

482
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:35,090
But the same thing applies for you to change your life so your way.

483
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:41,820
So I never wanted to be the counselor for individual patients.

484
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:47,550
So on the last example that it was the physician as a gun.

485
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,090
And then the issue is they didn't use soap and water.

486
00:52:51,090 --> 00:53:00,770
Right. Sorry. And then I'm sorry. So they already have gone from a different.

487
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:05,480
So I guess so this example saying, you know, we don't know. We don't know what happened.

488
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,720
Right. So we can't really pass on each side because we didn't see so anything.

489
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:18,810
Yeah. Yeah. So they could have been the physician arrived to this room with a gun on that position.

490
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:25,460
Yeah. Yeah. So that's. Yeah. If you see anything egregious like that, you know, don't shoot an email to carry,

491
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,230
like if you see people going from room to room in the same town they should not be.

492
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,270
Yeah. That would be, that would be not acceptable. Yeah.

493
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:42,950
I think in particular this example was more trying to demonstrate that the physician was already there already putting on PPD before you got there.

494
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,790
Number eight, this is a long and even has a worker wearing gloves,

495
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,680
access and occupied patient room and do the patients trashcan into the larger trash bin.

496
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:59,000
The worker returns the patient's trash can and immediately goes into the next occupied patient room.

497
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:28,180
To get back to your options, it's kind of like. And one of the longer answers.

498
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,020
Yeah, what are you going to do?

499
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:36,760
I'm not 100 percent sure which ones which could you so it's not record in the beginning because you don't know what they did

500
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:46,810
prior to the clubs that that going straight into the other room because you could see that they had to take him out and.

501
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,100
Yes. So the answer is, Dave, you were not. Yes.

502
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:57,490
Guest worker exiting the patient room or as we answer that, they are allowed to do that, since that's where the supply crisis is.

503
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,870
So that would be the first part of it.

504
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:06,920
And then you would know what plan plant exit a patient room after returning the trash can and then no watch upon entry.

505
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:15,920
So that makes sense. OK, that's a lot easier in person because you actually see everything, right, rather than the scenarios.

506
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,550
Right. Number nine, a code blue, we call it three health care workers,

507
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:24,040
one into a patient room without washing their hands to stabilize the patient, you would need a monitor and unnominated.

508
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:30,310
Correct. And hopefully then at least have a couple of seconds to do something right now.

509
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,660
Number 10, a physician and a fellow use the hand sanitizer dispenser at the nurse's station.

510
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:42,110
They both go directly into a patient's room without putting it away.

511
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:53,900
Thumbs up, thumbs down. So that's actually two observations, one for the fellow physician, number 11 and yes, two questions.

512
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:03,050
Are you still putting on some, like either an insanity plea or just going straight into the room like a cold or something?

513
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,310
So I don't know what to do. I think they're putting on.

514
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:12,690
And so I think what I think what happens in real life is that we're just I think they're trying to save the patient.

515
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:18,770
Right. But then other staff will try to properly execute it and kind of take over.

516
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:24,590
They'll be just like switch over. Yeah, I think the covid people are more like even if it's an emergency,

517
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:32,570
I think people are more likely to pause when IPB at least throw on an IV and maybe she'll we will say right now.

518
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:38,450
So currently, you know, we obviously are doing something so standard medical masks still somewhat protective, right.

519
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:43,080
Depending on whether or not they give people enough. Actually, on the impatient side,

520
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:52,400
we are also requiring all staff members to wear eye protection for any patient facing activities just to kind of minimize family, you know,

521
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,450
high risk exploiters, the staff members from the asymptomatically, the patients,

522
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:12,690
the patients who later developed for the hospital where we can we do this one, you just don't go there.

523
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:19,850
And I think we're just starting. The employee arrives at an occupied patient, use of hand sanitizer dispenser,

524
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:28,970
puts on gloves under the patient and they clean up that number 12 of the Monomyth arrives on the unit already wearing gloves.

525
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:41,180
She enters the patient room to draw a blood sample. Washington, sure, that was number 13 during physician patient rounds,

526
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:46,370
the attending physician applies hand sanitizer when leaving the patient room, then immediately enters the next patient.

527
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:53,290
Lockington, you're interrupting sanitizer. Thumbs up, thumbs up.

528
00:57:53,290 --> 00:58:08,260
I do that all the time. It takes a while, but 14, a nurse aide uses hand sanitizer outside the patient room,

529
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:17,420
grabs cleaning supplies from the nursing server and then enters the patient room.

530
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:25,700
Thumbs up, thumbs down. Yeah, so since we actually are able to see this whole supply and you can actually tap this line if you already missed

531
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,900
the part where they did and sometimes you just see something that they're just holding it up and they go in,

532
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,040
you're actually just not record that you're 15th,

533
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:41,420
a free trade past their stands on the threshold to see if the patient has done with their food tray, but they are not.

534
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:49,700
The food tray passes, then leaves the patient room and gets hand sanitizer.

535
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,990
Yes, so this one actually beat that record because they technically didn't cross the threshold,

536
00:58:53,990 --> 00:59:03,050
but it's good that they still did 16 a social worker actually they patient room stands by the door at

537
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:14,900
seven West where they kind of sit down and water boarded up and walk right up and down that record.

538
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,250
Thumbs up. Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:29,730
17 physical therapists enter the patient when she walks straight to the patient's bed and you get pain to access the room with her hands in a pocket.

540
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:36,480
Thumbs down for both entry and exit. Sure. All right, last question, we observe an hour and a play.

541
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:44,490
Hand sanitizer then puts on gloves. The orange rips the tip off of one finger to push a button on a machine in an occupied patient.

542
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:52,950
How would you record that in respect to the actual. It's up and down the.

543
00:59:52,950 --> 01:00:02,790
So I would thought this would actually be up because they did do in hiding before they put on people like they're supposed to.

544
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:12,030
But the fact that they then did something, you know, ridiculous, let me kind of like the situation at the airport.

545
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:17,650
And actually, this is a real example of what happened, so.

546
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:25,930
So that pretty much is everything to you, is there any other additional questions we do want to say that we do not have Bashforth at the fund,

547
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,760
a little hands on that future when one of you can help yourselves, too.

548
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:37,690
There's also some hand sanitizer for you guys as well. Not that you don't have enough already, but.

549
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:46,390
No questions, comments, concerns. So at this point, we do have the sign up list, so again,

550
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:58,750
we'll be observing the sign up for one of the floors and you'll observe on basically the ABC units of floor for each floor.

551
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:05,480
I would say about three people sign up.

552
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:14,140
If there's more of you than we can afford it, let's try to do three for each unit or each for first.

553
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:18,500
I guess since we do have time, I can kind of give you just an overview.

554
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:28,540
Sorry for fourth floor is comprised of what, like our narrow stroke population.

555
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:34,000
Again, this is all general care. Therefore, I think is some transplant units.

556
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,600
Guy Unit six four has pulmonary.

557
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:55,180
They have actually quite a bit of patience right now because the pulmonary flight 7th for cardiology, cardiology and then the A4 has him on.

558
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:59,400
Um. And like General Cody.

559
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,340
Yeah, I mean, the truth is that their patients are distributed somewhat randomly,

560
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,750
so there's not really there's not really going to be a particular patient population interest.

561
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:17,490
I don't know. But that's just kind of a quick background on the main kind of populations for each floor.

562
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:24,700
So I guess if there's no other questions, we can I don't know what's the best way.

563
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:35,040
We want people to come up. We want to pass it around or, um, I guess they can just have people maybe do it on their way out and grab their children

564
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,720
or else they want just everyone just wants to find out for you and on your way out.

565
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:45,780
It really does matter. You know, it doesn't have the same number with you.

566
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:51,270
Yeah. Just remember, one year I have four and then you guys are free to go.

567
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:56,460
If you have any questions, I'll hang around with you. That stuff.

568
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,034
Oh, yes.
