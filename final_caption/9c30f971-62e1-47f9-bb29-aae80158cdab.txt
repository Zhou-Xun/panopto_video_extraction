00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:04,074
In this video we're gonna talk about the role of digestive hormones and

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:06,174
controlling the digestive process.

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:09,534
During digestion food has to pass through multiple organs.

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:13,113
Including the stomach, the small intestine and the large intestine.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,596
In addition to controlling the flow of food through those pardons,

6
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:20,396
there also has to be regulation of secretions from the secondary organs.

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,380
The accessory organs such as the gallbladder and the pancreas.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,436
Much of this is accomplished by a key hormones that are released from both

9
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:31,841
the stomach and the small intestine to communicate from one organ to another.

10
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,642
If we follow food, first as it enters the stomach.

11
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,017
The first hormone that's released, is a hormone that's called gastrin.

12
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:41,778
Gastrin stimulates contractions and motility in the stomach to allow for

13
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:44,271
the churning and mechanical digestion of food.

14
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:48,994
Gastrin is secreted from stomach cells and acts on other stomach cells.

15
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:52,500
And in addition to promoting motility also promotes the secretion of some

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,771
key substances including hydrochloric acid.

17
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,962
Which is gonna acidify the stomach.

18
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:01,995
Pepsinogen which is gonna help with protein digestion and gastric life's.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,892
Which is gonna help with lipid digestion.

20
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,968
Once food passes from the stomach to the small intestine,

21
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,422
two things need to happen.

22
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,512
You need to promote the digestive processes in the small intestine.

23
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:16,311
And you need to delay more food from entering the small intestine from

24
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:17,105
the stomach.

25
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,080
This is accomplished by two hormones.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,844
The first one we're gonna talk about is called secretin.

27
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:22,642
So as I said,

28
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:27,389
secretin is gonna delay gastric emptying primarily by closing the pylorus.

29
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:31,209
Again to prevent further food from entering the small intestine.

30
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,319
The second thing that secretin is gonna do,

31
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,408
is gonna promote the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas.

32
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:39,864
This bicarbonate neutralizes the stomach acids and allows for

33
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:43,069
enzymes that work at neutral pH to function effectively.

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,353
The third thing that secretin is gonna do,

35
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:49,297
it is gonna quench the gastric induced motility and stomach secretions.

36
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:52,126
To prevent further digest from from happening.

37
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:56,869
The second hormone is called CCK or cholecystokinin.

38
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,876
It promotes the release of key digestive enzymes from the pancreas.

39
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,489
It also promotes the release of bile.

40
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,744
Which is gonna help with lipid absorption.

41
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:13,311
And just like secretin, CCK is gonna prevent further digestion in the stomach.

42
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:17,058
Here's a summary of what we've talked about of those key three hormones,

43
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,270
gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin.

44
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,270
Remember these hormone functions have to function in a particular order.

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,295
First, gastrin followed by secretin, cholecystokinin.

46
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:28,528
That way food enters the small intestine and

47
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:33,873
promotes its digestion at a rate that is appropriate to optimize digestion.
