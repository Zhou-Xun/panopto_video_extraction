1
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:12,170
Now let's introduce you to the concept of reactance.

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:19,223
Reactance is a natural manifestation of having your need for autonomy thwarted.

3
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:21,098
Think about tenements square.

4
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:26,462
Think about the Arab Spring if you threaten a person's freedom long enough or

5
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:31,927
hard enough they will react even if the consequences can be life threatening.

6
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:35,618
Similar to reactance in the political sphere,

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:40,423
reactance also occurs in health communication encounters.

8
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:41,918
What do we mean?

9
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:46,538
When providers use controlling language you must, you should,

10
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:50,906
you have to or the patient in any way feels coerced or guilted or

11
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:55,531
shamed into making a behavior change that can induce reactance.

12
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:02,301
Now, reactance can take on both sort of direct and indirect manifestations.

13
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:05,995
In direct restoration, the person just goes and does the behavior so

14
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:10,336
the doctor says them you can't drink anymore, you can't have sweets anymore.

15
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:14,907
You run home that night and have a beer and a bowl of ice cream.

16
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:19,158
Now that is actually in some ways easier to deal with the second

17
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:23,988
manifestation of restoration which is indirect restoration that's

18
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:26,708
often invisible to you as a clinician.

19
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:31,425
What happens in the indirect restoration is that the patient argues against

20
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,756
change internally.

21
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,526
They may be nodding to you outwardly.

22
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,878
Yes, I will quit smoking.

23
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:37,898
Yes, I will start to eat healthier.

24
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,929
Inside though, they're attacking the message and the messenger.

25
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,666
The reason I'm looking at you and saying you don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,003
I don't trust you or they're gonna say I don't believe this message.

27
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,552
I don't believe the source of this message.

28
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,563
I don't believe the veracity of this message.

29
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:53,761
The problem with indirect restorations you don't often know what's happening.

30
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,282
So it can be quite insidious.

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,329
Now you may ask what's the difference between reactance and resistance?

32
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,258
They're very similar.

33
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:04,533
But here's how we like to resolve the distinction.

34
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,000
Resistance is what the patient brings in.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,191
It's the psychological and motivational baggage and

36
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:12,554
barriers they bring into your session.

37
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:17,469
Reactance is the additional lead weights you add to that luggage by

38
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:22,046
using controlling or other forms of demotivating language.

39
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:26,048
So let's talk for a few minutes about the role of energy depletion and

40
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,157
behavior change.

41
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:32,610
We've already talked about energy depletion as a driver of resistance.

42
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,094
Let's go a little bit further to understand how important

43
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,947
depletion is in the behavior change experience.

44
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:46,247
Hans Selye a famous psychologist wrote extensively about the limited

45
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:50,755
amount of adaptive energy we get each day or change energy.

46
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:54,637
And when that energy is used up it's really hard to make change and

47
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:59,380
in fact it's really hard to adapt to any challenger environment throws at you.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,568
What do we mean?

49
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:05,203
Think about a difficult day for you, think about a day when you wake up and

50
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,242
you have an argument with your partner.

51
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:09,506
Well there goes two doses of energy.

52
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:10,927
Two batteries are spent.

53
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:14,372
Then you have a lot of traffic on the way to work and you're worried your boss is

54
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:17,553
gonna yell at you and your jobs in jeopardy two more batteries are shot.

55
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:21,493
Then you get a call at work that your mom is sick and you have to leave work and

56
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,586
rush to her doctor.

57
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,488
Another two batteries are gone.

58
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,259
Then when you get home and you find out your child how to fight at school and

59
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:27,904
got in trouble.

60
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:31,460
Two more batteries are gone and finally your partner comes home and

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,758
your argument for the morning continues.

62
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:37,534
You've used up all 10 of your batteries.

63
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:41,362
What happens if later that evening, you stub your toe or

64
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:45,526
you spill some coffee or you can't find the keys to your car.

65
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,302
You may explode.

66
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:47,195
You may overreact.

67
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,656
And that's because there is no elasticity left in the system.

68
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,711
You have no more adaptive energy.

69
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,925
There's no more wiggle room.

70
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:58,183
So what that tells us is we have to be particularly sensitive to our patients

71
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,140
energy levels.

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,247
Are they really ready now to make a change?

73
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:08,176
Now I wanna extend this metaphor to the health disparities realm.

74
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:16,701
This energy depletion concept is gonna help us understand while in many studies,

75
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:23,386
lower income folks often have worse outcomes, what do we mean?

76
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:28,572
If you wake up in an impoverished environment where you have less

77
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:33,668
opportunity and less resources that in itself drains energy.

78
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:39,860
So you may be Down two batteries just from that sort of background annoyance,

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,833
that life is unfair and your opportunities are curtailed because society is not fair.

80
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:52,607
If you don't feel safe in your environment, either because of crime or

81
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,395
discrimination or racism, that background annoyance sucks energy.

82
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:02,655
If you have to worry about feeding your family and paying your bills,

83
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,305
that background annoyance sucks energy.

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,682
So one way to think about health disparities is that drains adaptive

85
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:10,305
energy.

86
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:15,017
And in the case we just described that person may wake up minus six.

87
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,287
They only have four units left.

88
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:21,708
Well that would be a good explanation for why they may be less motivated or

89
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:26,141
less successful because they have less energy to attempt the behavior.

90
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,164
Unless energy to apply the necessary vigilance to continue the behavior.

91
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,867
So it is not the individual's fault.

92
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:37,226
It's not because they have some character flaw, it's because other demands in

93
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:41,021
their environment or social structures we set up structural racism.

94
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:47,170
Those can deplete the person in sort of this insidious silent background

95
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,639
way that can make them less able and willing to make other behavior changes.

96
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,763
We've addressed the importance of establishing

97
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:02,667
rapport and communicating empathy.

98
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:07,753
We've shown why it's important to first let the person express their fears,

99
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:11,543
drain there swamp before you give advice or information.

100
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:16,126
We have defined resistance and described some of the key

101
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,808
drivers of resistance and finally we define reactant and

102
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:26,482
why it's different from resistance and a little bit how to avoid it.

103
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:31,203
We connected all of this to the concept of depletion and help you understand why some

104
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:34,515
people are less willing and able to make behavior change.

105
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:39,866
Because they have less adaptive energy to devote to those changes.
