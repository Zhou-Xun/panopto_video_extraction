1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:32,220
You know, I you know, myself, I didn't scream three times.

2
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:48,410
I was like, not in that I also I noticed that the getting so.

3
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:56,660
I think it's going to be just like I don't think they should have done it, which I don't think I'm sorry.

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,290
I think you're right.

5
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:19,380
Despite not being able to make that.

6
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:37,870
I think I can say that my true intellect is.

7
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,620
Since we sit here, I think maybe.

8
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,690
All right. Good afternoon, everyone.

9
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm. I'm glad to be here and have something to show you.

10
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,870
You know, I was sad the last hour, uh, but it's, uh.

11
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,320
I'm very excited about being here and looking forward to working with you.

12
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:19,840
So what I was planning to do was to actually start sort of with how the course is organized and what it's about, what's in it.

13
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,090
And the easiest way for me to do that is to take the syllabus.

14
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,070
And what I did is I just highlighted a lot of things that some places there's too much highlighting,

15
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,000
but just so that I can follow the things I wanted to make sure you knew about.

16
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,460
So I think take a reasonable amount of time and also take any questions or comments as we go along.

17
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,860
You don't have to wait to wait for me to go through all this for sure.

18
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,049
I promise not to. There's no highlighting on the page.

19
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,740
That's about me. And you can read that on your own time.

20
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:03,670
All right. So first thing is, I don't know about the rest of you, but I get overwhelmed with the number of emails I get.

21
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,790
So I'm recommending, if you have a question, anything that has to do with the course, start the subject line with the 603.

22
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,670
That way I'll be looking for that so that I respond in a reasonable quick, hopefully quickly to questions you might have.

23
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay. And then it says Office hours by appointment.

24
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:36,070
We'll probably talk about this a little bit more, as I think you know, from some of these different messages I had sent to you earlier.

25
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:45,190
Um, some of the people in this course don't live anywhere very close to southeastern Michigan,

26
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,790
so I'm sure I'm going to have some people that are going to want to work with or at least offer to work

27
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:59,080
with during office hours for people that can't physically be here all when they want it to be here.

28
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,300
Okay. So that's one thing I want to mention there.

29
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:14,040
Let's go to fast. So I now know it gets a little too blue here, but we'll talk about the course structure.

30
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,470
And so there's going to be a combination of live and previously recorded lectures.

31
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:30,240
You'll even see that, I think, in what we're doing today and all all of these sessions,

32
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,530
this is my understanding from the women that was standing next to me who were showing me all the ropes of how this is going to work.

33
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,880
But my understanding is in this classroom.

34
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,260
It automatically starts. I know it's doing it.

35
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,500
We're being we're being seen as we go along and heard as we go along.

36
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,340
So it automatically begins to record, and it does that based on what time it is.

37
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,480
So it's like you don't even have to turn anything on or turn anything off.

38
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,059
This is a new one for me. And the other thing that's nice about it,

39
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,330
I was mentioning that is there's a few people that wouldn't be here in the class right now because they don't live near here.

40
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:25,130
And probably some of them, maybe all of them are watching this in real time.

41
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,140
So you can be somewhere else. And when you hear me saying something, that's when it actually happened.

42
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,229
I'm also told, although I didn't have this experience before with using Panopto,

43
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,350
but that was like a few years ago and also been told that once it's done,

44
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,000
it's done recording, which is going to be like a few minutes before 5:00 today,

45
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:57,380
that all of you should be able to go to the home page and then see where it says Panopto.

46
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,870
And I think every recording, you know, has it has a name on it which shows you what the date is that it was recorded.

47
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,680
So my understanding is you could you could walk out of here and 5 minutes later, you could be looking at that if you want to.

48
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:19,250
You don't have to. I'll believe this when you tell me it actually happened that way because it sure didn't used to be that way.

49
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,740
But that's what I've been told. It's like there instantly.

50
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,430
So I don't have to worry about it. And what's better is you don't have to worry about, well, I miss the class.

51
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,790
And, you know, I didn't get to see what happened.

52
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,510
Okay, so. Right.

53
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,829
So for us, for all these live and previously recorded lectures, basically,

54
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:55,080
really whatever we're doing during the course on a given day there, there will be associated quizzes.

55
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:03,060
And the purpose of these quizzes is not really to to make extra work for you or anything like that.

56
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:12,629
It's really to try to make sure that you understood what were some of the more important issues

57
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,460
that were raised and the ways that that's what we were speaking about during a presentation.

58
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,470
And so it's a way to make sure that you're sort of keeping on track about what's been covered.

59
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,310
And and I guess in a sense,

60
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:35,790
you as the students in the class and I to make sure we're on the same page about what was most important about what we talked about.

61
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,410
So so those quizzes do get graded.

62
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:46,650
I actually always take it to the Patriot talking about the grading, but there are quizzes where you get to do it twice.

63
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:54,030
If you get something wrong the first time, you can fix it so that it's not it's not really intended to make life difficult.

64
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:02,999
It's theoretically intended to to make it make it easier for you to say, oh, yeah, I know what they're talking about and I could do this quiz.

65
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,670
I understand that at. Right.

66
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,790
And so you're you're required to do this on your own.

67
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:23,850
I don't always do that for everything, but you'll hear we'll talk a lot about things I hope students do together on various issues.

68
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,800
But for those quizzes you're supposed to do, actually sit down and do them on your own.

69
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,670
Make sure you actually know what what are correct answers.

70
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,500
All right. And so.

71
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:47,440
Well, I could go to the next page, but as you can see there, the quizzes do count for a fair amount, 5% of the course grade just for completing.

72
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,700
And 10% of the course grade is for how well you did on the quiz.

73
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:00,050
And again, you get to take it twice. So you're going to know if if you didn't have a perfect score the first time,

74
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,810
you're going to know which questions you were told you gave the wrong answer.

75
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,530
It doesn't tell you which is the right answer. You're supposed to still figure that out.

76
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:20,240
But really, where I'm trying to end up is that I use the quiz to help you understand what we were talking about and make it all fit together.

77
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,160
And so it's not really there to make life difficult. It's much harder there to make sure you know what is going on with that.

78
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,879
All right. So so, yeah, if you put that all together, it's like 15% of the grade.

79
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,300
So I guess that's pretty significant, but it's pretty easy to do.

80
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,439
Right. I already said these things. Below that you. You'll know which questions you miss.

81
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,990
But you want the correct answer.

82
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:01,130
And there's also you have a from the time that it's available, which is usually these quizzes typically involve more than one session.

83
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:10,969
So when when you the quiz becomes available is, I think, almost always going to be right at the end of the last class.

84
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:20,660
But that quiz is part of that. It gets covered by that quiz and you have you'll have 36 hours to complete it.

85
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,670
And if you don't complete it, you'll and you turn in past 36 hours, you lose half of the half of it.

86
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,820
And if you get out too far, then you'll get 0% if you ever respond.

87
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,390
So you're supposed to respond to this in a timely basis. Okay.

88
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,180
All right. So. Right.

89
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,160
So in this course, during our class time in general,

90
00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:00,820
there's going to be a substantial emphasis on having structured interactive discussions, often including case studies.

91
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,710
And actually those are pretty heavily loaded in the first part.

92
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,420
So you'll have a good idea of exactly the kinds of things we're talking about, what we're doing and.

93
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,910
What? The way this is organized is that.

94
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,860
You'll have things to read about, whatever the issue is.

95
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,810
There'll be a series of questions that you're asked to answer.

96
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,940
You're not actually required to answer every one of those questions because for some

97
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,200
of them there might be like ten questions that could be quite complicated and long.

98
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,680
And instead, you're only asked and only asked to respond to some of the questions and you have some choices.

99
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,630
It depends on which one it is. Sometimes you get to choose which ones you want to respond to.

100
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,320
So the idea here is that you're going to write something out that explains, Hey, what?

101
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:06,919
What did you think about what you read and what these questions raised before you came to the class,

102
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,530
where we're going to discuss it and this historically that seems to have worked really well because

103
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:19,430
that means everybody has has been looking at this and thinking about it and the new flourish to this,

104
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,049
which is new to me. So don't ask me for the expertise of how it works.

105
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:33,440
Exactly. But there's this discussion thread called Peruse all our perusal, put an extra L on it.

106
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,679
So it's have I'm interested. Raise your hands.

107
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,610
How many people have used this so you can train me?

108
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:49,159
Many of you I can say that. All right. So my understanding of this is that it's sort of organized to try to try to push the

109
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,960
idea of students interacting with each other about what they think about some of these.

110
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,470
And I'm very much in favor of that. And so to get full credit for it,

111
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,580
besides you submitting what you wanted to say about what you thought from these readings that

112
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,620
we did and what our answers to these and the answers to these questions that were raised,

113
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,650
that in addition to this, you're supposed to find it.

114
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,130
So when you when you submit this, then you can see everybody else as is submitted it, right?

115
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:37,010
You can't say it before you submit. And just what you're being asked to do is to pick two responses that you find interesting and worthwhile.

116
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,950
And you want to make comments about what two other students had to say about these questions.

117
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,650
And so it's up to you how you want to do it. But typically it would be off.

118
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,110
It would probably be someone who agreed with you a lot.

119
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,290
That's pretty straightforward, but it might be someone where you say, Wow, the way this person thought about it,

120
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,940
I don't know what brought it to a whole new level I hadn't thought about.

121
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,720
And, you know, you might want to say, hey, this is really important to point out.

122
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,290
And you can, of course, use that to lambaste somebody you completely disagree with what they said.

123
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,740
That's maybe not very polite, but if that's what you decide to do, I will stick by.

124
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,050
You're allowed to do that.

125
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:30,260
I'm more interested in responding to things that you do that when you respond to what other people said that you're sort of focused on.

126
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,270
You know what's important here? What's the right answer? What's the right way that this should be addressed?

127
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,659
And, you know, typically helps a lot to be able to look through what other people had to say

128
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,580
and figure out which things that helps you with deciding what's most important.

129
00:15:46,940 --> 00:16:02,090
Okay. So actually, this is this is the part of the class I like the most part I like the least is reading excerpts from doing what I'm doing now.

130
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:11,330
Because these I've picked I think I've picked out a lot of issues that are important,

131
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:18,920
that are complicated, that impact lots and lots of different people that are worth thinking about.

132
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,540
And you can see that the way different, different issues are being addressed in different parts of the world can vary a lot.

133
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,700
And why is that? All that kind of thing.

134
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:40,520
And I just think it's much more lively and it's much part of getting at what's really important here and how how should we think about this?

135
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:47,870
And, you know, if you're if you're trying to. Make an argument, or even if you decide something so important, you want to pick it up.

136
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,200
You can do that with with what you've learned.

137
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,570
Okay. So there will be.

138
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:06,550
A midterm and there will be a final exam. And actually, this is well, it's not really out of order, but each of those is 25% of your grade.

139
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:15,219
The other thing we're going to talk about this case presentations and debates towards the bottom of the screen is us is also going to be 25%.

140
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,990
So three quarters of your grade actually depends on the two exams.

141
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,410
And also doing this case presentation debate, which you do as a group, working together, a group of students.

142
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:37,240
So the way I do these midterm and final exams is they are closed book examinations.

143
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:48,520
And so what I typically ask is for for people to come here and, you know, bring your laptop in and do it while you're sitting here.

144
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,610
You know, you're not supposed to be doing it with someone else and.

145
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,200
So when you do that, let me see what order I want to say this in.

146
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,530
So there's other students who aren't in this room more than likely.

147
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:19,250
But I hope you're hearing me in real time in person, at least some of them that really can't take the exam here because,

148
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,880
you know, if somebody lives, for example, in Pittsburgh, it's a little bit of a drive to go take an exam.

149
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:42,560
Right. So and so the so the other way to do this is I say you've probably done this in other classes, focus on the details of when it comes out.

150
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:51,290
But essentially what happens is if you say I can't or I don't want to do the exam sitting here where we are now,

151
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:01,480
the the other choice is essentially to do it on Zoom, where you have the camera pointed at yourself the whole time.

152
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,760
And that just is to make sure it's a level playing field.

153
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,540
And, you know, everybody knows it's supposed to be, you know, closed, like and that's what's expected.

154
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,980
So I just want to let you know that that's how I would be organized.

155
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,350
Okay. So I should probably stop for a second here.

156
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:29,550
I covered a lot of things. Are there questions or issues or things I said that were unclear that I don't want to bring up?

157
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah. What if we have accommodations for extra time or limited testing?

158
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,670
Yes, there certainly will be for your time out for your time.

159
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,850
And depending on whether an individual has a need for that or you talk about something else like I have accommodations.

160
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,400
Accommodations, yes, I come in person to do it or like, yeah, when I go to the testing center.

161
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,450
Yeah. What I would, what I would ask you to do.

162
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:06,570
Anyone that has accommodations is get those to me so I know about them like within the first week or so so that I know what's happening.

163
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,280
But yeah, we're always made what the accommodations are so right.

164
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:18,120
Besides the fact that people get accommodations, typically you're given a somewhat longer time to complete it.

165
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,350
They're also given the opportunity typically to be somewhere that's quieter unless,

166
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,650
you know, there's less turmoil going on, fewer people doing things.

167
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,930
And so, you know, I always, I think, were required to but I'm happy to do it.

168
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:40,260
I always make sure that any what's required in the accommodations, if someone has it, will be met.

169
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:48,080
Okay. Anything else anyone wants to comment on right now?

170
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:02,630
All right. So the other part of this class that I actually in that I enjoy a lot and I get to see how in my experience, you know,

171
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:10,580
people coming to this program, the University of Michigan, you're usually a very, very smart group of people.

172
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:18,560
And I get to see it because you're going to have to defend these positions, which I'll explain in a moment.

173
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:26,600
And it's and so it's going to be an assigned team of students that work together.

174
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:38,569
The way I do. This is, for example, how many people who are in this room or in the RH program, industrial hygiene.

175
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:48,260
So actually not that many. Okay. So like a lot of years it's been there's been, you know, ten, 12 people or something like that.

176
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:58,460
And then you want to make sure that everybody that each group has a if if that were the situation has at least industrial hygiene as because that's

177
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:09,770
someone who is specifically should have a lot of training about recognizing hazards in the workplace and deciding what needs to be done about them.

178
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:19,190
So that's just an example. Another example is that there is I think, I'm not sure if some of you were in the room or not,

179
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:30,410
but I think there's four people who are in nursing school and I think who may be working on doctoral degrees as well or already have them.

180
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,080
But anyway, so those are those are people that have, you know,

181
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:43,360
a background in terms of disease processes and so on and like that and, you know, diagnostic differential.

182
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,480
How do you decide what's wrong with someone and so on. And so those people would be spread across that group as well.

183
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:57,320
So you'll see. I'm going to ask you for all this information about what your background is and so on,

184
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,560
and then try to figure out how to put groups together in this case,

185
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,320
because there's 50 people that are part of the class, which is actually a bit bigger than I've had before.

186
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,970
We before we were able to do all these presentations, these case presentations, because you do them.

187
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,049
I should have explained more about this. I'll get to it in a moment.

188
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,410
But real short, you're required.

189
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:34,069
You don't get to decide. You're required to either take a pro or anti position on whether it's if it's something in the workplace

190
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:41,809
environment or it might be in might be an environmental one has to do with the kind of housing someone's had.

191
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,710
And so I like that.

192
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:54,050
But in in other words, you know, you're going to be making the argument that you've been asked to make, your team has been asked to make,

193
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,900
to try to argue that by looking carefully at the science and the literature and so on and how it applies.

194
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:09,860
So now that if you're if you're the a group that's supposed to say anti, you're supposed to say, okay, now,

195
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,479
yeah, this person had some exposures, but it doesn't it doesn't fit with what their, their disease outcome is.

196
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,790
And here's these all these papers that show that this is problematic, that that these two we've got together and the other team is go ahead.

197
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,500
Has been assigned to say pro and they're going to want to argue exactly the opposite.

198
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,840
Yes. This exposure, either environmental like in the house or in the workplace,

199
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,190
is what's responsible for the main disease process that this person endured.

200
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:48,979
Okay. And also, before you have to do this, we're going to spend it's not like a whole class,

201
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,250
but part of a class of giving you an example that that will work through together.

202
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:04,579
So everyone's more sort of uncertain about what's expected. And these are going to be some real cases.

203
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,059
Some of them are getting a little bit on all side, which is sort of interesting.

204
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:15,350
It doesn't really change that much, but it is obviously the literature changes about what's going on.

205
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,399
So they'll be about real people, things that happen to them.

206
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,700
And usually what I do is I get I wrote at least one other faculty member into

207
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,009
this and we both sort of score how well people did with it independently.

208
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,030
And then we meet with each other to talk about how it worked for the different teams.

209
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,220
And I feel obliged to do that because I don't know.

210
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,880
I don't know if I'm particularly biased or miss things or.

211
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:52,340
Whatever it may be. But I certainly have found that if you have one other person who you don't always agree with them, so it makes things more fair.

212
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:01,569
I think it's not just when I think about it. It's at least one other knowledgeable person, fire fighter who's been doing this for a while.

213
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:11,250
What they had to say as well. Okay. Yeah.

214
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,540
So this is a little bit new for me to try to do this, but I sort of because of an issue about some people not being able to be here physically,

215
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,200
you know, I'm going to set this out in more detail, but I'll have office hours available.

216
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:35,230
And what I'm going to what I'm thinking is if there's a group of people that didn't make it to the class that day,

217
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,190
for whatever the reasons are, you know, they live in a different part of the country or they were ill or something else came

218
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,590
up that I'm going to ask the people that weren't able to come to class to join me.

219
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,560
I mean, this will probably use your resume to just have a discussion about what they missed in the class that day.

220
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,950
So that's a way to try to make sure everyone sort of has the same set of opportunities or as close as we can get to that.

221
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,650
Okay. So let's see.

222
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,710
Okay, so here's the course requirements and grading, I hope.

223
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:22,240
I tried to get everything on one page. Is that is that big enough that you can read it from the back or not decide how close?

224
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,980
So, so, all right. I'll point of things. Um, so participation in class discussions.

225
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:37,150
So that's like basically class attendance. And hopefully once you're here, you'll want to speak up about things.

226
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,650
It's not a huge part of the grade. It's 5%.

227
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:50,229
But I was just talking about what I'm going to do if you weren't here is ask had this discussion with a group of you

228
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:58,870
that weren't here on that day so that you had the same sort of chance to weigh in on whatever was going in going on.

229
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:10,690
So that's only 5%. The quizzes we talked about just completing the quiz is 5% of your grade, how well you do, what percent correct that.

230
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,310
And remember, you get two tries and you use well, I don't know if anyone ever has gone downhill, but I think you could only get better.

231
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:28,510
So a lot of people, it's not infrequent that people get perfect scores in very usually.

232
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:37,120
Usually it's hard to do that for every single one. I think we might do like nine or ten of them, but usually people do pretty well with it, so.

233
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:46,480
So that's 10%. And then what we talked about where, you know,

234
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:56,200
that your that you are being asked to read information and with questions and that maybe certain questions

235
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,540
that you're supposed to write something to submit about what you think about answers to those questions.

236
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:08,980
And then also the part about looking at some other people's responses and weighing in on that,

237
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,030
what you did or didn't like, particularly about how they responded to that.

238
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,540
All that put together is still is only 5%.

239
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:24,260
So it's it's definitely heavy on the exams. And one nice thing you'll at least I think you'll like it.

240
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,600
Probably some people prefer to do it a different way is the way I've set these

241
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,710
exams up is that they're they're all multiple choice or true false questions.

242
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,540
Some of them are tricky multiple choice questions. I got it wrong.

243
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:47,860
But you don't have to you don't have to write an essay. You don't have to memorize things like the names of things if it's already there.

244
00:29:47,860 --> 00:30:00,220
And the question. And what's very nice about that, which is, I guess, obvious, I'm sure everyone in the room already knows this, is that, you know,

245
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:12,430
you're doing this through campus and you get to know what your percent has correct was before you walk out the door so you don't have to wait,

246
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,530
you know, right away how to do the exam as soon as it's time.

247
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,160
Okay. And then.

248
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,050
But it takes presentations. That's 25%.

249
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,250
I talked about that a bit.

250
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm not sure if I want to go into excruciating detail, but what I'm going to show you that that there's that statue supposed to take.

251
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,160
I will say one thing about the case presentations, debates.

252
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:48,319
From my point of view, what I hope part of what happens and what I see happening typically is that there's you know,

253
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,760
we're covering a lot of different territory here, you know,

254
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,599
in terms of exposures and how to think about them in terms of disease processes and outcomes,

255
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,059
how to think about them and and how to think about reading the scientific literature.

256
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:08,630
And, you know, if you read some study and they come to some conclusion and, you know,

257
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,840
to think things through and their conclusion reasonable that they they came through came

258
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,480
out with or actually could you say and I'm not sure I agree with how you interpreted this.

259
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:27,829
So it sort of brings all those things together and it's a way of, you know, putting together all the things we're going to talk about in here.

260
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,590
So I, I think it's I think it's a very useful exercise.

261
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,030
It's a lot of work, but it's also sort of fun. You can, you can, you know.

262
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,330
Show you in a minute. But know, we mostly give credit for things like comprehensiveness.

263
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,070
You know what you're saying, correct as it is, and so on.

264
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:58,120
But you can also get some positive points for being flamboyant, if that's what you want to do.

265
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,739
They really like your running a quiz show on TV.

266
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,780
I'm going to convince the audience that it's whatever.

267
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:15,219
Because the audience the jury is going to be everybody else who's got been assigned to that that particular case or whoever.

268
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,320
There's going to be a group of students assigned to, say, probe.

269
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,900
It was the exposure that caused the problem.

270
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:31,930
And the other group time, they're going to have to argue that the exposure did not cause their problems or maybe even the problem is not real.

271
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,549
Okay. So.

272
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,300
Yeah, so I think you have to say what you think.

273
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:46,190
It's a lot of work, but I think it actually really helps bring things together and how you how you

274
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,010
use the information in this class and how you how you think about this things.

275
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,310
All right. Any questions on requirements or grading before you go on?

276
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,330
Usually people are interested in that. Okay.

277
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:14,720
So here's the timetable for that case. Presentations and debates, I I'm going to assign the pro and anti teams by January 19.

278
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,110
So two weeks from now. And, you know, we've talked about all that,

279
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,589
trying to make sure it's the balanced teams that are put together a reasonable way where members of

280
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,610
those teams represent different areas of expertise that you can bring together to work on this.

281
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:44,290
And by the 14th of February, I'm going to want a list of four or more scientific references.

282
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,780
And by the way, those scientific references should be original work like this.

283
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,870
So someone say, here is here's what the different studies done on X have shown.

284
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:02,120
You want to actually get into the nuts and bolts of the studies.

285
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,900
And so you'll do that. And, and you also write a 1 to 2 page outline of your plan presentation.

286
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:20,810
The reason for paying a lot of attention to this is that I'm going to give direct feedback to everybody.

287
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,320
And if if I think if some part of what you're doing is barking up the wrong tree,

288
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,250
I'm going to tell you that before you you keep going on and on about it.

289
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:38,120
So it's actually you actually do want to spend the time and have thought about it and got your group working together.

290
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:50,930
But by next next month, because you'll get better feedback from me and get a better final product that way.

291
00:34:51,440 --> 00:35:04,399
Okay. And then I have everybody submit their their PowerPoint slides that they're going to make this argument with at the same time.

292
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,240
So that sort of level, the one thing that's going to be tricky,

293
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:16,640
which I actually haven't figured out completely, is so my experience with doing this is that if.

294
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:27,340
If you get past about five students in one group, usually what seems to happen with that is that some people don't contribute very much.

295
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:35,050
And so actually, I typically have tried to avoid having more than four people in one group, but sometimes five.

296
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:43,000
In this case, since there's 50 students in the class and historically I use four different.

297
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:56,380
So for different situations. So it means a different team because there's a pro A.D. for each one and we need five.

298
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:02,690
I can get a fifth one. That's not a problem. But even when I do that, there's going to be five people in each class.

299
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,800
So I just wanted to warn you, I mean, that's I think that'll work fine.

300
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:14,000
And that each class in each group, they'll be five people as I try to make the groups diverse,

301
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,070
as I said, um, so I just wanted to let you know about that.

302
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:30,110
The other thing you should know about it, so the way this works is following your group does a presentation and,

303
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:41,510
and that's when the other other side finds out what you have to say with the literature you're basing this on and so that.

304
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:50,030
So you both do that and then you have a chance for rebuttal where you know you're going to want to.

305
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,679
I mean, I'm not trying to put words in anyone's mouth, but you're going to come in and say, you know,

306
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:04,010
those two those two studies that your team the other team really put a lot of stake into it, so on.

307
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,530
Well, first of all, the conclusion of that study day was incorrect.

308
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:15,200
Here's why. And the you know, the study just wasn't done very well.

309
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,430
I wouldn't pay much attention to it. Pay attention to what we found in the literature.

310
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:28,729
That's the kind of thing you're going to hear. And it's yeah, don't don't try to be nasty about it.

311
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:35,930
But it it actually pushes people, I think, to think carefully about when they read scientific studies.

312
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,300
Did they do that? Well, I believe that what they say is the outcome, that kind of thing.

313
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,570
It's so it's worthwhile. All right.

314
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,900
So. So that happens.

315
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:57,220
You both and you also have to practice because you only have 11 minutes to do the first presentation and you only have 7 minutes for the rebuttal.

316
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,130
Okay. So you'll need to probably practice doing this with your team.

317
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:12,170
So. And the the one thing I have to work on that's going to be a little trickier is I'll have to

318
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,640
make some changes towards when when you're actually doing these presentations towards the end.

319
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:25,160
Because even with that 11 minutes and 7 minutes, you can't actually get through five.

320
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,880
You can't get through more than two cases per per hour.

321
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,030
So we're going to have to do this on three different days, but I'll figure that out.

322
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,470
All right. Um. And this is it.

323
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,820
We'll be talking about this actually in the next day when we meet again in a few days.

324
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:54,570
But these are the kinds of criteria that you probably would want to use to think about if you're getting ready to make your argument.

325
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:00,709
That's what's there. And I already mentioned that the judges is going to would be meeting probably one of their

326
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,870
faculty members in the things would pay attention to her emphasis and hearsay comprehensiveness.

327
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,710
And as I mentioned before, to some extent style. Okay.

328
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,030
And the other thing is, she calls the jury,

329
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:23,659
which is everybody is not on that case that has the right pro or anti or will probably do it the fancier way.

330
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,140
Now, we used to do it with paper anyway.

331
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:37,640
And so you'll you'll get to see what, how convinced you were of your the other people in the class.

332
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:48,710
And then and then usually I know something about this particular situation, what actually happened with these people.

333
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,640
So so I'll weigh in with something as well. Although I have to warn you ahead of time for some of these, I,

334
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:02,600
I changed the story a little bit because I think it's too easy for one side or the other.

335
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,790
And so if you put a lot of time into the fact that sometimes the tape would disappoint,

336
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,440
when you say that, you mean you didn't get all the data there wasn't actually real?

337
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,610
Yeah, that we were counting on that, but so be it.

338
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,720
I try to keep things pretty level, even in terms of that.

339
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:30,280
All right. And here is, of course, Joe, it's already warned you is definitely going to have to change somewhat here.

340
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:37,000
We're talking about case presentations and rebuttals because I've got to sit in some extra and we're here.

341
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,390
I don't think there's any need to go through it.

342
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:55,090
But other than to say five days from now, next Tuesday, we'll have our first in class activity, BPA, which is quite interesting.

343
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:03,489
And the other thing I'll be talking about before we do that in that class is ideas about causation,

344
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:10,790
which, you know, has a lot to do with things you learn when you're looking at things like epidemiology,

345
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:17,860
you know, how do you decide whether something is actually causal or is it just happens to be changing with the other thing?

346
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,120
So we'll talk about that. That will be coming up in the next class.

347
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:35,940
All right. The thing I'm going to look at in climate change towards the end here.

348
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,359
It's interesting because when I started doing this with climate change,

349
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,230
which was only, what, three or four years ago, a lot of things sounded hypothetical.

350
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,990
As you probably noticed, a lot of problems are no longer looking hypothetical.

351
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,780
Right? It was very much real. And I'm not sure what to do with this.

352
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,710
There's one part of me that wants to spend a lot more time talking about climate change.

353
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,730
So I got a little bit worried about that. Okay.

354
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,060
Well, let me just ask you. I'm interested, a show of hands.

355
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:19,280
How many of you have taken a course where there was a really significant amount of that course that was talking about issues of climate change?

356
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,380
It's quite a few people, but definitely less than half. So I'll try.

357
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,540
You'll have a head start on other people, but we'll talk about that when the time comes.

358
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,590
But it's very, as you know, and it's not things happening in real time.

359
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,549
All right. It's probably enough.

360
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,850
I know this. I think that it was the last thing I had.

361
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:56,750
Yeah. Any questions or comments or anything that covered about the course itself?

362
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,500
I, I will try to turn over a new leaf and get things ready in time.

363
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:10,840
I know this was. Right at the edge there. I have no I have no plan to do that again, is I?

364
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,200
There were too many things I had to change. I didn't realize how long it would take.

365
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:26,210
Okay. So. Every two weeks.

366
00:43:33,930 --> 00:44:36,270
That's where it's. So right now, it's only today that has all the vaccine about the session.

367
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,840
That's why it's the only one that is a different colored underlying.

368
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,190
But you'll definitely have this very shortly.

369
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,180
My plan is to have the first four sessions you quite quickly.

370
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:59,330
Okay. So there's today. It was there was nothing to do.

371
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:07,730
We did the course overview. We're going to talk about occupational environmental medicine, an introduction to it.

372
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:19,049
There is a lecture. There's a recording which is actually it's like seven years old now.

373
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:25,230
But I think it's still worthwhile if you want to listen to to the first part of this.

374
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,580
I wasn't going to cover all of that if I could avoid it. And.

375
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,190
I didn't do this. Did I want to tell you?

376
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,030
Well, maybe we should look at this together. I could just put it on.

377
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:58,680
I'm sorry. I just. I did this too fast because I was running out of time, and I just realized that the insides are here.

378
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,460
I actually can go get them, though, from a different way and just do this.

379
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:27,500
It's. You can hear.

380
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,130
Okay. I come back to that, I want to show you one other thing here about assignments are going to come up for next time.

381
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:49,530
This is when you can you can read it. But it's basically I really appreciate knowing a lot more about everyone in the class.

382
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:55,020
And I'm sure some of you have quite a bit of expertise on certain things that we're going to cover.

383
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:02,520
And so I'm also interested in knowing who knows about that, but I want to speak to it a bit, that kind of thing.

384
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:11,970
And. Oh, and also and I would like to know things like.

385
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:18,880
Yeah. What you what name you like to go by a first name or a nickname?

386
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,960
I don't know. Maybe you'll tell me you have to call me Mr. or Mrs. something.

387
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,620
I was really not. You can call me time if you want. I won't mind.

388
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:35,320
And. And also, if you want people to be aware of their preferred pronouns that as well.

389
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:45,320
Um, and everybody already knows this, but you know, the feature here is to, to see what other people post about something.

390
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,610
You have to set your own. So it's hard.

391
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,620
It's very hard. It's tough on plagiarism because you don't get to see anything after you've already written it up.

392
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,630
Okay. Um. You know, I think.

393
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,700
Yeah. So as I say, some people already started doing this.

394
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,340
It's great. Anyway, I think that's worth looking through.

395
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,480
Um. Let's.

396
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:24,910
Yeah. So I won't talk about this, but this is just to give you a sense of what this kind of thing looks like.

397
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,689
Right. If we're using Peru produce, which I know I was told by Joanna,

398
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:38,830
who has tremendous respect for the staff person that was here at the beginning, she says this really works well.

399
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,479
If she says that, I believe her. And yeah,

400
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:53,000
we're going to be looking at the PPA and looking at articles in The New Yorker and

401
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,800
then asking you to answer questions about what you think based on what it said,

402
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,620
and then write a different article from a different place that took a somewhat different approach.

403
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:13,600
And then there's also an actual article which covers a lot of things, but one of the things it covers is so this is bisphenol A,

404
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:23,890
BPA, which makes plastics more flexible, and so tends to show up all kinds of places, you know, from baby bottles to you name it.

405
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:33,490
And so there's a lot of concerns about animal studies, at least suggesting there may be adverse outcomes associated with this agent.

406
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:40,390
Okay. So that's so it's like something that's in our environment that we run into all the time.

407
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,159
And you probably have seen things advertised.

408
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:51,400
You know, if you look at something, you pick it up, they'll say, you know, BPA free or something like that.

409
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,790
They're going to say that that's great.

410
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:03,310
Which what these two people are talking about, this is just starting at HUD, is they're saying, well, um,

411
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:12,940
so now you come up with some other agent that's not chemically very different from BPA, but there's now there's no data at new agent.

412
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,549
There's been all these animal studies and everything.

413
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:21,130
But now you're saying, hey, it's BPA free, but we had to do something to make the plastic easy to work with.

414
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:27,640
And we don't mind the fact that nobody can come back to us and say, but this study says it's a problem.

415
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,810
But we know for a lot of these things, there's like basically no information.

416
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,130
So that's an example of the kind of issues, very real life issues that come up.

417
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:44,050
So if we're going to make of that up on all these things, but just sort of like journal of why,

418
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,260
why there's good reason someone might get riled up about what we're going to talk about in five days.

419
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,120
Yeah, go ahead. So this is due before the first class on Tuesday.

420
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:07,740
Okay. So what what's let's do is basically you're going to be asked to answer two simple questions.

421
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,800
One is, you read this New Yorker article.

422
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,890
Um, did it change what you believe about this?

423
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,550
Was it did it change how you think about it, that kind of thing?

424
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:28,700
And, you know, give a little bit of information about why you're saying what you're saying.

425
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,150
And then the second thing is to read this one.

426
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:41,030
As you can see by the title, where that person's coming from. Right.

427
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:46,730
And and say, you know, this person seems to have a bad habit.

428
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,940
More than one person I can't remember right now seems to have taken a different tact.

429
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,680
And the person who wrote The New Yorker article. And so now you're sort of being asked.

430
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,110
But what do you believe or where do you come down on this after you listen those two.

431
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:07,820
So there's other when we do other ones, it is some of them get more complex.

432
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:15,300
And sometimes I I've been known to list as many as ten different questions you might want to answer,

433
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,510
but I never ask you to answer ten questions before you come to class.

434
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,939
It's absolute maximum, I think. Ever ask anybody to answer before they come to class?

435
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,830
Might be three or something like that.

436
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:36,690
So it sort of guarantees that you've looked at it and thought about it, take it seriously before you show up here.

437
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,200
But I don't want to we're going to talk about it in person, too.

438
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,500
And so there's not a need to burden you with that.

439
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:52,470
You have to have a position on every single item that was listed, every question that was listed.

440
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,660
So that's sort of how it's organized. But just like the due date of the due date.

441
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,880
So the due date is the due date is that we're going to actually talk about this in five days.

442
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:09,210
So you need to have written a couple of paragraphs about you.

443
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:14,249
You can be asked, what did you think of the New Yorker article?

444
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,880
Did it change your way? You thought about this if you had ideas before?

445
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:24,030
And then what about the article that says BPA is fine if you ignore most studies about it?

446
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
And yeah, big questions like what do you believe?

447
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:38,520
How do they match those kinds of things? I mean, all those I mean, I don't need to tell you this because I, I know typically, you know,

448
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,519
people that come to this coming to the University of Michigan are on top of all this is what I find typically.

449
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:50,069
But anyway, it sort of brings up all those different issues that have to be put together at the same time,

450
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:58,469
you know, do you do you believe the science? Do you believe that the people making arguments are doing that from a neutral approach,

451
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:04,080
or are they doing it because it's going to be, you know, helpful, maybe monetarily or something to people?

452
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,360
How do you think this played out? Is that I think you already heard, but I sort of thought about this.

453
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:21,000
Is it reasonable or unreasonable to say, okay, there's studies of animals suggests there might be some real issues with adverse issues with BPA.

454
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,590
So let's just use a different chemical. We've got some smart chemists here.

455
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:32,520
They figure out to still make it flexible, but it won't be BPA, but it'll be something close to BPA.

456
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:37,080
That's the problem, because, you know, it has to be something that makes the plastic flexible.

457
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,550
You know, there aren't that many different ways to do it. So it's those kinds of things.

458
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,410
Right? So so you do have to you have to read all this stuff and do some thinking about.

459
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,059
You have to write a paragraph or two.

460
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:53,850
But then remember, you also have to look once you've submitted it, then you can see what everybody else has done so far.

461
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,830
And then you're supposed to take at least two people and you don't need to do that too.

462
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,980
I wouldn't come too far where you are.

463
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:09,749
Hopefully usually want to support what they're saying or is, or I guess that's the nicest thing you can say to someone.

464
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,350
It's like you think the same way I, I was thinking about it,

465
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:20,970
but you did it in a way that was really different and very make things very clear and easy to understand.

466
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,500
I think that might be like the nicest thing you'd say that when somebody when you read it,

467
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,430
it's okay to say, I totally disagree with what this person said.

468
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,750
You don't send their you don't send it back to them. They make that clear.

469
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:44,849
Like, I see I see what all the are. But, you know, you're not it's not like you're required to set what you said to the person so you can you

470
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,510
can say something negative if you believe something negative about what they had to say.

471
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,680
But when I said this five times,

472
00:55:52,680 --> 00:56:07,169
my experience with this is that if you didn't do organizing things this way works really well because it it means that usually everybody

473
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:13,020
or almost everybody in the class is on top of things because they were already required to do something with this information.

474
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:21,419
Right. And then we come together as a group and you might, you know, occasionally hear me pontificate too much.

475
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,380
But, you know, if you can stand that, you know, then you get to it.

476
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,820
You can debate it in a much larger group and see what people think.

477
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:35,250
And, you know, for some things, it depends on what it is.

478
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:41,670
There's some things where I probably have to contribute quite a bit because it's just it's hard to figure out what something might be about,

479
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,970
but lots of things that's not true that know you can answer the questions as well as anyone.

480
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,030
So I don't know.

481
00:56:52,120 --> 00:57:01,990
My experience has usually been that the students really like this part of it because it's like, you know, you're thinking about real world problems,

482
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:10,330
what to do about them and how people are addressing them or failing to address them and what should

483
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:16,629
actually be done and see whether some people may have very different ideas and positions on this.

484
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:23,290
And then, you know, you can debate it a bit. And it's it makes it's like.

485
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:33,330
It gets us to what you really are after, which is okay, given all of this information and having thought about it, where do I come down on this issue?

486
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:41,400
What do I think should be happening? So so it makes it makes it real world, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

487
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,250
Now that I've talked that out so much, I sure hope that people still are interested in this, but we actually get to it.

488
00:57:50,580 --> 00:58:00,930
Let's see. Okay. So I think what I'm going to do is save you some trouble because somehow.

489
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:08,730
I was doing too many things at once, but. Let's see.

490
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,040
Just. Here.

491
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,750
So I'm thinking I might just go ahead and play this because.

492
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,690
You don't have to sit here in this offense if you don't want to. But I did.

493
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,250
I don't. Somehow I didn't. And that with the.

494
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:52,280
But this time it's maybe they're not doing so.

495
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:59,470
You can hear what I had to say six or seven years ago about some of this.

496
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:05,270
But I'm just going to go ahead and try to put this on. And.

497
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,870
Not adjusted, of course. Content. What I'm interested in is.

498
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:19,540
Examples of issues with occupational environmental diseases in the city.

499
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:28,860
What I have to do here, just push this right. That's a couple of examples of celebrities throughout.

500
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:52,470
I don't know that you know that and accounts for half of all.

501
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,350
I think it's about more than half of all.

502
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:05,340
The closer to ionizing radiation that's not to the allowed is not to do CT scans, plain X-rays and MRI's in general.

503
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:14,130
And sometimes that material and it's the second leading cause of lung cancer, etc., and the leading cause of smokers.

504
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,810
So does everybody think they know what this is?

505
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:23,670
Probably so that's radon, right?

506
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:35,440
So here's a nice. I'm playing Halo, the chess, China's great big opacity,

507
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:43,700
where it should be blackish ish because there should be just mostly air there and a lung cancer showing up on a chest x ray.

508
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:50,610
And here's an example of a probably a home that's had some remediation done,

509
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:58,540
has had a ventilation system installed to remove excess grade on from the house, especially if there's a basement.

510
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:05,600
Right. And as Mike, I think I had sold or bought a house a long time.

511
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:14,050
I believe in this state somewhat. I'm sure someone knows. I don't think I actually do sell buy a house without having radon measured in the house.

512
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,170
I think he's legally required to he's allowed some sort of car.

513
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,420
Oh, it's outside because it's under $40 and it's just because I expect the buyer to do that.

514
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:36,400
So. Okay. So let's say just to keep you interested mean I suspect.

515
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:48,580
But if I could go backwards, I tell you. Okay. So this well, this isn't a philosophical question.

516
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:57,430
It's not a trick question. But I've got a question for you. Why were you afraid of into all these basics, if I know the answer that.

517
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:08,760
Right. It is naturally it geological materials and you know where it's coming from.

518
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:14,970
Why is it showing up in geological and it's a gas. You know, it must be being generated and dissipated.

519
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:18,920
Right. Yeah. Radioactive decay.

520
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:24,680
So there's this long cascade of radioactive elements and decay and another area acting on it.

521
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:31,550
And eventually you get to the kind of radon that is a problem.

522
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:38,960
And so there's two two reasons this problem exists. One is because of the top of that is Uranium 238,

523
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:46,070
which has a half life of four and a half billion years, which is almost exactly the age of the earth.

524
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:50,390
So only half of the radioactive uranium has changed.

525
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,340
So there's still lots of it around.

526
01:02:52,970 --> 01:03:01,220
So it's actually very important that the parent, the original parent of this cascade has such a long half life where it would be here.

527
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,610
Right. This would all disappeared long ago. And that's our half life.

528
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,710
And the other problem is it's great.

529
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:17,390
I think it's reality. 22. Right. I'm going to embarrass myself if I get it wrong, because there's simply too rate on the cascade anyway.

530
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,430
The one that counts, unfortunately, is a half life of a little over three days.

531
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:28,910
Just perfect to get from where it is on the ground to somewhere very different when there's differences in pressure.

532
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:37,340
And sure enough, that over a pretty short time, most of it will go on to the next product.

533
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,420
Which and. I don't get into it too much.

534
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:46,620
I just want to just say, you know, there's more to this than meets the eye.

535
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,910
Usually for both of these things. Some of you in this room probably knew all that already.

536
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:53,150
I'm guessing most people haven't had it presented that way.

537
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:59,830
So it's interesting to think about why the problems exist and do all of.

538
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,280
Ubiquitous contaminant doesn't. There's no reason the human body needs it.

539
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:16,150
Almost all of it ends up in bone eventually, and it can take years or decades for half of it to be cleared.

540
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:21,070
And it has effects. Many different organ systems integrate them all there.

541
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,980
And children are particularly susceptible.

542
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,860
Well, actually, I'm sure if you had to if I didn't have more than one answer, but I wouldn't want to tell me what the obvious answer is here.

543
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:38,680
Right. Okay. And you all get all this already.

544
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:44,030
But that's why that's a big deal, right? And here, I'll tell you a little story.

545
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:52,430
The first time I went to South Africa was to work on things was 1992,

546
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:01,730
and I got a tour from someone who was high up in one of the major oil refineries in South Africa.

547
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,590
South Africans are industrialized. So this is 1992.

548
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:13,760
Does anyone know roughly what year the man putting land and gasoline in the United States and planned.

549
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,850
Yeah. In the 70 seconds, 78 was actually the year.

550
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,620
No, no gasoline can have any light in that from this day forward. Okay.

551
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:33,730
So here we are 14 years later. And by the way, that was probably the biggest single document of all public health victory.

552
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:42,080
2048 had enormous impact on people's lives that this country is fighting immigration vastly.

553
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:49,339
And all of a sudden, 1992, they took me around and they showing me all these different things.

554
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:57,770
And I tell you the sign, they say this is where we're going to build our new total ethanol plant, slightly hold eggplants.

555
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:05,360
We're going to start making it so we can putting all our gasoline. And I started with it and I couldn't resist.

556
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:12,589
I was tired of implying I said, you know, do you think that's going to be economically your best hope in the long run?

557
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:20,090
Because I'm sure you're well aware there's all these countries, sort of high income countries that have banned its use.

558
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:26,120
They said, well, yeah, we think, in fact, they they actually never going to stop because they never actually built the plant.

559
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,740
But I was sort of like, so that's what we're planning to do next.

560
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:42,520
So that's a big deal. And I'm sure everyone else that you know, that picture right is all I can ever let you think.

561
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,850
Still has a few applications out of doors because it's so resistant to weathering.

562
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,390
But this is, as you know, it was it was being used indoors.

563
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:55,070
And, you know, your homes creates a large potential problem is in place.

564
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,159
All right. Okay.

565
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,500
So in the eighties and early nineties,

566
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:11,180
people that some people started really worried about AIDS and there's something happening anyway for most any other reasons,

567
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:23,960
various types of hepatitis and so on. But that's when more health care workers started using rubber gloves and glossier source of an allergen.

568
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:32,150
And if you had direct contact, you could have a problem, but you also was closer.

569
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:36,979
So all of you that are involved with directly with health care.

570
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:45,470
Now, I was somebody that I have so many people in this room. And so with gloves, you know, you want them to be relatively easy to put on.

571
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:49,250
So they would be part of the inside, so they would slide on to half more easily.

572
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:57,110
And first they had powdery get mixed up into latex, but they each allergenic and then could be inhaled.

573
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:05,239
So you could have by just a contact dermatitis, but you could have a severe respiratory reaction like an acute asthma attack.

574
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:14,540
Okay. And so you got this situation that says there is irony or whatever you want to say that we got

575
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:21,719
personal protective equipment that probably helps prevent health workers if you have an HIV positive,

576
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,140
but it's causing them a different problem. So everyone knows this is latex allergy.

577
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,690
And that picture on the side, of course,

578
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:38,680
is a picture of someone with a sort of classic latex allergy contact dermatitis when they've been wearing gloves.

579
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:48,440
Yeah, that's where they break out. I just so I honestly, if anyone knows this for contact dermatitis,

580
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:57,230
how long from when they started this current exposure that's going to cause the problem that initial exposure to allergy.

581
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:05,690
How long is a lot of current exposure that's going to cause? The problem occurs is a two you are going to see abnormalities going to see the reaction.

582
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:12,170
I had any idea, like, two weeks ago, a little too far out there.

583
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:16,970
But you're way in the right direction. It's not like a mosquito bite.

584
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,640
That's a different type of reaction. It's a high risk type in your body.

585
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:30,470
Everything's ready to go. So when you get that, you feel quite well and itching.

586
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:35,120
15 minutes ago, I actually had a couple of minutes. Contact dermatitis.

587
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:39,770
Usually 48 to 72 hours because it's a cell mediated reaction.

588
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,930
Things have to go somewhere else. And right there, like sort of waiting there to happen.

589
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:57,050
Okay. And. And this one, maybe not everyone in the classroom is going to know about this and we're probably going to spend some time talking about.

590
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,250
So this is a pesticide for intelligence, for worms.

591
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:12,680
And it was introduced into the US agriculture back in the fifties and it wasn't actually tested in a lab test to the early sixties,

592
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:20,080
even though it already been introduced and enrolled in Child May 11 as a child,

593
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:33,050
testing it can caused increased or absence from cows and it was recommended to go forward with using it.

594
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:39,290
And there was this production facility as it stands there, which is now in 1977,

595
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:47,480
that males that worked in this one department that were manufacturing this particular.

596
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:56,260
Cast aside, just talking to each other started realizing that several of them have been trying to father a child,

597
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,270
including several none that had successfully fathered children with the partner wife.

598
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:09,700
And something was happening. And, you know, the scary part about this is, especially if you're male, it's scary.

599
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,530
I was now changed and would later.

600
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,480
No change in secretary sex characteristics.

601
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:24,850
No warning of any sort to tell you that there's something going wrong with your reproductive system from this exposure.

602
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:32,230
And then despite the fact that it was essentially banned for use in the U.S.,

603
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:43,920
it was being exported by U.S. companies to places all over the world to be used because it worked fantastically as a pesticide.

604
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:54,040
Great job in telling the ones they made. So this is a state that was sued for tens of thousands, representing tens of thousands of workers.

605
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,579
So it's hard to say. That's why I spent a lot of time.

606
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:02,710
This honestly raises all kinds of interesting questions and issues, questions about what's ethical and what isn't.

607
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:09,920
But I don't go there today as much as anybody I want to since. Diorama.

608
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,840
Okay. Right. And.

609
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:20,830
And. It's amazing. People always trying new things.

610
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:25,870
So there's a billboard in the 1970s in California, which, by the way,

611
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:31,960
was really the facility where they figured out this is going homosexual in southern California outside of L.A.,

612
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:38,760
saying we need to tell you that our biggest problem ever with a gun made by Shell.

613
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:44,740
The other information as part of the growing downtown at the time.

614
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:48,700
And so there you go.

615
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:56,710
All right. So I purposely used up most of my time doing this.

616
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:02,650
And any other questions about starting the organization over the course? Okay.

617
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:09,300
And. So the next.

618
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:19,120
All right. It's probably because I'm too tired from trying to get everything done this time.

619
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,120
Only once. Remember, this won't happen again.

620
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:28,660
Both quit 15 minutes ahead of time, but I guess it's not even 15 minutes because it's supposed to be over at ten.

621
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:32,500
It's only 7 minutes, isn't it? Supposedly around 10 minutes before it.

622
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:48,500
The. No, I don't believe that I know me.

623
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:53,960
I like you.

624
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:04,940
That's why I should tell you.

625
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:11,590
I think that's like. He's just, like one of my.

626
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:16,980
I like to know what's wrong.
