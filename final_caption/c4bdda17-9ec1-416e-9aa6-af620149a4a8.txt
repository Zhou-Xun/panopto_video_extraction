1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,360
Good afternoon, everybody. So great to see many of you here.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,969
I'm particularly excited that this is the second to last class we're going to have this semester.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,450
And today we have five teams which who are listed here.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:26,490
So we are going to follow Kami, which specifies the order and that is generated with a random seat of today's date and from our.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,690
So I cannot cheat. So the first one is going to be sparkling.

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:38,069
Second one brats. So on global health, fourth one B, C and finally on latitude for Wednesday,

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,720
we have one more team than I originally planned, but I accommodate that because of certain health concerns.

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,860
So when you come to the podium, two instructions.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,459
First, notice that this is a camera. Okay, we will be doing the recording because this will be helpful for us to evaluate,

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,300
you know, what's the kind of improvements from the presentation to the final report?

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,590
There will be no penalty of the any change that's going to happen between the presentation report,

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,390
but it's helpful for us to know how much you have worked on since the presentation.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,510
Number two, this is a place where supposedly you can talking to.

14
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,140
Can you guys hear this sound a bit louder?

15
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,200
So when you're speaking on behalf of your team, just come to this microphone and then speak.

16
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,059
Number three. So you just need to click whatever slide that's here.

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,670
So I'm going to kick click the sparkling and I'll just do.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Presentation, which is, I believe, the sideshow. So why don't we welcome group number four?

19
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,520
Uh, sparkling to start the presentation.

20
00:01:52,790 --> 00:02:00,130
We have 12 hours of formal presentation and 3 to 12 minutes of presentation.

21
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,740
A 3 minutes of a Q and A I'll be doing timer. So once the timer fires off and you have to stop, that's the rule.

22
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:31,750
Okay. The.

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:42,420
Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Newton-John. I'm here with my crew member, Molly Anderson, to deliver a presentation of our final project.

24
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,820
And our topic is the association between the years of schooling and the life expectancy.

25
00:02:49,630 --> 00:03:01,390
Well, lefties dependency is a key metric for assessing the population health and this cannot improve has been the goal of many scientific studies,

26
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,350
including the sociology, psychology, medicine and pharmacy.

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:15,370
And the previous studies have shown that the education expenditure has to have a positive effect on the life expectancy.

28
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:24,910
So our objective is to study whether there is a significant association between the years of schooling and the life expectancy,

29
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,800
as well as how schooling affects the average life expectancy among the different countries.

30
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:40,500
Under refer to the data information. Our data covers 193 countries with the euro from the 2002 and 2015 11.

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,480
Income Transfer Types of information.

32
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:52,100
First place, the demographic information like GDP, like population, and the economic factors like schooling and health data like HIV.

33
00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:02,470
And I hope and the index of us. And the referred to the data processing Aboriginal data have nearly 3000 data points.

34
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,259
These are the ones mention that some countries because some of our fiber are totally missing.

35
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:18,730
So, uh, so after exclude, after excluding the missing value and data error, we have 1500 data points in total.

36
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:29,110
And okay, here is our selected variables loved dependency as our scoring as our predictor and the state status.

37
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,440
I call it federal as our confounders.

38
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,550
And from the above, from the tables above the GDP population.

39
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,750
This the two tables can show that the distribution of these two variables.

40
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,940
So I do think we have to do some transformation to remove the skewness.

41
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:59,700
And here is the spaghetti plot. We can see that the life expectancy of almost all countries increases with time.

42
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,530
And there is also a big difference between the rich countries.

43
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,170
It is in. We talk about the other models that are. Here.

44
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,650
I'm gonna introduce the model set up. First this hour, I'll come or I'll come is the life expectancy in years.

45
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,380
And our predictor is the years of schooling.

46
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:29,670
We also included eight other confounders, which is the develop or developing status, the under five years deaths per 1000 people, the alcohol,

47
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:40,320
the percentage of total expenditure, GDP per capita population, the cases of hepatitis B per 1000 people, and the cases of HIV per 1000 people.

48
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,190
And as we mentioned before, here are two variable that is highly skilled, which is GDP and population.

49
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,840
So we consider doing a log transformation first, then put them into the model.

50
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,910
We can see that after the transformation they become more normally distributed.

51
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,730
And this is our model equations. The first one is the baseline model.

52
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:12,190
Here the YJ is life expectancy and see for the object I at the time j and schooling.

53
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:20,770
Here is our predictor. That year is the time measurement and we put all the other confounders into the covariates here, then at a random intercept.

54
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,110
So then for the model two,

55
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:32,049
we add the interaction term of schooling and year because we realize that year has the positive effect on both the schooling and our outcome,

56
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:39,760
the life expectancy and the model. Three We add a random slope of year says when we were looking as a spaghetti plot,

57
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,710
we realized the trend of life expectancy among the countries is different.

58
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,790
Here's the fit information about of the model we consider and we use AIC as our standard for model selection.

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Here we can see that the model with Brendon's slope has the smallest AC, which is around 3197.

60
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:13,160
So this is a selected as our final model. Here in our final moto include our predictor schooling of year and eight other covariates.

61
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,850
And if you were only interpret those significant variables in our final model, first, let's see our predictor of schooling year.

62
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:28,100
We can interpret us one year increase in the school year is associated with 0.13 year increase in the life expectancy.

63
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:36,800
On average, as we have displayed in this spaghetti plot, there is an increasing trend for the life expectancy expectancy as time increases.

64
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,850
So for the variable year we interpret it quantitatively as one year increasing time is associated

65
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,870
with 0.28 increase in year off like life expectancy for the variable under five deaths.

66
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,800
We improve interpret it as one a 100 cases increased for deaths under five year

67
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,720
old per 1000 cases is associated with 0.6 year decrease in life expectancy.

68
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,860
And for the HIV variable, we interpret death. For one case,

69
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:17,689
increase in the HIV positive diagnosis per 1000 cases is associated with 0.31

70
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,260
decrease in the year of life expectancy and for the variable setters we interpret.

71
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,860
As for those developed countries, there is a 9.75 year higher life expectancy than those developing countries.

72
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,660
Okay. So next we come out to the model diagnostics or final model.

73
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,270
Firstly, we charge through the we have for all the variables seeing our final model.

74
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:59,290
We can see here the we are for all variables are very small and we believe that there's no material already issues in our model.

75
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,030
And the next we check to the residual diagnosis.

76
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,830
By viewing the residual file. We can see there is no consequence for our residual.

77
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:22,060
But however, if we see the Q front here, we can see the residuals and follow the normal distribution very well.

78
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,700
But we think that that is okay because there is a limit here.

79
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:40,630
So sample size in our that and we only have 16 years for each country and we look at looking through our data,

80
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,330
the life expectancy variable distribute here not normally perfect.

81
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,060
So that's all the model diagnostics our final model.

82
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:02,110
And next here. So again, our final model is the model which is running slow and the random intercept,

83
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:11,560
the scoring is the variable of interest and we're including all the keywords in our model, as we mentioned before.

84
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:26,530
For on the model, we can know that almost all the country have are increasing that few presidency on average with the year the demand for the country.

85
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:40,300
Usually you have more higher you presidency than the developing country and the schooling is positive associated with the last dependency on average.

86
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:52,480
Ashrawi as and on the photos is two wearables that are significantly negative associated with the average life of fantasy.

87
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:03,310
And the uh, for all the analysis result, we can give some recommendations on that for your house.

88
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:14,500
So firstly, we can strengthen the education you name the prevalence of HIV and avoid younger voters by improving safety,

89
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,140
medical conditions, technology to help increase the average life expectancy.

90
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:30,850
Secondly, the model shows that the percentage of government expenditure on health may not significantly associated with traffic fantasy,

91
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:43,720
but instead we think the total amount of expenditure on health might be made to help increase the average life expectancy.

92
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,640
But we cannot analysis this variable because we don't have data.

93
00:11:51,230 --> 00:12:01,330
Thirdly, we think we can introduce more variables in our analysis to provide a wider range of public health implications.

94
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,060
Now we will talk about some limitations in our study.

95
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,320
So we noticed that the results are the only implied association of the country relationship,

96
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:24,879
which means the country is higher average and every Wednesday than half the lower on the fact that it is lower forever.

97
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,130
So HIV and the status of the world.

98
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:40,180
With the suggestions given by this analysis, I might be limited to the material due to a limited set of variables in our model.

99
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:51,690
Now additionally, the number of years of observations in our analysis was small and the sample size was small, not severe.

100
00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:02,590
So we found that in our editors, some countries with low average life expectancy male have higher probability to have missing values or errors.

101
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,070
And some poor countries, some smaller countries more likely to have a missing values.

102
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:23,950
And this may be that you saw bias. And after we removing all the missing values and errors, they are also might be based on values in our data.

103
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,630
So that's all for the four projects.

104
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:40,010
Here are the references. Thank you. Or do you have plenty of time for questions?

105
00:13:52,310 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, I guess so. You know, the thing is that when you define, what does that mean?

106
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,550
I don't think that thinking about is pretty violence school and the internet from 2010.

107
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,990
Well by be counted in the denominator. I don't know. Since then.

108
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,670
How is going to find it? I don't see the distribution of that.

109
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,720
That's the primary disclosure. And I think I know that the spaghetti shows that.

110
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,460
Life expectancy versus. But I wondered how this.

111
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:43,710
And we have the submarines. So we did include a in this slice, but we do see the plot for the distribution of schooling.

112
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,310
So it means the average schooling year of the population of that country in the year we observe.

113
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,060
So it's for the whole population, average schooling year for the whole population.

114
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,660
And from the distribution plot we have seen, it's basically the normal distribution of arrival.

115
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,540
So it's basically perfectly normal to do that.

116
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:14,910
So it's basically it just fits our assumption for it, this model.

117
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,250
That's one that's a little bit. For my other question.

118
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,260
So. If a person sort of.

119
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,730
Lives lined up to take the. So today's.

120
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,270
Part of the school. So in a country where persons are healthy, they can.

121
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,550
They received education. That makes a lot of sense that they were part of the higher.

122
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:06,440
So. Yeah.

123
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,129
That's it's one atrocity. Yeah, I think that's a very good point of like the study interest.

124
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:21,820
But here, if we only consider the average number for both life expectancy and schooling years, this should be adjusted.

125
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,780
It is for the whole. Yeah, well.

126
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,240
So suppose that one country is. Is having more women.

127
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,150
High school. Live long enough to.

128
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:52,170
So I think that because I was. The nicer advisory there.

129
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,160
I think those are your intuitions that I think there might be reasons that are.

130
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,230
Other than the education policy one. Sectors that have in seven years.

131
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:53,150
That's all I can. Oh.

132
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,020
You want to know what's in this dress?

133
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,150
So it's based on our last name. So like, Verity is just a little.

134
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,570
That's not how you do it. Can we get just one minute to sit?

135
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:48,080
So. The. Uh.

136
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,480
Very nice. Okay. Thank you. She?

137
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,990
That's another thing. And you can get the.

138
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,280
What did you do with this? What is it? Why is it fullscreen?

139
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:24,830
Yeah. Okay. And then just open the other one in this one here. But that's far from ideal.

140
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,810
Well, that's. The worker and the presenter with you on this one.

141
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,680
Yeah. And then it should be a no, no, no. You guys need the speaker notes.

142
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,229
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can lend you. No, no, no.

143
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,320
This is why I do have the speaker voice. Yeah. Let's go out here.

144
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,970
Yes, we do. Roger.

145
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,760
Okay. Let's just teaches movies as well.

146
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,250
At the same time, she would take us. I'm just. We have enough time.

147
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,579
Just. Yeah, it's okay now. Yeah, I think this is funny. This is. This is.

148
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,790
Yeah, that and this and this. You can't. You just have to go.

149
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,790
That. That's not ideal. Okay. This is one of the set of actually.

150
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:19,800
So there is a good work. It was this.

151
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,420
This ideally works if you have this there. So.

152
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,550
Quick, quick. And then we can move. Anyway.

153
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,080
Does anyone ever see this time? Because I don't. Oh, I thought you were.

154
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,670
No, I didn't. Do you? It can be a computer if you want, so it's fine.

155
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,349
I know you guys are going to use the computer for speaking.

156
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,470
No, no, no, I. Okay. Right. Sure.

157
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,030
Okay. But no, we don't even get to see the team.

158
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,690
We'd be the first to. Britain's.

159
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,290
That is something I don't.

160
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,830
Perfect. Okay. Sorry for the delay.

161
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,059
Technical issues. But. Hey, everyone, thanks for coming. I am Suraj.

162
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,000
My members are Yang Lin, Danny of that Malcolm and today we are going to talk about prediction of Spotify streaming numbers.

163
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,550
So hopefully this will be interesting. So we are all familiar with what Spotify is.

164
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,620
Even though it has a few competitors, it remains the most popular streaming service in this world to this day.

165
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,750
So in this project, we tried to track the trends in the streaming numbers over time,

166
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,180
and we were also interested in finding out potential sectors that would influence these these streaming numbers for five weeks.

167
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:14,600
And our outcome of interest is the number of streams. So in the dataset, we have Spotify data on the on the weekly top 200 songs.

168
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,169
We considered all the songs that debuted in the top ten in the time period.

169
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,560
January six, 2017 to April 16, 2021.

170
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,879
We considered top ten because the likelihood of these songs remaining in the top

171
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,850
200 are way more than the likelihood of songs remaining in the top 200 for,

172
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,430
say, the top 50 songs in a week because we wanted to follow them for five weeks and to combat any missing data issues,

173
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,800
we wanted to have as much follow data as possible. So that's why we considered the top ten.

174
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:50,639
And as I already mentioned, we followed each and every song that debuted in the top ten in the time period for five weeks.

175
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,200
So baseline. And then four weeks after that, in the final dataset, we had 164 songs.

176
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:09,480
So we had to engineer a couple of areas to make our analysis are to achieve a better prediction and to make our analysis more feasible.

177
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:16,920
So the first one is the release type. This is a time varying variable that is going to have three levels.

178
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:24,540
So the first one is songs that were singles on there remain single for the time period that we have songs

179
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:30,420
that were released within an album and then songs that were first singles on that release with the album.

180
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,589
We also have a genre, so a song of have multiple genres.

181
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,950
We have like a variable that only has two levels.

182
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,930
Whether a song is a pop has at least like a pop gender compared to like songs without any gender related to pop.

183
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:56,410
We also have a streaming environment. We needed to account for the fluctuations in the number in the over of a Spotify usage in calendar time.

184
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:06,120
So in order to account for that, we created a variable that eats the moving average of the total top 200 streams in the previous eight weeks.

185
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,250
And finally, we needed to account for the popularity of the artist.

186
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,280
So we created a variable that is called followers categorized into two into four levels that takes

187
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,020
into account like the popularity of the artist based on the number of followers they have in Spotify.

188
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:31,230
Okay. So this is our our exploratory data analysis are we have the spaghetti blood for

189
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:38,670
the number of streams over time for 20 random songs selected into our dataset.

190
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,770
We can see that in general, there's like a declining trend and that's like how we expect that this to behave.

191
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:55,440
However, if you can see like there is one song like kind of brain that is the cleaning of the first, but then it's increasing.

192
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,620
We believe that that but maybe partly because we can understand that behavior,

193
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,410
probably because that song was first released as a single and then the album drop.

194
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,370
So like in general, it has a declining trend and then the album drops.

195
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:17,370
So people would like listen more because the album drops and they will like listen to the single while listening to the album.

196
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,330
And then if the crime declines again, we have 164 songs in our dataset.

197
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,700
We also have like these covariates alongside the other ones that I already mentioned.

198
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:38,290
So we have record company. We categorize these into two major labels, recording companies such as Atlantic Record.

199
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,390
There is another one I don't remember the name and then others.

200
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:50,100
We have followers with categories less than 21 million between 21 and 40 million, 40 and 60 million and above 60 million.

201
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,379
We have collaboration with there are some has multiple artists or not explicit whether a song has

202
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,380
explicit language or not gender and then a streaming environment this is streaming environment here.

203
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:09,470
It's in millions of streams. Oh, and I'm sorry for all of the analysis that we're going to do.

204
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,890
We split it our data set into training things because we are very interested in predictions.

205
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,350
So we did 80% training and 20% test selected as selecting the songs randomly.

206
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,520
Okay. Now, let me talk about the models part first.

207
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:33,400
Our whole thinking flow is that based our based on our moderately large sample size.

208
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,560
First is that we want to assume our outcome as a normal distributed outcome.

209
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:49,720
And based on this assumption, we will conduct different covariance patterns, models such as unstructured compounds, symmetry, air, air and so on.

210
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,350
And after conducting the different covariance patterns model,

211
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,910
we will check the normality of our residuals by using the Q here, plus visualization, SHAPIRO, Wilk test and so on.

212
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:11,230
So if after checking the normality we found that our residual follows a normal distribution, we will continue to work on the point one.

213
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,250
And if we found that our residual doesn't follow a normal distribution,

214
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,410
we will continue to work on the point two, which is the Palsson distribution outcome.

215
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,140
That is to say, we will use the link function of our model to be the log link function.

216
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,010
So the other thing that I want to say here is that based on this pause on distributed outcome,

217
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:42,760
we will use the generalized estimating equation to estimate the marginal model coefficients instead of the g out.

218
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,020
And then the reason why we use the G instead of the LMM is that our we are making

219
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,360
the inference based on the population average instead of the subjects specific.

220
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:02,560
So this is the reason why we use the G method. So based on the G method and also this Palsson distributed outcome assumption,

221
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:12,010
we will then conduct the models without interaction and also with the interactions and the interactions we want to include in our model.

222
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:21,940
We have to the one interaction term is the interaction between the weeks from baseline and also the artist followers and the second interaction term.

223
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,840
What it could is the interaction between the weeks from baseline and the collaboration status.

224
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,340
The reason why we want to include these two is that because we think the effect of

225
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:40,180
the artist followers and also the collaboration status will differ as time goes by.

226
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,120
Okay. Okay. So I'm going to talk a little bit about how our results went.

227
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:51,760
So first, that check for the normality of the residuals. You can see that things aren't looking great.

228
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,170
We don't seem to have the assumption of normality, of residuals being met.

229
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:03,850
And for that reason, we moved from fitting this general linear model to fitting this marginal model estimated using GIS.

230
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,380
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the results of that model.

231
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:15,340
I've only shown here the model with unstructured covariance, but we saw the same thing for essentially all of the covariance patterns that we tried.

232
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:26,910
And so what we see here are the results from the main effects model using this log link function and you can interpret the intercept.

233
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,490
As for an artist in the lowest quartile of popularity quartile popularity releasing a non hot,

234
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,850
non explicit song with no collaboration in a typical streaming environment because we've means entered the Spotify environment variable.

235
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,420
That's the typical number of streams you would expect for that artist.

236
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,670
So 24 million with this confidence interval running between about 21,000,029 million.

237
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,500
And for the other coefficients,

238
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:02,130
we can interpret these as sort of the expected proportionate decline we would see or increase we would see associated with each of these covariates.

239
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:11,100
So as you can see, we'd expect about a 12% reduction in the number of screens of a song for each subsequent week after the debut week of a song.

240
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:20,610
And furthermore, what we found is that singles are doing much better than songs released as part of albums on average garnering 19% more streams.

241
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,200
We're also seeing that after the album is released, the single does a lot better.

242
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:31,020
So songs that are singles and after the actual release of the album that they're associated with,

243
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:38,670
we actually see that they're streamed 49% more on average than you would see for just songs released as part of albums.

244
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,450
Other findings include, as you can see, that artists who are in higher quartiles for the number of followers,

245
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,350
so more popular artists are seeing a lot more success, which you can see in terms of those artist followers covariates.

246
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,670
And we didn't find that genre was a predictive covariate.

247
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,340
We also included the other covariates. We mentioned this, but we just wanted to focus on the ones that we thought were important.

248
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,219
In addition, you can see that the Spotify environment.

249
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,990
So if there's more users of Spotify, there's more people screaming in the recent follow up, right before this time we're seeing a lot more streams.

250
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:22,950
So 37% more streams per billion streams we saw in the moving average prior to in the moving average prior to the song being released.

251
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,410
So now looking at the full model where we include these two interaction terms,

252
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:36,839
what we're essentially seeing here is that although artists who are in higher quartiles of followers are more popular, artists are doing better.

253
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,280
In the debut week, we're seeing some regression to the mean in terms of later weeks.

254
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,440
So actually their streams are starting at a higher point, but they're declining somewhat more quickly.

255
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,560
Another thing we're seeing is that collaborations are actually a little bit more durable,

256
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,590
so they're actually declining by 7% less per week on average than songs that aren't collaborations.

257
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,160
So even though they started approximately the same point, as you can see, the collaboration very main effect is almost exactly one.

258
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:11,970
They're not declining as quickly as the other songs are. So moving on to our conclusions.

259
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,150
Moving on to our conclusions or sorry, moving on to our predictions on the testing dataset,

260
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:26,070
you can see that although we sometimes missed the intercepts of the initial number of debut streams, we're capturing the behavior fairly well.

261
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,670
So you can see at the top there, we have seven rings by Ariana Grande.

262
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,620
And you can actually notice that we've accurately predicted that when the album associated with seven rings thank you next gets released.

263
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,710
We see that we don't experience the same decline in number of streams and you can see that our model has accurately projected that.

264
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,120
I'd also like to point out that our incorrect prediction for Humble is because

265
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,980
Spotify made a data entry error and did not note that DAM was released in week two,

266
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:58,110
which is the spike you can see there. So we actually have a data error on the part of Spotify there and cannot blame our model.

267
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:08,310
So in terms of conclusions, although we have this relatively large sample size, we had to go to this model because the residuals were not normal.

268
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:16,890
We use the G method of estimation. We're able to use the model to reaffirm a lot of our prior beliefs, and the model predictions are well calibrated.

269
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,120
It's definitely a limitation that we had to limit ourselves to songs that were at least in the top ten,

270
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,930
and I think analysis using a more complete dataset would be useful.

271
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:31,720
Thank you for listening. All right.

272
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:46,260
So we have 3 minutes for questions. I know I have a lot of questions, but. But.

273
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:55,600
Right here. Coefficient wondering like are those artists for love and interaction or.

274
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:08,250
Yes they are old timey artist followers aren't like um yeah for it's we categorize quartiles.

275
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:18,820
So should I interpret all the. Absolutely.

276
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,780
I kind of like don't know if I should treat like girls football one as.

277
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,050
Yeah, you should. Yeah.

278
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,690
So that would be relative to the to the baseline value.

279
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,620
So relative to artists in the lowest quartile of followers.

280
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,700
So that's. Yeah. And if the confidence interval includes one, that's not.

281
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah. Is the. Like someone does have a.

282
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,300
No flavors no collaboration stage stays constant overtime for all the songs are is a.

283
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,720
WFP is a short run four weeks from debut.

284
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,559
So I think our hypothesis before we included this interaction was that you might see differences in terms of more popular

285
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,410
artists because maybe they're getting a lot of streams in their debut week because everyone wants to check out that artist.

286
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,570
But maybe they have, for example, we thought,

287
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:33,530
less staying power because the songs not necessarily charting due to its inherent patchiness or something like that in terms of the collaboration.

288
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,910
My initial hypothesis was that it would go the opposite way and that's why we included it,

289
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,750
because I thought a lot of people would check out collaborations for the excitement, but then they would drop off.

290
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,340
But clearly that's not true. And artists who collaborate more and get more Spotify streams.

291
00:35:50,340 --> 00:36:03,780
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,290
I don't think we had any of those songs in our day. To me, that single.

293
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,730
What is it that once they decided to use another collaboration?

294
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,290
Yeah. I don't think we have. Yeah. And I believe that if those had been included in those datasets, those would be separate.

295
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:25,250
Separately coders and the primary artist was the person who was who had it, who had the entry and then the level was just mentioned as.

296
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:37,430
Yeah. Which.

297
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:47,759
Look. That's a good question.

298
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,409
So we collected these figures in terms of 45, 45 measure a lot of variables, but they are very hard to interpret.

299
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,450
So even though we wanted to include them in the model because we don't really know how to separate them,

300
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:11,130
we just like like we did with The Matrix after that. But we didn't like to do it ourselves, but we wanted to see that they have such.

301
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:28,320
I have some food questions. Over this version.

302
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,969
You guys try to. Right from the get go.

303
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:46,610
The guys have the. So wonder.

304
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,500
For this one. We probably didn't, but we were planning on doing that.

305
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,610
Artist. You have looking for some.

306
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:16,790
How many? So. So we did consider that because we wanted to make population statements and not make individual statements that we would do that.

307
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,690
Yeah. And then for further action, if we have a new answer that we don't have.

308
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:30,590
So that's what we are using as a sort of way to include like the sovereignty situation was more like if,

309
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,840
if, if an artist has C next summer then following that song.

310
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,630
I suppose you get. Actually, it has a lot to do with.

311
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,510
But they are. Scouts. Players.

312
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,680
So what do you think they would want? For them.

313
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,770
I think it makes more sense to get. And it was the final question.

314
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:07,280
Oh. So I'm going to guess based on what we looked at them and the patterns because we looked at a bunch of them for predictions.

315
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,480
I think it's God's plan. Yeah.

316
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:18,430
Just on a fun fact when we were trying to like, look, we only have eight songs for each one,

317
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,750
although like every one, all of the songs in our training set,

318
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:31,000
we had a very, I believe, half an hour, 45 minutes trying to decide which one was wondering, because we had so many Drake songs.

319
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,480
I was like, Oh, this seems like somebody else. All right.

320
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:43,020
For the sake of time, let's look. How do.

321
00:39:49,560 --> 00:40:10,520
Oh, well. Okay.

322
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:18,320
So hi everyone. In this group we have Beau Flynn, Yehudi and myself and Pre.

323
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:29,030
Our project is modeling suicide and mental health disorders, a longitudinal analysis covering 49 countries from 2000 to 2010.

324
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,760
So let's start with a little bit of background.

325
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:43,680
A 1993 study done in Finland found that 93% of suicide victims were at some point in their lives, diagnosed with one or more mental health disorders.

326
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,460
The most prevalent were depressive disorders and alcohol abuse.

327
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,469
Another study looking at suicide rates in Taiwan and India found that 88 and 97% of victims,

328
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:01,230
respectively, suffered from disorders such as schizophrenia, mood disorders and alcoholism.

329
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:09,440
There is considerable literature examining the effect of unemployment, GDP and incarceration on suicides as well.

330
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:17,090
Therefore, we chose to look at the association between mental health disorders and suicide rates in various countries.

331
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,130
While while controlling for several confounders. We aim to answer two questions using our dataset.

332
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,140
First, how does suicide rate suicide rate change in countries over time?

333
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:35,920
And second, does the effect of rate of mental health disorders on suicide rate change over time?

334
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:46,510
So our main outcome is suicide rate, and our predictor of interest is the prevalence of mental health disorders,

335
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,780
which in this case include depression,

336
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:58,600
anxiety, eating disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, alcohol and drug use disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

337
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:08,530
Confounders in our model include incarceration, incarceration rate, unemployment rate, GDP per capita and geographic region.

338
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,720
It is important to mention that we had incarceration data for every two years from 2000 to 2010.

339
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,360
And so we used an imputation method to get it for every year.

340
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:29,860
So each missing incarceration date was obtained by taking the average of the prior and next year's rates.

341
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,460
We also transformed the number of suicides into rates in order to compare them across countries.

342
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:44,590
And in this table on the right, we can see that the mean suicide rate per 100,000 people is 13.38.

343
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,350
And the mean mental health disorder rate per 1000 people is about 142.

344
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,470
Also, the majority of the countries in our analysis come from Europe and the Americas.

345
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,100
Okay. Let's have a look at this price.

346
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:11,240
Organic thought of the number of suicides per 100,000 population base year by country.

347
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,790
And we can observe a slightly declining trend for the year.

348
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:25,340
And the number of suicide per 100,000 people ranges from like close to 0 to 50.

349
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:37,010
And we also observe the zero report for all the countries, Slovakia and both 2006 and 2007 years oh seven.

350
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:48,500
And we think this is probably around report and lead to our lead to some bias where some changes to our model.

351
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,500
First of all we made some transformation of our cover ICE.

352
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:01,550
First we just go to our continuous coverage and to have a back by their mean and they're a standard deviation

353
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:09,290
which can have our model converging better and we can also have a better interpretation of our final results.

354
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,480
And with the prevalence of mental health disorder, incarceration rate,

355
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:24,020
employment rate and GDP here also observed like only one country from Oceania and two countries from Africa.

356
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,780
So we regrouped this three countries into another new group, others.

357
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,610
And we also remove Slovakia just because of the probably raw report.

358
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:44,810
As we said before, based on our distribution of outcome, we chose to use the generalized linear mix model using Poisson Poisson distribution.

359
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:57,740
We first test because of our dispersion also compared to kind of model those models for modeling Kundera, FACA model and negative binomial model.

360
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,020
We also test for the inclusion of random. So over time, whether we need it or not,

361
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:10,910
we also test the in action term of time and mental health disorder to see whether there is a interaction effect here.

362
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,600
First of all, we calculate over dispersion ratio.

363
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:23,910
This is a calculated based on the sum of sum of square messages divided by as arrested, different degree of freedom.

364
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,480
And we saw the ratio is significantly larger than one, which indicates over dispersion.

365
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,140
And we also tried the negative binomial model, which can also account for the over dispersion.

366
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,629
So we would just use a jump with negative binomial distribution here.

367
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:50,130
And we saw the over over dispersion ratio is is much smaller, is smaller than one.

368
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:59,729
However, we know that random effects already account for a over dispersion, so I think it's fine to just continues plus on distribution.

369
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:06,390
So we just all the following are based on our Joanne and using a sound distribution here.

370
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,580
Yeah. And with that person framework in mind, we then went towards if we can defend an intercept only model.

371
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,459
So we fit a model with only a random intercept.

372
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:24,070
And then we fit a model that actually allows the intercept, intercept and slope of the year to vary by country.

373
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:34,390
And then we compare these using the ANOVA function R and we got a likelihood ratio test statistic with a P value far smaller than our 0.05 cutoff.

374
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,030
And then we concluded that from this result, a model with only random intercepts would not be defensible.

375
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,510
So we included the intercept and random slope.

376
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,310
And then our final model is pictured down here. We have year mental disorder.

377
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:57,490
The interaction between your mental disorder, the categorical variable of region GDP, incarceration, unemployment and our random effects as well.

378
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:06,370
We then offset for the population. Next, we want to actually test for this interaction and also run some model diagnostics.

379
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,120
So we want to answer a question of does the effect of prevalence of mental health disorders on suicide rates change over time?

380
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:17,740
So if we go back to the other slide, our interaction term deals with Beta three.

381
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,730
So we ran a test to see if 83 was equal to zero or not.

382
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:30,280
And we actually found that with a P value of 0.4644, we actually don't have enough evidence to reject this null hypothesis.

383
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,780
However, we did decide to keep this interaction in our final model because it deals directly

384
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,320
with our question of interest that spurred on the study in the first place.

385
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:48,310
Then we go to our model diagnostics and we use the generalized variance inflation factor to check for multiple linearity amongst our covariates.

386
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:56,950
All those values were less than two, which was the rule of thumb that we had found in our research to use two as our check.

387
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,030
And then we also ran residual plots as well for our model. And you can see here in our residual plots, the assumptions seemed to be met.

388
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,150
We have some trailing off at the tables here in the normal two Q plot.

389
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,310
But these residual plots also highlighted the need to get rid of Slovakia,

390
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:18,970
because our residual plot here was severely violated when we included Slovakia as a country.

391
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,220
Okay. Uh, uh, sorry.

392
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,060
So our, our standard model is a generalized linear mix model using personal as our distribution.

393
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,159
And we decided to include both the intercept and the random slope.

394
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,810
First down our results of the likelihood ratio test.

395
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,560
We also include the interaction terms of the time and a mental health disorder based on our question of interest.

396
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:57,630
The videos have the final module as shown on the left side, and we can see that the EU, the confidence interval covers one and the people of 7.4.

397
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:07,620
Therefore, we conclude that we do not have evidence to support that the countries specific suicide rate ratio changes over the ten years after 2000.

398
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:15,220
After adjusting for all other covariates. And also for the last year about the coefficient of the interaction.

399
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:23,440
We found that P value is also greater than the quantity of five and we conclude that we also do not have enough evidence to support that.

400
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:29,950
The country specific changes in this area depend on the prevalence of mental mental health disorder.

401
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:37,180
After we adjust for other covariates and the results for other covariates and rhythm of war that more in

402
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:47,560
customary incarceration it was a large suicide rate or higher GDP is associated with a lower suicide rate.

403
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,440
And of course, our study has several limitations.

404
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,860
The first one is that we mentioned before our in crosswords is how we have every other use data.

405
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,370
So we use a imputation which may lead to a bias.

406
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:11,209
In the second. While we only include 5 to 7 variables in our study and the previous literature suggested that variables

407
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:18,500
such as the divorce rate or the annual alcohol consumption may also associated with the suicide rate.

408
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:24,830
However, we have difficulty finding this data for all of our 49 countries and over the ten years.

409
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,500
So it did now include these variables due to the customization of our simple size.

410
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:39,300
The third one is that our study is based on country level, so the conclusion may not be tied to the individual level data.

411
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,000
And there are two directions for our future work.

412
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:51,280
The first one is that we want to do some group analysis to test to the effect of sex and age on the suicide rate.

413
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:57,490
Because previous literature suggested that individuals with a age between 25

414
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:02,410
and 44 may have a higher suicide rate compared with the young and the elderly.

415
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,730
Also, men may have a how I read compares women.

416
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:13,659
And the second direction is that we are going to increase the linear spying methods in our model

417
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:19,660
to examine whether it is 2000 and that economic crisis will affect the suicide rates or what.

418
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:28,000
And there are some literature suggested that a higher suicide rate may be caused by this economic crisis.

419
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,570
And this is the list of our reference and data set. Thanks for listening.

420
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:42,540
We welcome any suggestions or questions. I would tell.

421
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,980
So lot of great presentation. And I think that.

422
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:07,800
So you guys can scroll to. I say.

423
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,320
This. Yeah. Yeah, I think I understand is a disclosure.

424
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,530
Yeah. So with no idea how it should be.

425
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:36,419
Oh yeah. The 5050. Yeah. Yeah. So we, I, I might be in notation near here, but yeah.

426
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,430
Because we have a Q and Q plus one models that we're comparing here.

427
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:51,570
We'd have the 5050 mixture. So we just want to make sure that keeping that in mind when we look at the P value, just making sure that that is,

428
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:59,280
you know, very, very low because I know that when we compare this to the mixture, we could have some issues there.

429
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,640
So we were just looking for that P value to be very, very low to kind of account for that.

430
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,480
What? Next slide. This is almost like. But that's.

431
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,680
You know, you're using the. Using a no vote test here, too.

432
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,979
So basically we fit a model with the interaction.

433
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:28,040
Without the interaction we did using over test in the likelihood rate or a NOVA function are in the likelihood ratio test here.

434
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,400
So what depends on what kind of tests you do. Like what it's been.

435
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:41,880
Eric. What's Weinstein? Okay?

436
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:48,020
Yeah. So for the bottom.

437
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:54,180
Right. What? Uh. So you guys were pretty solid.

438
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:01,790
Yeah. So I think it's. We?

439
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:15,470
Yes. I think the when we had this checked it, we had not changed the title yet, but we had used the our puss on model in it.

440
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,510
So I think the default title might have made it seem like the normal Q Q plot.

441
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:26,600
But from what we found in the research and everything, they had used this as one of the checks.

442
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:39,270
I you have a you can go to the site. So for mental health disorders that tend to be.

443
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:47,720
They are. The mental health disorder is this variable right here.

444
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,930
Is that changed time or is that. This over time?

445
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,239
Yes, this does change over time.

446
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:04,260
We had actually categorized it in the beginning into low countries with low, medium and high mental disorders based on their rate.

447
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:10,860
And we saw that around 3 to 4 countries actually flowed in between those categories.

448
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,840
So it is not a time invariant covariance.

449
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,250
Yes, we treat yes, we treat this as a continuous variable.

450
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,640
It's like. Here.

451
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:49,720
Yours is an average over ten years. Like over, like all 539 we have.

452
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,630
It goes to. Yeah. So the the lowest.

453
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:16,069
Here that starts around here, this is the Bahamas. And then all the way up here is actually Lithuania is very high up here with

454
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:19,940
countries like with bigger countries like the United States right around here.

455
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,310
Any questions? Okay.

456
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:40,370
Okay. So I woke up the next day.

457
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:50,620
So the team for. What's the word for today?

458
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:13,819
I don't know what that is. It. Okay.

459
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:37,200
Just one. I can. Hello?

460
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,490
Can you hear me? Just fine. Pretty well then. I just want.

461
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:49,280
Okay. Hi, everyone. We're team B.C. and today will be presenting time trends of academic performance by geographical region within the United States.

462
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:57,430
Some background information. Education is extremely important for health, which is why we're looking into academic performance.

463
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:04,510
And there are several reasons why. But one of the main reasons that the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is where we got a dataset from,

464
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:11,140
is interested in is education as an indicator of employment and income.

465
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:19,540
And people with higher educations tend to have to find stable and stable jobs and higher incomes or stable income and jobs.

466
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:25,899
And this grants access to resources such as health insurance, retirement benefits, gym clubs,

467
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,890
being able to afford a house in a nicer neighborhood that may be less prone to violence, etc.

468
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,020
And the second impact is the generational impact.

469
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,069
So this has an effect on the children of parents who have higher education.

470
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:48,790
And in fact, children whose parents have a higher education are more likely to get obtain a higher,

471
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,280
higher education or degrees such as a college degree,

472
00:58:51,580 --> 00:59:00,190
and are less likely to be exposed to violence and housing instability, which in turn leads to a higher healthy life.

473
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,850
So some prior research on academic success.

474
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:12,650
Since academic success is we're using it as an indicator of whether or not you're progressing in your educational life.

475
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:21,260
Most literature uses the grade point average or GPA in a 4.0 scale as a metric for academic success.

476
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:30,170
And within our research, we found that some countries have also realized that the region in which a school

477
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:36,050
is located tends to determine whether how well the students in that school does.

478
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:43,640
Unfortunately, within the United States, there is a gap in the literature, and we hope that within our research we're able to fill some of this gap.

479
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,410
A second component that is extremely important is urban rural areas.

480
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:55,340
So, in fact, in the United States, there is a lack of colleges in rural communities.

481
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:05,090
And people who go to do attend the rural community colleges or rural colleges tend to perform worse than people who attend schools in urban settings.

482
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:11,850
Some other important factors is the income of the parents of children who have low

483
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:16,590
socioeconomic status tend to perform worse than children with higher socioeconomic status.

484
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,010
And of course, race and sex are important factors, especially given the history of the United States.

485
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:30,840
These two demographic groups were once segregated from attending the same universities as white male people.

486
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:39,780
And so we consider this an important factor in terms of the quality of education and the how how benefits,

487
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,280
how beneficial these quality of education may be for these two different demographic groups.

488
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,540
And our data is from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

489
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:58,680
And in 1997, the US Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics created the National Longitudinal

490
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:04,680
Survey of Youth to understand the issues around education and youth entry into the workforce,

491
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,210
which is an ongoing survey.

492
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:17,610
For this survey, participants were recruited from youths born in the U.S. during 1980 to 1984, aged between 12 to 16 as of December 31st, 1996.

493
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:24,540
And for them, at least one parent should have lived within the 50 states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia.

494
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:31,620
The survey oversampled Hispanics and on his buttocks, and he follows those youths through high school, college and employment.

495
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,969
And only from 1979 to 1994 came by.

496
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:48,970
And you only after 1994. Our samples are thorough 300 to 3239 students who were born between 1980 and 1984.

497
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:55,690
And response variable is over time. We have eight time points which correspond to each semester over a four year.

498
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,510
We have two predictors of interest.

499
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:06,270
One is a region which has four categories, and it is north east, which is the reference level, and there are central, south and west.

500
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:11,940
Urban-rural classification is another predictor of interest, which has three categories urban,

501
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:18,540
rural and unknown, which is the reference level three covariates at baseline are sex, race and parents income.

502
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:25,010
We also have two main assumptions. First one is the students who graduated high school begin college.

503
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:34,730
That year, they turn 18. For example, students who were born in 1980, graduate high school and start college in 1998.

504
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:41,420
Second is that the students attend college in the region or area of time at baseline for four consecutive years.

505
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:51,260
Our goal for study is to examine the difference between in time trends of collegiate academic performance or of students from all

506
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:59,240
four regions and examine the difference in time trends of college rates on those three difference urban-rural inference level.

507
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:09,110
Here are some visualizations of time trends of GPA. On the left is my region and on the right is by urban-rural classification.

508
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:18,109
First, if we look at the plot on the left, the red line shows north this region and as students there increases onto first term and then

509
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:23,120
goes down while other three regions signal early increases for the eighth consecutive terms.

510
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:31,610
Next on the right plot, the students in both urban rural areas increases for all eight terms, while rural students is a little bit higher.

511
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:36,020
The students categories in a non region do not follow the same trend this time.

512
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:46,459
In order to test whether the time trends in GPA are truly different between the four regions and between the area types.

513
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,490
We fit the two linear mixed models shown here.

514
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,660
For our regional model, our response variable is GPA for subject I a term j and we have the term number,

515
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:03,020
the region, sex race and parents income as well as the interaction between term and region.

516
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,810
And the interaction terms will be the ones of interest. And although our main goal is examining association,

517
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:13,820
we also included a random intercept to allow each individual's response trajectory to vary

518
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:20,000
randomly when predicting or our urban role model is essentially the same as the regional model,

519
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,720
except we replace the region variable with the area type.

520
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:30,200
And in order to choose the covariance structure for these models, we fit several models with unstructured covariance,

521
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,400
compound symmetry and auto regressive and compared them through AC values.

522
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,609
And for both the original model and the urban rule model,

523
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:43,370
the auto regressive covariance structure turned out to be the most appropriate with the lowest AIC values.

524
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:50,070
So from our models we can see that testing, whether the time frames and GPA differ between the regions,

525
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:55,950
is equivalent to testing, whether any of the coefficients of interaction between the term and region are not zero.

526
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:03,030
These are the Vedas five, six and seven, and we performed a dual test, comparing the models with and without the interaction.

527
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:09,839
And for this model, our P-value was less than 0.05, which gives us evidence of significant interaction.

528
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:15,630
And this means that the time trans and GPA significantly differ between at least one pair of two regions.

529
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:23,940
In addition to this finding, we found that the estimate of the expected GPA of females is higher than that of males and that

530
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,290
the expected GPA of non-black non-Hispanic students is higher than that of black students.

531
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:34,770
Similarly, testing whether the time trans and GPA differ between the different area types is equivalent

532
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:39,990
to testing whether any of the coefficients of interaction in that model are not zero.

533
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:47,550
And these are betas four and five. We went through the same procedure as before and this time our P-value was greater than 0.05.

534
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,060
So we don't have evidence suggesting different time trends in GPA.

535
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,749
And although the interactions weren't significant this time,

536
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:00,149
we have the similar finding that the expected GPA females is higher than that of males and

537
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:04,710
that the expected of non-black non-Hispanic students is higher than that of black students.

538
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:16,299
So from both our model analysis, we can conclude that over time, GPA rate does differ across regions,

539
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,480
but it does not differ between urban and rural classifications.

540
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:26,260
So in this table here, we've calculated the overall rate of change in GPA for each of the four regions.

541
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,889
You can see that the Northeast is the only one that has a decreasing rate,

542
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:34,510
while the other three north, central, south and west have increasing rates over time.

543
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,870
Our analysis also confirmed previously studied determinants of academic performance.

544
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,810
So in both our models we found a significant positive association between being a female student and GPA.

545
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:52,540
We note that the earliest you're calling the college matriculation in our dataset is 1998,

546
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:59,950
and previous literature states that in the 1990s the rate of female student attendance at four year institutions was actually increasing.

547
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:08,950
So, for example, in 1993, the rate of enrollment for women at four year institutions was at 46%, while only 36 for men.

548
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:15,640
We also found positive associations between GPA and being a non-black or non-Hispanic student.

549
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,420
Other previous studies have also found similar gaps in academic performance by race.

550
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:22,990
However,

551
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:31,720
we would caution against interpreting this blanketly as there are other factors such as like inherent systemic racism within higher education.

552
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:38,440
So there are quite a few limitations to our model in our analysis.

553
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:45,580
So first of all, we have missing data. So some students are missing some or all of their eight term GPA values.

554
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,450
However, we assume that these values are missing completely at random.

555
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:53,729
We also make some pretty strong assumptions about an individual's education timeline.

556
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:59,219
So, for example, we assume that everyone entered college immediately after graduation and then was entering college,

557
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,959
stayed there for four years, and we assumed that they stayed there consecutively.

558
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:11,280
So we don't account for dropouts or for transfers, and we also don't account for taking longer than four years to complete college.

559
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:18,470
We also assumed that students remained in the designated region that they reported at baseline throughout their four year stay.

560
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,640
However, people may move around as they transport colleges.

561
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:28,210
Finally, we assume our outcome of interest is a continuous 4.0 value of a GPA.

562
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,070
However, there's not a standardized scale of GPA across public and private institutions,

563
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,790
and so this may not be the most consistent estimate of academic performance.

564
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:42,490
And then lastly, we assume that there's a linear time trend when in fact, this may not be the case.

565
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,070
So some future directions that we might undertake,

566
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:54,830
we might analyze non performance as an indicator of student overall being such as mental and emotional health or self-motivation.

567
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:01,160
We might also want to consider gaps in people's education either taking gap years or dropping out completely.

568
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:10,309
And finally, more study in this kind of area would help us identify regional specific regional gaps

569
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,900
in education and hopefully point out some factors to mitigate these differences.

570
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:25,070
Thank you for listening. I saw some questions.

571
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:17,170
Yeah. So there's two different data sets.

572
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:23,710
One of them was started from 1979. However, the data set that we're using is starting from 1997.

573
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:28,120
So the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been conducting this since 1979,

574
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:33,520
but they've kind of diverged into two different data sets, one from 1979 and one from 1997.

575
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:59,370
That's great. So this. Yeah.

576
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:03,500
I think we were just curious about if we changed that. It would make a difference in our model.

577
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:16,860
But I think you're right that we don't maybe need to consider that. So I think if you go back to the.

578
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,370
So I. Right. It's a good idea to.

579
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:35,320
I think that's a. The New York.

580
01:11:40,840 --> 01:12:01,300
Just another kiosk. I mean, ideally, I think some sort of like oscillating model, but I'm not sure if we've learned that so far yet.

581
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:08,319
Yeah, that's true. I think we're into I don't know.

582
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,370
I think it depends on. I feel.

583
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:27,220
I think you guys have time. So that is for parents.

584
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:39,600
Just baseline. And for the rule.

585
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,850
So I believe the model. So I would.

586
01:12:48,910 --> 01:13:00,980
That would be. Cautious about that because. And how many people?

587
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:56,300
Comparing the. Thank you.

588
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,160
Any other questions? You guys are so right.

589
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:05,820
This is. So let's give them another round of applause.

590
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:12,360
We have a final. Today. So.

591
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:34,250
Why don't you? 700.

592
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:50,930
However, while we are equal before my knees, hands on my crew member, Ethan Shelton and Rachel Outlaw, because they used it,

593
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:56,250
you know not in the nicest of antibody immunogenicity and the persistence of the MRA be

594
01:14:56,270 --> 01:15:01,670
until once instituted P2 vaccine in patients undergoing the maintenance the hemodialysis.

595
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:08,180
Here I want to express on the now global name since this course is called a longitudinal analysis.

596
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:13,820
I think it will be fine to address your user latitudes, which is a synonym of the longitude.

597
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:20,770
Again, that's true. That's the area we all talk about. You're the big one. Okay.

598
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:27,310
Given the empowered antibody response of HIV patients to other vaccines,

599
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:34,720
there are concerns regarding the robustness and durability of the humoral response induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

600
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:44,710
So our group aim to evaluate the immunogenicity of a vaccine during the induction phase, the persistence and decline of specific antibodies.

601
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:53,760
After six months after initiation of the vaccination and the factors predicting these outcomes in patients undergoing HD that they

602
01:15:53,770 --> 01:16:04,000
outside our group use is from this report and I'll call of interest is normalized age or the value of IgG so positive for IgG and AGR.

603
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:14,260
The connection time is t zero before vaccine Taiwan post first dose and t two second dose and every 3 to 4 months during the waning phase,

604
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:22,150
the paper used non parametric analysis like chi square all group use longitudinal approach that out.

605
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:31,850
Okay so instead it while we want to start either on to an all effects of or HD on the human immune response.

606
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:38,840
It's a perspective called a starting role there for these really terrible patients and the controls respectively.

607
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,140
Well, in the industrial phase, we figure sounds regression time.

608
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:47,540
We try the tie off after those three weeks of the first dose and the six weeks after first dose.

609
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,110
In terms of the methods that we use, Jim, and then we use for the continuous sort calling the ordinal value of IG and the

610
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:58,610
model model for their quality of the over zero conversions for component two prior.

611
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:05,300
So we can see that shows that exist curative fluency, you know, a change of presence between the parents and control.

612
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:10,820
So let's look at your first departure because you can look at your the slope of the

613
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:16,450
slope of the patients will become much steeper after the second vaccination and,

614
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,770
you know, second approach. Or we can focus on the Sheba in the control.

615
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:29,030
So the probability all the still positive there is a U-shaped we are in the patients, the probability is the monotonically increase.

616
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:33,140
So Nazareth as you have to talk about your the first part of 31.

617
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:43,499
Okay. The formula is showing up off. We have HD status weeks we acquire as covariate on the last table.

618
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,820
Show the model all the team selected, including the covariates patterns.

619
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:52,080
The right side is the IAC table of defined models.

620
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,810
How we can see a model y has the noise to AC so any star selected as the best model.

621
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:06,320
And table to show the estimated covariate value and the p value was of the covariate as significant.

622
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:11,230
And this goes to show the difference in media ideology.

623
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:15,800
No value was squeezed between HD and now HD patient.

624
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:29,530
We also appeal to a marginal model to determine whether the presence of a teenager in Z or part of this other sin control cell and the young parents.

625
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:36,549
And in aged you model you g model we consider are those who can the older of the pie

626
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:40,720
and the interaction to acceptable for in this outcome all terms are significant.

627
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:45,040
Joey is a pivotal much smaller than 4.05.

628
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,790
And also to improve the position of summation,

629
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:56,220
we try to find the optimal corrosion strata and the the tolerates the corrosion strata is the poster and in the right

630
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:05,560
we approach to the probability of oh I did you pop party with Acer for the HD and controls our vaccine schedule.

631
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:15,100
As we can see the probability of eligible the officer young controls these mature higher sign patients in the priming stage,

632
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:24,070
but it a drop down to the same level as patients and an advantage or increase or gap of the second the vaccination.

633
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:29,229
As for their parents, the probability was low in the beginning.

634
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:35,500
Partridge up bumped up after the second vaccination and that you can see that there are the controls on that stretch.

635
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:42,440
Also we will talk about for the second the study. Oh, of course.

636
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:48,390
Oh, I also Canada the superintendent as is before the AGM a seroconversion started.

637
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:53,450
Oh this time the Russians are in the Scotland on insignificant and we also use

638
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:59,089
the authorities colleges torture in the Roger eyes approach of the popularity

639
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:05,059
of jump of positivity over time and the the prevalence of I German positivity

640
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,610
is also low is a modest increase over time in both the young and pigeons,

641
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:16,550
and the control potential was always higher in parents that control as an extra job.

642
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,930
So now come to the second starting phase of our project.

643
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,959
In this part we want to study antibody decline pattern during a much slower phase and how

644
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:34,140
it would be impacted by different factors with two additional action times called T4,

645
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,560
T3 and T4. And we have the same response.

646
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:49,920
But the additional KRAS is like cancer and B.C. diabetes cardiovascular, and we will still use GM Amit G to study the effect and potential impact.

647
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,060
And you can see here we are plot spaghetti, plot for all the patients,

648
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:01,500
optimum value of IgG and see there is a turning point and time to and the trend is pretty similar during the samples.

649
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:07,379
First of all, we will show the mean under difference across.

650
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:15,330
You can see the difference in the potential impact birth by age, cancer condition, controversy, cortices and anti-incumbency.

651
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:20,190
And we build singles. You ask is interaction between time and each crossroads?

652
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:29,850
And they all show the same trend, similar trend of an especially significant effect in age cancer and the B, C and cardiovascular.

653
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:37,889
And we will show this in our report due to time and space limitation here today and following previous results,

654
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:46,560
we built one for interactions you're hours with hit or aggressive grains selected by SC and likelihood ratio test.

655
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,470
You could see the model parameters here. Notice we exclude gender and diabetes in the speaker model.

656
01:21:53,070 --> 01:22:02,340
We show that age influence while controlling all other cross and zero and we could find with age increasing the agency level would be overall lower.

657
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:11,610
And if we control the age in each group and control other cross and zero and you find the impact of at ABC in different age groups,

658
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:18,059
we could find from the three figures that with higher and ABC level,

659
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:28,170
the agency level would decay much slower in each age group since time to and meanwhile from the peak change we could find the same conclusion the

660
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:38,550
increasing age we lower the overall agency levels and we will also have similar conclusions for many outlook for us and we'll show them in our report.

661
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:48,129
Due to time and space, we meet here in presentation and we just choose the clearest and most significant impact and now we will be at 1

662
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:55,830
a.m. otherwise full time spies and here we just the age and the ABC interaction following our previous results.

663
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:03,510
And we divide the time in three weeks, six weeks, 20 weeks and we only setup our random mean tests, our intercept model.

664
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:08,069
Look here we we will regard the time as continuous of arrival.

665
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:15,690
He said affect. You could see the model parameters here with significant impact on ages interaction and the end end should be seeing pack

666
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:23,970
the nicely is not so significant but still show some trends and we brought slides with parameters and check the trends.

667
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,370
We could find the predicted age for us.

668
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:35,460
With aging increasing older people would have significant lower level of agency during each period, especially after the second dose.

669
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:44,670
Positively, in fact for each age is similar controlling other carrots and considering anti ABC level in each age group.

670
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:50,760
And we only show here that for those under 55 and this LME model shows the same trends

671
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,760
of previous model was and ABC impact on different of any effect of agency levels.

672
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:02,970
And it will firstly decline slower and then faster and time three points next.

673
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:07,579
Okay.

674
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:19,880
So besides M and I model, we built marginal models for AGM and IGT, seropositivity wheezing patient respectively as a model for the mean response.

675
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:30,259
It depends on T and T square, and we divide the user age at 70 and regarded as an indicator for patients who are older than 70 years old and other

676
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:39,080
demographic and clinical variables such as gender cancer and obesity and diabetes and CVD are also added into the model.

677
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:44,660
We also consider the interaction time between time and age to evaluate the difference

678
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:50,270
in the adjusted time effect comparing patients older than 72 years old or younger.

679
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:59,390
And here we show the result for, as you see, a real positive time in Times Square, the only two which show significant effects.

680
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:08,540
And in the plot on the right we showed estimate the probability for a G positive was in male patients without adding other disease.

681
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:14,330
We can see there is a probability of several positive for patients aged less than 70 years old.

682
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,530
Almost always remain higher than those who are older.

683
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:23,180
So this also corresponds to our common sense and previous clinical outcomes.

684
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:29,890
And next we showed results for AGM Seropositive from a plateau.

685
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:35,510
Right? So the overall trend is the same with IGT and overall value is smaller.

686
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:40,310
The difference between two age groups is larger than AGI and so.

687
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:47,239
I know you know, our discussion power is we can reach the conclusion you study one that anti-spike antibodies

688
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:53,000
level for HD patients increase more after second dose and after first dose and once more.

689
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:59,300
While the seroconversion of following priming was lowering in patients compared to controls,

690
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,760
most patients with positivity for anti-spike igg after a second dose.

691
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:09,229
Also, the prevalence of Anti-spike IgG and positivity was low,

692
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:16,460
with modest increase among the vaccination schedule in both patients and controls, but always hiring patients and controls.

693
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:23,090
So we can see that older people would have significant lower level of IGG during each period.

694
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:30,110
But the landing pattern for each age is similar in controlling other covariates and anti HBC

695
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:36,620
level and cancer condition would have significant impact on IgG declining since the second dose.

696
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,500
And what's more, the probability of age.

697
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:47,120
And I guess their opportunities remain higher for patients younger than 70 throughout the time adjusting for other covariates.

698
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:55,280
And so based on all of our study, the results may give future advice on applying different regimens and schedule for

699
01:26:55,730 --> 01:27:01,010
COVID 19 vaccination for patients and patients with other disease respectively.

700
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:04,760
And that's all. Thank you for watching. We are happy to answer any question.

701
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:15,280
I have a few questions. First one is that because the first part of the.

702
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,510
So. For the.

703
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:46,940
So here we are. So these are like evangelists faced.

704
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:57,410
So weeks are said to be using all three of seven is that there's three, 3 to 4 weeks and seven.

705
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:12,280
Yeah. So the only. No.

706
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,190
Actually, in starting phase two, we have two parts.

707
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:23,080
For the first one, we just regard the time point as zero one, two, three, four, and that's another one.

708
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:28,970
We regard it as a continuous outcome just like on zero three, 620.

709
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,720
I just. So now my question.

710
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:42,840
Yeah. So I think to me a. You guys are doing?

711
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:53,340
Oh, no, G. To tell you the truth.

712
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:04,080
Yeah. Think for my podcast that's a lot more about dealing with the fact that some of that.

713
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:08,760
Now not to too sure just to say that when you are despite the.

714
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:19,940
That's an expensive. Explore the reason why I'm asking this.

715
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,800
You've got to step down that for this juncture.

716
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:31,760
And that's where. That's actually a bit.

717
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:41,880
But when you say the name, it's more than that. Just. Depends on what?

718
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:48,420
Appropriate. Don't make us model.

719
01:29:51,340 --> 01:30:05,239
Here. So actually it's just so we just choose the price path.

720
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,860
And by the by what we don't get done on the course,

721
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:19,040
just like select them by the IOC and the likelihood ratio test and we do not try other price structure.

722
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:45,600
Yeah. I think that is excellent candidates and. So we will try it again this hour for this model.

723
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:56,040
Yeah, well, I'm not asking you to. Yeah.

724
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:01,950
It's not like all the US were. Imagine that the first and second.

725
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:06,630
Because they're closing time like yeah they will have hard.

726
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:15,110
So because when the time and space is multiple, you need to try some different kind of structures, right?

727
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:19,200
Just like the explosion. There are few.

728
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,230
Personally, it's like you will have a better guess. Brothers and sisters.

729
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,670
To me, it's a matter of whether those. Alternative.

730
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:36,139
I'd say that's what. Alter the gene.

731
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:42,860
That is not. Yeah, I think so too.

732
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:59,030
Yeah. Okay. This is the first month.

733
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:15,110
What is the pattern here? What is the. So we want to actually, because we have two additional collection times come to this one study now.

734
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:20,840
We have now. Now the time here is the time.

735
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:29,180
Time zero time one compute time three and time four and which represents the dosing time of the patients.

736
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:37,670
So actually and comparing to the first study, now we have two additional action time and the time to here actually is a second dose.

737
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:50,480
So actually what we want to investigate is the whole structure of the antibody level in the patients and not wholly dosing time for him,

738
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,890
but also the after dose type during the second.

739
01:32:55,130 --> 01:33:04,670
So from this from these figures, you could see here we are plotting the difference between different age group controlling all other chlorides.

740
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:12,229
And you can see there is a significant difference between those people aging smaller

741
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:18,980
than 55 and those aging between 55 to 75 and those for those with the latter,

742
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:23,120
the ends of the 70, 55. And so you just want to make sure.

743
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:30,080
So for all the chlorides, how will they impact the antibody level is they are falling.

744
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:38,270
And that's why we want to do a response profile analysis that focuses on the same age and patient extraction.

745
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,260
I think. Okay.

746
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:51,640
So they're purposely spreading the Marines is to destroy the the start no side to one started on the

747
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:59,080
priority decline president in the waning phase and how it can be impacted by the different factors.

748
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:10,040
So basically we just want on to investigating the decline pattern and also the potential factors which can influences, uh, the response.

749
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:13,210
So, so, so you start, you, we forces these to.

750
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:24,140
Yeah. So you know that I think that. My questions really are looking for some parallels or looking for vertical shifts.

751
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:33,430
Because if you look for competitors, be looking for shifts, which I can see that as you get older.

752
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:37,670
Mm hmm. Just the subject of. Yeah, that's.

753
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:46,940
Yeah. Okay. I think as you can see my question, Syracuse was, you know, did you guys want to like specify the questions it's okay to have?

754
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,370
Specific. What is the pattern you're trying to test?

755
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:57,150
Okay. But otherwise, I think it's very impressive.

756
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,500
Seven. No specific. Oh, okay.

757
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:13,310
Gotcha. Thank you. Yeah.

758
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:19,580
So actually here because the origin of the illness at the age is not dividing.

759
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:31,140
So in the first study to offer that this is a study, it divides the aging two or three groups following some previous quality research of myself.

760
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:37,590
So I think it was 55 and 55 to 75 and those two would be bigger.

761
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:48,410
But with the reference of our paper, the paper actually when they are dealing with the age as a category where I was just dividing the ages with 70.

762
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:54,130
So the 17 dealing is part of the reference of the original paper.

763
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:03,000
But I do not follow them here. But it. I was checking.

764
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:11,960
Yes. The 70 is just from the Orient.

765
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:15,170
So you just like a reference of the original dataset.

766
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,180
But so you'll see here and I don't think that's that's reasonable.

767
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:24,680
So I just divide the age group as my previous experience.

768
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:34,620
All right. So your time. Again. I know that you guys are.

769
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,930
You can. That began with. I think that.

770
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,330
All right, everybody.
