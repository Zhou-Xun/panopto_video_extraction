1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,320
That's where it was at. And then next week, you have a break.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,969
On Monday. So you might be here. But then we will on Wednesday to talk about what you do on Wednesday.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:21,210
And I'm already trying that. And so that's great. But just if you have questions about that, you know.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,940
All right, let's talk about let's begin our conversation.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,269
So I'd like to begin with this quote from Mark Twain The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want,

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,320
drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not. And I like this quote for two reasons.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:50,720
The first is that it illustrates that many of the things that we're going to talk about, like behaviors, reinforced behaviors more generally.

8
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,060
The thing that why they are reinforced is because they feel good.

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,910
Just feel good to do. Okay. And so that's the first part is that sort of it acknowledges the fact that these, you know,

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,170
you would rather do the thing that feels good rather than the thing that does not feel better.

11
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,520
But the second is that there's a cost to that, and that cost is your health. Right?

12
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,040
So these are the two elements that we're going to talk about.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,570
So you can think about, broadly speaking, behavioral disorders and what am I to put under that,

14
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:39,270
that sort of and really are everything from eating disorders to substance use disorders to avoiding excess Internet use.

15
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,209
There's a wide range. You know, not all of these necessarily will be considered disorders for the DSM.

16
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,820
But the notion that you can think about any any that's the thing that makes them similar

17
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,840
is that they are characterized by what the person is doing rather than what they have.

18
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,079
Now, that doesn't mean that there's not a biological substrate, as we've talked about.

19
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,720
And we'll talk as you learn in the readings and we'll talk about more today.

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,910
So it doesn't mean that there's not something happening in the brain that is causing these disorder behaviors,

21
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,240
but that what makes them and that's the way to think about this is like it's about what they're doing,

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,019
not what not internally as opposed to something like depression, where it's not depression is not really about what the person's doing.

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,829
It's about what's happening in the brain, in the body. So what is behavior?

24
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,330
Behavior is just any motivated activity or pattern of activity that has a purpose in it.

25
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:35,750
That's any motivated activity. So just think about something like think about your day so far today, it's 1130 on a monday.

26
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,800
What are some things that you did today that you also did yesterday?

27
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,830
What are some patterns of behavior that you that you experienced the last three days to get frustrated?

28
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,719
Yes. And tell me what tell me a little bit about that.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,480
So frustrating. All right. Yeah. So that's that's a foam hand.

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,330
Made my bed and your bed. All right. Wow. Yeah, I know.

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,890
That's good judgment. That was that was self judgments are not towards your breakfast, right?

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,730
Your breakfast. You have, like a morning exercise routine with a desire.

33
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,290
I try to, you know, what have you got on your phone for this more?

34
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,300
Yeah. Still good. Now, let's talk about why that happened.

35
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,820
All right. So. So any behavior as you've all got patterns.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
So it's an example like patterns of behavior, things that you do all the time.

37
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,400
So now think about those examples as we as we walk through this underlying kind of shared idea of why, why, what behaviors are.

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,390
So there's a combination of this physiologic drive and a learned response.

39
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:53,360
So the learned response and this is the thing that the normal book out in her talk goes on to say this is what ends up driving the you know,

40
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,990
this is what what do you think about like kind of Pavlov's dog type thing about,

41
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,310
you know, if you don't get that reference, it's okay, I'm going to explain it. But the idea is that there's things in the world that prompt you.

42
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,290
We're kind of come before the thing that you're going to do. So let's take the example of brushing your teeth.

43
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,110
So behaviors brushing your teeth, what happens first? What is that? What is the proper attitude before breakfast or after breakfast?

44
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,150
Teeth, pressure? I'm a before breakfast. Before breakfast. So you are out of bed.

45
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,920
Brush your teeth. How many of your after breakfast pressures? So what is your problem to me?

46
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,230
So it's right after, you know, I think it's after I eat before I leave.

47
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,770
Okay. So there's some but the point is like, you know, so there's the same behavior,

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,210
but there's some there's differences in sort of like, what is your problem?

49
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,780
I'm also like right out of bed, like, don't don't talk to me because I need, which is strange because I also am like caffeine dependance.

50
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,770
I'm about to go drink like six cup cups of coffee. So it probably wouldn't make any difference if I brush my teeth before.

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,160
After. So then there's this behavioral response, right?

52
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,430
You're brushing your teeth. And then the consequence, the consequences of our dental hygiene are that our teeth are beautiful, you know, etc.

53
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,240
Right. So that's you can think about it that way. But let's talk about your phone.

54
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,080
What prompted you to look at your phone this morning? Turn off your alarm.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,089
So. Oh, it's. It's to turn off your alarm. It's like the fire.

56
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,690
The alarm is on the phone. Yes. And so you can now really get visibly upset.

57
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,350
I felt my alarm. So.

58
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:33,659
And then what part of your phone are you looking at first thing in the morning? Text message, text message code text.

59
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,840
You that, right. Yeah. I think you're looking at.

60
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,810
So in that case, like the phone is like there's a number, right? There's something on your phone indicating like, look at me.

61
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,590
Right. Do you ever look at an app, even if there's not a notification prompts that?

62
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,030
I know. I know the answer. Okay. So when you're looking at your phone. Okay.

63
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:06,490
And then. And then what's the consequence? What do you. What is the sort of sound that they're looking at your phone first thing in the morning.

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,020
Yeah. We stress I'm seeing institutions so stress is down now.

65
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,450
It's up. Stresses up, up, though. Okay. So this is the consequences negative for you?

66
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,550
Yes. Yes. Gotcha. Okay. So, you know, you've you've oriented yourself to this to the world.

67
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,450
Okay.

68
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:36,070
So the thing that's makes the behaviors interesting or different is that that behavior is there's a cycle actually underneath underneath the hope.

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,270
So you do your behavior, you brush your teeth, okay? You feel your teeth, feel nice and shiny, clean for a little while.

70
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,770
You have time passes, you have animals, you go.

71
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:53,770
And what is the name of that delicious garlic thing that they serve with Middle Eastern restaurants?

72
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,489
What is that? I thought it would be something. Garlic sauce to thank you.

73
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,069
Yeah. Oh, man, you eat all of that and then. And, you know, and then and then you go brush your teeth again, right?

74
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,780
Then you get the desire. That appetite in this case just means a desire to do that behavior again.

75
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,229
So let's talk about it with your phone. So you look at your phone, you feel satiated, maybe say she's not the right word.

76
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,040
Right. But you really don't feel the same feeling you had. Bless you before you look at your phone.

77
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,160
Time passes. How much time this is for you on your phone may differ.

78
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,680
You know, this might be minutes. It's my how you perform it depending on sort of what else is going on.

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,510
Right. And time passes. And then that desire to look at your phone is back.

80
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,549
Right. And so and in fact, the developers of apps for your phones depend on this.

81
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,980
This is exactly what they have designed the app to, to walk into it, because they know if this is what they want,

82
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,360
because what they are trying to get is to kind of get you forget to forget about

83
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,140
satiety and instead just do this all the time regardless of what's happening already.

84
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,859
So so you get with a partner and just first we talked about phone, but there are probably other behaviors.

85
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,980
Think about other behaviors that you do that feel good at the time, you know.

86
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,700
So what are some example? I just kind of I mean, you don't have to share with a person, but I'll ask you to share out to some other other things that,

87
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,890
when you think about within this context, are something that you would fit within.

88
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,290
Yeah. Drinking coffee? Yes, absolutely.

89
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,340
So for those of us who are caffeine dependent, so what is your prompt for drinking coffee diet or it's the morning.

90
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,860
Did it start so either. So those are two different things, right? So that so the fact that we can have the exact same behavior.

91
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:46,100
So one is just time of day, right? So this class runs from 1130 to I bet at like 1159.

92
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,430
You know, you just kind of your stomach starts growling a little bit, you know,

93
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,700
and it may not be that may happen regardless of what time you actually eat breakfast this morning.

94
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,009
So but you so there's some incident with your coffee and you know,

95
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,850
and then this there's this drive underneath is what gets hijacked when we talk about dependance,

96
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,360
which we'll talk about more talk a little bit more about it today.

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,549
But so, for example, I used to be a one cup of coffee drinker maybe once every two or three days.

98
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,860
And now literally I have two or four cups of coffee. And the reason for that is because I'm less sensitive to the effects of caffeine.

99
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,650
Why am I less sensitive? Because my brain knows that I'm going to get four cups of coffee, right?

100
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,530
So it is adjusted the sensitivity.

101
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:38,989
So if it had the same number of receptors for caffeine as it did when I was your age, I was only drinking one cup of coffee then and I drink four.

102
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,460
I'd be buzzing all around like nuts. Right. But it doesn't anymore.

103
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,580
And. And so it takes four cups of coffee to just sort of get the stimulant that I want.

104
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,210
And that literally is the definition of tolerance. So I have developed caffeine.

105
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,700
That is that's exactly what I've done. But that's exactly what happens when somebody develops nicotine dependance.

106
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,430
And so one cigaret at the beginning is very satiating, but after a while it's not satiating.

107
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,630
Right? This is also what happens with any substance, right?

108
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,890
Yeah. What's another behavior? You do?

109
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,210
All right, Max, any citizen here loves a deal.

110
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:31,500
You want to know about shopping and getting a deal? I just love shopping.

111
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,459
And what is it? So what is the feeling? All right, so what is that?

112
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,250
What is. What is happening? So I like surfing.

113
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,670
Okay, so. All right, so now. Right. So you're digging through stuff. All right, fair.

114
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,890
So you're digging through things. You find it. You get that with a good deal?

115
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,300
Yes. I've known you.

116
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,540
Yeah. Yes. And I'm here. So then. But in the same amount of time.

117
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,770
Right. So then you eventually that thing stops feeling as good as it did.

118
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,210
It stops bringing you the same pleasure that it did when you found it. All right.

119
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,780
So that looked you know, whether it's sort of like it now, it's doesn't quite fit the way you thought when you start noticing things about it.

120
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,860
Right. And this is this is this is this type of develop, like not feeling satiated by that thing that felt good.

121
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,900
That is it. We can apply to lots of different examples, but I know other examples.

122
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,440
Exercise is a, you know, one that you could fit you could fit in here to.

123
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:44,940
Okay. So the point is, is that there's lots of different examples of this general sort of what behavior is.

124
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:53,310
And it's and it's in its when we talk about what why substance use disorders, why they develop and why they're harmful.

125
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,790
Keep this in your mind. Oh, sorry.

126
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,300
The other thing I forgot to say at the very top. So I asked you to read a paper this week called From Fear to Crack.

127
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,659
And I didn't ask you to read that because that's a good paper and that that's good science and that that's the way that people think.

128
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,959
But rather, I ask you to read that because that's the paper that justified the harsh penalties for cannabis use,

129
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,320
because it showed that people who use cannabis or people who use cocaine almost always use cannabis first.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,570
So this that is the paper that justified harsh penalties for marijuana.

131
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,700
Did I mean those where the paper was published. Or my readers.

132
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,340
Where is that paper published this week? Those who presented it this week.

133
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,830
What? You think I'm going with this? Where do you think? That journal. Where do you think? What do you think was the name of that journal?

134
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:04,020
But it was the American general public health, our flagship term. So we're so I want to, you know,

135
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,819
sort of we're probably going to feel a little uncomfortable this week about the role of public health and substance use and prevention,

136
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,290
etc., because we've now considered unhelpful ideas about the about the problem.

137
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,690
Okay. All right. So this is our model. Any questions about this before I go on?

138
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:31,700
So just kind of an important foundational idea. Yeah.

139
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,560
The model is different.

140
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,780
Or like in what ways would it differ?

141
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:45,460
Maybe for like a healthier, like for positive behaviors compared to like unhealthy or just self-destructive ones?

142
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,490
Yeah, I don't think it would differ very much at all, actually.

143
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,520
That's a great point. So you can imagine this is like sleep.

144
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,850
Sleep is healthy, right? So you feel tired or you've kind of gotten to the bedroom and you're, you know, you're settling down to sleep.

145
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:07,150
Time passes, your body is satiated and your consequences that you're feeling, you know, you're feeling refreshed.

146
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,650
You could imagine this as something like meditation or.

147
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,719
Right. So there's something that kind of like you make time for it. You just desire a time for calmness in your brain.

148
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,910
And you do that behavior, you've time passes and then right.

149
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:33,639
So you can see anything that feels good, anything that feels good can can be described in this capacity, I guess that I will talk about.

150
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,940
Now, let me let me let me revisit that specific question when I talk about sort of why it is, though,

151
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:47,919
that some behaviors are really reinforced and others are not so not all not all behaviors have the same likelihood of reinforcement,

152
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,150
but the model is under the hood of all of them is the same. Yeah, that's a great question.

153
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:02,820
Other questions about this kind of fundamental. Okay.

154
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,589
So what when I say that we're going to talk about, you know, disordered behaviors this week.

155
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,559
Okay. Well, what what makes a behavior disorder, right.

156
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,050
Why is your phone not disordered, not considered a disorder according to the DSM, like looking at your phone?

157
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,280
So the ways that we think about and this is why, again,

158
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,120
this idea of there's a generic we want to have a general idea of our approach of thinking about behavior disorders is that the goal is disorder.

159
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,650
So we can think about anorexia nervosa, the goal of it, I mean, and again,

160
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,490
it's not that people are thinking about this in like a rational way when they're if they're experiencing this condition.

161
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,020
But that what is what what this person is trying to do is get to a low weight.

162
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,360
We consider that a dangerous thing for somebody to do. And so we say the goal is disordered.

163
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,709
You can also think about like self-injury. So if somebody is like a tic disorder, right?

164
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,310
That's the idea that you want a picking disorder. That would be the goal. This disorder.

165
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,680
It might be that the means to reach the goal or disorder. So this is an example of conduct disorder and bulimia.

166
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:10,079
So, you know, so for something like Lenya, it's not that necessarily that's trying to lose weight in and of itself is a disordered behavior,

167
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,610
but rather the means of trying to achieve that are just are problematic and a concern.

168
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,040
And so we want to intervene on you can imagine conduct disorder is a way of like kids trying to play with each other,

169
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,730
except the children are sort of engaging in delinquent, delinquent or kind of bullying behavior as a means of playing.

170
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,740
It could be that the consequences of their behavior are dangerous.

171
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,830
And so with something like nicotine dependance,

172
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,889
the reason we would consider that this is part of the DSM is because we are concerned about the

173
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,590
consequences of chronic nicotine use or tobacco use with something like binge eating disorder.

174
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,870
We might be concerned about the behavioral consequences of something like obesity, which tends to occur in that context.

175
00:16:52,770 --> 00:17:01,320
And then although this is getting is still very, very important, but the idea of illicit drug use, the idea that there would be imprisonment or fines,

176
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,690
and then finally, it could be that the provocations for the reason, the sort of things that are coming along with using the behavior are disruptive.

177
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,930
So if somebody is missing work either due to like a hangover or, you know,

178
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,659
is showing is high or drunk, like on the job or while doing caregiving duties, right.

179
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,660
These are that it's it's that those the behavior is disrupting other parts of their lives.

180
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:37,139
So these are the reasons why we sort of try to put bounds on what is a behavioral disorder versus what is not.

181
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,260
But I want to just kind of make it clear that, like,

182
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,070
there are lots of unhealthy behaviors that just don't fall under the rubric of psychopathology, like your phone use is one of them, right?

183
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:51,090
So like, that's not considered. So you might. You might and by we can debate whether we mean by unhealthy, etc.

184
00:17:51,090 --> 00:18:01,260
But the point is, is that it's not that any reinforced behavior is the same as substance use for an eating disorder,

185
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,760
but it is the case that we we have to kind of put the we try to put bounds on why we consider something

186
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,480
a behavioral disorder and the way that we put those bounds on or that the goal is disordered,

187
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,670
the means to root vegetable or disordered,

188
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,720
the consequences of behavior are dangerous or the sort of things that are coming along with that behavior are disruptive to.

189
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,139
Okay. So we're not going to get to we're going to talk about this more towards the end of class.

190
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:34,070
But I also want to say at the top that that when we talk about treatment for behavioral disorders and this was also apparent in the readings,

191
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,250
there's two types of ways we both are trying to address.

192
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,990
There's treatments that are trying to address the physiologic drive like naltrexone,

193
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,729
and there are treatments that are trying to address the learned aspects of the behavior.

194
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:54,250
So we've had medications for treating substance use, in particular opiate dependance since the 1960s.

195
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,680
And methadone treatment is still used to this day as a treatment for heroin.

196
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,819
But you can think of other examples like antabuse gastric bypass,

197
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,360
nicotine replacement patches and naloxone is examples of medical treatments that are aimed at that drive.

198
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:15,169
So they're not aimed at disrupting the learned behavior. They're there. They're hoping they're going to sort of throw a wrench in the drive,

199
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,160
which is then going to prevent the learned behavior sequence from continuing to happen.

200
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,630
But then there are other treatments and these are far more.

201
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:33,590
These are used much more often, even if they would probably be more effective if they were used in conjunction with another medical treatment.

202
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,200
And those are things like cognitive behavioral therapy and group therapy that are aimed at addressing the learned aspects of the behavior.

203
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:46,100
So this is going to be, you know, identifying triggers of use that is those antecedents and sort of like, okay, now you walk in the doorway.

204
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,040
This is where you normally took your smoke, right? You're trying to stop smoking.

205
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,879
What other behaviors are you going to do when you walk through that door? Or this is the group of friends that you hang out with.

206
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,150
Whenever you hang out with those people you drink, you're trying to not drink.

207
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,220
How do we what else are you going to do with these people? Right.

208
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,130
Can you engage in a social environment where there's drinking is not going to be the expectation.

209
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,760
There are also community led efforts, things like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

210
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,260
Alcoholics Anonymous was founded in 1935. These are kind of patient led groups that provide social support for abstinence.

211
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,270
They they don't have sort of professionals in them by definition.

212
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:36,620
They also, by nature of their anonymity, don't you don't hold themselves up well to quantitative analysis as to their impact.

213
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,099
All that being said, you know,

214
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,850
there was this Stanford NewsCenter Center just about a couple of years ago

215
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,800
saying that Alcoholics Anonymous was a very effective way towards abstinence.

216
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:56,690
If you went to the triple-A website, which is the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Abuse and Addiction,

217
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,920
you would find that they don't think that it's evidence based.

218
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,360
So, again, to the point of the people can disagree on a lot of the things we're going to talk about in the next two weeks.

219
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:16,850
But oftentimes it's sort of beside the point how effective it is because that's the only thing that is available.

220
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,950
Do you remember when I told you a few weeks ago only 8% of people with a substance use disorder got any treatment?

221
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,260
Yeah. Okay. So 92% of people are getting nothing. And the 8%, most of them are getting this.

222
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,160
Okay. So it's kind of, again, beside the point as to which is more effective because homeless, most people get absolutely nothing.

223
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,209
And the last thing I want to say in terms of thinking about again,

224
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,000
we're going to revisit this towards the end of the class when we talk about services.

225
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,930
But what makes treatment for substance use or any behavioral disorder different

226
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,610
than getting treatment for something like depression or schizophrenia or anxiety,

227
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:03,620
for example, is that treatment is almost never sought by the individual for a substance use disorder or disorder, almost never.

228
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,040
Instead, we this is shorthand that people use or what they call the four L's of treatment initiation.

229
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,710
So this is loved ones.

230
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:19,490
This is an intervention where the family has is working to try to get this person help liver, which stands for experiencing a health problem.

231
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,630
Right. So they are developing they might have an overdose.

232
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,670
Right. And then this might prompt someone or you might at that point get court order treatment.

233
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,530
But so the point is that you have some sort of health impact of your use your life, whether you get fired.

234
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,770
Right. Or sometimes, you know, you show up to work drunk or high and you get if you're lucky,

235
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,450
your workplace has what's called an employee assistance program, which is a way to help to get people into treatment.

236
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,480
And the fourth is the law. Right. And so this is that you are arrested for you're arrested for DUI or public intoxication.

237
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,350
Remember back I told you when we talked about treatment use that the illicit using illicit substances,

238
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,309
the likelihood of getting treatment is higher than for using illicit substances.

239
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:13,190
So more much more many more people access treatment for opiate dependance than access treatment for nicotine dependance.

240
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,450
This is because I can legally mandate to go to treatment for opiate dependance.

241
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,740
I can. No one on this earth can legally mandate that you go for treatment for nicotine dependance.

242
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,760
Okay. And so like these these are the four kind of avenues to get someone into treatment.

243
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,260
There's very few people who sort of are seeking treatment.

244
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:44,020
And the this is this is just a this is from the screenshot from the the podcast, the NPR podcast that you listen to about the Vietnam War.

245
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:53,049
Once again, just for those of you who haven't done the reading yet this week, the the situation was that in Vietnam, many soldiers had used heroin.

246
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,420
It was it was relatively easy to access, certainly far easier to access than it was in the United States at that time.

247
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:07,770
And the this was sort of like horrified America that our soldiers were, quote unquote, addicts.

248
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,360
And so what the military did and we can debate whether this was an ethical thing for them to do,

249
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,160
was mandate that you would have a negative urine drug screen in order to get on a plane to come home.

250
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,309
And so that was pretty effective in getting people to abstain from using heroin.

251
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:30,040
And what was kind of shocking to people afterwards was that when those soldiers returned home,

252
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:37,809
most of them, the vast majority of them, never used again. They did not go back to heroin, which again at the time, nobody would have predicted that.

253
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,540
Nobody would have predicted that that would have been no. Of course, when you think about like, well, they weren't in a war zone anymore,

254
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,169
maybe that was like major environmental change would have had an impact.

255
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:53,020
But it does really illustrate when you think about like are very, you know,

256
00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:00,700
even I'll show you data that like nicotine was actually more it was a form of dependance faster than opiates.

257
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:16,800
But the notion that you could have something as severe as using heroin and where 50% of people who used had some sort of dependance in that a

258
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:24,760
relatively brief period of nonuse followed by a change in environment would would address that was was kind of a miracle that came out that way.

259
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,530
And the person who led that work was a woman named Lee Robbins, who also was one of the very,

260
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,390
most very important people in the development of the ACA project.

261
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,980
So the whole first effort to to measure mental health in the United States, her son is a guy named Jamie Robbins, who's a professor at Harvard now.

262
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,670
And that's where the psychiatric genealogy multigenerational.

263
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,050
Okay. So questions about this format switch gears a little that talk about what makes something addictive.

264
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,950
Okay. So what are the types? So there was a question about like what would this behavioral disorder?

265
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,620
Would that be the same for something that's more positive, right?

266
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:16,119
And so the things that if you think about the general gestalt of antecedent behavior consequences and then underneath the hood,

267
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,770
we have behavior satiety, time and appetite.

268
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:26,650
Okay, so what if changes? What sort of factors, if you plug them into that general formula,

269
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:33,160
shape the likelihood that a behavior is going to be a behavior of abuse or what we might call addictive.

270
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,630
The first is, you know, basically how how rewarding is.

271
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,190
How much is the dopamine response from that thing that you are doing?

272
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:55,100
So so for example, if you think about something like food, so all food, you know, is reinforcing in some capacity.

273
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,509
Like, it is very, you know, it gives you calories.

274
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,980
Your body has this natural appetite for it. This is why it is evolutionarily conserved trait.

275
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,530
But like if you are sort of really hankering for something, what are you hankering for?

276
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,880
Yeah. Sweet, sweet celery. No, no, no.

277
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah, it's not celery, right? It's sugar, you know, or something.

278
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,460
Right. And so we. So those even within food, you know, that even though all foods sort of are reinforcing,

279
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,010
there are some foods that are far more reinforcing than others.

280
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,899
And if you were to, like, array, you know, something like tobacco or alcohol or cocaine.

281
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:42,440
Right. Those are other examples that especially something like cocaine, which is like a dopamine agonist, like that's what it is.

282
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:49,070
Okay. The second thing. So first is like, how how much how good does it feel to do this thing?

283
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,210
The second is, how quickly do you feel good from doing this thing?

284
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:03,290
So no one should say no. And it is it would be very unusual to have someone start with a nicotine patch and then like go to a tobacco.

285
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,310
Right. And the reason for that is that the patch is actually not a very reinforced way.

286
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,540
It's a slow release of nicotine by definition.

287
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:19,820
Like that's what it's supposed to happen. Whereas if you if you inhale nicotine, that's sort of the best way to get the high from nicotine.

288
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,690
Okay. This is also why we're worried about vaping, because vaping is some of these that we'll talk about it a little bit more today.

289
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:37,759
But but so the notion that smoking nicotine is, um, provides a much faster high than using a patch, smoking cocaine or using bass cocaine.

290
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,030
Crack cocaine provides a much faster high than using powder cocaine. Okay.

291
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:48,200
So there are things about like the way that people can do a do a behavior that affects how rapidly you feel the high.

292
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:54,770
The second is how long that high lasts. All right. Or the third, rather. So a short duration is much greater abuse potential.

293
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,580
Okay, so so your phone, right.

294
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,850
When you feel good after using your phone, it probably doesn't last very long as part of, you know, even though it doesn't feel very good,

295
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,470
even though it doesn't release a whole lot of dopamine, the little bit you get doesn't last very long.

296
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,790
Okay. And so you're going to continue to do that that last. But the duration of that high is is much lower.

297
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
And so if it's a short duration and this is true, for example, with tobacco, right?

298
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,550
So tobacco that high that someone gets from using, that is relatively brief.

299
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,290
And so you get people who smoke, you know, 24 Cigarets a day, for example, which is a pack of cigarets.

300
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,040
Okay. And then the fourth is potential for tolerance. And so this is what this is my coffee problem, right?

301
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,319
So this is you need to consume more of that,

302
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,970
but that that thing or you have to do that behavior more often that is either larger amounts or more frequently to get the same high.

303
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:53,000
So this is what Norah's talking about, where if you look in the brains of somebody who's been using cocaine, for example,

304
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:01,250
they're they don't make as much of a response to cocaine anymore because they're they have developed tolerance.

305
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,180
Their brains have developed tolerance towards that towards that substance.

306
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,169
And so in order for that person to feel high from cocaine anymore,

307
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,520
they have to use a lot more than what they used to have to use because their brain has actually been changed.

308
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,170
The receptors in the brain have actually changed in response to the frequency.

309
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,400
You're right. It's almost like the brain has adapted to an environment where cocaine is readily available.

310
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,020
And then the fifth is the symptoms of withdrawal, which are tend to be substance, substance specific.

311
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,220
And so oftentimes and this is very true, for example, something like nicotine,

312
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,650
but the thing that a person is doing the behavior for is not to feel good anymore, but it's simply to avoid this misery of this behavior.

313
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,680
Okay. So if somebody is nicotine dependent and they haven't had a cigaret in 24 hours, they are in a bad situation.

314
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:55,600
Like they're going to feel terrible. If someone is opiate dependent and they haven't had an opiate in 24 hours, they can they could die seizures.

315
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,400
There are things that can happen and that through the withdrawal process, if it's not a medically supervised withdrawal.

316
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,790
And so oftentimes a person is engaging in a behavior,

317
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,900
especially later in sort of the progression of a substance use disorder, not to feel good, but simply to not feel that.

318
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,930
Okay. So let me let me ask if there are questions here.

319
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:26,610
I'm going to summarize a little bit. Yes. There are new medicines that can help with healthcare.

320
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,570
Yeah. So, you know, so yeah. So even something like a patch is like a nicotine patch is trying to address withdrawal because they're trying

321
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,810
you're using a patch to try to space out your cigarets over time so you don't have to use them as often.

322
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,640
And yet people will take, you know, if you're undergoing opiate recall, for example,

323
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:54,960
like you're like, we're going to give you medications to help through this. But it's it's going to be pleasant no matter what.

324
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,330
But like the alcohol does this. Yeah.

325
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:07,740
Other questions. Yeah. You mentioned earlier that there's like changes in your brain, like, really like the receptors.

326
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,320
Can you reverse that if you go through like VR or.

327
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,150
Yeah. So that's a great question. Bless you.

328
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:24,390
So the the short answer is probably, you know, the certainly people do engage in like long term sobriety, you know,

329
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:32,040
but when when you talk to people and this is the irony of this is you probably don't even know this reference, but listen to a podcast interview.

330
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,930
I just it was fresh. It was fresh air.

331
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:43,200
So is NPR podcast interviewing Stevo, who is so sort of jackass where they like just do terrible things to their bodies anyway.

332
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,219
So he's talking about for his recovery. So in his experience of that.

333
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,940
And so it was an interesting time for you with today's lecture.

334
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,999
But but the you know what?

335
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,610
I bring that up to say that it is not the case that if somebody has any when when people talk about being in recovery,

336
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:10,770
they don't talk about it as being a passive experience. And so for I'm going with this is that while it is almost certainly like if they were

337
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,780
exposed to cocaine or heroin after being after having not used for six months of time,

338
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,620
that they would react differently than if they had just used it last week.

339
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,969
I'm not saying they would use it.

340
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:27,390
I don't I'm not saying that their brain would look the same as a cocaine or heroin naive person who would never used that substance.

341
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,510
And of course, we would never expose someone in in a study.

342
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,280
We would never expose somebody to that who is not already used.

343
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,960
We do expose people to heroin, cocaine in studies. Those are people who use those substances.

344
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,550
All right. So but, you know, this is something that happens.

345
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,960
So, for example, like risk of overdose is very high after people get out of treatment.

346
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,100
And part of this is because they are potentially using the same amount that they were using before.

347
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,259
But the body has made adjustments and they don't need that much anymore in order to feel high and they like that.

348
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,460
So it's an accidental overdose. So it's there certainly are changes.

349
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,740
The question is like how quickly it takes time? Yeah, it's a great question.

350
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:19,860
Other. So the parts of the brain I mentioned at the beginning of class, I mean, there's been, again,

351
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,009
a term that the the the condition that we're going to talk about class that we have

352
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,880
the greatest understanding of the neurobiology is our substance use disorders.

353
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,910
And this is because you can get rats and mice addicted to cocaine and nicotine and heroin, etc.

354
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,730
And then you can look in the brains of those rats and see what the heck is going on.

355
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:44,010
So we know that there's different parts of the brain, like kind of which and I can't show you a graph like this for like depression or schizophrenia.

356
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,350
I really can't. I mean, people will make things like that,

357
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,450
but I don't know that they they're not based nearly on the kind of evidence base that we have to base this graph on.

358
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,299
And the reason is that that they're tapping addiction for whatever we mean by that.

359
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:06,330
But behavioral disorders are tapping into evolutionarily conserved things like that, that behavior and satiety cycle,

360
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:12,750
the physiologic drive and the behavior that is evolutionarily conserved, that is learning and dry, you know, in physiology.

361
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,370
And so things like decision making, you're kind of just central energy balance.

362
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,920
Your emotional processing memory and learning and motivations are all you know,

363
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:27,430
we know where these elements are sort of like functionally exist in the brain and we know they're all relevant to people,

364
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,580
to disorders of behavioral disorders. Again, this is just illustrate.

365
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:45,870
This is from Nora Volkow, a paper she did several years ago where she was looking at the similarities between things like where this drug.

366
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,149
Okay. Fine so. But the similarity so she's she's been doing work night of the national drug

367
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,680
use has been doing work funding work on good behavior kind of eating behavior.

368
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,020
But the notion that there's kind of like this underlying relationship between this is your your hope.

369
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:10,530
It's like this is your, um, this is your hypothalamus, which is your central kind of metabolic control.

370
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,790
This is the ventral type mental area which is too involved and here a motivation.

371
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,060
And so and then you've got amygdala. This is memory, right? Amygdala and mental is fear, hippocampus is memory.

372
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,780
But so she puts all of these things potentially on there, right?

373
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,830
So if you're a crafter, great, like making things or making art.

374
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,150
On the idea of playing sports, winning a game, right?

375
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:43,130
You can think about that, like the engagement in that music dance, you know, hanging out with friends or even though you might love your job, right?

376
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:50,070
You kind of have to get reinforcement in that way. So she she argues that there's kind of this we shouldn't just think about drugs.

377
00:36:51,150 --> 00:37:00,219
There are things that we can use from what we know about drugs to understand other motivated behaviors and just to kind of make it very clear.

378
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,310
So there's a couple of and this these studies have been replicated to some degree or another.

379
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,590
But I want to show you an example of this, is that the types of studies that are done so this is an example where you've got rats in a

380
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:16,499
cage and they're they're randomized to either get to they have two lovers or they've got yes,

381
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,270
they've got several levers in front of them. So this one and this lever, nothing comes out.

382
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,680
All right. Lever, lever. See, there's two lovers.

383
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,800
There's Lover C and there's Lever S and some of some rats are randomized to get nothing that comes out of Lever C,

384
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,610
some are randomized to get water that comes out of lever C,

385
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,509
some are randomized to get saccharin, which is sugar,

386
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:47,100
but it doesn't give you calories and lever s and some are randomized to get sucrose, which is just sugar or straight sugar out of liver.

387
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,270
So this is suffering is sweet but does not provide calories.

388
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,200
Okay. And so the first thing you notice is that the rats prefer liver or they rather they'd rather get sugar.

389
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:05,100
And some of that has no calories and something that is sweet and has calories.

390
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:12,110
And if they then then, you know, these other things that they choose and lover see you.

391
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,389
They train these rats over time. This is the one this is the one I want to show you.

392
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:25,830
So these are rats. This is where they they're replaced with not it's not water or nothing.

393
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,520
It's cocaine now. And so you can see the rats first liver, see all the time.

394
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,370
They really want what's in lover, see? Okay. So they press a lot and there's nothing, there's nothing coming out of lover s right now.

395
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,530
It's just Lover C that's got anything hooked up to it.

396
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:43,230
And then after about a minute of just being able to give themselves as much cocaine as they would like,

397
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,880
that that liver, as suddenly it's hooked up to either sugar or center.

398
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,270
Okay. And so now and of course, the rats, like, he's not like tied to the thing, right?

399
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,569
He's wandering around the cage, whichever lever.

400
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:01,710
And and so, you know, they still press this lever quite a bit or their cocaine lover, but they start pressing the sugar.

401
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:09,700
After. Even though cocaine is still available to them now, they don't price it nearly as often as they did when they.

402
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,860
Because this is because the high from cocaine doesn't last nearly as long as the satiation that you get from sugar.

403
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,440
But it suggests, again, that we can think about sugar.

404
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:28,660
And, you know, you can think about like how the sugar get into our diet and get into our food system, etc., in a way.

405
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,319
Right. So let me just summarize and then I'll take pause for question.

406
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,040
So we have unlike most psychiatric disorders, we have excellent animal models of substance use, independence,

407
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,650
dopamine or these kind of central word circuits are kind of central to any behavioral disorder.

408
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,300
Again, any whether we're talking about exercise, food, cocaine, nicotine, whatever,

409
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,600
and all behavioral disorders we can we can understand within this kind of broad gestalt

410
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,140
of a physiologic drive that's related to reward and motivation and a conditioned world,

411
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,350
which is our learned response to behaviors and context.

412
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,730
So any substance or behavior that is reinforcing that as it feels good has a rapid onset and

413
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,980
short duration of a high that you get from it and has the potential for tolerance and withdrawal,

414
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:27,730
has the potential to become disordered. So in DSM five, which came out in 2012, we got three new addictive behaviors.

415
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:36,790
So we have caffeine dependance. I guess it's not technically a disorder there, but it isn't ICD ten binge eating disorder and gambling disorder.

416
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,740
So, you know, I'm sure in your lifetime we will see Internet use disorder.

417
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,990
It's not in there now, but it will probably be in there.

418
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,710
We can also imagine like gaming, like video gaming, other types of conditions that might go in here.

419
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:58,380
So again, just the idea that anything anything that checks all of these boxes is going to become disorder.

420
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:12,560
Okay. We pause here for questions. All right.

421
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,660
Well, you're thinking about those. I'm going to take a look at our.

422
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:26,010
Our cloud. So these are the first ten words you think of when you hear the word addiction.

423
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,730
I comment on what stands out to you? What it.

424
00:41:50,780 --> 00:42:06,930
I think the biggest thing is that any time that you read things like I was immediately more so on the context of, like, a lot of the jobs report.

425
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,330
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah.

426
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,760
I thought it was interesting that treatment is what a lot of people think of considering how small.

427
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:25,960
It's a great, great observation. Yeah. The things that stand out to you.

428
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,140
I see issue and I see the word moral up here, which is we're going to talk about this.

429
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,930
We talk about opiates, which is something that is the opioid epidemic.

430
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,750
Certainly, it's changed many times over the course of the epidemic, but it still is more common in rural areas,

431
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,790
which, again, it might not be what you think about when you think about substance use more generally.

432
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:16,270
I also saw where was HIV on here. Right. Which is that can occur in the context of, you know, using or sharing needles.

433
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:21,850
And so the notion that there's other health effects that are even though we're not be able to talk about them in class,

434
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,860
but the notion that there are other health effects that come along with substance use.

435
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:45,690
I'm a little surprised. I don't see like. Family as I see support families maxed out credit is not like right in the middle.

436
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,350
Mr. CELLCOM Oh, okay. Thank you. Okay, good.

437
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:57,239
So given that, given that we're going to discuss but it's also may be that like the emphasis on the treatment,

438
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,250
recovery and rehabilitation is that, you know, you think there may be, you know,

439
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:08,040
either that that's what we see on the news or it may be that that's what your family members are dealing with or such are your friends.

440
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,900
Right. So I think it's important to kind of just see what what these things look like.

441
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,620
So it's certainly different even though stigma shows up here doesn't.

442
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,080
Yeah, it's not on there. It's stigma. It's not that on.

443
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,670
I ask you, what do you think about mental disorders? This was huge, right? And then you said depression and anxiety.

444
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,850
You didn't really talk about substance use disorders, which that's okay.

445
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,329
That's what most people look at.

446
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:39,620
And now, you know, so what do we think about stigma, like the way that stigma operates in behavioral disorders?

447
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:44,700
This is huge, actually, because there's this presumption that the person can can just stop.

448
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:51,240
Right, Dr. Phil? Like just stop, you know, when the fact is, is that if they were to just stop,

449
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:58,239
they would become violently ill and could potentially, you know, like, it's not it's not that easy, right?

450
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,920
It's never that. Okay. All right.

451
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,530
So the last couple of things. Last thing I want to focus on three. One more questions.

452
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:13,920
So I'm going to shift gears. I want to talk about tobacco. Okay.

453
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,410
All right. So this is another quote from Mark Twain. He says, Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world.

454
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:26,540
I know, because I've done it a thousand times. If you've ever they've used, they've turned to cigarets.

455
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:32,990
You know the truth of that statement. So tobacco use is still a leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States.

456
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:39,680
There are over 5 million deaths per year. That 20% of deaths in this case, we think, are attributable smoking each year.

457
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,180
About 20% of U.S. adults are current smokers.

458
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,940
We had bottomed out at about sort of 13, 14%, and then we got vaping.

459
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:57,020
And so we're going back up there and about 50% or one out of every two current smokers attempts to quit each year.

460
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,160
And if you are not a smoker,

461
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:07,960
I got a feeling that you will never become one because two thirds of people who become regular tobacco users had already started by age 14.

462
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,860
So you've already aged out at the highest risk time of abusing kids.

463
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,520
So this is just showing you the prevalence of tobacco use by age.

464
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,260
And so thankfully it's lower among the youngest groups here.

465
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,190
But, you know, sort of your pick, your peak user here.

466
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:34,190
And that's not only combustible tobacco, but just to kind of put it put it in perspective.

467
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,339
So even though even though 20% of Americans overall smoke and you're age period,

468
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,300
it's it's around 40% that are currently using some sort of tobacco every month.

469
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:55,980
Tobacco use is more common among American Indians and Alaska Natives than with lower use among Hispanics and Asian-Americans in the United States.

470
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,480
Tobacco use is much more common in rural areas.

471
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:09,979
This is so here we are in Michigan, but there are parts of the states are far more rural, that Michigan is higher prevalence of smoking.

472
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:16,370
So you can see Alaska, right, which is probably one of our most robust states, much higher rates.

473
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:22,459
And really it's only Colorado and California that have about 10% of the population smoke.

474
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,550
So again, it's that 20% is not randomly distributed.

475
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,030
It's not randomly distributed by age. It's not randomly distributed by race.

476
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,340
It's not randomly distributed by place.

477
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:41,070
So in 1964, and I'm sure you've probably heard of this report, we got the surgeon general's 1964 report called Smoking and Health,

478
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,620
which reviewed over 7000 articles on the health impacts of smoking.

479
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,420
This is the U.S. surgeon general secretary at the time that this report was released.

480
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,389
A year later, we finally get the first legislation on labeling cigarets.

481
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:06,750
So the 1965 Cigaret Labeling and Advertising Act, which says that the warning has to say cigaret smoking may be hazardous to your health.

482
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,900
We get an update in 84 to 4 rotating warnings which I think are still in place today.

483
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,660
One is around. They are.

484
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,680
But if you ever make tobacco is also sold differently, you can't just pick up a pack of cigarets like you could.

485
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,730
When I was a child, you could just they were just on the counter. Anyway, the point is, is that now they have some rotating warnings.

486
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,930
In 1969, we banned TV advertisements.

487
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,810
I, I remember being I remember I should say I wasn't quite sure,

488
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:44,760
but I remember the first ad I saw for vaping on television, and I was like, What the [INAUDIBLE] is that?

489
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,400
It was like, You're in the Super Bowl. And I'm like, What the [INAUDIBLE] is that doing on television?

490
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,770
I didn't think you could show tobacco.

491
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:58,920
And this is this is in part because until very recently, as in the last two years, vaping was not covered under anything that I'm showing you.

492
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,110
So you could advertise and you could put it in print.

493
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:11,540
Advertisement. You could put on television. 86, we got our first effort to kind of talk about secondhand smoke.

494
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,070
And 88 the surgeon journal states that nicotine is addictive.

495
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:23,600
The in 1994, tobacco executives testified to Congress that nicotine is not addictive.

496
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,190
Think of Congress and say that's incorrect.

497
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,479
It wasn't until 1990 that we banned smoking on domestic flights.

498
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:41,470
So beyond is ten. Okay. So we we've banned smoking on domestic flights and we get the first local smoke free restaurant.

499
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,160
What is past the 1990s?

500
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,400
Great. This is just sort of I guess I want to.

501
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:55,969
The reason I want to review this is because I think it's important to kind of understand how much the environment

502
00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:02,960
has changed since 1964 in terms of like where one in two people smoked around in 1964 to where we are now.

503
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:11,480
So the other thing that state started realizing is that there was money in this and so state started suing and winning huge,

504
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:20,420
massive, massive settlements against tobacco companies. When I was in Virginia, we had which is where a lot of this I mean, Philip morris,

505
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,540
literally, their offices were around the corner from where I worked.

506
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,830
And and so these places didn't go out of business. So even though they they were sued for millions and millions of dollars.

507
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,070
But we start getting states suing specifically to cover the costs of things like, you know,

508
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:43,190
all the illnesses that their Medicaid populations are are developing as a result of tobacco.

509
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,110
In 98, the tobacco companies decided, rather than go state by state,

510
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:54,070
to deal with all these lawsuits, they're just going to have this giant master settlement agreement,

511
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,400
which, again, is going to reimburse states for their Medicaid payments due to smoking related illnesses.

512
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,640
And it also, again, was the first time we got a ban on outdoor advertising for tobacco.

513
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,310
In 2009. We get these families Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.

514
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,309
So again, we don't get we get like litigation, litigation, litigation.

515
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:24,210
And then we get more, more acts from Congress that are going to give the FDA the ability to regulate tobacco products.

516
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:33,150
But it doesn't cover it does not cover vaping at the beginning because vaping is nicotine, not tobacco.

517
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:40,850
And so this is where you get like that is literally like that is why we've had all this other litigation for the last decade to figure out,

518
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:49,319
does this act actually relate? It doesn't cover vaping products because the tobacco companies, which are the same companies they own.

519
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,070
All right. So you're not you're not getting out of the system.

520
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:58,140
If you're using vaping, they're like, that's not tobacco, it's liquid nicotine.

521
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:04,060
Right. Can you regulate tobacco? FDA regulated nicotine. Okay.

522
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,000
So questions about this kind of I'm sorry, that was a huge, huge whirlwind in history.

523
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,510
Okay. So what happened since then?

524
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:20,399
So in 1960, again, we had about this is this is the prevalence of people who are smoking more than a pack a day, Armstrong said.

525
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,430
It's 20 cigarets in a pack, not 20. So this is the prevalence.

526
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:35,819
So that is about 25% of Americans were smoking a pack a day or more in 1964 when that report said, okay, these are heavy smokers and we get,

527
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:45,780
thankfully, a precipitous decline in the prevalence of people who are more heavy smokers as a result of our coming after the surgeon general's report.

528
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:50,110
We don't we don't have. But not everybody is a heavy smoker.

529
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,620
So what happens to your light smokers, your kind of social smokers or I'm just going out on the weekend.

530
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:02,000
I just have a cigaret when I have a drink. So the answer is that prevalence has basically not changed at all since the surgeon general's report.

531
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,790
And so what the report did is that it focused attention on helping people who were very heavy users of tobacco.

532
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,640
Of course, they were also far more likely to die from tobacco related illnesses.

533
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,910
So they were going to exit the population no matter what.

534
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,700
But it really had no effect on like smoking, right.

535
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:29,750
This sort of the study. So as a result, when we look at like what tobacco looks like, what tobacco use looks like in the United States,

536
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,370
it's not just who is using, but also in what capacity are they using.

537
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:42,049
The tobacco users are also far more likely to have lower education than people who do not use tobacco.

538
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:49,220
And this is the likelihood of stopping use. Okay, so this is the likelihood that you will quit using, given that you started using the top line.

539
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,450
There are people who have an undergraduate degree in the first line here are you folks.

540
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:59,509
The undergraduate programs are well, if you if you ever develop nicotine dependance, the likelihood is we'll be able to stop.

541
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,590
That is quite high.

542
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:10,970
But if for people who are have less you know didn't finish high school only about 40% of them are ever going to be able to quit use of that tobacco.

543
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,430
So this I don't even bother to show new estimates because they're just sky high.

544
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:26,300
So this is the prevalence of e-cigarettes has exploded since they came on the market in the late August, early 20 tens.

545
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:34,279
It's now pretty definitive that e-cigarette use in adolescents predicts starting to use combustible tobacco in young adults.

546
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,749
And this is this is showing you that you're about three and a half times higher odds of

547
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:42,800
using combustible tobacco if you used e-cigarettes when you were younger versus not.

548
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:55,700
Of course, the debate is that and actually the FDA has approved some vaping products as a tobacco alternative for people who are current smokers.

549
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:02,270
So this is, again, this like tension between vaping as a safer cigaret, which it certainly is,

550
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,200
versus vaping as a gateway to tobacco use, which it also almost certainly is.

551
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,740
So both things can be true are both things almost certainly are true at the same time.

552
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,790
Just to put it in context, we don't smoke quite as much as other places do.

553
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:27,180
So you can see Europe and Asia smoke more than we do this.

554
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,400
I'll talk about this next time. But what I do want to end on is, again, just this idea of policy and sort of.

555
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:43,880
No. Again, helping us get comfortable with being uncomfortable about the role of public health and substance use prevention and treatment.

556
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,440
So, sir, I presume most of you have some understanding of what prohibition was.

557
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:54,430
Somebody tell me about what it was.

558
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:01,510
Yeah. When they banned alcohol, it banned the sale of alcohol.

559
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:06,510
Yeah, I just still get it in different ways, but I saw the commercial itself was banned.

560
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,630
Right. What else do you know about it? What was the reason for this? Yeah.

561
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,470
I think there's a lot of like a woman's name. Too many.

562
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,650
Yes. So women women were very much front and center for this.

563
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:29,209
What else was happening during this time? Before signing up.

564
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:34,910
There were a lot of there was domestic violence and broken families because of alcohol.

565
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:41,990
Yeah. So there were. So there were all these, you know, I mean, what we would have for today is like aces.

566
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,579
Right. There was like a lot of adverse childhood experiences. There were a lot of broken families.

567
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,670
There were issues, you know, violence that were happening.

568
00:56:50,120 --> 00:57:03,440
And the public health was through a concerted effort, starting at the state level and then going to the federal level of public health practitioners,

569
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,700
suffragist movement, religious leaders and anti-immigration groups.

570
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,380
So this is suffragists. These are not anti-immigration,

571
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:20,630
although they they were not nobody was happy about the immigration that was happening from Southern and Eastern Europe.

572
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:24,920
And in fact, so so prohibition passes in 1920.

573
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:36,170
This is coming right off the heels of World War One, where the bad guys in World War One also bigger.

574
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,239
And what we have at the point is,

575
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:43,219
is so we get we're getting all this immigration that's coming into the United States from southern and Eastern Europe.

576
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,470
This is when Anheuser comes to the United States.

577
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:51,500
This is when names that family, names of brewers and things like that that, you know, I'm sure you're familiar with.

578
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,900
But Eastern Europe, these are people who are not considered white by the population at the time there.

579
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:05,600
And so all of this convalescence of movements comes together to pass prohibition as a constitutional amendment.

580
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:09,950
And so the first and this marks the first time in our nation's history and the only time in our nation's history

581
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:17,520
when we've passed an amendment that has withdrawn or that has constricted behavior rather than allowing behavior.

582
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,999
Right. The first and only time that we've constricted that.

583
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,510
So I just I, I give this, I guess, as a a notion and there's a wonderful aisle shared on the campus.

584
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:33,730
I there's a wonderful four part documentary series on Prohibition.

585
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:39,979
I just missed that by Ken Burns, who always does great work on this, if you're interested.

586
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,129
But just to kind of the fact that our discipline,

587
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:50,810
that is the field of public health has not like oftentimes or I should say we

588
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,980
still don't know how to talk about substance use without it being a moral issue.

589
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,390
And that's something that we have to kind of just face, I think, head on,

590
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:06,440
because otherwise we're just going to get it's no surprise that this is the same country that does the war on drugs 60 years later.

591
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:11,460
Okay. All right. So we will stop here and I'll see you on Wednesday.
