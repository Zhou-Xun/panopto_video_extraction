Welcome to Ebbitt 634 is module on compartmental transmission models in this module, Hollender d, the compartmental transmission model.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,630
The Learning Objectivists module are one to describe the basic properties of the compartmental

3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:28,650
transmission model and to describe the model assumptions associated with these models.

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:39,420
Anderson may in the 1970s defined a class of pathogens largely consisting of viruses, bacteria and protozoa that they referred to as micro parasites.

5
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
These pathogens shared a number of features. They reproduced within the host.

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,290
They were small and hatch short generation time. That is, they reproduce rapidly, resulting in a fast growth rate.

7
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,160
Hosts that recovered from disease or infection were often immune for a period and sometimes for life.

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,880
And the duration of infection is short. Relative to the lifespan of the host,

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:15,000
ecological models of host parasite relationships generally focus on modeling the two populations and their interactions.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,090
Anderson may argue that for the micro parasites,

11
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:26,600
it made more sense to track the epidemiologic status of the hosts rather than tracking population sizes and their interaction.

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,260
They therefore adopted that McCormac.

13
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:41,810
As they are model that had three state variables, the number is deceptive ls the number of infectious and the number of immune as shown here.

14
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:50,090
This model also captured the population dynamics of the host, where births from all three states entered the susceptible state.

15
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:59,420
Natural death occurred in all states and a death specific death rate, a disease specific death rate occurred only in the infectious stage.

16
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:07,220
The transmission process is governed by a transmission rate recovery rate and a waning immunity parameter.

17
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,960
Each of these states, each of these three states are called compartments where everyone within a state is homogeneous.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:23,750
That is, there is no distinct, no distinction is made that any individual within a given state.

19
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,590
This model structure is based on the premise that there that the natural history

20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,110
of the transmission process for these pathogens share a number of features.

21
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,030
First, a number of individuals are classified as susceptible to infection.

22
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,660
People can stay in this state on the order of decades.

23
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:52,520
Once infected, an individual enters into the latent state, staying there on the order of days during which time the virus starts to amplify.

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:00,640
At some point, when the viral load increases to a certain level, the person becomes infected and infectious.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,910
They are in this state again for on the order of days. During this time, the viral load peaks in.

26
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,800
A person may exhibit symptoms. During this time.

27
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,810
The antibody levels are also beginning to increase. And the viral load continues to decrease.

28
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,550
When the antibody levels reach a certain point, they're considered immune.

29
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:33,420
Which can occur for as long as decades or more.

30
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,430
These pathogens and the transmission processes are different in a number of ways.

31
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:45,270
The differences can be described parametric. That is, they can take on a unique set of parameter values.

32
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:54,480
For example, measles is generally assumed to have a lifelong immunity, whereas typhoid fever infection typically confers only short term immunity.

33
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,540
Measles has a long incubation period on the order of weeks, whereas polio has a shorter and capi patient period.

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,540
On the order of a few days. Finally, gonorrhea does not offer any immunity.

35
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,550
Differences can also be described structurally by altering the model equations.

36
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,890
For example, measles and Kove ID are generally considered directly transmitted and as such,

37
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,380
the basic as they are model from Mackendrick may work well.

38
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:30,370
Gonorrhea is sexually transmitted, which means it is also it is also directly transmitted.

39
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,440
But social structures often important to include winning when considering medications.

40
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,720
Strategies for Estes's. Cholera is waterborne and therefore the pathogen.

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,740
The pathogen can survive in the environment, often necessitating the collusion of an environmental state.

42
00:04:49,740 --> 00:05:03,100
Danger is effective. Born. Disease often necessitating the inclusion of states describing the transmission process within the mosquito.

43
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:12,280
Here we have plots of cases of various infectious diseases. Between 1930 and 1990, we see that they all have different patterns.

44
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,810
Arguably, many can be described through choices of parameter values.

45
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:26,670
We'll be looking at some of these differences in labs. Many show periodic behavior, specifically measles and woofing cough.

46
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:32,080
A closer look had measles and whipping cough shows, distinct periodic behavior,

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,970
whooping cough exhibits peaks every three years, while measles exhibits outbreaks every other year.

48
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:46,690
We will see in lecture in a few weeks how a simple mass action model can explain why during the pre vaccination error,

49
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:56,670
measles exhibited highly regular biannual patterns. So what are the assumptions of these compartmental models?

50
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:06,570
First, the population is large and constant. It is also model as a continuous variable, which is fine given we are assuming large populations.

51
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,140
Next birth and death rates are equal, which is necessary given the population size is constant.

52
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,430
Deaths are exponentially distributed and therefore one over Ammu is the average lifespan of an individual.

53
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,360
Populations are homogeneous within each state, which is a basic assumption of a compartmental model,

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:36,680
as we already talked about, mass action, governances transmission, and that transmission occurs via contact.

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:45,380
Individuals recover and enter into the immune state. And the latent state is assumed to be zero.

56
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,580
Finally, the removal rate from the infectious state is one over Gamla plus new.

57
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:01,440
So we will next delve into these compartmental models as a framework for modeling transmission.
