00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:15,774
After watching this video, you will be
able to describe some basics about of

2
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:20,167
a data steps and how to use data step
statements to make subsets of variables

3
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:26,250
using the KEEP, DROP,
WHERE and IF THEN statements.

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,047
DATA steps are used to
create new SAS datasets.

5
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,824
Copy existing ones and manipulate data.

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:37,391
The output of a data step is
usually a newly created dataset or

7
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,720
an updated existing dataset.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,977
A very very general template
is shown in this slide.

9
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:49,332
It always starts with the keyword data and
after that,

10
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:54,168
you tell SAS the name of the new
dataset after manipulation.

11
00:00:54,168 --> 00:01:00,010
Then remember to finish data
statement with a semicolon.

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,519
In the second statement,
you use the word SET,

13
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,658
to tell SAS where to get
the original data to start with.

14
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:11,642
And finally you will tell SAS
what to do with the new data,

15
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:18,570
either subsetting variables, subsetting
observations, or creating new variables.

16
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't forget to add RUN followed
by a semicolon at the end.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,240
With this general template in mind,
let's look at a more specific sample.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,623
Here you're first creating a new
temporary dataset called temp,

19
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:38,670
that will be your new dataset or
the output data.

20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,170
Note that I know it's a temporary
dataset because no library is specified.

21
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,570
So by default this one will go to
the work library, the library for

22
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,850
temporary datasets.

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,736
Second, you are telling SAS to
get data from an existing dataset

24
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,734
called variation from the br library.

25
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:02,708
So with this two new statements
you are telling SAS,

26
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,861
get the variation that I set
that is in the br library and

27
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:11,160
copy it to a new temporary
dataset called temp.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,714
Note that you should have told SAS
before where to find the dataset with

29
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:19,741
the lid name statement as we
mentioned in the previous video.

30
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,690
Otherwise you will get an error.

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,836
Finally, we are telling SAS to create
a new variable called obesity which

32
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:32,651
will take value 1 when an existing
continuous variable BMI is 30 or

33
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,156
more and takes value 0 otherwise.

34
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:39,445
We will go back to those if then
statements in the next video

35
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:44,210
when we talk about how
to create variables.

36
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,213
Other examples of things you can do
in a dataset are shown in this slide.

37
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:53,723
Here we are still creating a new
temporary dataset called temp for

38
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,762
that permanent dataset called variation.

39
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,206
But this time instead of
creating a new variable,

40
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,162
we're going to get rid of some variables.

41
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:08,980
For that we will use the drop statement,
we are dropping day cals and vit a.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,471
And you can see the result on the right
from the original dataset that is on

43
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:14,140
the left.

44
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,430
We only give the variables ID and PROTG.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,632
Note that we could do exactly the same,
but instead of dropping variable,

46
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:28,516
just keeping the ones we are interested
in, in this case ID and PROTG.

47
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:32,042
So we use the keep statement
to keep ID and PROTG.

48
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:36,306
We get the same output dataset
as we got in the previous slide.

49
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:38,604
It will be up to you to choose one or

50
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:44,700
the other depending on how many
variables you want to keep or drop.

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,632
Finally, we can also subset observations.

52
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:48,758
In this example,

53
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:53,572
we're subsetting our dataset to those
observations where day is equal 1.

54
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:58,433
Using this statement where day eq 1,
the result is a smaller than I said.

55
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:02,500
Where we only have observations for
the why.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,491
Note that you could do the same
using a different statement.

57
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,141
It was said by using if day
not equal to 1 then delete,

58
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,670
we will end up with the same dataset.

59
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,394
This is just an example of what I told
you in previous videos that there is

60
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:22,451
redundancy in SAS and you can do exactly
the same with many different codes.

61
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:28,370
It will be up to you to choose the way
that is more convenient for you.

62
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,117
In summary, in this video we
learn the basics of a dataset and

63
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:37,495
how to manipulate other asset using the
KEEP, DROP, WHERE, and IF THEN statements.

64
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:44,096
In the next video we will learn how
to create new variables in a dataset.
