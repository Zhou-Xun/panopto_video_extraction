1
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:09,354
So, when you're thinking about
communication evaluation and design,

2
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:11,192
there's lots of models out there,

3
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:15,820
lots of papers that have been written
about how to think about doing it well.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,370
I won't go into too much detail today, but

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,950
I do wanna give you an older, but useful
model, for thinking about this process.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,070
It has six steps that lay out all
the steps between the start point,

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,110
where somebody's first being exposed to a
message, all the way to the point at which

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,615
they're act on it, and each one of these
can go wrong, and it can go right,

9
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:43,935
and thinking about each of these steps can
be helpful for helping you to identify

10
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:48,385
potential barriers and correcting them
before they become a real problem.

11
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:51,845
This model's called the Reception-Yielding
Model, and I've heard other names for it,

12
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:53,990
but that's the one that
I'm most familiar with.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,365
And it has these six steps.

14
00:00:55,365 --> 00:01:00,472
Presentation, attention, comprehension,

15
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:05,460
yielding, and I'll explain what I mean
by that in a moment, retention, or

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,340
memory, and then, behavior.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,940
So let's go through each one of
these in turn, and I'll try and

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,650
explain what I mean.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,900
So first, presentation.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,130
Literally, this is about,
was it presented to the target audience?

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,310
Did they see it or hear it?

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,710
Was it able to be seen or
heard in that environment, or

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,420
did they even know that it was there?

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,550
So this gets into questions like, does the
target audience watch the particular place

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,390
that this was broadcast, listen to, or
read whatever it is you're presenting?

26
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,440
So presentation errors are gonna
be things like, this was,

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,480
the poster was put up in an office,
but they never go there, or

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,990
it was broadcast on a channel
that they don't listen to.

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,240
Those kinds of issues make it hard for
people to do anything,

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,390
because if they didn't see it,
they're not gonna react to it.

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,524
And in a web environment, you might think
about this as, it's great if there's a web

32
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:10,490
page, but if nobody ever goes to it,
or if nobody ever clicks on the link,

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,530
then they were never presented
with that information.

34
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,930
Now, once you get past presentation and
somebody's

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,190
actually been presented with the
communication, then we get into attention.

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,630
Were they able to attend to it?

37
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,930
Now there's lots of barriers
that might be relevant here.

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,430
Maybe they just weren't motivated,
it was there and they didn't care.

39
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,370
Maybe it's not that they didn't care,
but there was time pressure.

40
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,830
They didn't have time
enough to process it.

41
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,720
They didn't have time to read through it.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,730
They had to do something else, so they
didn't listen to it, something like that.

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,290
Or maybe there's competing demands.

44
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,340
The classic example of this is,

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,530
I could be talking to a parent whose got
a small kid with them about anything,

46
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,430
and I'm not necessarily gonna have their
attention because their attention's gonna

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,080
be on their kid,
trying to make sure that their kid's okay.

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,740
That's not because they aren't interested.

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,410
It's not because it wasn't presented to
them, but the competing demand on their

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,560
attention means that they weren't
able to process the message.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,580
Or it might be physical limitations,
right?

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,170
So, someone with poor eyesight
might not be able to attend

53
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,410
to something that's in a small font.

54
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,340
Someone who is hard of hearing may not
be able to attend to something that's

55
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,160
being said over a loudspeaker because
there's too many other sounds.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,120
Those physical limitations are limiting
their ability to attend to the message.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,780
Now, if we assume for
the moment that it's been presented and

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,160
that they were able to attend to it,
then we get into comprehension.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,670
And there's lots of issues that can
happen with comprehension, right?

60
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,055
The basic idea here is,

61
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:55,380
is the target audience able to
understand what you have given the?

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,120
Maybe they don't have
background knowledge.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,870
This happens a lot in the context of
scientific communications, right?

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,330
I might be talking about my
research in a particular area.

65
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,950
And if the audience doesn't know, let's
say the prevailing theories or methods,

66
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,820
I might make assumptions
about what they know and

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,370
skip over some knowledge that they
need in order to understand it.

68
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,470
Maybe there's language issues.

69
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,780
If I'm always speaking to
somebody in English and

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,500
English is not your first language,
you may not

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,720
understand the terms that I'm using,
because you don't know the language.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,460
Or maybe it's not the language issue,
but it's a literacy problem.

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,550
So, complex medical terminology
means that I might be

74
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,540
describing the problem accurately, but
you're not able to understand me because

75
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,950
the terms I'm using are not ones that
you know and you knew how to use them.

76
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,160
Even if we're not talking about words,

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,830
maybe we have the same
problems with numbers.

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,940
In my own research, I do a lot of
work on numeracy, people's ability or

79
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,590
lack thereof to use the numbers that
we give them to make health decisions.

80
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,060
And on a broad level, was the information
presented in clear and plain language?

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,340
Did you present it as plainly as you can?

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,710
There's no negative to using clear,
plain language.

83
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,200
Even highly educated people
are often very grateful when

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,280
complex information is presented that way,
and that can help to overcome the kinds of

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,780
comprehension barriers
that we're talking about.

86
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,690
Now, let's assume that it's presented and
they attended to it, and

87
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,380
they were able to understand it.

88
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,010
We could still run into a problem
that's called yielding, right?

89
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,400
And what I mean here is,
is the information or

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,310
the ideas something that the audience is
gonna accept, or might they resist it?

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,310
Why might they resist this idea?

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,880
Well, one common issue is, the new
information you're giving them might not

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,350
be consistent with their prior beliefs.

94
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,120
And when you have new information
that's inconsistent with prior beliefs,

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,270
there is a resistance process, and
so maybe I won't actually accept

96
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,380
this information as true, or
something that I need to pay attention to.

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,810
In addition, maybe it's not
coming from somebody I trust.

98
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,860
Who am I gonna trust about whether or
not a particular procedure is a good idea?

99
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,750
Well, maybe it's my doctor, but maybe
it's my friend who went through that, and

100
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,420
if somebody I don't trust
talks to me about it,

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,320
maybe I'm not gonna respond to it as well.

102
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,260
Similarly, is this somebody
I feel like I can relate to?

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,600
If the person or
the source of the communication,

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,110
maybe they're credible in the sort of,
I trust this person has knowledge sense,

105
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,250
but they’re not somebody I relate to,
and so they just rub me the wrong way.

106
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,049
That’s also gonna make me more
resistant to whatever the message is

107
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:52,400
that you’re trying to get across.

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,643
Now, assuming everything
is going well up til now,

109
00:06:55,643 --> 00:07:00,300
we don't always need to act upon
information right when we get it, right?

110
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,490
We have to retain it.

111
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,310
We have to remember it.

112
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,180
And that process can break down too,
right?

113
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
Am I able to remember this?

114
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,170
Well, that could be because it
was just too complicated, or

115
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,560
maybe it's that it didn't
seem personally relevant.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,000
It didn't seem like something that
I needed to pay attention to.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,750
Or it could be that I just didn't
have the time to process it.

118
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,220
I thought I knew it, but I didn't have
the time to integrate that knowledge

119
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,980
into my larger understanding
of the situation.

120
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,010
And so, it went in one ear and
out the other.

121
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,430
All of which could be a problem, in terms
of my ability to retain the information.

122
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,760
And then lastly, of course,

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,480
everything above has to happen before
we can start to talk about behavior.

124
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,470
Do behaviors actually change?

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,090
Well, there's lots of
literature in public health and

126
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,410
elsewhere about barriers to action.

127
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,780
Even when somebody wants to act,
they know what to do.

128
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,910
There may be lots of other barriers
that prevent them from acting.

129
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,490
And being aware of what those barriers
are is important to thinking about

130
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,018
the design of our communications.

131
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:13,460
Now, as I've said before,
this is not a perfect model,

132
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,470
but I find it's really useful for helping
me to find different kinds of barriers and

133
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,050
anticipate which ones I need to pay most
attention to in different situations.

134
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,220
For example, if I'm spending all of my
time worrying about comprehension or

135
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,200
yielding issues, making sure I'm using
plain language, thinking about whether

136
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,060
this information is gonna be something
that somebody would accept or

137
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,340
not, I might forget about presentation
issues, or attention issues.

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,270
And it really doesn't matter whether
it's really comprehensible if they don't

139
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,280
see it and they can't attend to it,
we're not gonna get anywhere.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,980
So, I encourage you to use this
model as a way of checking yourself,

141
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,250
to make sure that you think about all
these different kinds of barriers and

142
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,639
do your best to try and prevent them.
