00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,630
So a few years ago, there was some research that became really popular among parents raising young children.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,870
It was called the marshmallow test. Perhaps you've heard of it.

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,380
The experiment went something like this An investigator would offer a preschool age child a marshmallow,

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,140
but tell them that if they could wait for 15 minutes without eating their marshmallow, they would get a second one.

5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,890
If not, the test would be complete after they ate their one marshmallow.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,330
The investigators would then leave the preschooler in the room by themselves with that marshmallow and wait to see the child's choice.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,510
Whether or not the children were patient enough to double their reward was found to be a predictor of better performance in school.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,300
Higher SAT scores and higher overall competency ten years later.

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,860
For years, this was taken as an important lesson for parents, and teaching their children will power to improve their chances in later life.

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:10,700
Success. More recently, however, cracks began to form, and there was growing skepticism in the take home findings of the marshmallow test.

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,650
In fact, investigators at the University of Rochester took it upon themselves to repeat the original marshmallow study with some refinements.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,679
In this new version, they concluded that the earlier findings had a lot less to do with a child's ability to wait

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,120
for good things and more about the fact that wealthier kids have a leg up in the world.

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,210
How so? Well, they argued that wealthier children have more persistence in waiting for better rewards,

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,760
because in their life experience, if they don't take one good thing, another will be offered.

16
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,760
This is in contrast to children that are less wealthy,

17
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,980
where the opportunities for treats occur far less frequently and are less likely to occur again.

18
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,240
In other words, it was family wealth and not patience that caused children to become more academically and socially successful adults,

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,170
not their ability to wait for a reward, said another way.

20
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,220
There was an alternate and perhaps more likely explanation for their findings.

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:14,060
This phenomenon of alternate explanations for observed associations between exposures and outcomes is what in epidemiology we call confounding.

22
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,290
Many of you are familiar with this concept through the old adage of correlation does not necessarily imply causation.

23
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,240
In the following series of lectures, we'll discuss confounding in great detail.

24
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,690
Well, define confounding and talk through more examples.

25
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,550
Learn how to predict the impacts of confounding on observed associations.

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,500
Dove into when confounding occurs using a causal graphing approach called a directed acyclic graph or dag,

27
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,900
and then discuss how to adjust for confounding to isolate our associations of interests.

28
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,470
Finally, we'll talk about situations when you can get into trouble by trying too hard to account for confounding.

29
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,000
All throughout, you'll get a hands on opportunity to practice identifying confounders,

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,210
drawing dags for confounding and predicting the impacts of confounding with and without adjustment.
