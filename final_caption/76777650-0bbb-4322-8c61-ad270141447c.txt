1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:05,066
OK. So in this module, we're going to be talking about skills

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:13,446
to help us push through the difficulty of having difficult dialogs about difference in diversity.

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,336
So a lot of the things were going to talk about in this module,

4
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:23,916
we'll be really familiar to you to practice  in different ways regarding our own mental health, in regarding our relationships.

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:34,606
So the biggest key, I think, is preparation going into these conversations is really gonna be taking good care of ourselves, to breathe.

6
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:37,936
This is where going into a conversation and during a conversation,

7
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:45,316
you may just pause and breathe like you're trying to pull air all the way down into your feet.

8
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:55,236
And exhale, just let your shoulders drop and relax. Often in conflict, you get tense and it doesn't necessarily help us hear better.

9
00:00:55,236 --> 00:01:02,696
It doesn't help us think better. It doesn't help us feel and stay connected to empathy.

10
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:08,546
So before these conversations, during these conversations, after these conversations,

11
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:12,776
you need to take care of ourselves sometimes in the middle, we need to take a break.

12
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:21,286
Sometimes after we need to just go for a run or walk or get out in nature, do some of the exercises in our

13
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:29,366
mindfulness and coping kit. To support ourselves, bring our nervous system back to kind of a baseline.

14
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:37,796
Because these conversations aren't easy. So the same way, for example, if you're going to work out, you kind of need to stretch and warm up

15
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:43,466
stretch and cool down. And be aware of your body throughout exercise

16
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,246
So you don't injure itself It's very similar with this.

17
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:53,396
These conversations especially if you're having them

18
00:01:53,396 --> 00:02:01,126
from the point of somebody who's been oppressed in regards to the topic, you're talking about can bring up a lot of trauma.

19
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:13,446
It can be really exhausting. And so you need to be able to take care of yourself in the aftermath the people who really see you, hear you, understand you.

20
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:17,406
And if you're in the conversation as somebody who's learning and hasn't had those experiences,

21
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:23,246
experienced more privilege and maybe needs to interrogate some of your ideas.

22
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:28,986
It's also challenging and I think that

23
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:37,106
often what can happen is if you like we talked about before Ill show the side, again we freeze, we get fatigued,

24
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:46,036
we get overwhelmed and you need to know that tears may come, defensiveness may come, but you want to notice them

25
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:53,876
sooth and ground then, and stay present in the conversation.

26
00:02:53,876 --> 00:03:02,546
Often in the aftermath, especially if we have not had the experiences of discrimination or oppression

27
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:08,186
after the conversations is a good time sometimes to connect with somebody who shares our identity.

28
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:12,226
So, for example, if I'm

29
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:21,906
a straight person learning about systemic oppression and discrimination and violence towards LGBT communities, in the aftermath

30
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:28,516
I may need to set a time to talk to

31
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:32,056
another straight person who's further along in their learning about this,

32
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:37,756
who can really hold me accountable and who can explain who can teach me things and explain things to me that I may not

33
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:46,996
be getting and where I can say some of the things that ideas I might have and ask questions were less likely to do harm,

34
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:52,636
because this isn't somebody who's always being harmed by thoughts or questions.

35
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:59,506
And I can also really get into going on the Internet looking at tools that have been set up to help me

36
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:09,056
learn more, reading books by LGBTQ people or whatever the identity variable is so that I can learn more

37
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:21,166
about it and doing that individual learning or that with one safe person in addition to these conversations is essential because that allows us to have

38
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:28,996
safe spaces to interrogate our ideas, to unlearn and to process our shame

39
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:35,726
or defensiveness or whatever may come up. So then when we come to these conversations

40
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:41,486
where there are different identities in their room, we're more used to talking about the difficult things,

41
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:50,846
we're less likely to do harm and we're better able to hear and process the new information.

42
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:54,386
The other thing to think about is if you remember back when we were talking about bias and

43
00:04:54,386 --> 00:05:00,866
how you learn it so early and often affects all types of things outside of our awareness.

44
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:08,876
We have this natural tendency to kind of group people. If we're staying grounded and breathing in our body

45
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,196
if we're exercising compassion for ourselves and for others.

46
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:20,176
We also we have an actual capacity for empathy when we see people as as value as valuable as us.

47
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:27,826
And so we want to stay grounded in our bodies so that we can continue to access empathy and hear better.

48
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:32,176
And that's going to really help us when we can access curiosity and empathy and our conversation

49
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:38,606
the conversation is going to go better.

50
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:45,206
I think to just to know, even if sometimes difficult and overwhelming emotions come up in the conversation,

51
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:55,046
It's not necessarily bad. Often what'll happen, though, sometimes is I'm just learning about something and it makes me feel bad I become fearful

52
00:05:55,046 --> 00:06:00,096
and the conversation gets distracted.

53
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:06,786
We're no longer talking about the difficult thing happening out in society that's having an ever negative impact on people.

54
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:17,236
We start talking about the discomfort or the tears and in reality, we want to have some tolerance for those difficult emotions so that they don't distract.

55
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:22,446
I can feel a lot, I can have tears, but I can still ground myself.

56
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:29,226
Take care of myself. Move through the conversation hear and learn and get more support to sort through it

57
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:37,606
afterwards. So you see on this slide with four

58
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:43,346
this is just noticing as you're moving through the conversation, what's happening in your body.

59
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:49,146
Is your body kind of moving into fight mode are you getting defensive and you're kind of talking a lot

60
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:56,286
interrupting a lot, getting more big and intense in your body.

61
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,016
And the thing is, again, emotions aren't bad emotions will come.

62
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:08,256
People will have sadness as they talk about experiences, people will anger as they talk about their experiences of injustice.

63
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:13,686
But we want to make sure in these conversations that we're not using our

64
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:17,956
anger, especially when we've experienced privilege to shut down the conversation.

65
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:22,746
We'll talk a little bit about the intensity of emotion and how to manage it in these conversations.

66
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:29,606
But we want to observe what's happening in our own body and use the strategies that we have to calm our body and stay centered

67
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:35,316
as much as possible, we can be engaging in a sort of communication.

68
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:41,886
Also, notice, if you're freezing, if you're wanting to run from the room or change the subject even.

69
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:49,536
And that's another important cue to slow down and calm down in your body.

70
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:57,786
Also, if you notice that you start watering down the things that you've experienced or trying to say them just right

71
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:03,596
so that people will hear them, know that honestly a lot times in these conversations

72
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:14,456
our job is to show up, and to speak our truth as best as possible and then to to listen and engage,

73
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:18,246
but we shouldn't be so worried about did I say it just right

74
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:22,626
trying to please people in order to be heard

75
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:29,296
because it often interrupts us from saying the things that need to be said.

76
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:32,326
And the thing about how that ladder works,

77
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:38,596
that ladder of volume that we've talked about is that often people who are lower on the ladder have always had to

78
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:46,216
kind of explain their experience a lot and take care of the people higher on ladder to keep them comfortable.

79
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:52,606
We know that this is a conversation where we typically are more valued and taken care of by society.

80
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:57,856
It's important that we try to do even more of the same

81
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:03,226
grounded and listening and allow people who have experienced a lot of trauma and pain

82
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:08,556
to be able to talk about that without being too water down what they're saying,

83
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:22,156
or kind of keep everybody happy in order to be heard. Now, there's kind of a dynamic that happens in these conversations around intimacy and intensity.

84
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:26,186
And I'll explain what I mean by that.

85
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:36,176
Intensity means that as soon as we start talking about a difficult topic like race or sexual orientation or gender identity or religion or politics,

86
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:41,156
the intensity and the room is going to automatically go up like we're going to feel

87
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:47,156
this is this is a hard topic, this is a difficult topic, this is an uncomfortable topic.

88
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:50,696
Intensity is not our enemy,

89
00:09:50,696 --> 00:10:00,726
the same way that a couple might have a disagreement that they need to talk about in order to get back kind of connected and unified.

90
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,356
And to talk about it, it's gonna be intense,

91
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:10,676
one person might want to have children one person might not. It's a hard and intense conversation.

92
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,916
So intensity is not bad, it means it's going to take us out of our comfort zones

93
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:19,156
It's gonna feel uncomfortable.

94
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:32,626
But often what happens is that we need intimacy and by intimacy I mean empathy, caring, curiosity in order to make the conversations productive.

95
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:41,126
If I walk in and my mentality or the feeling in the group becomes us versus them,

96
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:50,226
if it becomes adversarial or just conflict or talking at each other as opposed to hearing each other.

97
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:59,026
What's happened is the intensity has gone up, but the intimacy has not. And so,

98
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:03,286
as you're having these conversations, notice within your body and notice within the group.

99
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:07,576
Are we really hearing each other go back to that idea of the circle of people who

100
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:13,306
I see, care about want the best for

101
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:22,926
and I'm willing to go out of my way to really hear, understand. You want to keep a whole group in the room in that that circle.

102
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:29,576
Even if that means what we're doing is we're actually listening to one group that's usually not heard more.

103
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:38,766
But if empathy and curiosity, warmth and caring has left the room, then often

104
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,496
the intensity is not going to be really productive.

105
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:51,466
And so this is where often kind of getting to know each other as people staying grounded in our bodies so we can keep accessing empathy

106
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:59,516
and curiosity is really important. Having intense feelings

107
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:09,326
It can be important to say, am I still seeing the other person is as human and valuable and being able to hear them, even if I don't agree with them?

108
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:16,116
So intimacy is kind of the glue, It's what keeps us willing to work on the thing and hear each other even when it's intense.

109
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:23,916
And so you almost want to be. Kind of assessing the temperature of the room.

110
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:34,066
And if we've gotten away from intimacy, we need to increase it to keep things the conversation productive.

111
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:40,726
If somebody, for example, is sharing out just having had a miscarriage, they're sharing vulnerably

112
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:46,726
and so the intensity is going to go naturally. When intimacy and vulnerability go up, intensity goes up.

113
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:53,846
We're usually leaning in and listening and caring, and that's going to lead to a productive conversation.

114
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:58,976
So think about in those moments, if there's not enough intimacy in the room.

115
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:04,036
Are we asking enough open ended questions? It's really helping us see and hear the

116
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:09,756
other person's live experience. Are we sharing vulnerably about

117
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:18,536
care and concern for the other person's experience? Are we just interrogating people's experiences?

118
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:24,116
We need to kind of step back and do some trust building and some agreements on how we're going to communicate in that space

119
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:30,756
and what the boundaries are in that space. All of those things are going to help to increase the intimacy.

120
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:38,926
So there's enough glue holding the group together to problem solve and work through the intensity.

121
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:44,946
So intensity is always there. It's normal. We have it on the work of increasingly need

122
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:51,346
to go with it the conversations usually gonna be productive.

123
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,866
So we want to keep those things in mind.

124
00:13:53,866 --> 00:14:01,846
Another thing sometimes it gets in the way of intimacy is when we kind of get into the problem and oppression in Olympics.

125
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,946
So it's all about comparison,

126
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:10,906
well you experience that this group over here experiences. If those comparisons usually are not particularly helpful

127
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:13,556
we want to switch in that moment out of scarcity.

128
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:19,686
There's not we don't have to sacrifice compassion for this group in order to have compassion for this.

129
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:25,206
Actually keep the conversation focused on this particular topic.

130
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,876
I mean, if we need to revisit and have a conversation.

131
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:35,496
For example, if somebody is saying, well why should we hear about the immigrants if we're not taking care of our homeless.

132
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:43,636
So, let's have a conversation about the immigrants and not kind of go off into the oppression and about another topic.

133
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:52,636
Let's stick here and really sort through and then if we need to set a separate time to also think about

134
00:14:52,636 --> 00:15:03,346
how to take care of this other group. Let's do that too. But let's not put them against each other because that's usually not effective and both can matter.

135
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,646
And that leads us right into this this issue of complexity.

136
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:13,546
So if you're going to have these conversations, you have to be willing to have to endure some some intensity.

137
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:20,046
You have to be able to build intimacy and you have to be able to tolerate complexity.

138
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:32,486
So many times, especially in our current world of sound bites and news and lots of misinformation and social media, we hear lots of soundbites.

139
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:34,216
So we take the one soundbite,

140
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:47,286
we argue with a sound bite, and the sound bite is usually oversimplified, usually needs to be unpacked in conversation anyway.

141
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:53,256
About the soundbite and with a lot of the conversations that you're probably going to be having around these issues

142
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:57,966
there's a lot of both and that two things can be true.

143
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:02,646
For example, there can be good police officers.

144
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:10,456
People like they know you have an aunt you have an uncle. You have somebody who approaches a job and tries to do the best job.

145
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:17,366
And helps people that can be true and

146
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:22,016
the history and current practice of policing can also be causing people a lot

147
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:27,116
of undue and unnecessary harm and that harm can fall more on some communities,

148
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:36,416
Both of these things can be true. But how do we move forward and create solutions that incorporate

149
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:42,756
both of those things. Different people are gonna come up with different different solutions and perspectives about that

150
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:50,686
often hear the people saying that there are systemic problems as saying all police are bad,

151
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:58,216
and that, I don't think, is what they're trying to say but we have to be able to have more complex

152
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,586
narratives and conversations.

153
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:11,356
And so just know that if you come in with one view or one soundbite or one piece of data, there are probably some layers to it.

154
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:20,996
And those layers aren't all equally baited necessarily in their impact

155
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:26,036
or in what the solutions are.

156
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:33,906
But know that things are going to probably get complex and murky and messy at times, and that doesn't mean that they're off track.

157
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:46,436
We often like things to be really simple, but simple doesn't usually do a good job of explaining all the things that are prepared for the complexity

158
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:49,696
be prepared for the fact

159
00:17:49,696 --> 00:18:00,886
that there's gonna be a lot of how do we hold these two things or sometimes the way more things than that together and make sense of them.

160
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:08,266
One of the practices that can be really useful with this is the practice of Lovingkindness.

161
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:17,986
And this is another thing where you can kind of there's lots of Lovingkindness meditations. But the practice of

162
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:32,596
taking people that are the hardest for you to understand, the hardest for you, to hardest for you to care about the problems they're bringing up

163
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:40,346
and spend time kind of in meditation seeing them

164
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:49,006
and sending warmth, caring and compassion to them. And often people talk about starting with a small circle and then and then moving outward.

165
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:55,626
So I might start with thinking about myself and wishing myself a really good.

166
00:18:55,626 --> 00:19:06,776
I might move out from there and just see the faces of my best friend or my parent or people in my community and I might think of them

167
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:15,396
and send them kind of warmth and well wishes. And I might expand that bigger and bigger and bigger, I might expand it to the whole planet,

168
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:24,626
I might expand it to other people who are dealing with some of the same difficulties that I'm dealing with.

169
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:36,006
And then I may also really sit with and try to expand that to people who are different than you, and I may find it uncomfortable particularly

170
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:42,596
If we're talking about people who've been a part of

171
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:46,316
discriminating against me or oppressing me. I can I can try it because I can

172
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:54,546
I can remember that while I maybe I want to hold them accountable behavior, that they're still human beings.

173
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:58,116
But one thing I like about the practice of Lovingkindness, somebody said is I think this is key,

174
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:00,366
If it ever becomes difficult

175
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:08,226
send Lovingkindness out to anyone, then bring it back to yourself, because in that moment, you're probably the person who needs it.

176
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:15,996
If you're having difficulty seeing the point of view in the experiences of somebody who is different than you.

177
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:21,936
Spending some time, especially if they're less valued and not treated as well in society

178
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:33,256
spending time, seeing them and trying to extend the same warmth and well-being that you would wish for your best friend to them can help us.

179
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:37,606
What's nice about it is that's increases the empathy.

180
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:45,636
It's an it's there's nobody there's nobody there to argue with, It's just you sitting there really trying to

181
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:55,886
see the person in a more holistic way as a whole human being with thoughts, fears, worries, dreams.

182
00:20:55,886 --> 00:21:05,246
Just like you have, and as you can kind of grow that Lovingkindness, that warmth towards them in this practice,

183
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:10,636
it'll probably better prepare you for walking into conversations.

184
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:17,356
As well as the things like doing the reading, reading fiction novels, watching documentaries,

185
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:22,786
TV shows that really allow you to see more through the eyes of other people in practice empathy.

186
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:34,466
It's going to better prepare you for a lot of the conversation.

187
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:39,626
So this is the acronym ALLY, this word gets used alot

188
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:44,436
its probably not one of my favorites cause I think it kind of gets overused and watered down.

189
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:53,856
But I think generally these these tips for ways that we can help

190
00:21:53,856 --> 00:22:03,626
shape the conversation when somebody is talking about difference or discrimination or oppression that we're going to experiencing.

191
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:12,886
I think these tips can be really helpful. So the first one is to always center the impacted.

192
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:21,596
If we're talking about breast cancer survivors or people in recovery from substance use,

193
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:27,836
it's gonna be really important to hear not just what scholars and researchers have said,

194
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:32,756
but what that group of people are saying their experience is what that group of people

195
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:38,216
are saying are the obstacles that they face what that group of people is saying

196
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:43,696
that they need in order to have the same

197
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:54,606
access, safety, dignity, respect as other people. So if you notice, nobody is in the discussion that is impacted then the conversation

198
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,406
is probably not going to go the way that you want.

199
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:02,346
It's important, but what we don't want to do it in a conversation is

200
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:09,686
if there's only one person with a visible physical identity, to turn to them all the time and say, what do you think?

201
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:14,196
What we want to do then is bring more video material,

202
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:19,896
reading material that represents those voices and not put it all on the pressure that one the

203
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:26,926
person in the room or not assume that one person represents a whole group of people.

204
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:31,586
We just want to make sure that those voices are being heard, not just other people's opinions about that group.

205
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:40,256
So this kind of goes with that we want to listen and learn from the people who are being the most impacted

206
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:45,156
by the problem. We want to leverage our privilege

207
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:54,876
so if we're further up on that ladder, society has given us more access, has given us more respect, more dignity, more safety,

208
00:23:54,876 --> 00:24:00,756
then we want to use whatever influence power that we have within the system to

209
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:07,626
bring the problem up before people know the differences that are happening.

210
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:14,776
And, you know, wherever we want we want interrupt

211
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:18,886
conversations that we hear around us that are reinforcing negative ideas about people.

212
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:25,366
So these are always using where we are on the ladder to help create access for other people.

213
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:30,386
We're just trying to get rid of the difference altogether. And then yielding the floor.

214
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:34,616
So if I'm in a conversation, let's say again, if you go back to the

215
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:45,186
breast cancer survivors or people dealing with infertility, and I find myself talking a lot and taking up most of the floor.

216
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:52,446
I want to yield it to other people who are actually experiencing that so that it can be a space where their voices being heard.

217
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:56,166
These are just all things to keep in mind.

218
00:24:56,166 --> 00:25:07,416
If I'm in a different group, like I might go back to my friends who may not be familiar with infertility and share the information that I'm learning.

219
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:14,676
That's the time where I want to use my voice the most. But in those conversations, I want to make sure the people who are impacted

220
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:23,536
are really at the forefront in guiding our thoughts about how to make the situation more equitable.

221
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:32,486
So the main things here at kind of reviewing this module and the previous one to know that these conversations are difficult.

222
00:25:32,486 --> 00:25:41,226
Know that we all being very different experiences to them, know that they bring up a lot of thoughts in our bodies.

223
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:47,906
And that we've got to be really skillful and intentional about slowing down,

224
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:56,746
staying connected to curiosity and empathy, listening, honoring the fact that it gets really complex.

225
00:25:56,746 --> 00:26:00,706
Then really using our skills to be an active listening assertive communication

226
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:08,976
listening assertive communication so that we hear each other. And we really want to be

227
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:20,346
keep everybody in the circle keeping everybody's needs met and this can be a really great place to use imagination in addition to Lovingkindness.

228
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:24,666
Sometimes we look around and look at the solutions that we've seen.

229
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:30,376
But these conversations, whether you're in the conversation or after the conversation, thinking

230
00:26:30,376 --> 00:26:37,296
what would new systems look like that met everybody's needs?

231
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:45,066
What could we get out of the way that you have to kind of not get locked in to only what we've seen done before?

232
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:52,806
It's always been done. And so taking time after these conversations to reground ourselves

233
00:26:52,806 --> 00:27:01,236
kind of notice what we've learned, but also spend time imagining new conversations and continuing to learn from more people

234
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:12,036
different ideas, how we can shape environments that celebrate everybody that include allow access, safety, dignity for everybody.

235
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:18,126
So it's not easy work. It is definitely a marathon. But like I said, at the end of the other one, it is definitely worth it.

236
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:23,916
We want to continue to use these skills and to grow these skills.
