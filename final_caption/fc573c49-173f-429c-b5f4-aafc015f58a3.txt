1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,480
The first unit of our course is focused on understanding the structure and function of health care.

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,330
Public health and regulatory systems.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,830
We're going to spend time discussing how public health is organized and structured, how the U.S. health care system works.

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,320
And then we'll consider the different regulatory systems that are in place and how they're organized.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,690
So in this first module, we're going to focus on the structure and function of public health.

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,760
And I think the best place to start is to really define what public health is.

7
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,220
So oftentimes the public thinks about public health as meaning different things.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,660
It could be disaster response. It might be health care for the poor.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,100
It could be behavioral interventions like limiting the types of food you're allowed to consume.

10
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,089
It could be restaurant inspections for cockroaches or what we might commonly think

11
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,010
of making sure everyone is vaccinated for an infectious disease like influenza.

12
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,990
To help us define this, though, I want to look at some different definitions that have been developed.

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Let's take a look at some of the core principles drawn from a definition of public health by C.A. Winslow.

14
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:29,730
You'll see that Winslow defines public health as the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life,

15
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,360
promoting health and efficiency through organized community effort, controlling communicable infections,

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:46,140
educating individuals on personal hygiene, organizing medical care, developing mechanisms to ensure everyone can maintain their health,

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,510
and ultimately allowing every citizen to realize health and longevity.

18
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,770
So that's a pretty broad definition. And I think we should look at a more concise one as well.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,710
Public health is the set of activities a society undertakes to monitor and improve the health of its collective membership.

20
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:15,110
So that means we focus on preventing disease and injury instead of considering just individual needs.

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,390
Public health is focusing on the public needs and how society can provide for them.

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:30,970
So career and public health then is different from other health professions in medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy and social work.

23
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:40,290
There's often an individual provider, an individual patient, an emphasis on treating a specific illness or disability.

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:50,490
But in public health, the emphasis is on societal benefit and how individual patients can collectively improve their health status.

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,880
So let's take an example then to think about the difference. A dentist might treat an individual patient for dental caries.

26
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,770
Now, that really means they're treating them for what we call a cavity. Here.

27
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,290
The provider is the dentist and the patient is the person that's receiving treatment.

28
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:17,060
But in public health, the government looks across all people to help prevent dental caries for everyone.

29
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,380
So that means that a decision might get made to Florida at the water.

30
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,629
And in fact, that has been made throughout history, making fluoridated water available to everyone in the community to try and

31
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,670
address this health challenge collectively instead of one patient at a time.

32
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:45,520
So the mission then of public health is all about focusing on activities that society undertakes to monitor and improve the population's health.

33
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:55,040
So this process has been evolving over time and we've seen a shift in the way public health is approached, especially over the last century.

34
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,340
In the early part of the 20th century, the focus of public health was on infectious disease prevention.

35
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,130
How do we avoid contracting smallpox? How can we protect citizens from a flu pandemic?

36
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,280
But as technology and research advanced,

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:20,780
the focus shifted more toward dealing with noncommunicable diseases like obesity and chronic conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease.

38
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,560
If you expand that even further injury prevention, should citizens be allowed to drink and drive?

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,070
What are the regulations associated with distracted driving?

40
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,200
This evolution is what we consider new versus old public health.

41
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:46,120
Now, as you can imagine, that's why it's not really that easy to draw clear lines around the exact definition of public health.

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,790
So another aspect then of defining public health is making the distinction between public health and health care or more specifically, medical care.

43
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,290
So I want to take a few moments to really think about how the two differ.

44
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:10,700
Public Health focuses on industry and environment, on healthy individuals and systems that we set up to keep people healthy.

45
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,790
So if we compare that then to medical care. Medical care tends to focus on sick individuals.

46
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,830
Public health has a preventive orientation. And medical care has a curative orientation.

47
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,040
Then if we think about the providers, public health providers are often health departments,

48
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,840
while our medical care providers are physicians and hospitals.

49
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,190
Finally, if we think about who the focus is on in public health,

50
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,730
we're focusing on the public sector and in medical care, we're often focusing on the private sector.

51
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:56,240
So if public health is focused on the public's wellness and the ability to remain healthy and productive,

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,290
what are some of the core values that we can think of in terms of public health?

53
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,350
Well, one core value is the idea of disease prevention.

54
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,230
So that means we're looking to ensure that we can protect citizens from getting sick in the first place.

55
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,520
At the same time, public health as a core value of health promotion, making it easier to be healthy.

56
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,190
So that means promoting healthy behaviors.

57
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,180
And if you think about some examples, maybe we're reducing pollution in a place where large numbers of people have asthma.

58
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,630
To help address that health challenge. Another really important core value is social justice.

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,690
We need to develop systems that allow all citizens to receive equitable care.

60
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,380
Think about neighborhoods in a community. People in one neighborhood might be receiving one level of care,

61
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,930
and people in another neighborhood only 20 minutes away are receiving a different level of care.

62
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,470
How do we make that level of care equitable? How do we prevent that disparity from forming?

63
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,130
Public health also has a core value of evidence based practice.

64
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,470
This means that interventions and strategies that we're deploying every day should be informed by the best scientific knowledge.

65
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:19,550
So if you have the best scientific knowledge in front of you that way, you're working toward having the highest likelihood of success.

66
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,930
Using evidence to promote success. Finally, let's think about the core value of accountability.

67
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,810
Public accountability is so important.

68
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,650
And when you think about communicating findings to the community publishing data about public health challenges,

69
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,080
sharing with citizens what is happening,

70
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,610
those are all critical pieces of ensuring that public health is accountable to the people that it's designed to help.

71
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,190
So while the core values of public health provide us with a really strong set of principles,

72
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,580
it's also really important to consider that there are some tensions that exist around all of these core values.

73
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,570
So let's think about one of those tensions in terms of public health's role.

74
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,530
And I'd like to think about that in terms of a really fundamental question what is public health's role in our lives?

75
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,190
And it comes down to a principle known as paternalism. Sometimes we actually call that the nanny state.

76
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,130
Well, what does that mean? It means we have to think about who is responsible for health.

77
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:32,830
Is there some grand authority that can tell you how to live your life, or is it your responsibility to make a healthy choice?

78
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:40,040
To that end, we can actually start to consider the importance of protecting the population's health.

79
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,380
But at the same time, that might actually mean we're intruding into individual liberties.

80
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:56,750
So if you think about government in its role, is the government's right as an institution there to tell me that I can't smoke in a public place?

81
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,050
Whose responsibility is it?

82
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:09,010
So as we continue our discussion then of the structure and function of public health, I want you to think about some of these examples and tensions.

83
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,260
And really what I want you to be thinking about is how you would actually define public health.

84
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:22,500
How would you organize the core values in public health to make sure that we're getting successful outcomes for everyone?
