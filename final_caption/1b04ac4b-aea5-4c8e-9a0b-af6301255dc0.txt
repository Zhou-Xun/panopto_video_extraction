1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,880
That content was really powerful. That conversation I had with Dr. Peoples plays on repeat in my head.

2
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:38,200
There were so many gems in there. I know her concept of troubling hierarchy and disrupting hierarchies really stays with me.

3
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,990
Something I try to ask about all the teaching I do is how is this disrupting unjust hierarchies?

4
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:52,480
And that conversation you had with Dr. Ford. Yeah, I'm so grateful that we have had guidance of people who have been walking this walk for so long.

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,950
The important model to learn from here is to trust the black and brown scholars who have been committed to anti-racist practices long before we have.

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,210
Yeah, that conversation and so much of the other content really helped me think about my own commitment to anti-racist teaching.

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm thinking about who are the examples to follow, many of whom we heard from in this module and thinking about how it is a long term commitment,

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,610
not something that I'll be done with in a year, ten years.

9
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,220
It's really lifelong. Yeah. And you need a support system to help you stick with the journey.

10
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,660
Friends, colleagues, and role models who can help guide and support us along the way.

11
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,020
Yeah, for sure. I hope all the folks on this journey with us are finding their people, discussing this content with them,

12
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,400
and building a network of folks working together towards an anti-racist teaching goal.

13
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,810
Absolutely. So where to next? How about over there?

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,070
Sounds good.
