1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,990
Up next, John. And the outline for today is we will start off by talking about assignment number one.

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:23,240
We will then talk about trends and urbanization and then we'll talk about non-communicable disease injuries,

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,450
interpersonal violence and sexual gender based violence and infectious diseases.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,570
So I'm going to turn over to Jonathan now, who will walk us through assignment number one.

5
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,940
All right. Let me get my screen shared a minute here.

6
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,210
All right. Can you see both of my screens or just half of it?

7
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,330
I can just see the World Bank data website. Okay.

8
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,800
Let me try this again 1/2. I think I can do both at the same time.

9
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,590
Is that better? Now you see the assignment.

10
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,610
That is it. Okay, perfect. Okay, so this is assignment number one.

11
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:36,489
It's your contacts, demographic profile. So you're going to want to think about specific context.

12
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,840
Doesn't have to be a specific country for mine.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:51,520
I chose people living with HIV in Tanzania, ages 15 to 49, just because that's where most of the data was limited down by that age range.

14
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,700
And then the links that are here. If you did happen to look at the assignment, I did realize one of the links was broken.

15
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,760
So I did go ahead and update that link for the CIA World Factbook just a few minutes ago.

16
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,120
So take your context and then you're going to start going through and entering in the data.

17
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:21,700
I started by kind of just exploring the four websites that are above, so looking to see what was in each of those websites.

18
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,479
So I just kind of went to each of them and looked at what kind of data each of them had.

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:38,650
So I knew where to go for what I was looking for. So I can show you the World Bank data first, then go over some of this.

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,790
But for myself, I was looking at people living with HIV in Tanzania,

21
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:51,130
so I just started by searching HIV and kind of saw what kind of data I could pull

22
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,950
since I wanted the total population size and the prevalence of HIV and then Tanzania.

23
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,170
And you can see the percentage here, 4.7%.

24
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,160
And then I did have to go to the website in order to get at total population for the country.

25
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:25,100
Four. I use the CIA World Factbook a quite a bit for some of the later questions in terms of like social factors, cultural norms and expectations.

26
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,030
You can search for a specific country here.

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,670
So if you are doing a specific country, you can search for the country that you're interested in here.

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,390
Just for an example, because I don't want to throw all the way down to Tanzania.

29
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,200
You can do country summary and it has all this kind of information.

30
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,850
So a particular interest might be people in society or the economy or the government.

31
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,930
So you can get all kinds of data there from the CIA World Factbook.

32
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,830
The DHS, the demographic and health surveys that is also super useful.

33
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:15,790
So when I was looking at kind of breaking down that prevalence of HIV in terms of specific populations, so they're looking at the specific topics.

34
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,570
I was looking at HIV. I went by topics first rather than by country.

35
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,480
So you could you could get to some of the same information by going to country list first.

36
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:33,420
But if you're looking at a specific topic, there's a whole list of them here alcohol and tobacco, tuberculosis, maternal health.

37
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,350
I was looking at HIV and then there's country HIV factsheets here.

38
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,809
So there's all kinds of other information in this in this platform.

39
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:51,190
But just as an example. First.

40
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,720
I can't find what I was trying to show you, but this website had a whole breakdown of.

41
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:10,130
HIV prevalence by women, by men, by men of sex, of men, residents, urban or rural discordant couples.

42
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:24,850
It might be very useful for you. So this was the HIV prevalence estimates factsheet that I found.

43
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,380
It has information on a whole number of countries, specifically in Africa.

44
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,490
But I gave me the breakdown of rural versus urban, as well as all the other factors that I was looking at here.

45
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,760
I never had to know how to do this when it has this bar at the top of my screen and I can't see my other tabs.

46
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,900
Okay. So the W.H.O. website also has a lot of information for you.

47
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,639
You can start by either going to like a country if you want to.

48
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,530
So you could start by for me going to Tanzania.

49
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,390
And then look at all of the different statistics that they have for you there.

50
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:25,260
Otherwise, you can also start by going to health topics if you're looking at a specific disease or exposure indicator.

51
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,210
You can also start by looking specifically at indicators. So if you're looking for like.

52
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,700
Crude death. Three believe it some here there's a whole list of alphabetized lists of indicators here as well.

53
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,400
So for the optional indicators that you're looking at at the end, you can find those here.

54
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:54,450
And then for the assignment, you know, just want to make sure that you're reporting the value and then what is that looking at?

55
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,370
So is that birthrate here is per 1000 people.

56
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,569
So that migration rate per 1000 population.

57
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,480
So just make sure you're including the units percent of total population and then where you're pulling the data from.

58
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,360
And then down here you have more of a free text.

59
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,459
So what information where you're not able to find, why might that be difficult to find and what bias might that introduce?

60
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:30,150
So I couldn't find a specific mortality rate for those living with HIV to see if there was a decrease over time for HIV mortality rate.

61
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:37,050
And then you have a whole section here to talk about cultural and social norms and social factors in your context.

62
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,590
Fantastic. Thanks, Jonathan. Could you actually pull up your assignment again?

63
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,559
And what I'm going to do is go to Jonathan's assignment and I will tell you how we

64
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,760
will be creating needs and what kind of feedback you can you can expect on it.

65
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,940
Awesome. So let's start with question number one. What context you selected.

66
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,780
It's like John mentioned, it's not just meant to be a a country, it's a context.

67
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:23,219
So you might say it might span countries so might be displaced people from Syria who are then,

68
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,250
you know, in Lebanon and and and and Jordan and, you know, kind of throughout the region.

69
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:38,310
Or it might be very, very it might be smaller than a country like Johnson didn't play HIV in Tanzania between 15 and 49.

70
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,430
And, you know, that's a pretty straightforward question.

71
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,009
Just make sure you do something, you know, that's kind of make sense the way you do it and you'll get full marks on that one.

72
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:59,760
So, Jonathan, you got your full point over that, then question to the way the table will look in the assignment is the first one,

73
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,120
two, three, four, five, six columns are already there. So from total population size down to mortality rate.

74
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:12,300
And then the last four we left blank for you to fill in ones that you.

75
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,500
That you. Think are important.

76
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,629
That being said,

77
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:25,050
the ones that we put in that every predefined if they don't make sense to your population say this doesn't make sense for our population,

78
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,020
there's no point in the and that's completely fine. Just justify that somehow.

79
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:38,850
For example, if you if Jonathan was looking at men who have sex with men who lived with HIV, maybe fertility rate isn't that important over there.

80
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,280
And then, you know, you could just say,

81
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:54,900
since I'm looking exclusively at men who have sex with men who for the most part on fertile we I didn't include that that that box over there.

82
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:04,350
So again because I include all these who there would be the four points over here but I will give some feedback saying perhaps the other

83
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:15,990
data sources you could use one that comes to mind immediately from for to me is AIDS info from UNAIDS or maybe the Tanzanian census.

84
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,450
So I wouldn't restrict yourselves to the just to the sources we put on top.

85
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:30,150
Look, look deeper are some that make sense to your context or to the or to the disease you're studying?

86
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,040
I'd also maybe say some other important indicators or I know Jonathan had a most last one you had.

87
00:10:39,690 --> 00:11:11,259
Knowledge of. As everyone.

88
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,130
I'll still have an. Okay. Okay. I know Ryan's connection is a little bit unstable.

89
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,070
We give him just a minute to get back on with us.

90
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,920
Did you ever question? Yeah. Can I ask a quick question?

91
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,690
Yeah, go ahead. If I'm looking at a population where it's like it's very hard to find data outside of this,

92
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:48,670
like sources that's been provided, I go on to say, is it okay for me to engage, help from like Gurpreet as well?

93
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:57,799
Yeah, absolutely. I know she probably would be super glad to have questions from you and you can also

94
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,879
definitely look at so like these are the four sources and I did just use this for sources,

95
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,110
but like Brian was saying, you can go to other sources as well.

96
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,180
And he's like sometimes for HIV, the UN AIDS website would have been a super good one for me to use.

97
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:19,960
And then some some of these things too, like you might have to kind of your units here, you can kind of get some explanation.

98
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,700
So I wasn't necessarily able to find.

99
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,450
Fertility rate for specifically people living with HIV.

100
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,790
So I gave the fertility rate for the entire country and just kind of specified what I was looking at.

101
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,720
Same as the mortality rate. I couldn't find the mortality rate specifically listed anywhere for people living with HIV,

102
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,959
but I just calculated it myself based on the number of HIV deaths per year over

103
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,890
the total number of people that are currently living with HIV in the context.

104
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,830
So some of the numbers you might have to play around with a little bit or look at different sources.

105
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:09,750
Feel free to email me if you are kind of struggling with finding what you need.

106
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,350
And then Brian was saying sometimes it just might be like an and a not applicable and then just give an explanation of why.

107
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,520
Okay. Great. It's helpful. Thank you. You're welcome. Any other questions while we're waiting for Ryan to come back?

108
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,810
Yes. Janet, there. I was just wondering if you could do, like, one example, like how you got the unit out of there?

109
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,980
Yeah. All right, let me.

110
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:46,240
Try and do this. Okay.

111
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:54,930
So on the DHS website there is this download of HIV prevalence estimates for from U.S.

112
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,830
So let me try and show you this.

113
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,230
So I had all of this information about HIV prevalence broken down by country and region and Africa.

114
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,489
So this is a 2010 publication.

115
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,860
So you can see here the prevalence of HIV from 2008 in Tanzania was 5.7.

116
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:24,090
So it is down a little bit. Now go to the same thing that you are seeing with the oh point naught.

117
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,140
Let me try this again. Thank you.

118
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:44,010
Okay. You see them both now? Yes.

119
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:53,490
Okay. Thank you. So this publication has given me the 27,008 prevalence for people living with HIV.

120
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,670
And to me, it's a little bit higher than what I got here.

121
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,490
So you can just explain, like what where you got it from and what year it's from.

122
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,290
So it has gone down a little bit if you look back to 2000.

123
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,200
Seven and eight, you're probably going to see about the same.

124
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:18,320
Yeah, 5.3. So just like I had from the DHS website, it has gone down since then.

125
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,630
Okay. Good. I'm on my phone. Can you hear me?

126
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,630
Yes, absolutely. Good, so bad that I cut out.

127
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:37,100
What was I saying when that happened? You were saying something about my optional indicator that I had at the bottom.

128
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,650
I think you're specifically talking about knowledge of HIV status. Yes.

129
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:53,500
So, you know, then we would just say Jonathan couldn't include a few more indicators, like maybe so there's something called the UNAIDS, 1999 ease.

130
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,100
We talked about them a little bit last time and, you know,

131
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,250
kind of going deep and knowing what the goals are, like the SDGs or 1990, the other goals and your topic,

132
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,589
knowing what those are and then kind of including those in there and knowing about

133
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:15,250
people who've initiated onto the ARVs and people who are virally suppressed.

134
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,750
But generally that looks great. And for degrading, that would be a false.

135
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,210
I mean John has that will give him a full score. And then could you go down some more, please?

136
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:52,739
So I just switching to my computer. Perfect. So then to be is talking about what data you can't locate and you'll quickly realize

137
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,700
there's so much data you can't find in global health because nobody is collecting it.

138
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,260
So talking about a source of mortality or maybe there's difficulty finding data on certain populations

139
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,760
or certain demographic factors over there and talking about the biases that might introduce it.

140
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,589
Johnson is doing a great job here. And then finally, the social factors and context.

141
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:20,340
So in HIV, you know, I mean, always the language is important in the tribal groups and religion,

142
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,819
and there's almost one for everything, as well as the population structure.

143
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:32,160
When talking about human trafficking, especially sex trafficking and forced labor is important, but maybe also going deeper into the economics of it.

144
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,360
How are people working and talking a bit more as well about migration, particularly migration within the country?

145
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:48,390
So that's all what I'm going to do is put a few more comments on this example and we will upload this to Canvas.

146
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,150
So you all have an example to go work in your assignments.

147
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:04,240
Great. So we can return to the any questions on this before we move back to the lecture?

148
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:23,630
So. The term slum. What are people thoughts on the term slum?

149
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,810
Do you think it's a term that should be continued to be used? Is something that's falling out of favor and is something from the past?

150
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:41,490
What do people think about that? I just remember when I first read the articles that were assigned, like I was surprised that slum was used in, like,

151
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:49,750
an academic context just because, like, I don't know, I feel like I was just, like, raised to never, like, call a place like a slum.

152
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,510
Like, it has such a stigma. And I just was surprised that that's like commonly used in that way.

153
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,070
Yeah, I certainly agree. Anybody else?

154
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:09,569
I thought it was interesting that the authors of the paper made a point earlier, and I think the first paper that they're like,

155
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:16,650
this is a term that has really bad negative connotations associated with it, but we're going to continue to use it.

156
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,780
I thought that was like interesting to point out without like and I know like the paper might not have

157
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,590
been the place like get into terminology like if there was a better way to talk about something.

158
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,120
But it's kind of felt weird like point out and then just like brush past it and continue.

159
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,280
I think that I'm not interested in certain if this is what they use, like an informal settlement,

160
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,450
they like proposed a different term that might be a little bit better.

161
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,330
And then I feel like they could have done a lot.

162
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,479
It would have been very powerful if they had used that term going forward and then it would be like setting an example.

163
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,200
But like you said, they went back to using the term some the entire time.

164
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,330
I guess that's what I was. That's what I was confused about.

165
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:19,630
Why are they not synonyms? Sorry. This they are y or an informal sentiment in some sentiment.

166
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,290
This is what I wanted to ask if anyone had further insights.

167
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,690
So I just, I just left for a second because then that. Could you repeat that was sort of.

168
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,979
Yeah. So everyone was talking about how in the article they mentioned they use the term slums and then they

169
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,080
also give us another term that we can use to like I guess to talk about some informal settlement.

170
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,650
But then like immediately after they said that using the term slums and informal settlement aren't synonyms.

171
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,730
So what is the difference? So what I wanted to kind of know more about.

172
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,709
Yeah. So that's a great question. So this put out there, I know the authors very well.

173
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,880
So Richard Littlefield was my supervisor and so is Sam Watson.

174
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,470
So two of the senior authors on this paper and this is something we talked about quite often and.

175
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,650
And I'll get back to your question in a second. And there's really no answer.

176
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:25,680
But what started off is there was a funding call from the National Institute of Health Research in the UK,

177
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,430
and the funding goal was to research health and slums.

178
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,320
And they couldn't then not call it slums because they wanted the money.

179
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,440
And also, you know, these the authors, Richard, especially.

180
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,300
They're fantastic. They're very ethical. He's a very ethical global health professional.

181
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:51,240
Everybody else on the page, on the paper, too, especially Carolyn Cope, attorney.

182
00:21:51,990 --> 00:22:03,210
She's amazing. If you ever look her up, she runs a PHC in Nairobi, but they they come from a time where these terms are very accepted.

183
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:12,310
Moving away from the word slum is a relatively recent thing, which is kind of why that's the case.

184
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,120
This is something we actually grappled with quite often.

185
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,859
I refuse to put the word slum into my Ph.D. and they were like, Well, no, you have to call the slum.

186
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,110
And this is something we talk about quite often because the funding, but a lot of this actually comes down to the funding of that.

187
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,340
So what is the difference between an informal settlement and a slum?

188
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,420
So what people call an informal settlement is is.

189
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,030
It's mostly people are squatters over there.

190
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,820
There's not really much land ownership and there's no organized public services.

191
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,060
And then what they say is the word slum is a subset of that, where it's unsafe.

192
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:03,660
It's overcrowded and it's unstable. But I don't really see the need to make that differentiation firstly,

193
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:12,870
because I think he'd be pretty hard pressed to find an informal settlement that isn't unsafe or isn't overcrowded or doesn't lack basic services.

194
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,950
And even then you can you can still use other terms.

195
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:26,850
That's saying slum. You can say, you know, a a urban informal settlement that that lacked basic services or has particular issues with X, Y or Z.

196
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,990
But there's no real answers there. So just want it to be something that you're all thinking about as you're reading these papers.

197
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,170
So moving on, Paul said we could talk about this more end if we have time.

198
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,680
Urban health where they talk about urban informal settlements or informal settlements,

199
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,680
it's really a story of inequity and that's where a lot of the issues come from.

200
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:02,530
So on the left over here, we have the map of Dhaka, where I am now,

201
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,320
and a picture below that of the cradle of the informal settlements of Creole being right here.

202
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,690
And what I want to show you is this little bit over here is called Gulshan.

203
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,010
This is the richest area of Bangladesh.

204
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:27,660
I went shopping over here in this little bit of Gulshan on Friday and there were stores selling shirts for $50 and ties for $100.

205
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,770
It was, you know, obscene.

206
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:36,870
And then just literally across the road is this urban, informal settlement where people don't have water and barely have food.

207
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,700
And we talk a bit more about this in a second. And this isn't an isolated, isolated case.

208
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,100
On the right, we have a picture from Johannesburg in South Africa.

209
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,500
On the on the right, the pictures, Alexandra, which is a township.

210
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,580
Apartheid, black South Africans, a move that work for the white South Africans in Johannesburg.

211
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:09,270
And, you know, it's it's by all intents purposes, a very impoverished, urban, informal settlement and literally across the highway.

212
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:16,530
So here's Alexandra. Here's a place called Sandton. This is this is the richest square mile in all of Africa.

213
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,300
The amount of money over there is obscene. And you can see it really well in this picture.

214
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,820
This this hasn't been Photoshopped in. I've seen this almost every day.

215
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,930
I mean, this divide is real. And the whole point of this and same using my career is this is because.

216
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:39,839
These urban, informal settlements really pop up when there's a need for cheap, unskilled labor and lot of issues.

217
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,980
You get them that really because of inequity. So must sort of just tell you a little bit about, you know, what I've seen over here in Dhaka.

218
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,640
And, you know, like I said earlier, if anybody wants to chime in with their own experiences, please, please do.

219
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,430
So. The first thing that strikes you in Dhaka is the roads.

220
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:08,489
And we'll talk about a little bit in presentation. But you have cars, you have these incredibly unsafe busses that are kind of scarred a little place.

221
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:16,440
You have the C and GS, the motor rickshaws, people on bikes, people on motorcycles, people on cycle rickshaws and everything else in between.

222
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,720
There's really no traffic rules. People don't listen to the police to who and who are pointing out where to go.

223
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:34,140
You know, they have one traffic light which nobody listens to. And this leads to quite a few fatalities and injuries from road traffic accidents.

224
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:43,980
Accidents, every, every. And two things to mention as a side when when any of you go off and do your do your work internationally.

225
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:50,580
The first is the biggest killer of NGO workers is road traffic accidents.

226
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,220
That's the absolute number one killer of NGO workers.

227
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,050
So make sure you're wearing a seatbelt in the car and that you have a proper driver and doing it safely.

228
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,129
The second one is, please, please, please, under no circumstances take a motorcycle taxi.

229
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,459
They're called boda, boda or motos or whatever roundabout there.

230
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,250
Incredibly unsafe. A few years ago in a medical school, a student died because he was taking a boda.

231
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:24,210
Boda, which is involved in accident. And one of my friends in Kampala a few years ago, she was on a boda, boda and most crossed between two busses.

232
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,499
And she it's it's miraculous. She wasn't paralyzed.

233
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,660
She had physio for about six months. She's completely fine now, but they're very unsafe.

234
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,490
If you do end up using a boda, boda or a moto, a motorcycle taxi.

235
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:47,520
So the two things to keep in mind are if you can use like an app like Uber has motos and boda, boda is on it.

236
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,060
On Kenya, there's an app called Safe Boda you can use, and if there's no app bailable, just talk to the driver beforehand,

237
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,880
make sure they know what they're doing, make sure you know they are drunk or high or something.

238
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,580
And also, if you can bring your own helmet, but if you can avoid them completely.

239
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:17,190
So the other thing that strikes you in Dhaka is you see in this picture, these are all electricity cables running around just kind of tied to poles.

240
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,180
This is also incredibly unsafe and causes many fires.

241
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:28,620
Yeah, this box lying down, it's because there isn't the infrastructure to deal with it, to deal with the big influx in population.

242
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,920
And this is in a pretty, pretty nice area of Dhaka as well.

243
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,569
So we then went to Mirpur, which is an informal settlement similar to the difference of miracle being.

244
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,000
It's mostly climate, internally displaced people.

245
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,700
So because of river erosion and flooding, people had to leave their homes in the countryside to move to Dhaka.

246
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:57,059
And this is building right over here. We have a picture that's my boss's head in the back showing kind of like one the alleyways here.

247
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:07,110
It's very densely populated. You can barely walk through it. It's one thing to consider on the bottom left.

248
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,829
There's a picture inside one of the one, the settlements.

249
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,280
So and this one was organized that you have a big kind of tin building and each one a beer room.

250
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:24,660
I have never been so, so hot in my life until I walked into this place.

251
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:31,170
It was easily 110 degrees. And, you know, I after 5 minutes, like I couldn't stand anymore.

252
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,040
And no, this did a lot of health impacts from that, but.

253
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:42,350
That's also what the people we talking to, the people living there, and we asked them what's what's the hardest thing about living here?

254
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,050
And this one, they said, it's it's the heat.

255
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,870
They just can't stand the heat. And the children are getting dehydrated and and people find difficult work.

256
00:29:52,890 --> 00:30:00,180
And that's a major issue that. And those people they were actually very well off relatively when they were living in the countryside.

257
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:07,320
But because of climate displacement, they had to move here and they lost pretty much everything in the middle, on the bottom.

258
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,760
We have a picture of a room. Every family has gone one room and each family has about five people.

259
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:24,840
So five people live inside this tiny space. Which, you know, is just not a humane way to live, especially with that heat.

260
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,980
And on the right over here, we have one of the kitchens.

261
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,299
And again, we talk about this later in the lecture, but there's no good ventilation here and they aren't even using safe cooking techniques

262
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,090
that fires almost all of the time in addition to the issues that the pollution is causing.

263
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:52,210
We spoke to somebody else who is living there. It's it's it's struck me so much through asking him what's the hardest thing about living here?

264
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:00,399
And he said that it's that it's the it's the costs.

265
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,450
It's it's it's an ability to pay for rent. So he said, okay, how much did you rent?

266
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,730
It was 2500 taka, which is $25.

267
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:21,560
That is not a lot of money. And for context, you know, if you go to a, you know, like an average restaurant over here, one,

268
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,070
they're like kind of middle class working people go to you're paying like 500 taka for a meal.

269
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,860
If you get a haircut, it's maybe like 700, 800 taka.

270
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:39,080
But just that amount of inequality between the people living in these settlements and the people living and living in kind of the rest of Dhaka,

271
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,620
it's really causing a lot of these issues.

272
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,010
If you kind of spread out the inequality a bit more, you won't have these issues I'm seeing in the comments.

273
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,870
Q And Marie, we've got a few things.

274
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,910
I just wonder if you want to kind of unmute yourselves and share with the class before we move on, maybe.

275
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,490
Q First. Oh, yes.

276
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,850
Rachel asks, Is it like coming into the settlements settlement?

277
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,280
It's kind of like, how did that happen?

278
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,780
From my experience,

279
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:26,400
a lot of times the men near the settlement lightning comments and then the ritual by the women and then push politically for this to be implemented.

280
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,420
And then they build penthouses here and like the old complexes here and stuff like that.

281
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:40,070
A lot of very jarring difference between the houses right next to Don't.

282
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:51,150
Yep. Thank you. And I think that that is an issue around the world as well.

283
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,549
Or even just rich people buying these buying plots of land.

284
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,880
These areas do even just rent out without composing, converting it.

285
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,220
But it's so much just like profit gouging that comes from this, which, you know, is really a big problem.

286
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:15,050
Thanks so much for sharing that. And Marie, I see you talking about the the injuries.

287
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,800
If you could save your comments, let me go to the injury portion. That would be fantastic to chat about what you're saying there.

288
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,049
And Marcus, you had a comment about Brazil. Yeah.

289
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:35,930
I was answering Rachel's question earlier and I said in Brazil, usually what happens, especially like when from the rich,

290
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,460
richer neighborhoods are located in the outskirts of the city so far away from crowded places and all that.

291
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,850
So it's harder to get there because vacation or transportation means so.

292
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,610
And you also may be able to find it just across the street like a rich neighborhood in like a very poor neighborhood.

293
00:33:52,940 --> 00:34:01,620
But that's more common in other states now. My home state and I also mentioned, like going off what you said about rich people buying the lanes.

294
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,820
I know a lot of business they do down there. Do that stuff down there.

295
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:12,980
Where to buy domains and just tell people to live and tomorrow they become homeless or they just end up being like even more crowded spaces.

296
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,630
Yep. And forced displacement is a really big issue as well.

297
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,310
Both from private people and private companies buying buying the land.

298
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,350
Also, sometimes government buys the land and people are just forcibly displaced at any other option.

299
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,360
So thanks so much for sharing that market's great.

300
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,060
So just moving on now, we talked briefly about some trends in urbanization.

301
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:46,690
So 2007 was the first time in human history when there were more people living in urban areas than rural areas.

302
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:53,800
And that's a trend which is really expected to continue forever, pretty much.

303
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,270
And there are lots of factors that are driving urbanization,

304
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:04,600
but you can really kind of split those into push factors and pull factors of demand and supply.

305
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:12,640
The pull factors, the factors pulling people into urban areas, the economy of their the opportunity to make money.

306
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,600
But sometimes people have an unrealistic expectation.

307
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,770
They have they can go to and become rich, which isn't always the sense people also, you know, take some risk in doing this,

308
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,709
but it's often quite informed or maybe people want to go to make some money and then send money back home.

309
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,350
That's a very common thing to do. People also just might want to change their life.

310
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:40,670
They might not want to be a subsistence farmer or wherever out of the made industries, but they work.

311
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,489
And they also just might be family over that who they want to join. On the other side, though, you know, that could be climate change or famine,

312
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:56,360
which is pushing people away from where they live or maybe there's violence or,

313
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,040
you know, other social issues of there or a plethora of other issues pushing people away from where they live.

314
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:07,010
So these together, what's causing the increase in in urbanization.

315
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,420
And you can see opium in most of the world,

316
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:21,680
people tend to live in urban areas a bit in sub-Saharan Africa and and and Southern Asia and East Asia and South East Asia.

317
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,190
That people still most live in rural areas, but that's rapidly changing.

318
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,900
And I'm sure in ten or 20 years, most of this map is going to be gone.

319
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:39,639
So most people live in urban areas. And we can see over here this is just continuing to grow by 2050 is going to be such a massive number,

320
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,220
more people living in urban and rural areas, and that's going to continue forever.

321
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,380
Look, I'm sorry. Just trying to hide that. I don't want to let you go.

322
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,820
And now this is showing off the, um, population who is living in the urban, informal settlements.

323
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:08,590
And this is also really a story of if you put down an equity that's something called a Virginian.

324
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,860
That's when you can map inequity in a country.

325
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:18,640
You'll really see that there's a pretty close correlation between inequity in the country and,

326
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,110
you know, shamefully urban population living in an urban, informal settlement.

327
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,870
But that being said, you know, it's not all doom and gloom.

328
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:37,780
More and more, the proportion of people living in informal settlements as a total of people living in urban settings is going down.

329
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,940
There's definitely improvement over here. And towards the end of the lecture, we'll talk about why that might be the case.

330
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,260
But there are plenty of problems faced in urban settings.

331
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,880
One is pollution, both from cooking and the environment and cars and and industry.

332
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,190
There's not that much green and recreational space in these areas.

333
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:04,600
Food, especially healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, might be difficult to come by.

334
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:13,540
Extreme heat is an issue. The environment is contaminated with solid waste and human waste and other contaminants.

335
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:20,110
Noise levels can be extremely high, leading both to, you know, hearing problems and mental health problems.

336
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,040
Violence, both interpersonal and sexual gender based is an issue.

337
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,630
There's a massive amount of road traffic accidents,

338
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,380
and these really come down to the population density and the inequities and issues and social mobility.

339
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,940
So talking about non-communicable disease,

340
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:46,810
which is becoming an ever present problem globally as lifespans go longer, but also especially in urban settings.

341
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,910
A few reasons for that, because the built environment and social economic status,

342
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,880
there's generally quite high rates of tobacco use, low rates of physical activity given the low amount of recreational space,

343
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,180
poor food, poor food intake and a high amount of alcoholism,

344
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:15,850
in addition to a lot of other issues here, like pollution and like and a few other things as well.

345
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:25,220
For example, there's almost double the risk of low physical activity in a urban area compared to a rural area.

346
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,000
There's also double the risk of low and low fruit and veg intake is 1.5, the risk of elevated BMI.

347
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:42,110
And people, as you can see on the graph, on the bottom right, are more likely to start smoking at a younger age than in a a.

348
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:56,320
Rural area. And Moses goes, Well, this is one of the areas actually where there's not really that much data to go off, but a fairly high rates of.

349
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,620
And this is from India, the fairly high rates of diabetes, high rates of hypertension,

350
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,250
high rates of obesity, high rates of smoking and high rates of binge drinking.

351
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:16,060
But what I really want you to see in this graph as well is, is how neighborhood effects play into this.

352
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:22,510
So on the top, you have the prevalence of disease by individual level education.

353
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,710
And on the bottom, it's by neighborhood level education.

354
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,500
And I really want you to focus on hypertension over here.

355
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:43,489
It seems a bit, although they have many, many prime lessons from education, have lower rates of hypertension than men of primary education.

356
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:53,440
Then it goes down a bit. But you can see here for everything as you get as a neighborhood in general gets more education, it goes down across.

357
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,340
You don't really get these wacky trends like you see over here or even over here.

358
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,830
And that shows how important neighborhood effects are.

359
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:08,979
Even if you just educate one person or you have an intervention of one person that the whole neighborhood isn't benefiting from,

360
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,559
that the neighborhood effects are so strong that doesn't really make a big difference.

361
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,889
And it's not just for MTV, it's for ideas as well. Infectious disease induced trauma, pretty much everything.

362
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:26,370
So all these interventions, you do have to be holistic. So.

363
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,270
We're going to pause over here briefly for discussions.

364
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:43,760
And in your groups, you're going to chat for about five or 6 minutes about a an entity of your choice and intervention to decrease the burden of that.

365
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,940
And we talked about this in class last week, but a few different types of public health intervention.

366
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,890
You can you can you can discuss there's primary interventions which is reducing the risk of disease.

367
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:08,010
So. If you're doing it for HIV, for example, there be condom use or prep the secondary intervention, which is early detection and treatment.

368
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:19,440
So again, with the HIV example, that would be community based testing and rapid HIV initiation and then tertiary intervention.

369
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,120
So preventing severe mobility and mortality with advanced disease.

370
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,250
So for HIV, it would be addressing AIDS and making sure people with AIDS aren't getting co-infections.

371
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:39,389
That can really cause issues. So we'll put everybody into groups now and take about 5 minutes just to chat about and an NCD of your choice

372
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:49,050
and possible solutions to decrease the burden of that NCD through these just to button these interventions.

373
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,780
John. I think I will go to. If you want to go to one, I'll go to two and then I'll switch between two and three.

374
00:43:15,380 --> 00:48:39,220
Okay. I think everybody is back.

375
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:48,340
So as always, if we can just go for each room and and if someone kind can summarize what you were chatting about.

376
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,650
Room number one was Chris, Elise, Jacob, jump in with you, Lu and Sara.

377
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:04,000
I can go ahead and speak for our group. So we took us a little while to figure out where it was, what we were going to discuss.

378
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:09,549
We started talking about diabetes and whether or not we wanted to talk about

379
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,270
interventions for type one diabetes or type two because they have different,

380
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:26,950
different needs. Near the end of our conversation, I believe Sarah had a really good comment about maybe type two diabetes education,

381
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:38,630
doing some education for Pacific Islander youth in America and incorporating the church because they want me to explain it.

382
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:43,240
Yeah, you're doing great, by the way. But yeah, really good points.

383
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:50,560
Oh, I appreciate that. So yeah, essentially just because in terms of context for this so for Pacific Islanders,

384
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,940
when it comes to where the community aggregates, the church is a big focal point.

385
00:49:55,330 --> 00:50:04,060
So if you were going to do a primary intervention to educate youth groups because they have after church youth groups for the adolescents,

386
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,559
you can incorporate some sort of supplemental education around nutritional practices and, you know,

387
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,110
just basic information about what foods are good or how to workout at home or things like that that they could use.

388
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,070
Awesome. Thank you. Yep, that sounds great.

389
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,750
So a lot of times in in settings like this, especially,

390
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,580
especially more formal settings with it's more you need more community institutions like churches,

391
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,770
you need little community and community institutions because they don't really government services to go off.

392
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:45,960
And also trust is a big thing. A lot of people living in these places don't trust the government and the more formal health institutions.

393
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,389
So using those kind of organizations is is a great idea.

394
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:57,600
So thanks so much for sharing that. Room number two, Amir, Christian.

395
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:07,680
Q Marcus, Maria, Sophia. I can speak for our group.

396
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,680
Please chime in. Group number two if I were getting anything,

397
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:19,140
we it took us a while also to get to sort of settle on a disease that we were interested in talking about.

398
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,639
We eventually settled on like. Lung cancer.

399
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,870
We decided not to go with smoking specifically, but lung cancer is the product of smoking or even car pollution,

400
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,340
things like this product too, which I was unaware of.

401
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:43,940
We focused mainly on primary intervention steps because once again we took us a bit to get to that disease decision.

402
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:52,820
And we mentioned that some primary interventions would be public service announcements,

403
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:59,390
more behavioral control at the community level or company level in terms of.

404
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:10,250
Communicating those like the harms of smoking at the individual level.

405
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,920
Who are that? Mary. Mary. Maria, you brought up the.

406
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:27,210
The prioritization of green spaces within communities in terms of lessening pollution on the community level.

407
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,540
And then we sort of I guess we sort of skip past secondary intervention.

408
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,540
We mentioned a couple of things, but I'm forgetting them now on a more tertiary intervention would be of course, ones.

409
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:46,440
Yeah, Chris. I think for secondary I think he mentioned screening for secondary interventions.

410
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,220
That's right. That's right. You know those in place.

411
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:58,550
And then for tertiary interventions, we had chemotherapy and surgical interventions which use it and then yeah.

412
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,250
Prolonging life and put someone in hospice care.

413
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,240
In hospice care. Awesome.

414
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,130
Yeah. When it comes to screening programs, again, it's really one of those things that you want to look in on existing community structures for.

415
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,729
And I'm sure in one of your classes or we'll talk about it,

416
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:23,370
you learn about community health workers and they can do everything from primary to tertiary ed interventions.

417
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,340
But having them deliver screening programs is really fantastic.

418
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,050
Even now, everybody in the world, for the most part, has a mobile phone, and integrating that into some kind of mHealth service is fantastic.

419
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:41,400
Tertiary interventions are top, especially for a disease like cancer, and hopefully we'll have a lecture later on on cancer treatment.

420
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,990
But it comes down to if you can't afford your treatment, you're probably not going to get your chemo or your surgery if you need it.

421
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,860
So a big part of me thinking about how people can finance this,

422
00:53:52,860 --> 00:54:00,020
maybe we rolled out an insurance program or maybe we put in financing programs that people can can use to pay for this.

423
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,040
Or it might even just be a livelihoods program so that people can make a bit more money.

424
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,140
So fantastic. Thank you. And the last group.

425
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,180
So a lot of the interventions that we talked about,

426
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,370
the other two groups have kind of already mentioned, but we talked about like coronary heart disease.

427
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:28,370
And on the primary intervention level, we talked about Greenspaces and just implementing greenspace for more physical activity and

428
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:35,659
also potentially like in a more minor way to remedy like inaccessibility to nutritional diets,

429
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,799
just because some cities have urban gardening and stuff like that.

430
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:46,430
So if there is increased green spaces available, that maybe that could help people's diets as well.

431
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:56,719
And then we also talked about screenings and kind of like using pop ups as a way to like get like large amounts of people screened and that

432
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:09,140
might be more like accessible or sustainable to organize a pop up than like trying to organize a more permanent clinic in those types of areas.

433
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,400
And then also for tertiary intervention,

434
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:19,790
we also talked about like pop ups as well as pop up clinics and then maybe just the

435
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,700
administration of like medications that might just help to reduce the severity of

436
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,580
symptoms and that are like cheaper and easier to distribute like aspirins or like

437
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,970
vitamins that are particularly relevant to heart health or something like that.

438
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,980
Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. I'm really happy you brought up the distribution of medication too, because that's such an issue.

439
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,710
Firstly, getting the medication there, but also.

440
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:57,489
Getting medication, which is not fake and, you know, not expired and is safe to use, especially in these urban in, you know,

441
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:05,060
kind of more impoverished places and places that people have so much education to tell, you know, what's good medication wise and that's fantastic.

442
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:12,950
So thank you. Good points from every group. So we will now talk about.

443
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:20,780
Public injuries. Interpersonal violence and sexual gender based violence.

444
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:28,160
So the biggest cause of death for people aged 15 to 49 in urban settings is actually road traffic collisions.

445
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:32,510
And the reason why there's so many is there's this unplanned betterment.

446
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,690
There's higher populations in these cities than designed.

447
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:42,170
There's not enough infrastructure. There's unsafe vehicles and unsafe drivers.

448
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:50,810
Actually, a lot of times even people don't have driver's licenses, especially people driving the rickshaws and and those kind of vehicles.

449
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,540
And then you mostly pay attention to structures.

450
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,540
So maybe the construction sites, things are falling down from a poorly constructed housing.

451
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:06,950
They might be real ways. People, you know, going for tons of people don't know how to handle or even just bones are very common.

452
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:16,850
And I just kind of want to also be here because Mary had an interesting comment on injuries in Uganda.

453
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:21,660
Some agreed. You want to talk about that briefly. Yeah.

454
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:29,140
So I did some research there. I think it was 2018 and it was just on shoulder pathology,

455
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:41,020
but we were like recording a score of their pain if they had any like prior injuries or if it was the first one and then like the cause of it.

456
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:56,320
And a significant amount of people got injured through like either transportation to work or their job, like was being a boda boda driver.

457
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,379
And so it did correspond with people's work with this.

458
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,070
It was just like a small clinic. But yeah, that's good.

459
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,330
Thank you. And you know, it's an issue all over the world.

460
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,700
But what's really important, I think, is also considering the the people in these accidents,

461
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:22,450
especially the boda boda drivers who didn't get to the clinic, prehospital care systems are often quite lacking.

462
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,220
Or people just might say, I can't afford the clinic, so I'm not going to go.

463
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,350
So I'm just going to quickly show you a video from the doctor just so you can see what the roads are like.

464
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,290
Pretty good. Yeah.

465
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:54,590
What, about half of.

466
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,590
So as you can see, it's incredibly congested, many different types of vehicles sharing the space and people walking down

467
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:28,350
the road the amount of times they'll be here in a 20 minute drive to I think,

468
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:33,180
you know, I'm going to be in high school. Last day is ridiculous.

469
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:38,400
You know, people drive on the wrong side of the road. No one pays attention to to the laws.

470
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:45,959
And, you know, these the CNG drivers over here, most of them don't have licenses and, you know, pedestrians as well.

471
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,940
People since there's no crosswalks, the way people across the road is they just start walking and,

472
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,049
you know, the cars stop, but they don't always stop.

473
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,890
And it's a massive problem over here. And a lot of country,

474
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:07,680
a lot of cities that have had a rapid influx of people and have been able to cope with the demand for transport will also you know,

475
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,270
another big issue is also violence, both interpersonal violence and sexual gender based violence and are many, many issues.

476
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:22,200
This is a very complex problem. But if you are to need to commute at very late hours when it's dark,

477
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:28,140
improper lighting along with insufficient public services, the official word here is the police.

478
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:36,090
I'm not sure how true that is. But you know, just on public services to support prevention of violence,

479
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,230
stresses welcome in city alcohol and drug abuse and particularly in the case of sgbv just

480
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:51,360
systematic gender inequities and often lack of respect for for women and other gender minorities.

481
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:04,680
So on top left, I just have a graph showing you Nairobi and the hospital over there, the proportion of road traffic accidents.

482
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,740
And actually in Nairobi, most of them are from pedestrians. So people just trying to cross the road, more than half.

483
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,709
You don't have people who inside motor vehicles, motorcyclists and bicyclists.

484
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:22,800
But obviously this will look very different depending on the on the context in the city.

485
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:31,710
On the bottom right. This is this is from from high income countries in Europe, but still, you know, applicable globally.

486
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:37,650
You can see the proportion of people in different communities reporting of crime.

487
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:45,000
Being densely populated communities and green being not so densely populated communities.

488
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:55,290
And in almost every country, densely populated communities have higher levels of violent crime than than less densely populated communities.

489
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:03,840
And it's a very complex problem. And there's very little data available in ex-KGB, which,

490
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,120
if it's a field people want to go into, is is one that urgently needs research and work on it.

491
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:18,600
But this paper was discussing that the letter about, you know, ten percentage points,

492
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:24,870
50% higher rates of attempted rape in urban areas than rural areas.

493
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:30,419
Something interesting with Ebola as well is that having a partner and living

494
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,590
in an urban area was associated with higher levels of female sexual assault.

495
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:40,620
So you can you know, there's kind of evidence here suggesting that a lot of the XDR-TB is actually intimate partner violence,

496
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:47,760
which, you know, could come down to, you know, stress, nearby environment, inadequate services and alcohol and drug abuse.

497
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,270
But again, the data and research on this is really, really lacking.

498
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,840
We will go past the discussion for now and come back in the end if we have time.

499
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:10,009
But I just wanted to talk to you about one of the road traffic interventions, which is actually being done in Dakar, and it's fantastic.

500
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,970
And they portrayed it as a public health intervention and that was building a subway.

501
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,150
So they built a subway in Dhaka to open in December.

502
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:23,480
And the reason for that was saying we need to take cars off the road, people, when all these road traffic accidents.

503
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,670
So it's a really powerful example.

504
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:36,110
Off, off, off of, you know, how public health can be pretty much everybody else building highways,

505
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:38,629
improving their road infrastructure for the same reasons,

506
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:47,720
saying this is going to improve, improve, you know, road safety for people and as a public health intervention.

507
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:52,440
And before we move on to Healey, I see your comment.

508
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:57,290
Do you want to discuss that a bit more? Yeah.

509
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:03,889
So I remember when I was in Turkey, I was much younger then, but any time we would try to cross the road,

510
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:08,330
I always felt like the cars wanted to meet you or you just like go faster just to make it,

511
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:13,219
like, almost near impossible for me to be able to cross safely. And then also my time in Kenya.

512
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,760
When I went, I think two summers ago, I felt the same thing.

513
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,209
And the roads are extremely congested. And personally,

514
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:25,730
whenever we're driving since typically I guess our highways are like one way you'll

515
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:29,510
have drivers gone to the other side and they'll keep going on to the other side,

516
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:33,260
the other cars, just so that they can, I guess, go faster.

517
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:38,330
But immediately when they see red light, they quickly move over to the side that they're supposed to be on.

518
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,740
And when I experience that for the first time, I was like, this is this is dangerous.

519
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:50,750
And then I also have family members who recently passed away in Tanzania because I think one of the one

520
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:57,290
of the bigger semi trucks was coming down and they were just crossing the road and had hurt the person.

521
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:01,370
So they passed away and apparently with the people in the area were like, it's very common.

522
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:06,710
It's very common for someone to just like cross the road and they're just going to get like a snag across the street.

523
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:14,030
But just due to the nature of the roads being like so big and the car not really carrying that large taken away.

524
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,860
So it's a big problem. Yep.

525
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,380
Thanks so much for sharing and so sorry for your loss and Tanzania.

526
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:28,879
But it is a massive problem, especially, you know, again when you go out for your international work.

527
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,360
If you're an environment like this, that's another part of really making sure you stay safe.

528
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,669
So the three things you can do,

529
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:42,320
all of which I've done and I'm going to present them in order from safest but most ridiculous to probably the best option.

530
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:47,450
Actually not the best option. Depends how you look at it. The first was it was my first time in Bangladesh.

531
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:54,229
I had no idea to cross the road. I took a rickshaw across the road and the guy was so confused and I tried doing that.

532
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:58,430
But you know what? I'm happy I did it because, you know, I just had no idea how to do it.

533
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,010
And he was happy. He got like a dollar for doing that.

534
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:11,840
The second way is, which is what I do now, is I will stand an intersection and I'll wait there for five or 10 minutes until there are no cars coming.

535
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,220
And then I'll go and you'll see like dozens of people who live here walk past me.

536
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,710
But, you know, I think that's a good balance.

537
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:24,650
And the other way, which I don't really recommend, is you just see someone who knows what they're doing and you just kind of follow them.

538
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,150
But that can be quite risky sometimes, especially if you don't know the person.

539
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:42,340
And now infectious diseases. And we all do a whole unit of couple of weeks of three or four weeks on infectious diseases.

540
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,510
So we will just have a very cozy overview of this.

541
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,850
But there are quite a few issues that cause infectious disease outbreaks in urban settings.

542
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,120
The first is human animal interface is over the top.

543
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,340
We have a picture of a illegal chicken abattoir in Hillbrow in Johannesburg.

544
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:05,379
And this wasn't in, you know, an informal settlement. This is in a skyscraper that was abandoned.

545
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:13,690
So a bit of background. When apartheid ended, most of the high income people left Johannesburg.

546
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,440
It's called the central business district. So essentially downtown.

547
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:25,270
And it was taken over by by by different gangs and really just became a very, very impoverished area.

548
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,450
And now people are running chicken abattoirs in them.

549
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:33,280
And you can just think about the amount of blowback too, and other diseases that's that's getting over here.

550
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,769
Go to the chickens, to the people taking care of them.

551
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:46,059
But also when the chickens are slaughtered themselves, the meat on the right is about going going along with the human wildlife and faces.

552
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:55,440
We have some dogs and rabies and, you know, other diseases associated with dogs are also very common in these areas.

553
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:01,180
And again, keeping yourself safe. If you're like me and you want to pet every single dog, you see, firstly don't do that.

554
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:09,340
But if you do, if you do, make sure you get your rabies vaccine, inadequate food supply,

555
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:15,040
which is also a problem both in the quality of food, but also the safety of the food is the food safety.

556
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,949
Those are going to give me food poisoning. Population density.

557
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:26,169
Just people living so close to it is always an issue for the poor, for for disease spread water infrastructure.

558
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:33,159
So can you get safe water? Well, as you can see on the bottom left picture is the water stagnant boat because

559
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,840
it's unsafe to drink or also because that's a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

560
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:45,580
Right now in Bangladesh, there's a dengue outbreak because of all the stagnant water, sanitation and solid waste,

561
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:53,620
solid waste being garbage, which can obviously breed different vectors of disease like flies and mosquitoes.

562
01:08:53,620 --> 01:09:00,940
And it's just disgusting in general, just garbage lying around for days, but also managing people's flood sludge.

563
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:08,050
So on the bottom right, we have a picture from an urban settlement in India, the called Hanging Latrine.

564
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,010
And I mean, it's pretty obvious what's happening here.

565
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:16,120
This guy is going to the toilet and the hanging latrine goes through actually into a lake below it.

566
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:22,540
And then there are children playing in lake. And that is not a good example of waste management.

567
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:37,450
Personal hygiene, as well as just being able to wash yourself to prevent, you know, skin diseases as a big one to prevent and keep this disease.

568
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:46,300
And also antimicrobial resistance in these places, because there's actually very easy access to antibiotics,

569
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:52,360
become breeding grounds for animal diseases, and they're way more.

570
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:56,049
And it's also worth noting these are all intersectional with the other topics.

571
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,320
For example, sanitation is actually and water.

572
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:07,150
Sanitation is a big issue in Sgbv. One example is, you know, women, especially in refugee camps,

573
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:16,360
generally don't like going to the latrine late at night because because of the threat of sbv.

574
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,500
So then, you know, they might, you know, use the bathroom, the house, which isn't that clean.

575
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,970
And, you know, a lot of different examples like that. Um.

576
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:34,920
Moving on. Great. And over here from two cities in India are two areas.

577
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:41,610
In India is the burden of a few different IDs, orange being girl excuse me.

578
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,960
And blue being orange being urban and blue being rural.

579
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:56,250
And you can see that for a few of these, you have a few more cases in urban areas, but for other fevers it's a bit more in rural.

580
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:05,790
But I would really think that when you go down to considering reporting bias and you know how people and how this data is collected,

581
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:12,060
you have far more diseases in urban areas than in rural areas.

582
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,840
You know, a disease which has very good surveillance programs is diarrhea.

583
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,310
And you can see this on both of them. It's far more in urban areas, in rural areas.

584
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:30,979
And then when it comes solutions, you know, we'll have a big unit on infectious disease surveillance later on in the course,

585
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:35,510
but a lot of it comes down to vector control and putting in safe water and sanitation

586
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:41,719
services and hygiene promotion and vaccination as well as another big one.

587
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,870
But I won't touch on this too much for now because you'll be overwhelmed that I'd work later on in the semester.

588
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,400
So what are the future of urban informal settlements?

589
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:03,690
A lot of people think that urban informal settlements really are stuck like that forever, and there's just no way out of it.

590
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:05,910
But that's not really the case.

591
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:13,770
So in South Africa, there are places called townships, which essentially the staff composed of urban, informal settlements.

592
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:21,299
The history is during apartheid, black people were moved to the townships to work in the cities,

593
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,400
and Suharto's the biggest one, and Suharto was quite famous because that's where Nelson Mandela lived.

594
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,310
And it's whether Suharto uprising happened, which is the uprising, I believe, in the sixties, which is really.

595
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:37,300
One of the big catalysts for ending apartheid.

596
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:41,290
But now people in Soweto are building massive houses.

597
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:47,050
So the one on the bottom over here is 12 million rand, which is about $100,000, which is a lot of money.

598
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,229
And it's a massive house and deep and sweat is turning from what would you'd consider

599
01:12:53,230 --> 01:13:00,010
an almost criminal slum into a place where people it's into a nice place to live.

600
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:09,020
And why is that? It's because well, firstly, people were given ownership rights to land, so they want to invest the land they once had.

601
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:17,470
It would be taken away. But more than that, we talk to people living there and you ask them, you know, why is the matter improving so much so quickly?

602
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,209
It's because they have great pride in where they live. They say, you know, I'm from Soweto.

603
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,030
I would dance for my my children. We balance that out.

604
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:35,050
And so activists who I am and because of that, people really want to invest in community and improve it, which is really fantastic.

605
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:40,620
And I think these two things building pride in communities and, you know,

606
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:45,820
making sure people can actually own their land and threaten for their land is a really big

607
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:53,370
component of of improving of informal settlements and growing and reducing that inequity.

608
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:57,420
But with that. Okay.

609
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:03,210
So before we move on to next week, are there any questions on today's lecture?

610
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,400
Awesome.

611
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:24,370
So for I do apologize and realize that class is supposed to end at 420, 430, so I'll be ending a full 20:08 p.m. But for next week I will not be.

612
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:34,450
I'll be away and I won't be checking my emails. If you have some kind of urgent need to contact me, email, Jonathan and Jonathan can send me a text.

613
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:42,760
On Tuesday, Dr. Lindsay Kobayashi will be giving a lecture on health and goal settings and health plus lifespan,

614
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,360
and now a few readings on perusal for that.

615
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:54,280
On Thursday, Dr. Mark Wilson will be giving a lecture on child health and survival, which is a nice precursor to our maternal and child health unit.

616
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,130
And I don't think Mark has great readings yet, but he will in due course.

617
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:09,160
I posted a optional video and discussion that's just a forum on canvas on road traffic accidents in Dhaka.

618
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,370
So the video is about a 45 minute documentary on road traffic accidents.

619
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:23,890
It's incredibly interesting. And then if you can just, you know, jot down some comments and discussion on, you know,

620
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:28,450
kind of interventions to reduce the burden of road traffic accidents in Dhaka.

621
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:35,110
And then the next week from September 20th, you resume in-person class.

622
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:42,370
The first class, I believe, will be John, who is at the class on graffiti with Nancy.

623
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,660
On the 20th. Let me check. Yes, that's that is correct.

624
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:54,940
Okay. So before that clause, it be in person and we will send a reminder email out before that.

625
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:03,400
But you won't have any meetings, but you will be watching a movie before that class that you will discuss in class.

626
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:12,760
And then later down the line, just say by nose. I know a lot of you were quite interested in that video last week from Dr. Modu Pi.

627
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:20,379
So I sent him an email and he's going to give a guest lecture later in the semester so we can kind of discuss the video with him,

628
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:26,380
which should be super exciting. So that is all for now.

629
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:34,040
Any any last minute questions before we wrap up? Great.

630
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:39,060
As always, John and I will stay around for a few more minutes if anybody wants to talk us off the class.

631
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,940
But have a lovely weekend and I'll see you all in a week.
