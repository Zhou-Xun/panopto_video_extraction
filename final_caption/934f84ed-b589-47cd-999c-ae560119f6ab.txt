00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,760
Good morning, Wake Up Detroit listeners. My name is Sophie, and I'll be your host.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,020
So in our first podcast, in the series, we discussed a major environmental justice issue in the southwest Detroit community,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,110
high and differential rates of asthma in this community due to polluting incinerators and factories.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:27,000
But the issue at hand is one of systems level, meaning it's rooted in deep historical structures ranging from redlining to historical lack

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,850
of investment in this community to consequential poverty relating to these racist structures.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,460
There's still work we can do as citizens and community members to address this issue.

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,940
We can activate local officials to push back on these corporate polluting bodies and get them out of our community.

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,140
Though individuals are not to blame for this environmental disaster in our community,

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,350
our voice matters and we are here to say the city of Detroit needs to do better by us.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,580
I want to start with the story. This is about Vince Martin. It's reference from a 2020 Guardian article.

11
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,740
Growing up in Southwest Detroit, Vince Martin thought it was normal for the sky to be orange.

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,260
His family moved from Cuba to one of the black areas of town. When Martin was only three.

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,500
At the time, discriminatory housing practices segregated,

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,690
the city is Afro-Cuban family settled in the four eight two one seven district, now known as Michigan's most polluted zip code.

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:32,250
Again, the southwest community we have been discussing specifically, the Martins moved to Boyne Town, a working class neighborhood.

16
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,620
This town sits next to a Marathon Oil refinery and its sprawling industrial campus.

17
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,650
Martin is now an environmental activist in Detroit.

18
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,340
He remembers the refinery being made up of maybe one or two tankers when his family settled there in the 1960s.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,910
The situation worsened exponentially over time.

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,840
Since 2013, the refinery has surpassed state and federal regulation emission limits and over 15 occasions,

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,480
according to data from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:11,090
Martin, notice the worsening air quality. He considers himself fortunate because he traveled so often for sports, escaping the worst the pollution.

23
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:19,970
Martin reflects that others weren't so fortunate. During his high school reunion, Burton noticed that more people in his class were dead than living.

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,820
He knew a lot of his classmates had died from cancer.

25
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:30,830
In fact, Martin's own young brother, David, developed asthma and juvenile diabetes, as we know from the previous podcast.

26
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,430
Each of these health conditions has been linked with air pollution.

27
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,330
Growing up, Martin remembers, David was rushed to the hospital every few days with respiratory issues.

28
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,530
These episodes kept happening every time he tried to go outside and enjoy his environment,

29
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,750
said Martin did extensive and frequent asthma related health complications.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,480
David, unfortunately, died at age 45. What Martin calls toxic poisoning.

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,600
I'll leave you with this quote from Martin. Someone with such joy in life, seeing it stripped away little by little.

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,990
It's a terrible thing, Martin said. To be in a community like that and to be exposed to these kinds of pollutants.

33
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,370
It's a sad story. So what can we do?

34
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,860
One primary intervention to prevent any more environmental health catastrophes in the southwest Detroit community is through policy intervention.

35
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,550
Specifically,

36
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:32,180
the city of Detroit needs to enact more stripped air emissions restrictions in tandem with alternatives to gas emissions and a focus on green energy.

37
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,770
This is a big deal.

38
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:42,950
This proposed structural level intervention will promote true equity to provoke to prevent polluters from entering this community in the first place,

39
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,600
while redistributing corporate resources towards green energy and jobs that will have a long term, sustainable economic impact.

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,820
The city of Detroit can't intervene and push forward more stringent air emissions restrictions,

41
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,740
and the national EPA or state regulators can implement, in this case,

42
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,480
passing a local ordinance on clean air rights, including provisions on green job creation,

43
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,380
redistribution of corporate taxes towards clean energy and preventing polluting facilities from taking up shop.

44
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:20,270
What address both the imminent danger of unchecked air quality and long term economic opportunity in the green sector?

45
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,890
This is all very forward thinking, but what can we do now in the president and present?

46
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,710
OK, so as citizens, we can put pressure on local officials to clean up our air?

47
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,580
How so? Let's take a note from environmental justice activist who in 2019 got the city of Detroit to shut down the Detroit

48
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,940
renewable power incinerator in a majority black community like the incinerator in the southwest community.

49
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,600
Most of the waste cut came from whiter, more affluent communities,

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,420
which place the burden of disposal on a mostly African-American, low income community.

51
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:01,730
Classic environmental racism The Breathe Free Detroit campaign, a coalition of public health, environmental justice and concerned citizens,

52
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,740
collected nearly fifteen thousand petition signatures starting in twenty eighteen,

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,740
demanding Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan shut down the incinerator because of its link to air pollution.

54
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,450
The activists reflected that they were successful because elected officials generally respond to demands from big numbers of constituents,

55
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,120
which the signatures represented. The Breathe Free Detroit campaign will begin organizing around the southwest

56
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,590
Detroit community to pressure our local representatives Gabriella Santiago,

57
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,750
Romero, Representative Rashida Tlaib and Mayor Mike Duggan.

58
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,190
Follow wake up Detroit on Instagram at Wake Up Detroit to get a link to our letter demanding the removal of both the incinerator and the refinery.

59
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,430
This is the first step towards true environmental health equity and justice in the southwest Detroit community.

60
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,780
Our voice matters, and we are here to say the city of Detroit needs to do better by us.

61
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,075
Thanks for listening.
