1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,840
In this module, we're going to

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,160
dive a little bit deeper into

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,785
the concepts of
hazard and exposure.

4
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,650
I've already used these
terms in previous modules,

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,185
but they may still seem a
little abstract to you.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,240
We thought what better
way to drive that home

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,370
than being here in the
actual environment where we

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,560
are surrounded by
literally thousands

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,705
of potential hazards
and exposures.

10
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,280
So we're going to dive
into this a little bit

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,455
more deeply in this module.

12
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,660
Now we've already
talked about the fact

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,420
that hazard is a chemical
or biological or a

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,090
physical agent or some
set of conditions that's

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,360
capable of causing a
biological response in humans.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,660
So again, there's
chemicals that are around

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,000
us constantly in the
air and our water,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,890
biological hazards and Physical

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,980
hazards like the noise from
the roadway right here.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,500
We've also talked
about how exposure is

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,815
the contact between a person
and the hazards around them.

22
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,120
We've highlighted already

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,890
that exposure has
three components.

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,180
One is intensity.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,070
So how much of the
hazard is actually

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,235
there in the
environment around you.

27
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:09,695
Two is frequency. How often
are you actually exposed,

28
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,300
and three is duration.

29
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,640
How long does the exposure last,

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,010
and we've talked about how
exposure is the product of

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,560
frequency times intensity,
times duration.

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,850
What we haven't talked
about so far is how we go

33
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,235
about actually quantifying
these hazards.

34
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,860
We can express this actually
in lots of different ways.

35
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,795
So we can talk about
the total amount

36
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,070
of a hazard present.

37
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,510
We do this for radiation

38
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,980
if you've ever heard for example,

39
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,490
radon measurements expressed
in terms of picocuries of

40
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,949
radiation present or
how many kilograms

41
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:42,925
of chemical are present
in a particular facility.

42
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,590
We can also measure
intensity as a ratio.

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,955
So if you've ever
heard of the unit

44
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,715
decibels used for noise
like we have here.

45
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:51,140
A decibel is a ratio of

46
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,180
how much sound pressure
there is in the environment

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,620
compared to the minimum amount of

48
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,575
sound pressure a normal
hearing human can here.

49
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,130
We can also express intensity
in terms of concentrations.

50
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,010
So how many units of a
particular contaminants are

51
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,980
present per unit of
environmental media?

52
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,600
Let's dive into that
a little bit more.

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,910
So we often talk
about the mass of

54
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,390
a contaminant per some
volume or mass of media.

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,790
So for example, I
might say there are

56
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,775
10 micrograms of a
particular air pollutants

57
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,890
in the air I'm
breathing right here,

58
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,860
per cubic meter of air around me.

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,365
Or there's a certain
number of micrograms

60
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,840
of lead per liter of water that I

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
drink or a certain
number of micrograms of

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,155
a contaminant per kilogram
of food that I eat.

63
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,090
We can also make
internal measurements.

64
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,400
So how many micrograms of

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,195
lead are present per
liter of my blood.

66
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,055
So those are some common units.

67
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,210
In the popular press,

68
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,380
you may seem units
more like parts per

69
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,920
million or parts per billion.

70
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,820
These are all show ratio numbers.

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,390
So per one part of contaminant,

72
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,170
how many million parts of

73
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,970
environment are
present around it.

74
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,865
So let's dive into that
a little bit more now.

75
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,015
So I'll give you
two examples here.

76
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:06,800
The Occupational
Safety and Health

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,450
Administration has
a limit for how

78
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,280
much formaldehyde workers can

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,110
breathe in the air
in their workplace,

80
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,920
that limit is 0.75
parts per million.

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,290
What's a part per million?

82
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,360
Well, one part per
million is the same as

83
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,990
one drop of ink in a
full-sized kitchen sink.

84
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,720
It's also the same
ratio as one inch in

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,960
16 miles or one
minute in two years.

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,065
So a pretty small
amount of contaminant.

87
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,150
By comparison, the Environmental

88
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,010
Protection Agency has a limit for

89
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,990
how much arsenic can
be in the water you

90
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,885
drink of 10 parts per billion.

91
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,280
Now a part per billion is the

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,930
same as that same one drop of

93
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,900
ink in a full sized
swimming pool or the

94
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,700
same as three seconds in

95
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,170
100 years or one
penny in $10 million.

96
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,400
So you can get the idea that

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,050
both of these
expressions parts per

98
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,310
million and parts per billion are

99
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,500
pretty small amounts
of contaminant,

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,690
but don't be fooled
for some chemicals.

101
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,490
One part per billion is more than

102
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,730
sufficient to actually
make us sick.

103
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,020
So we've talked about exposure,

104
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,020
let's move onto the
next concept of dose.

105
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,630
Recall that dose is how
much of a contaminant or

106
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,360
hazard actually gets
inside your body,

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,300
so pass the barrier of
our external surfaces of

108
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,600
our body and its internal and
available to cause damage

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
to your tissues.

110
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,020
So exposure leads to dose,

111
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,360
but it should intuitively make
sense that you can't have

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
a dose if you don't
have an exposure.

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,060
Again, this may not be super
intuitive but I want you to

114
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,760
imagine the figure that
we've illustrated here.

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,740
Let's say there's a
smokestack putting out

116
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,320
air pollution right in the
middle of a crowded community.

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,450
We've got people that
live in some cases

118
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,010
very close and people
that live further away.

119
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,055
You might say well,

120
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,565
we have a bunch of
people who are all

121
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,470
100 meters from the smokestack,

122
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,795
they must all have
exposure and dose.

123
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,990
But in fact if that's
smokestack is positioned

124
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,530
where the wind always blows
the smoke in one direction,

125
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,070
then the people upwind have
no exposure and no dose,

126
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,930
whereas the people
downwind may have

127
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,485
huge exposures and
huge subsequent doses.

128
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,510
So we have to remember
three things here.

129
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,520
The concentration
in the environment

130
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,830
around us is not the same as

131
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,600
exposure that
requires humans to be

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,420
present and exposure is
not the same as dose.

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,830
Dose requires the stuff to

134
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,515
actually get into a human's body.

135
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:28,520
Exposures and doses can be
very simple on the one hand.

136
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,650
So imagine the last time
you went to the dentist or

137
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,365
the doctor's office and
you've got a medical X-ray.

138
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,420
It was a single exposure
at a given point in time,

139
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,755
you've got an exactly
known amount of radiation,

140
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,440
we know who did it. It's
incredibly well-documented.

141
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,755
That's the best-case
scenario. That's not reality.

142
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,170
In reality, all of us
are being exposed to

143
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,885
multiple exposures all the time.

144
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:53,550
So for example, right now I
have noise from the roadway,

145
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,120
I have ultraviolet
radiation from the sun,

146
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,830
I have chemicals in
the air I'm breathing,

147
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,305
I have whatever was in
breakfast this morning.

148
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,120
So in reality, it's quite

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,190
difficult to understand
real-world exposures.

150
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,470
Try to imagine how
we would assess

151
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,790
your own exposure to

152
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,270
an average level of an air
pollutant over a whole year.

153
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,950
So this is really complicated.

154
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,095
We've got two things we
need to keep into account.

155
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,120
One is the aggregate exposure.

156
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,475
So let's take a particular
chemical, lead.

157
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,739
I might be breathing
that in the air,

158
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,480
it might also be in
the food I'm eating,

159
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,880
and it might also be in
the water I'm drinking.

160
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,100
So in aggregate, I
need to consider all

161
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,890
of those routes for that
particular chemical.

162
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,005
But we also have a
cumulative exposure.

163
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm not just exposed to lead,

164
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,455
I also have these other

165
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,050
chemical and physical
biological agents.

166
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,570
So environmental health is
very difficult because we're

167
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,040
exposed to these mixtures that

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
change over time but
also quite frankly,

169
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,330
it's very interesting
because of that.

170
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,250
So if you're still not convinced

171
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,460
that exposures are important,

172
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,650
let me give you an example.

173
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,170
You may already know that
carbon monoxide isn't as

174
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,275
fiction and if you're exposed
to too much, you could die.

175
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:58,670
Is that useful information?

176
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,815
Absolutely. But it's not enough.

177
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:03,440
We also need to know how
much carbon monoxide

178
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,110
can you be exposed
to before you die,

179
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,000
or how much can you
be exposed to before

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,130
you can start to get sick at all.

181
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,140
Where might you get exposed to

182
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,530
carbon monoxide and when
might those exposures occur.

183
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,070
How would we go about
measuring these things.

184
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,000
All of these aspects are critical

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
for us to understand
and be able to say,

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,680
you are exposed at a
certain amount and that is

187
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,030
less than or more
than the safe level.

188
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,500
Another number I want
to come back to 85,000,

189
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,690
remember that's about the number

190
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,830
of chemicals or at least that's

191
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,420
our best guess of the number

192
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,180
of chemicals in
commerce in the US,

193
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,810
and that's just chemicals.

194
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,700
We also have the
physical hazards and

195
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,560
the biological hazards around us.

196
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,200
So we're exposed to so
many things all the time

197
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,730
that exposure assessment is

198
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,940
a critical part of public health.

199
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,160
So to connect the dots here,

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,230
we'll come back to our
exposure disease framework.

201
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,670
We've already talked
about the source

202
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,185
as the origin of a hazard.

203
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,700
We talked about how pollutants

204
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,155
move through the environment,

205
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:02,480
those environmental levels or

206
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,330
intensities or
concentrations as we say.

207
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,270
Once that hazard comes into
contact with a person,

208
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,000
now we have exposure.

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,880
Once the hazard
gets into a person,

210
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,890
we have dose and

211
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,930
unfortunately that dose
can of course lead

212
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,130
to adverse health
effects subsequently.

213
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,750
So the dose-response relationship

214
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,120
again is our way
of characterizing

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,980
the relationship
between the dose we get

216
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,530
and the adverse
reactions that we have.

217
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,390
So this is a nice
way for us to be

218
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,250
able to compare
different agents and

219
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,910
decide how much more toxic
one is than the other.

220
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,020
In image you see here,

221
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,040
we've got two chemicals;

222
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,460
chemical A and chemical B
on a dose-response curve.

223
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,260
The y-axis is response.

224
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,480
The x-axis is how
much dose you get.

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,860
So for chemical A,

226
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,780
you'll see the slope rises very,

227
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,615
very quickly and sharply
and then flattens off.

228
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,820
That tells us that this
particular chemical

229
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,015
is very toxic,

230
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,740
a very small change in your dose,

231
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,940
results in a very large change in

232
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,620
your response and as you see

233
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,540
that response flat
line at the top,

234
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,860
that maybe because everybody's

235
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,025
dead after we hit
that flat point.

236
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,060
Contrasts that to
chemical B where we have

237
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,370
a nice gradual linear slope.

238
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,860
So a small change in chemical B

239
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,830
yields a small change in the
dose-response relationship.

240
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,915
So in this case, we
would say chemical A

241
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,285
is by far the more
toxic chemical.

242
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,660
That's probably the one that
we should focus on first.

243
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,920
So wrapping it all up,

244
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,585
identifying hazards and
understanding exposures

245
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,090
is the foundation to EHS.

246
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,130
We can't do environmental
health science without

247
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,730
exposure assessment
and understanding.

248
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,500
If our exposure
quantification is not good,

249
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,780
we're not going to be able
to understand how much

250
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,465
of a dose does it take
before people get sick.

251
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,480
We won't be able to identify
acceptable levels and

252
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,320
set standards to protect
the public and workers,

253
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,770
we won't know how to monitor

254
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,110
environments to make
sure that they're safe,

255
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,180
and we won't be able
to prioritize sources.

256
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,680
So when we do
exposure assessment,

257
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,970
we can start to say,

258
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,320
for example, what is it that's

259
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,120
coming out of this road
that's more important?

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,314
Is it the noise,

261
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:04,510
is it the chemicals that
are being emitted via

262
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,780
pollution or is it
some other factor.

263
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,690
So all of these things
are critical for

264
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,075
us to do good environmental
health science.
