1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,569
One of the most wonderful things about being part of a university community is that you get to meet

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,310
so many interesting and intelligent individuals because so many people are getting their educations.

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:27,490
However, they're often transient, and after spending some time with us here in Ann Arbor, they move on to other new, exciting opportunities.

4
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:37,030
This phenomenon, of course, does not only happen in college towns, but also in cities and towns around the world, as well as in study populations.

5
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,149
In this video, we're going to talk through the challenges that can come about in estimating measures of incidents.

6
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:52,370
Proportion because of people's movement in and out of populations will then discuss the use of rates to estimate incidence.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,580
And I'll talk about how we can calculate these measures for both small studies as well as very large populations such as cities, states or nations.

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,250
We'll begin this video again with the notion of incidents.

9
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,410
You recall that the idea with incidents is that you start with some fixed populations at

10
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:17,170
risk and then you follow them over time and count what fraction develops the disease newly.

11
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,629
This is a great measure for a population when you're able to capture the full experience of

12
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,690
people over time because it represents the probability of getting a disease or somebody is risk.

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,780
Of course, the challenge is, is that life happens and within a fixed group, some people will leave your study area over time.

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,480
Others may die or develop different illnesses,

15
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,750
and still others may simply stop responding to your requests for information about their disease status.

16
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:56,310
As a result, it can become very challenging to count all of the people who ultimately get the disease of interest with any kind of accuracy.

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:04,710
In fact, we're highly likely to miss cases and therefore underestimate our incidence proportions.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,060
So what do we do? Well, you likely recall from previous coursework that one very nice way to get around

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,800
this issue is that instead of counting the total number of people at risk,

20
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,490
we can count the amount of time that people spend at risk and use this number in our denominator.

21
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:32,580
As a result, we estimate the rate or speed at which people develop disease, a measure that we call the incidence rate.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:43,770
In small populations. This can be calculated pretty easily by simply adding up the time that people spend in the study before they're lost.

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,590
Die or develop the disease of interest. For example, here we can see that the person time at risk is shown in orange.

24
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:02,040
Adding up the person time contributed by each line results in a total of 30 months of follow up time for the full group.

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,060
Since we observed one case out of the 30 months of time that the group spent at risk,

26
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,770
we can estimate that the group here has an incidence rate of 0.33 cases per person month.

27
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,209
Now, while this is a manageable exercise for small studies,

28
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,270
you can easily imagine that it'd be so much harder to tally up the full person time at risk within

29
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,810
a large population where people are not only leaving for various reasons and at different times,

30
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,310
but they're actually also entering the population at different times.

31
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,090
So what do we do in this scenario?

32
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:50,690
Well, we make our best guess at the person time in a population by multiplying the average population size during our time period of interest times,

33
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,060
the duration of time that we're following people.

34
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:02,640
For example, let's look at this data from the CDC on dementia incidence in the United States between 2010 and 2014.

35
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,330
On the left are the number of new cases by year.

36
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,580
And on the right is the size of the U.S. population, also reported by year.

37
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,920
To estimate the incidence rate of dementia between 2010 and 2014.

38
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,460
What we would first do is sum up all of the new cases in the population across the full five years.

39
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,670
This results in approximately 1,117,000 new cases of dementia.

40
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,190
We then divide this number of cases by the average person time of the population,

41
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:45,910
which we've estimated by multiplying the average population size of nearly 314 million people times the five years of follow up.

42
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:57,080
As a result, we see that over this five year time period in the United States, the incidence rate for dementia was 70 cases per 100,000 person years.

43
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,440
This estimate can then be compared to different time periods or different locations to see how

44
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,050
rates are changing over time or if they're worse in the United States than elsewhere in the world.

45
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,510
Of course, one very important thing to note when estimating incidence rates is that you're

46
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,740
inherently assuming that the rate is constant over the period of follow up.

47
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,250
In other words, we assume that the rates that you would get from following ten people for 20

48
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,870
years is the same as what you would get for following 20 people for ten years.

49
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,590
Well, this particular case seems pretty plausible.

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,800
You can imagine that this assumption starts to feel less and less realistic as you get to longer durations.

51
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,680
For example, would you believe that the rates you would get from following five people for 100

52
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,330
years is the same as what you would get for following 100 people for five years?

53
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,940
Likely not. Therefore, just like with incidence proportions,

54
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,580
you need to be thoughtful about when you construct your estimates as to whether or not the duration is too long to assume stability in your estimates.

55
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:14,800
Great. We've now finished up much of the review uncommon measures of disease frequency that you've seen in your previous classes.

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,960
And we're now ready to start thinking about some new material in terms of how different measures of associations relate to one another.

57
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,889
Before we do that, though, I just want to note that the key takeaways from this particular video are that dynamic

58
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,650
populations can make it very challenging to estimate simple measures of incidence proportion.

59
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,059
Therefore,

60
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,180
we can calculate incidence rates for small populations and estimate incidence rates in larger populations to account for attrition over time.
