00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,980
To sum up, this class in three minutes is a tall task looking at the six Americas quiz result,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,000
I scored with the 26 percent who are alarmed about climate change.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,300
I am a bit concerned that only a quarter of people fall into this category,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,120
but I feel that learning about climate change through an environmental justice loans has clarified for me how we may be able

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,140
to increase that number so that more of our fellow humans are alarmed and ready to act and demand action from those in power.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,760
The first part of the course was extremely helpful in distilling the science behind climate change.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,220
The link between global warming and greenhouse gases and the human nature of greenhouse gas emissions.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,770
I had believed the science of climate change for years, even while not being well versed in the details.

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,550
Having this foundation added to my armamentarium is critical to the fights to come and the

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,430
still massive amount of education that needs to be done within the six Americas quiz.

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,790
I answered that I did not think climate change would affect me.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,420
Very much answering only a little while, still being alarmed at the facts in general and on future generations,

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,890
learning about the health impacts through an age lens has further support of this answer.

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,890
And as a cis white, straight male and the upper middle class,

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,690
I am in a group that can largely escape the significant near-term impacts of climate change.

16
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,910
I have air conditioning and access to clean water.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,400
I can afford to jump in food prices and can move if needed to escape any regional exposure to floods,

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,850
severe storms and wildfires or other climate related natural disasters that may arise.

19
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,680
This class has reinforced the notion that poor countries, mostly of color and poor people within rich countries again mostly of color and urban,

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,600
are the most at risk from the health effects of climate change. This is, of course.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,660
This, of course, follows that most stressors are most intensely felt by those who are at high risk at baseline.

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:56,520
But the sheer size of the health impacts from climate related natural disasters, vector borne diseases and sequelae of climate change is staggering.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
As a person in a relative position of power,

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,740
I see it as in part my responsibility to advocate for policies that will lessen these risks in the communities.

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,440
While the evidence bases of climate change is indisputable,

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,530
I think that case studies of impacts on specific communities have been the most compelling in this class.

27
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,760
I feel that as advocates, we must tell personal stories to evoke emotion and spur action among the public and policymakers.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,190
The data absolutely must support the stories, but the stories have the potential to move people beyond that,

29
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,640
which they learned from research studies and particularly looking back at the

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,710
1995 heat wave of Chicago that killed 700 individuals and less than a week,

31
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:43,750
mostly people of color, mostly elderly, isolated people who could not escape the impacts of those massive heat waves related to climate change.

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:51,820
Other stories in the Detroit area or in Detroit, specifically over the last few years of massive flooding related to significant rain events

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,500
and an aging infrastructure of a combined sewer system that can't handle all of that rain.

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,720
And again, communities of color in and and communities mostly are impacted.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,970
I believe telling those stories connecting the dots for people in those communities and outside of those communities has the ability to move policy,

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,780
perhaps more than data, perhaps more than graphs, perhaps more than the science has done thus far.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,530
It has been such a privilege to participate in this class and spend time with an engaged group of fellow students guided by such a treasure,

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:31,072
Professor Dr. Charles. This was a class about which I was most excited entering the elective phase of the program and that delivered in full.
