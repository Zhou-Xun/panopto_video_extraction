1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,819
And I don't know why. It's not only a canvas and then I add some slides for a burn.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,899
Prevention of children early childhood injury. It's a very large feel.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,300
I mean, you think about and this is a developmental question, not necessarily what is the right kind of injury to focus on.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,610
This is just one where there happened to be some resources. My work in this space is somewhat limited.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,710
Most of the time I'm interacting with adolescent age or emerging adult age populations,

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,480
and I have worked with the state, for example, to implement a car seat program.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,970
The idea was to train car seat technicians.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,200
So you think it's a car seat? How hard can it be?

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,889
As a parent, I can tell you it's not as easy as it seems to do everything correctly and it can have a huge influence.

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:56,530
And so what we were doing is working with training bilingual technicians so that they would be in better positions to work with their constituencies.

11
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,940
It was primarily over in Grand Rapids, so there are a lot of different ways that we could think about engaging with early childhood injury.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,370
So just because this is where we kind of focus today doesn't mean that this is a space that you're interested in.

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,660
You have to stop.

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:19,170
And then there are other places where we we know, for example, drownings or access to firearms or you know, I use that example a lot.

15
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,360
But are there spaces where you are, where early chatter, where children can be injured?

16
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,800
I would encourage you to bring that into your reflection of science.

17
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,249
Okay. So this will be kind of an overview.

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,319
I mean, as in so many cases, what we'll do each week is a broader overview.

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,370
It's the 30,000 foot level, but hopefully giving you space to also dig into a specific topic area if this is what's exciting for you.

20
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:50,100
Okay, so reflection assignments, I'm asking you to do it three times this semester.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,400
I like these days. Thursday is my good day. I teach twice as well of long day, but it's a good day.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,910
I get to talk to you folks. I get to hear your thoughts. I like the questions.

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,770
It's fun to try to think critically about some of the stuff, but I know I don't get to talk to everybody.

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,210
I don't get to hear what you're thinking about or what you're exposed to in other classes,

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,930
or how you might be engaging in injury outside of the conversation that I'm kind of directly,

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,870
that's what these are, and it probably sounds a little hokey or clichÃ©d, but I want to hear from you.

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,049
I want you to just tell me a little bit about how you're thinking with either the material that we discuss in class or the

28
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,210
presenters that do that come in or something that you read about in the news or so on Twitter or whatever it's going to be,

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,510
if it's related to injury, if you can kind of make a connection to the topics that we're discussing in the course,

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,020
you feel free to just have a free expression of your thoughts, ask a question.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,500
And I mean, it's a rhetorical one that you kind of answer for.

32
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,120
Tell me about something that happened in your personal history that changed the way

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,979
that you're viewing some of the content in your material that we read or the speakers.

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,910
Again, I'm not looking for four formal, five paragraph essays.

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,879
Here's the framework or here's the template that I can follow and I can knock three of these things out in the first three weeks.

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,890
Please don't do that. You can if you really need to. But I'd rather you tell me just in a free form, you know,

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,990
reaction to something that you saw on the news or I wish that this could be different and here's why.

38
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,339
I mean, provide some provide personal touch to me because, again, I don't get to sit down and talk to everybody, 200 or 500 words.

39
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,379
I mean, that's a page, page and a half. My goal is to respond to the best of my ability.

40
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,780
There's about 20, 25 people in my class. I will try my best to respond to your your reflections.

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,740
It might be just a Hey, I thought that was interesting, but I want to read them all.

42
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,490
I want to kind of understand where you're coming from, if you're willing and if you bring up something that we might be able to bring into class,

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,499
I will respond and say, Hey, can we potentially bring this up when we're discussing X, Y or Z?

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,480
Or could we could I use this example that you found from New York Times or something like that?

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,769
And that would be great. And if you want to lead or participate in that conversation, even better, I'm not going to force you to.

46
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,070
But that's the level of engagement that I'd like to have with these assignments.

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,930
They're a fairly large chunk of the grade, so don't ignore them.

48
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,350
Please. You can start to respond.

49
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:30,930
Even this week I'm asking that you respond a week mostly so that the topic is still fresh in my mind when I'm responding to you.

50
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,730
If if it doesn't always work out that way. That's all right.

51
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,780
Give me a little bit of heads up at the top. Say, I know we discussed earlier the childhood injury in week three, week six now,

52
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,139
but this is why I think it's relevant to these are the connections that I'm making.

53
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,630
This is my favorite paper. But by and large, I'm asking if you want to do something on early childhood injury.

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,100
This would be a great way to do it.

55
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,790
So it's going to be you kind of do the following week and the exposure six figures and the purpose is in response to the.

56
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,709
Class material. Respondent speakers go to the panel and actually confirmed that whatever is going to be the go to

57
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,600
or go watch the video from Ideas for healthy cities respond to that whatever it's going to be.

58
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,630
So a little confession of mine. Let's see here. Candice.

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,480
But questions, comments.

60
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,600
Concerns. It could get six or.

61
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,180
I don't know how much you're reviewing. You do right now for the last week, but we started to get into theory.

62
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,030
We started to get into conceptual models. There was a lot of slides. It was like 70 slide, you know, so we didn't make it through everything.

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,060
We can kind of finish off these last couple of models of injury.

64
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,520
And before Sean joins us in about ten, 15 minutes, conceptual models, again,

65
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,020
we're taking theoretical ideas and operationalize them into three constructs.

66
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,000
This is a report that I'm writing right now.

67
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:12,260
It is an examination of a group of substance using kind of adolescence and emerging adults ten years ago who are now parents.

68
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,399
And so we're looking at the intergenerational transmission of substance use in the state

69
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,690
of Michigan following the introduction of our recreational cannabis use law in 2018.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:32,150
The idea or my questions of interest were whether or not having a law like this is sparking conversations between parents and their children,

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,930
having billboards now that say, you know, medicine, sky and whatever else for you to buy these products,

72
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,380
like alcohol, like other forms of advertising,

73
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,729
might change the way that parents and children are talking about marijuana might change

74
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,360
the way that people are feeling about the risks or perceived risks of marijuana,

75
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,660
all of those pieces. So thinking a little bit more broadly about just the individual, the child,

76
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:04,040
the kind of social or family level child parent interactions, but then all that kind of context that's happening around it right now,

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,370
whether or not that's again, influencing directly their their parents, who all had a history of substance use in their past,

78
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,850
95% of which were using marijuana, but some 30, 40% having other substances as well.

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,860
But then also this kind of more mechanistic thing to get to what's happening with our children.

80
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,080
And those children can be anywhere from 5 to 18 thinking about those conversations, how they could look a little bit differently.

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:37,610
So the goal here of a conceptual model is to try my best to convey a complex set of ideas and a relatively simple descriptive picture.

82
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,900
Right? We talked about direct effects.

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,540
We talked about mediated effects, right?

84
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,470
So all these influences that might inform the family environment, which in turn inform the the child outcomes,

85
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,870
is there a direct relationship between these two and how do we kind of conceptualize or how do

86
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,060
we operationalize these different broad constructs into things that we can actually measure?

87
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,590
You can see I did this with some of this specific data that we already had about the parents.

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,910
I could have done this within I conceptual model to try to increase clarity, etc.

89
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:18,230
But this is this is my best depiction of, again, what I'm hoping to do with this study or what we did with this study.

90
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,410
Unfortunately, I write about. Here COVID hit.

91
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,950
So as much fun as it is, trying to get to talk to parents and children last couple of years has had some implications.

92
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:40,350
But that's my conception. Good luck with it.

93
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,570
Any questions? Any questions about these? I can't remember if I ask you to do one for your final product or your final project or not.

94
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,200
But if you're okay with these ideas or conceptual models, again,

95
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,580
I think if you're talking mechanistically, which we usually do in conceptual models, is the way to go.

96
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,330
Good, good, good. All right, let's see here. So we already talked a little bit about interventions.

97
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,890
Why did I show you these again? Logic models. You done logic models?

98
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,260
I think I had noted heads last week. But I do like the idea that you I mean,

99
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,600
if you're not going to use your conceptual model to be a little more specific about how you're

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,420
going to operationalize constructs or activities that are related to your project or your program,

101
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,840
it's forcing you to find that kind of 1 to 1 correspondence between the activities,

102
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,110
the things that you actually do, and some of the countable outputs, right?

103
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,240
The number of times, the number of the things distributed, the number of people trained,

104
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,489
all of those different things moving to kind of well short, intermediate.

105
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,430
If you want to add long term outcomes, it's a different way of representing the theory of change.

106
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,920
It's a nicer way than a conceptual model or a theoretical model to talk about some of

107
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,970
the specific things that you think are necessary for your program to be successful.

108
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,280
So if you are thinking about asking for funding, if you are thinking about talking to your stakeholders for the very first time,

109
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,810
what do they need to know in terms of how this program works,

110
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,990
what this program needs, what we can show, what we can measure to assess whether or not it's implemented well,

111
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,590
what we can measure to assess whether or not we're starting to make change.

112
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,000
And then ultimately, if we do everything well with our facility, if we can monitor all that process.

113
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:35,290
Where do we. Where do we think we're going to get to in the long term? I bet you you've done this a couple of times in different classes.

114
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,880
I bet you think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got this. I'm working with a foundation right now.

115
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,290
The very first thing I'm going to do is to ask them to help me fill in a logic model.

116
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,360
Tell me how your program works.

117
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,410
And from that, after I understand how that program works and what you think it's going to do, if we can start to tabulate something like this,

118
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:01,270
I can develop the intervention design or I can develop the evaluation design, or I can help you monitor that implementation.

119
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,749
Right. That's kind of our at least my role as a scientist with an injury prevention science scientist.

120
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,130
Right. I'm helping them think through. Great. You already know what you want to do.

121
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:20,770
You want it. You know where you're going to get. Let me help you fill in this minutia so that we can figure out how we can,

122
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,260
you know, have, you know, smart objectives, outcomes, wherever it's going to be,

123
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,309
something that we can measure so that we can assess some sort of theory that's going to

124
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,540
drive us from activities to the the short term and then ultimately long term outcomes.

125
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:41,050
So again, sorry if you've done this before, but don't give up on our little, you know, little engines that could logic models here.

126
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:48,910
It doesn't have to be super, super complex, but it's a step beyond just your conceptual model to getting to to very specific and

127
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,110
tangible changes that might be happening and still kind of capture the same ideas.

128
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,979
Okay. So the I think the prevailing theory around injury prevention that I want to talk

129
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,310
about in the reading that I gave you last week was Around the Head is Matrix. But before that, just kind of spontaneously popped into existence.

130
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:17,320
There were a couple of different theories around injury related intervention, both of which.

131
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,900
So here's one the three days of intervention.

132
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,360
This is, I forget the name of this model, too, but still capturing the same ideas that we're not just talking about the individual.

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,410
We're not just talking about the mechanism of injury.

134
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,150
And we're not just talking about the environment. All three of these things are kind of interrelated.

135
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,080
With this model, the idea is here against the mechanism of injury.

136
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,880
Here's the kind of person, person interaction and education that we might be able to do to help somebody avoid some of this injury.

137
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,830
Enforcement would be kind of the policies and contextual features that are kind of contributing.

138
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,780
I'm showing you these just because they kind of come together and realize that people don't operate in a vacuum.

139
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,110
Similarly here, people don't operate in a vacuum. And so that's a message I'd given you before.

140
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,640
Here's the hands matrix.

141
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:17,920
Look, I think it's so cool that you can take most injury an injury problem and start to populate a table that looks a little bit like this.

142
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Right. So my favorite piece of it is this.

143
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:29,200
It's asking you to think about what's happening before, at the time of the injury and following the injury.

144
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,420
Right. And from there, we can think through how we are going to map on to components of our program or recovery if necessary.

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,040
Right. It talks about the host, which is going to be the the individual who is either injured or if there's a if it's an intentional piece,

146
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:52,750
if there's a perpetrator as well. So we can think about who's either, you know, creating the injury or who who is this has happened to.

147
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,610
In this case, we're talking about driving.

148
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,570
And so the host here is somebody who is at risk for a car accident.

149
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,230
Right. So we're thinking about somebody who is at risk for a car accident.

150
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:13,160
And we can start to fill in a little bit of that before at the time of and after they should.

151
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,270
How are you? I'm good. How are you? Very, very well. Everyone.

152
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,959
Dr. Schwarzenegger. Hi, everyone. Dr. Sharon is there.

153
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,660
But I know we are talking through the heads of Matrix, but we are excited to hear a little bit about implementation,

154
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,510
science and how it could be implemented in the field of injury prevention.

155
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,280
Okay, great. I see you've heard a lot of talk. You want to pull some slides over?

156
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,609
What's the I mean, I'm happy to, but I'm also happy to just talk chats.

157
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:47,280
If you guys have questions that you want to just talk about, okay, whatever is kind of most convenient and feel free to finish up what I think about.

158
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,920
So this is being your record. Is that okay? Of course. Okay. So come on.

159
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,590
So I think we did have some folks read or at least I posted the articles that you sent along.

160
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,660
Okay. I think part of what we've been talking about in the last two weeks, we began with kind of an overview of theory.

161
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,130
We've talked about how theory can be used to generate a conceptual model, even down to a logic model.

162
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,620
I've talked a little bit about some of the experimental design limitations and how perhaps an R, c,

163
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:24,220
t won't work in the context of injury because it's difficult to prospectively assign someone to a category of injury or treatment.

164
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,520
Right.

165
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:32,740
So then what do we do in a field where we want to have good and rigorous science, but our best gold standard tools might not be available to us.

166
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,500
So that's a little bit of this. So just a little bit of back issues we're dealing with in this area.

167
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,690
Right. But I mean, if perhaps you were just starting off with maybe kind of more of a Q&A,

168
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:51,550
what is implementation science and how is it helping to build the field of, I guess, scientific exploration?

169
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,940
Now, I know it's a big question and then maybe we can connect it to an injury.

170
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,510
That sounds great. Yeah. So I will say I've done a number of different studies across a number of different clinical domains.

171
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,700
My sort of bad joke. You I'm here now. I was the medical school for several years of faculty before that.

172
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,040
And my bad my bad joke was, I don't have a disease. Right?

173
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,480
I kind of work across disease conditions, but I have done a lot of work in that kind of mental and behavioral health space,

174
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,420
just in part because there's so many barriers and so much lack of access to good treatment in those spaces.

175
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,220
And so how many of you are familiar with what implementation science is?

176
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,060
Vaguely. Oh, that's such a tepid response.

177
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,910
I love it. I love it. So this is a pretty fledgling area within the field of health services research, at least as it's been branded.

178
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,360
Right. I mean, this kind of work has been going on for a very long time.

179
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,060
We just didn't really call it anything. And there hasn't been kind of a systematic science developed around it.

180
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,760
But really, the idea is, you know, we learn how to do things better, right?

181
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,770
We published those papers in JAMA, The New England Journal.

182
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:07,990
Right. Whatever other darling might be reading. And then, you know, for a long time, people just kind of sat back and said, great, go do it right.

183
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,850
And believe it or not, that didn't happen. Right. Behavior change is hard.

184
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,430
Organizational change is even harder, arguably.

185
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:24,160
And so about 25 years ago, there was a very famous paper that was published that showed that the average gap.

186
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,400
Right. The average gap in time between something kind of being published.

187
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,970
Right. Saying like, hey, this is the best practice for this kind of injury and for that to be adapt are

188
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,330
adopted kind of broadly as like best clinical practice was about 17 years.

189
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,700
Right. And just to make that even a little bit more impactful, only about 20%.

190
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,110
Right. 20% of practices ever achieved. Right. Broad scale adoption.

191
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,800
So, you know, you have like 17 years and kind of the best case scenario.

192
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,269
And so NIH said, hey, let's try to fix this, right?

193
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,040
Let's try to bridge this sort of, you know, research to practice gap and make it a little bit more efficient.

194
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,100
Right. Make sure that people are getting access to these high quality, you know, best evidence based practices.

195
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,649
So, you know, my work, my background is actually in organizational sociology, right?

196
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,880
So I'm a sociologist who kind of came to health services research as part of my postdoc.

197
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,560
And, you know, we've said, like, how do we test and develop and figure out how to best support, right.

198
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,279
The kind of widespread adoption. Right. So providers.

199
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,540
Right. In practices actually saying I'm going to treat this patient with a as opposed to be.

200
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,229
Right. How do we do that on kind of a broad scale? Right.

201
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:41,620
So sort of at the hospital system level, at the state level, the national level we're talking about like VA policy.

202
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,660
Right. And yeah, that's that's kind of the big picture, right, for the work that I do.

203
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,280
So I do a lot of what we call implementation trials.

204
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,970
Or you guys read the article about the hybrid trials, hybrid implementation effectiveness trials, and we talk about that a.

205
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,980
Not yet. Not yet. Okay. So.

206
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,730
So. Well, we can. We can talk more about that, too.

207
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:13,710
But essentially, when I do a randomized trial, right, I don't randomize people to treatment or control.

208
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,290
I randomized people to implementation strategy or implementation strategy.

209
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,760
B, Right. Where implementation strategy A might be, you know,

210
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,999
we're going to give the provider or the entire hospital system access to a bunch of educational modules on a website and implementation strategy.

211
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,570
We might be we're going to do that and we're also going to give you some pay for performance dollars.

212
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,270
Right. We're going to give you a financial incentive. Right, to do this. And then we test and we see which one does that.

213
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,190
Right? Which one does better. So that's kind of like my big picture overview.

214
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,340
Do we have questions at this point and how can I help fill in gaps? Yeah.

215
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,250
How do you decide what? Like what? How do you decide on what strategy? Well, that's a good question.

216
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,860
Such a good question. So, you know, it's always interesting to see a field kind of develop.

217
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,180
Right. And as you might expect, this field is sort of new enough.

218
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,330
15 years, really. But like we've had a journal that's been around for a lot of what we've been doing.

219
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,190
Initially it has been cataloging things. Right. We've been kind of like librarians for implementation sites.

220
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,190
Right. So we collect, you know, what are the big barriers and facilitators of the implementation efforts.

221
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,450
Right. And that's given us a number of different frameworks that you'll commonly to use in the field.

222
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,410
The other one has been writing, What are these implementation strategies?

223
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,330
Right. And we've come up with about 73 of them so far that have been cataloged and defined.

224
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,810
And this is actually a fairly recent effort, like in the last five years or so,

225
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,730
that they've kind of published like the definitive paper, that these are your implementation strategies.

226
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
And so now the question is, well, how do we do that?

227
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,520
Right. Just like you said now in some cases. Right.

228
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,140
So ideally, what would the ideal situation be? The ideal situation would be right.

229
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:08,800
We go to a site, we figure out what are the things, right that are preventing the adoption of this particular practice.

230
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,720
And then we find we identify the strategies. Right. That are going to actually address those barriers.

231
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,150
Right. And if we think about our logic model, right. Our logic models for implementation are that.

232
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,709
Right. It's thinking about what is the strategy, what is the mechanism, right?

233
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,890
And how is that mechanism going to address the barrier? And then how is that going to lead to our outcome, which in this case.

234
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,720
Right, is not usually not usually, at least initially a patient level outcome.

235
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,170
Right.

236
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,250
It's rather that sort of implementation outcome, which might be provider level or it might be site level or it might be, you know, something else.

237
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:48,340
Right. In reality. Right. We are constrained by a number of other factors.

238
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,230
Right. So, of course, you know, usually cost is a big constraint.

239
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,400
So we don't necessarily have the kitchen sink. We don't have the resources to throw everything at people.

240
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,420
We also have what we call sort of just capacity issues. Right.

241
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:07,600
So it would be super fantastic in a lot of cases to be able to pair providers with like a coach that's

242
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,179
an expert in this evidence based practice who can sort of work them through all of this stuff.

243
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,740
All the barriers they might be, may, might be approaching, but we just don't have the people for that, right?

244
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,160
We don't have the sort of purveyors of those implementation strategies.

245
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,850
So, you know, we kind of try to do a hybrid approach, right, which is where we identify what the big barriers are.

246
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,350
And then we try to build up our own capacity or make use of the existing capacity

247
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,850
to identify implementation strategies that kind of fit that mechanism the best.

248
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,980
So it's not a great answer to your question, but you're hitting exactly on where the field is right now.

249
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,980
Right. Which is to do a better job of mapping that out and then figuring out how to sort of test that as well.

250
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,800
Right. Yeah, please.

251
00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:01,230
So when you're like when you're deciding to do these like two approaches and what population would be worth doing,

252
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,920
I would assume you would work in a city or one space.

253
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,239
How do you know that? That's the thing you should go after.

254
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,490
Are you talking to the community or is this based on like what's happening in the hospital?

255
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,240
Like, how do you where are you? How do you how do we decide which of the many, many gaps in this stuff to actually tackle?

256
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,850
Yeah. Now that's a really great question. So it depends a little bit on the context you're working in, right.

257
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,880
We talk a lot about and this is part of the reason why I've gotten interested in this field as an organizational sociologist.

258
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,920
Right, is because change right and sort of precursors to change happen at different levels depending on the context that you're in.

259
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,540
So two examples of this.

260
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:53,820
One is I'm part of an initiative here at Michigan Medicine called Improve, which is the Michigan program to enhance program and value enhancement.

261
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,600
I believe something like that. I should really know what it stands for. So that's about it.

262
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,210
But the idea there is that we essentially work with our clinical champions,

263
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,060
our leadership at Michigan Medicine, to identify where these gaps are in sort of value based care.

264
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:15,480
Right. So that might be things like, you know, overuse of imaging or overuse of testing, right?

265
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,480
And so we then go back to the clinical guidelines and we say, like, you know, which of these many clinical documents that are not being adopted.

266
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:28,410
Right. Are we going to focus on that? Now, the other thing to consider and so in that case, we usually needed like strong in a health care system,

267
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,860
you usually need big, you know, top level buy in, right.

268
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,430
Because they're usually the ones that are footing the bill, right.

269
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,720
If we're going to go in and pay for provider education or some kind of additional support on top of that,

270
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,580
they're usually the ones that we need to have the buy in from right now in other settings.

271
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,740
So for example, I've done quite a bit of work in schools, right, in particular around mental health.

272
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,859
We just finished because guys, I think that was one of the papers I sent along with this trial where we looked at trying

273
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,940
to implement cognitive behavioral therapy in 94 high schools across state of Michigan.

274
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,480
Right. In that case, that was really about school mental health,

275
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,670
preschool professionals coming to our our partner organization, which is called Trails and saying we need help.

276
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,270
Right. We have students that are not getting access to mental health services.

277
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:22,379
What can we do to fix this problem? And Trails was the one that said, you know, cognitive behavioral therapy is an intervention.

278
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,930
That is a treatment. Right. So it's not sort of like social emotional learning or, you know, mental health first aid.

279
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:34,500
It's something that actually is targeted as a treatment but is sort of easy and manual enough that people

280
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,230
with limited background write in clinical training should be able to deliver it with high fidelity,

281
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,220
right? And so it's kind of a good like intervention that help to fill that gap.

282
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,010
Not entirely, but it's kind of a good place to start.

283
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:53,030
So that was in that case, it was much more of a bottom up approach where the providers on the ground said, we need help.

284
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:01,909
Help us figure out what to implement in the states to fill this gap. Yeah.

285
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,540
At least they're the ones who said they need help or your loved ones identified.

286
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:16,180
Another fantastic question. Right. So in that case, they were the ones that really came to us and said, right, we need help in this space.

287
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,230
And that was certainly something that implementation science is dealing with.

288
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,240
Right. Is this sort of like do we go ground up or do we go top down?

289
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,280
Right. I sort of joke. You guys are all way too young to have been around for like the Reagan administration.

290
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,030
But there was this joke in the Reagan administration that was like, we're the government, we're here to help.

291
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,379
And I sometimes say, like, that's kind of true for a politician, since we're like, we're the implementation scientists.

292
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,530
We're here to help. Right. And like, nobody really wants us there. Right.

293
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:48,340
We're not helpful. We're not useful. And so we have to figure out, right as a field, how do we balance this?

294
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,610
Right. How do we make sure that we are leading the way, trying to encourage change in a positive direction,

295
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,000
while at the same time making sure that we're attentive to our communities?

296
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:06,460
Right. We all know the change fatigue, especially right now, is incredibly real and especially as we try to embrace equity.

297
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:14,500
Right. At understandings of, you know, not just implementing overall and making sure we're implementing the right thing in the right communities,

298
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,720
that, you know, having that kind of buy and having that sort of ground based support for these initiatives.

299
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,720
It's going to be a nonstarter if we don't have it right.

300
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:30,070
Yeah, particularly with that note on change, do you ever run into issues where you're trying to look at something?

301
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:37,840
But there isn't necessarily an implementation method that is currently existing that's really hitting at everything you're trying to get at.

302
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,040
So like there's a problem that exists. We recognize that there's a gap.

303
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,760
We recognize that there is some kind of practice that can help to fill that gap.

304
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,290
But we don't think a strategy currently exists that would sort of address all of the barriers.

305
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,280
So, I mean, we run into this a lot. I wouldn't say that.

306
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,540
I wouldn't say that the strategy doesn't exist. We all know what the answer is.

307
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,870
It's just a matter of actually getting that answer fulfilled.

308
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,650
Right. And I would say this happens a lot in our like our social sector.

309
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,159
Right. If we're talking about things for like juvenile justice. Right.

310
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:16,660
Things for schools. Anybody want to guess what the biggest barrier there are to sort of doing better practices, providing better care?

311
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,700
Yeah. Having people for work. Yeah. I mean, money.

312
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Right. Money. So we know, right.

313
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:32,630
That if we had better staffing ratios in some of these places, if there was more money for training, if there was more money for rooms.

314
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,370
Right. To be able to do some of the stuff in. Right.

315
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,800
Just, you know, a better you know, a better funding right across the board.

316
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,560
But that would provide a much better basis for providing the kind of care that's necessary.

317
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,280
So, you know, that's the situation that comes up most commonly. Right.

318
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,080
And again, we're seeing this even in hospital settings right now, the staffing ratios and things like that.

319
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,040
Right. That are, you know, Michigan Medicine is dealing with, you know, limited staff.

320
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,820
And so that, of course, creates a problem if you're trying to look at adding more things right, to staff capacity.

321
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:13,569
Now, there are ways that we can try to work with that. For example, a lot of it relates to sort of messaging, right?

322
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,450
If we can convince people that, hey, guess what, if you invest in a it's actually going to make be downstream,

323
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,110
more cost effective or potentially even cost savings.

324
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,210
You know, there are ways to kind of try to build that case, but it is certainly more challenging.

325
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:37,270
Yeah. There was a hand back there, too. Yeah. You mentioned earlier that a lot of what you've been doing is cataloging implementation science methods.

326
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:45,070
Yeah, I was wondering how much of that is looking at like grassroots community implementation and

327
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,950
kind of in conjunction with some of the questions that were asked about how do you take the

328
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:55,390
top down versus bottom up approach and how much is looking at stuff that is in research and

329
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,190
publishing academia as opposed to stuff that people are doing on the ground constantly?

330
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,049
Yeah, that is a great question, right.

331
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:10,030
Because as you point out, although researchers are new to this new to this practitioners, this is what they've been doing right for a long time.

332
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:17,260
And so trying to make sure that we are that we are both properly conveying the work that's already been done and also acknowledging.

333
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,170
Right. That work is incredibly important to the field.

334
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,600
I don't know that we quite figured out the balance yet, which is, you know, not uncommon for for academics.

335
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,640
But I will say that the people that develop sort of companionable strategies,

336
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,710
it's called the Eric the something revised implementation strategy compendium.

337
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,799
They did pay a lot of attention to the things that those organizations on the ground were doing

338
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,330
and the methods that they were using in terms of trying to get these things implemented.

339
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,570
Yeah, it's a great question. Yeah.

340
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,530
So after you implement like you're testing two things, what happens to the one that doesn't do well with the device that it tossed away?

341
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,680
I love that you ask this question because it actually lets me talk about one of the three designs that I do in this field.

342
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:10,340
It's a little bit unique, and this is called a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial.

343
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:19,970
Right. And essentially a smart study. Right. Is a type of trial design that was developed not for purposes of like straight up evaluation.

344
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Right. So you have your test group in your control group or rather for something that we consider we call optimization.

345
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:32,420
Right. So why is implementation science kind of ripe for these important for these sort of optimization trials?

346
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,040
Well, because we have a lot of decades of empirical work.

347
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,970
Right, that show that not doing anything new is not a work.

348
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,320
Right. I mean, again, remember what our key focus would be in this kind of a trial?

349
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,830
We don't change anything. Right. Or maybe we do something like super low level and we just know that that's not going to move the needle.

350
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,510
Right. That's not actually going to change things. And so oftentimes what we end up doing instead, right,

351
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,880
instead of having your typical like control and treatment hour is we do either a comparative effectiveness assessment.

352
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,540
So I do strategy versus strategy B or the ones that we really like to do is we try to

353
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,070
develop what we call adaptive interventions or adaptive implementation strategies.

354
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,640
And the idea behind this is, you know, we have these strategies.

355
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,910
Some of them are more expensive, more intensive.

356
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,020
They require, you know, more training. They require more money.

357
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,730
And really. Right. If you think about it, we're trying to scale these things up, right?

358
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,400
Statewide, nationwide. We want to make them as cost effective but also as efficient as possible.

359
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,560
Right. And especially not effective. So we oftentimes will do what we call kind of like a stepped care model in implementation where.

360
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,680
Right. We'll start people off with kind of a low level strategy. We'll give them a little bit of time.

361
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,980
Right. Then we'll see if it's working or not. If it's not working, then we'll step them up to something a little bit higher.

362
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,990
Shot going again. Is that okay? Well, maybe we need to switch them to a different intensive strategy.

363
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,469
Right. Is that right? And so, you know,

364
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:09,500
a lot of where my work is and trying to figure out how do we kind of build those scalable models that show that they work really well.

365
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,880
Right. But are also able to be tailored. Right.

366
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,700
Able to be adaptive to both how sites are doing under their current support,

367
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,530
but also just like the different types of sites and barriers that are out there.

368
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,290
Right. So I'll give you an example. This was from our school based implementation of CBT study.

369
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,600
And everybody got this sort of like basic level strategy, which we call replicating effective programs.

370
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,080
It's a strategy we use for basically all of our studies.

371
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,630
And, you know, since we're in you know, we're near Detroit, we often talk about this in terms of like bad car metaphors.

372
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,960
Right. And so, like, rap is like you're Ford, right?

373
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:53,150
Rap is like your reliable. Right. Like gets the job done in some cases, but, you know, relatively inexpensive.

374
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,700
Right. And pretty easily scalable. So you can think about rap as basically like your manual life intervention.

375
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:05,090
So everybody got access to a beautiful website that had really great CBT instructions and lesson plans and things like that on it.

376
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,010
We gave them a one day in-person training, right, in CBT to get some hands on practice.

377
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,010
And then after that they got like a phone number in their back pocket, but they could call if they got stuck in a newsletter.

378
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,250
So, you know, cheap, right? Scalable. And it's going to work, right for some of our school professionals.

379
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,379
Then we randomize, right?

380
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:31,760
So after training, we give them a little bit of time and then we randomized everybody to either add on to all 94 schools to either add on.

381
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,100
Right. A coach who would focus on building their CBT skills, their CBT fidelity, their self efficacy with respect to their CBT delivery.

382
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,610
Right. Or to stick with just the training program. Right.

383
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,330
And of even three weeks and at eight weeks, they told us two things.

384
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:53,240
They told us how much CBT are they delivering? And they told us, are there any barriers, adverse school.

385
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,050
Right. That they think are going to keep them from being able to continue delivering CBT?

386
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,240
Right. So maybe there's a principal that thinks that doing mental health in a school setting is a really bad idea.

387
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,150
Right. And there are certainly those principles that are out.

388
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,140
If they either had not delivered a certain amount of CBT or told us that there were these barriers that were in place.

389
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:19,790
Right. Whether they got coaching or not in that first randomization, we randomized all of those slower responders.

390
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,759
That's what we call them. Right. So then add on. Right.

391
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,800
Facilitation, which is a sort of strategy, organizational focused, how to basically work with someone who like knows CBT really well,

392
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,040
knows school settings really well and you kind of gameplan, right?

393
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,130
Like here's the organization they're encountering, what are we going to do about it?

394
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,170
Right. And kind of help you work through those problems and out of that on or they didn't.

395
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,680
Right. And so what we end up with is we actually end up with four different right sequences of strategies that we can compare head to head and.

396
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,770
Which ones worked the best. Right. And anybody had a chance to look at the paper or read the paper.

397
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,030
So which one work best? No. Facilitation? Yeah.

398
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,450
The one where we gave facilitation, it was training only.

399
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,050
And then we increased we added facilitation for those schools that were slower responders.

400
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,740
Right. That was the one that sort of led to the most CBT delivery.

401
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,490
Right. And so that's the one that's kind of being scaled up at this point in time.

402
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,640
Trails actually got money from the state of Michigan this year in Governor Whitmer's budget to scale this up statewide.

403
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,059
Right. So that's what's happening next, which is pretty cool. Right.

404
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,390
Which is pretty cool now. So great question.

405
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,370
And, you know, it's certainly something that we're sort of open to other city designs, right, to think about how to do that.

406
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:37,160
But one of the things I love about doing this work is that pretty much everybody gets something right.

407
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,180
We very rarely say no. You know, we're just not going to give you any additional help.

408
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,220
Why? Well, because we have enough data, right. That shows that that's probably not going to lead anywhere.

409
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,630
And so it's a great chance for people to get a little bit more assistance and help in doing this.

410
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,990
But the other thing that I would caution is that, you know,

411
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,430
for a long time I would go and I would give talks about these protocols that we had and people would say, are you sure this is ethical?

412
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,370
Right. Like, why aren't we just throwing everything that we have right at all of these different sites?

413
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,680
And, you know, our results are amazing. Study like a school by study show why we don't do that.

414
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,940
Why some people are more conservative than others.

415
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,350
Yeah, exactly right. Some people don't need that. Right. Some people believe that.

416
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,880
In fact,

417
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,020
what we found was the coaching intervention that we deployed as part of the ACE study was that it actually decreased CBT delivery in some cases.

418
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,480
Right. And we don't know exactly why what happened there. We're working through some qualitative data to help us figure that out right now.

419
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,960
But this is actually the second study in a row that we've done that has shown that,

420
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,140
you know, more important, implementation support is not always better.

421
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,190
And especially when we're working with, you know, people that are in public health,

422
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,480
including mental health, who are trying to do this right out of the goodness of their heart.

423
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:57,380
Right. Asking them to do 12 other things to help them implement this thing in addition to implementing the thing.

424
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,879
Right. Can become really burdensome. Right, and can make it seem like more of an effort.

425
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,200
But it actually used to be so figuring out kind of how to get them to the help of a

426
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,129
need without giving them too much help is a lot of our sort of problem in our in our.

427
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:17,620
Our challenge. Yeah. Other questions.

428
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,219
Yeah. Can you elaborate more like the discussions or goals you have once you get to the national policy level,

429
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,700
particularly since when you said needs are different across the state.

430
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,360
So. Yeah. Right.

431
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:39,910
So, you know, this is something that I or this is, again, kind of an even burgeoning kind of niche within implementation.

432
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:46,990
Science is figuring out how do we draw this line right between local or statewide initiatives,

433
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,820
especially when we have good, good evidence of support and, you know, funding.

434
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,850
Right. For what sort of policy initiatives are for these kinds of things? Obviously, there's a lot of challenges there.

435
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:03,820
Right. One of the biggest being that funding for many of these sort of social programs is, of course, the state wide thing.

436
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:12,790
Right. And so, you know, so right now we have a study, for example, trying to implement a collaborative care model for serious mental illness.

437
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:18,370
So bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder in behavioral health homes, right.

438
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,900
In Michigan and Maryland. So we're partnering with Hopkins on this.

439
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,760
You know, you hear behavioral health problems and you think, okay, right. I know what that is here.

440
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:35,590
And then you go over to Maryland and you learn that behavioral health homes have a completely different infrastructure funding set of expectations,

441
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,980
right? Set of, you know, resources available. And so, you know, I have the same name, but they're very different.

442
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:42,760
Right.

443
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:51,520
And so thinking about policy implications, oftentimes the first thing is like what level of policy changes even sort of reasonable or feasible here?

444
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:58,299
Right. And I will say that this is a place where we are increasingly becoming interested, right.

445
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:04,120
In in trying to draw these lines and figure out, you know, how do we do the sort of feedback loop in the most efficient way possible?

446
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,400
I don't know that we've quite gotten there yet.

447
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:14,050
I will tell you that when the Trails program was doing its sort of, you know, lobbying that it had to do to get this line item in there.

448
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,809
You know, on the budgets for Michigan, you know, they were told explicitly like this can't just be cost effective.

449
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:25,720
This has to be cost savings. Right. If you want the funding to continue, you have to show us, right, three years from now,

450
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,590
where are we not spending this money because we're spending this money on school mental health.

451
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,760
Right. So, you know, you end up you start off with your kind of purview of like this particular landscape and this particular program.

452
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,770
And you eventually realize that you remember the policy states. Right. But like, they're going to have to figure out how this fits in.

453
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:48,850
Right, to like a number of other programs and situations, which, again, isn't uncommon right in these cases,

454
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:54,550
but it's something that I think a lot of implementation scientists were kind of weren't prepared for what we're thinking about about this.

455
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,420
So it's a great question. It's something that if you're interested in, I would say there is right now things that are just kind of getting off the

456
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,600
ground to help us think about build better models for doing this kind of stuff.

457
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,290
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, money is obviously the big thing here.

458
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:16,810
Have you done any trials where you give money to the right money to use that their their will versus another group resources.

459
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,889
So what would you willing to buy is a resources here would be like like help doing something as opposed to like, hey, here's some money.

460
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:30,070
Go, go figure out how to do it yourself. So we haven't done that in a trial context, but we are.

461
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,290
So I work with a lot of the CQ ies here on campus.

462
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,190
If you guys heard about what these cookies are. Let's see if I can explain this in like the simplest way possible.

463
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,920
So Blue Cross Blue Shield, right. Is the, you know, the big insurer in the state.

464
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,970
And essentially. Right. If you talk to any of the people at the hospital, they will say that they do not pay hospitals enough.

465
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,530
They do not reimburse hospitals.

466
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,780
And so the way that they try to make up that balance, because, of course, Blue Cross Blue Shield is, you know, a nonprofit.

467
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:08,080
Right. Is they do. These are collaborative quality improvement projects where hospitals across the state come together and they say,

468
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,470
hey, we are not doing this thing well enough. Right?

469
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,180
We're all going to try to do it better.

470
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:21,970
And then Blue Cross Blue Shield gives them incentives and gives them pay for performance incentives to try to basically implement these practices.

471
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,200
Right. So it's a it's a fantastic right for somebody like me. This is like a dream scenario.

472
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,980
Right. Because you already have like the sites that are there, the initiatives designed.

473
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,160
And all we have to do is figure out how can we manipulate this to learn something. Right.

474
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:39,850
So your question is a great one. And we just had a study funded that's going into the graphic into the field,

475
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,440
hopefully like six months or so where we're working with our surgical collaborative

476
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:51,850
on trying to improve sort of patient optimization before hernia surgeries.

477
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:58,389
Right. So hernia surgeries are, you know, very popular, minimal will not popular is the wrong word.

478
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,290
Right. Because what's the popular surgery? Very commonly used.

479
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,400
Right. Minimally invasive surgery that we know, you know, if you do things like, you know, stop smoking before then.

480
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,860
Right. There's a much lower chance of having, you know, pre surgical or post-surgical.

481
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:24,890
Bad things happen. Right. And so places like Michigan have implemented new protocols for trying to essentially get patients to certain,

482
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,620
you know, criteria before they do the surgery. Right. You know, the thing about hernias, they're not usually sensitive.

483
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,710
So you need to wait a month or two, right? You can do that. So what we're doing in the study is another smart study, right?

484
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,000
What we're doing the study is we're actually giving everybody access to a new set of pay

485
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,050
for performance dollars that are focused on implementing these optimization criteria.

486
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:54,080
Right. And then if they fail to meet that criteria with this sort of financial incentive, then we're going to randomize them to additional resources.

487
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,979
Right. So it's not quite the question that you're asking, which is a really cool study.

488
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,290
And I've got to think about if we can figure it out, if we could do that somewhere. But, you know, but it would it gets at that same idea.

489
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,020
Right. Is giving more money, right. Financial incentives in people's pockets enough or do we actually have to give them.

490
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,500
Right the help in terms of addressing the barriers, developing the skills.

491
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,220
Right. Holding their hand a little bit. Right on top of or in lieu of that?

492
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:24,680
Yeah. Have you ever had a strategy that, like, it seems to work and it's finding that they like this stuff?

493
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,710
Oh, a couple of, a couple of good examples of them, actually.

494
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:38,000
So the first one was we did a study called ADAPT, which was our first implementation, smart study.

495
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:45,560
And this was trying to implement, again, a collaborative care model in community mental health practices in Michigan and Colorado.

496
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:53,989
Right. And so the idea with this is really it's about like providing a cheap and efficient self-management intervention for patients,

497
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,230
again, with with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.

498
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,990
Right. And, you know, we talked to, like all of these clinic leaders.

499
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,490
They all thought, this is amazing, right? This is the best thing on Earth. We're really trying to do this.

500
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:13,100
And the strategies that we offered were actually two different kind of flavors of this facilitation idea.

501
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,480
One was external facilitation. Right. So you have a phone call with me.

502
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,600
We talk about your barriers. We strategize, come up with your game plan, keep checking in right until everything is done.

503
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,880
The other one was actually that plus what we called an internal facilitator.

504
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:34,490
And the idea of the internal facilitator was, you know, I'm going to be on the phone, but you're going to be in your clinic.

505
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,310
Right. And I'm actually going to buy out 20% of your time, right?

506
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:45,139
20% of your time. And your new job for that 20% of your time is going to be to work on implementing this collaborative human right.

507
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,850
So you're going to be, you know, talking to me,

508
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:52,130
but you're also going to be using your time to interface with leadership and go to meetings and talk to people on the ground.

509
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,130
So that sounds like a genius idea. Right. And everybody thought if we do this head to head comparison.

510
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,170
Right. External plus external plus internal. Right. But the second one is bit of low ever getting out of the water.

511
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,120
And it didn't. Right. It was like a massive, massive failure.

512
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,880
Anybody want to guess why? What do you think?

513
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,310
So the basic idea, right, is that you as the internal facilitator, your paycheck doesn't change.

514
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:31,160
Right. You're still getting, say, the pay to pay the same amount. But now your clinic managers come to you and say, like, oh, and guess what?

515
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,190
You get to do this, too. Right. And so if they didn't do it right, they didn't do it.

516
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:43,640
And so the internal and not only that, but it sort of made them less interested, right, in picking up the phone when I call you.

517
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,090
Right. And I said, hey, let's talk about this. And you're like, I don't want to talk about this.

518
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,440
This isn't my job. Right. But that got 12 million other things that I chose to be doing.

519
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:58,040
And so when it came to actually implementing our implementation strategy, which had been done,

520
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,210
I should point out this had been done really well in a number of settings in the VA.

521
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,020
Right. And the VA, which has a very different structure. Right.

522
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,890
Than any other healthcare system in the U.S. and it worked really well there.

523
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,700
When it came time to sort of doing this in. Right, our CMH is our lower resource settings, right?

524
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,480
Where our staffing ratios are an issue. Everybody has 12 million things we're trying to do.

525
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,460
It was an abject failure. Right. And so we learned we learned a really important lesson there.

526
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,780
And then I would say the coaching strategy that we did for ACE was a similar story.

527
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,560
Right. Not quite as big of a failure as we as that one was.

528
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,520
But, you know, and we would talk to people afterwards that were assigned to coaching.

529
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:44,120
So, first of all, only about 70% of our school professionals that were assigned to a coach ever had any interaction with that coach.

530
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,790
Right. Ever picked up a phone, answered an email, much less actually had the coach come and do CBT with them.

531
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,470
Right. So that's always a bad sign when you have that sort of low of engagement.

532
00:47:54,890 --> 00:48:00,200
I want to talk to people about the coach and afterwards they said, you know, it was really uncomfortable, right?

533
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,260
Because I suddenly have this new person. I don't know them.

534
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,660
My students don't know them.

535
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:10,970
My students are supposed to be talking to me about this, their mental health struggles or mental health challenges right in front of this new person.

536
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,560
On top of that, that person's job is to correct me when I do CBT wrong.

537
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,340
Right. And as we all know. Right. That can be a very challenging thing to do.

538
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:26,150
Well, right. To correct someone in the context of, you know, delivering the talk or treatment or whatever.

539
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:34,130
So, you know, again, it was interesting because trials have used this coaching model for a number of years and had gotten incredible results from it.

540
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,310
Right. And this speaks, I think, to one of the big challenges of implementation science research right now, which is generalizability.

541
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:49,820
Right, external validity. So the studies that we're doing, trials have recruited schools, right, to do their coaching model to implement CBT.

542
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,470
When we recruited for our study, we recruited schools that wanted to implement CBT.

543
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,610
Right. Those two things are different. Right? Those two things are different.

544
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,770
And so not all of the schools were actually interested in or thought they needed to have a coach there.

545
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,950
And again, it added additional burden. It added additional cost.

546
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:11,630
And so a lot of what we're doing right now is figuring out, well, where did coaching work?

547
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,410
Right. We know that overall it didn't work and improve outcomes.

548
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,400
But there are some schools where it looks like having that coach was really important.

549
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:25,190
And those were typically the schools where the person that was in the study was completely naive to CBT.

550
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,090
Right. Didn't feel like they knew anything about CBT and really needed that person to sit there next to them and help them through this process.

551
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:39,320
If you were somebody that felt like you already knew how to do CBT or that had done CBT before, that person didn't add anything to the equation.

552
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:46,160
Right. So again, this is part of the cool work that we're doing right now is trying to figure out how do we kind of test and refine.

553
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:50,720
Right. Who's getting what kind of support. Yeah, great questions.

554
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,820
So I want to be mindful of your time, but I do have a comment, please.

555
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,330
I do have a couple in there who really kind of next action item type of thing. So first, you mentioned a lot of different implementation frameworks.

556
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,710
If you were to say one or two that you really should know. What with those two frameworks.

557
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,670
Yeah. So can I give three you go for. I'm sorry. I'm going to give three.

558
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,729
So they speak to sort of different parts of the process. Right.

559
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,790
So first of all, you have your kind of determinants frameworks and these are kind of questions of what are the common barriers and facilitators.

560
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,420
Right?

561
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,700
And the one that is most commonly used there is something called cipher or CSIR consolidated framework for implementation research and it gives,

562
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,270
you know, these barriers and facilitators across five different domains. Right.

563
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,499
So it's kind of a checklist.

564
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,780
If I were to go talk to a new site about this implementation effort, they would say, here's what I think the problems are.

565
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,669
Here's what I think is going well for us. And I could literally check these things off right then in the middle.

566
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:49,110
Right. You have Eric, which I already mentioned. That's our compendium of implementation strategies, right?

567
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:52,740
And so again, the idea if we're talking about our logic model is I have my barriers,

568
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,250
I map goes on to implementation strategies that are going to address those.

569
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,910
Right? And I have a little mechanism that says, here's how I think that's going to address them.

570
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:07,380
And the third one would be our outcomes, right? Implementation, as you probably already figured out, is a multifaceted thing.

571
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,280
Right. Am I interested in how much CBT is delivered?

572
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:17,520
Am I interested in how good the CBT is? Deliver it? Am I interested in how many students got access to quality?

573
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,510
Am I understand? How much did their mental health outcomes improve?

574
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,190
Right. These are all important parts of unpacking, right? What's happening as this implementation process unfolds?

575
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,969
And so the common outcomes framework that is used for that is called M, right.

576
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:39,840
And Reading stands for Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation, Fidelity and Maintenance or Sustainment.

577
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,120
Right. So it's getting at those kind of five dimensions of what implementation should achieve ideally.

578
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:54,150
Second question, I'm think back to my Campbell and Stanley does like research design.

579
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:06,570
Yeah. And I don't remember them saying anything about smarter. So like is I tend to develop a working knowledge of the new procedures that are

580
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,630
kind of encompassed with adaptive interventions or having a conversational,

581
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,670
I mean ability to have a conversation with partners about these.

582
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,600
We don't all have access to this early research center that professors in health management policy.

583
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,890
What would you recommend for those who are going to be operating in this field?

584
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:32,450
We'd like to consider contemporary ways that assessing implementation with trials like this for our working under our limited budgets,

585
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:37,740
working with partners who might have may not be as familiar suggestions or or ways for them to learn more.

586
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,100
So I was thinking about like resources here for learning more about this kind of stuff.

587
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,399
It could be resources or even even having that first conversation.

588
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,790
I know these things exist, but you know, folks, well, this isn't an RC, this isn't a quasi experiment design.

589
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,220
Why would we do this? Yeah. Yeah. So there are a number of so, you know, optimization trials are kind of like the big thing that we talk about.

590
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:05,219
But that smarts, right factorial designs are kind of another version of this optimization.

591
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,750
Trials are kind of this big umbrella term, right,

592
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,450
for this thing that we do before we kind of tested in like a typical effectiveness or efficacy trial.

593
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,080
And there are a couple of frameworks that have been developed there.

594
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:20,940
Linda Collins, who's now at NYU, it's really been the one that's published on this the most,

595
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:29,640
which is a plan because she actually calls it the most framework. And anyway, so she has a bunch of like it's like she has a brand new book out.

596
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,760
But if you're interested in learning more about this, you can you can go there.

597
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:40,430
And, you know, if we're talking about like having that conversation, I actually think that in a lot of cases, right,

598
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,260
going to comparative effectiveness are going to like, you know, some of these more optimization kind of focused trials.

599
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:56,279
It's actually a little bit more palatable for people right then than doing a typical RTT because right people will say we don't want to be in a way,

600
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,940
we don't want to be in the control group. Right. Why do we want to be in the control group for this?

601
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,300
Right. And so you can actually pitch them and say there's not going to be a control group.

602
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,870
Right. Everybody is going to get something. Everybody is going to get some kind of help.

603
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,440
And the idea will be then we're going to figure out which kind of help works best.

604
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,940
Right. And so, you know, if you kind of start the conversation there, right.

605
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,590
That's oftentimes, you know, about as much as they kind of need to know if you can.

606
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:25,140
Then later on, like if you're doing a smart trial, where, again, the idea is to adapt right to sort of how things are going in the field.

607
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,690
Again, that can be a little bit of a selling point for you, right?

608
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,670
Because you can say things like, you know, hey, and then after a short amount of time, we're going to check in with you.

609
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,680
Right. And if things aren't going well and you need more help, then we're going to, again, you know, potentially give you more help.

610
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:44,159
Right. And that can be a very effective way of kind of getting people to say, okay, that sounds like a cool idea right now.

611
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,690
Then you have to be a little careful because if you're randomizing, you can't guarantee anybody anything, right?

612
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,500
So that's you know, if you're talking to kind of like your your on. On the ground.

613
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,180
People that are doing the work you want to have conversations with, you know, wonders about this stuff.

614
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,550
That's kind of a different conversation. But nonetheless, there is enough stuff out there.

615
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:07,950
And you know, what we always say when we're writing these grants is like, you know, it's all about the story that you're telling.

616
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,930
Right. It's all about kind of saying we have these different tools that we think work.

617
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,740
We think they might even work better if we do them in combination. Right.

618
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:22,799
But we don't know that yet. Right. And so if you can kind of tell that story in a way that it makes them think, oh, well, obviously, right.

619
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:29,970
We have to test A versus B and C versus D and we have to test if D works better than C, if you're not doing well on, you know, on A.

620
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,140
Right. By the time I get to design, which can look a little complicated, a little overwhelming,

621
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,290
they're kind of like, oh, obviously, that's how they're going to do it. Right.

622
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,760
So, you know, it's it's it again, I'm always happy to have more conversations about kind of,

623
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,140
you know, having those, you know, designing those kinds of works, if you're interested.

624
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,620
Yeah.

625
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:55,390
One more kind of tough question for you, because I've been working in medicine for six years in the Patient Education and Health Literacy Program.

626
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,180
I'm a writer. Yeah. So we do education.

627
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:07,260
Yeah. So we've worked on some of the schools for portrayals of great music.

628
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,360
You know, a lot of the times, the like,

629
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:19,979
we're brought in to like any of the paper education efforts and like a lot of it tends to be at odds with how we get across the institution,

630
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:27,360
which turns into like a failure for some providers to actually provide the valuable resources that are being created.

631
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,630
And we've never actually been like included in a grant process until this year.

632
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:41,280
So one time when all the programs were on for ten years.

633
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:47,990
So I just feel like there may be some areas where, um, certain, you know,

634
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:56,040
programs are left out that could be, you know, you know, enthusiastic about collaborating.

635
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,790
And how do you identify that, especially in Michigan? Yeah, you identify them, you know.

636
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,249
Sounds like you are you know, you're in this experimental field, sort of.

637
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,130
And you can just work with all these exciting professions and like areas.

638
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:15,340
So how do you how do you do it? Well, obviously, we're not doing it.

639
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,720
You know, maybe you need to tell me how we should be doing. Might be tough, right?

640
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:25,170
No, no, no, no. So, first of all, I think that's you know, I love that you're kind of connecting.

641
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:29,400
I mean, I hate that this is you're in your experience. Right. But I love what you're seeing that experience, right.

642
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,480
Like in this landscape.

643
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:40,710
And I think that, you know, the the best implementation efforts, the ones that are going to be the most effective and and also the most sustainable.

644
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:45,330
Right. The ones that are going to sort of live on after me and my team have long gone right.

645
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,300
Are going to be the ones that involve the people on the ground that recognize the importance of what we're trying to do.

646
00:57:51,630 --> 00:58:00,030
Right. And so, you know, I mean, I it's just it's a pithy answer, but like, we should be, right?

647
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:05,310
We should be engaging those of you that are already in this role, that are already doing this work, because that's the whole point.

648
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:11,040
Right. The point isn't for me and a bunch of people that have never been seen in Michigan medicine to come in and implement something and then leave.

649
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,630
Right. Because that's never going to work. Right. The point is to leverage what already exists.

650
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:22,320
Right. And create something new. Right. Create something better. So you know how.

651
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,020
So with a team that actually did come to you, did you feel like that was a good like a good process?

652
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:32,040
And do you feel like they're using you well? Yeah, it feels really complementary.

653
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:38,729
And it's, um, it is a lot of like pre, like he's in, he's in the process of applying for the grant.

654
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,620
So it's quick and like he doesn't have a lot of time,

655
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:47,250
but like he's the fact that he's like took the time never being with us and just be like, Do you want to write a letter of support?

656
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,040
Do you want to be on your council? It might be a year from now if you want to do it right.

657
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:58,110
That's all the time. That's great. So it's just a little bit of discovery, I think, for but I also think it's a matter of like,

658
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,530
how many people do you have in your team to actually reach out and do that?

659
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,420
Yeah, no, I mean, that's definitely true. And the other thing that's that's a that's a real problem and implementation science of that,

660
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,710
the a scalability problem kind of within the field of application science is that,

661
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:17,430
you know, every time we go to every time there's a new investigator with a new thing they want to implement within Michigan medicine.

662
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
Right. This whole process kind of starts a new right.

663
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:24,630
Like there's a new person, there's a new who has a new thing that they want to do.

664
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,200
Yeah. And so right. And so like, you know, it's terrible that you've had that problem.

665
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,749
But like the other problem that I could perceive you having is that you're literally getting bombarded with requests every week that like,

666
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,560
Hey, we want you to work on this, we want to work on that one to work on this. But these things are not good.

667
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:44,879
Right. And so part of what implementation science needs is kind of we move into like, I don't know, implementation science 2.0, right.

668
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,460
Is that in places like Michigan Medicine, we need the existing infrastructure to be there, right?

669
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,560
We need the infrastructure to be there so that when. Investigators have something that they want to sort of do.

670
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,850
Right. We have connections to you and to certain people in leadership and we can kind of, you know,

671
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,790
help to make those processes a little bit smoother while at the same time, you know, minimizing.

672
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:04,059
Right.

673
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:12,700
All of the the redundancy that occurs as part of these processes and also hopefully leveraging your time and resources in the best way possible.

674
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,240
Right. So, you know, we've got a lot of work to do.

675
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:22,630
Right, in terms of that. And again, this has been like a like a situation where we're kind of, you know, victims of our own success.

676
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,190
Right. Like as implementation,

677
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,740
science has grown in popularity and has grown and sort of this need for collecting this kind of data and testing out these strategies,

678
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,580
we realize that we don't have the infrastructure to support this kind of level of work from so many different kind of people.

679
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,690
So, you know, we'll do better. We'll try to do better, I promise.

680
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:44,770
But that kind of feedback is like, so important. Yeah, I just thought I heard perspective.

681
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,190
Yeah, I know. That's great. That's fantastic. We love it.

682
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,250
All right. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Smith.

683
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:00,819
We appreciate your time. All right. Bye. Well, I do have a lot of folks are interested.

684
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,820
Try to send along an email address. Absolutely.

685
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,760
And, you know, I've got a lot of projects that are ongoing right now.

686
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,049
So if anybody is interested in working with our team, you know, feel free to drop me a line.

687
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:16,830
And, you know, like I said, I've got four or five different projects that we're always looking for, sort of, you know, our help with.

688
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,050
So feel free to drop me a line and be happy to talk more so.

689
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,920
All right. All right. Great to meet you all. Thank you again for your time, but I really appreciate it.

690
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:27,430
It was fun. All right, everybody. All right, folks.

691
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,420
So I think we can move into a break.

692
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:40,630
But if this is something folks want to kind of respond to or reflect on this kind of stuff, I think you're on in about half dozen classes.

693
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:51,550
And one of my favorite my favorite, favorite, favorite lectures is like DRC and the idea of random random assignment and why DRC is the gold standard.

694
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:57,940
But to hear a whole burgeoning area of science that's pushing back on this and thinking about the kinds of questions and the

695
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:04,509
different way we're trying to address questions with frameworks like this versus what we've been operating under over the last 35,

696
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:09,520
40 years is really exciting. And I hope I mean, if you can think about some of the examples shining, even,

697
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,110
I think what the areas and spaces that you're working in and where this could work versus not work,

698
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:20,940
I think that's a lot of opportunity and yet it seems a little a little bit esoteric right now, a little nebulous.

699
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:27,129
It's not super common across things. But the idea that you can have their buy in that the idea that you can have

700
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:31,240
situations where people aren't relegated to a control group for a year or two years,

701
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,440
but you can start to take advantage of your intervention that you believe is effective right away.

702
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,950
That's really cool stuff, especially in our field.

703
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,500
Our field almost just could pull you all into the injury field where we can have immediate impact.

704
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,300
Immediate impact. So great to great to hear some some work in this space.

705
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,730
Why don't we take why don't we come back and have one? Do you want more of that?

706
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:00,760
We went all day long here. How about one in five? All right, so can I get 1 to 5?

707
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,500
But I have a high water. I'm talking about the hands maker, so we're talking about a hands matrix.

708
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:13,150
And then I 130, we're going to hear about some of the pediatric trauma programing and the questions and great.

709
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,229
Thank you so much for doing it.

710
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:20,620
It makes a big difference for a speaker to come in and hear like I think and great questions, insightful questions, bringing in your own experiences.

711
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,950
So I really, really appreciate it, folks. All right. So it takes some time.

712
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:29,100
Relax, stretch. It's food. Whatever you need to do. I will see you soon because I forgot my clicker.

713
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:34,130
And I want. And.

714
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,935
Curtain raiser. And you have to help me remember to unpause or to resume this recurring.

715
01:03:43,259 --> 01:03:53,249
Why is that? Because it's what you guys want to do extremely well.

716
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:58,709
Oh, you mean the series stars everyone is going to have?

717
01:04:00,389 --> 01:04:06,599
Yeah, I know. Sylvester. Yes, it's going to be nice for some.

718
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:11,879
Let's bring it back where we're going to come join us in about 15, 20 minutes.

719
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:18,089
So I do want to spend just a little bit of time, because I do think this is a nice way to think, to be think about injury.

720
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:24,029
So they had Matrix, if you read it on last week, I talked to you a little bit about one of the things I like,

721
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:28,649
which is it thinks about what's going on before, what's going on at the time and what's going on after.

722
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:35,489
Right. So in theory, you can take most, if not all forms of injury and apply this matrix.

723
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:39,119
So in this case, in this example, we're like, how about a like a car accident?

724
01:04:39,479 --> 01:04:46,019
So what's nice about The Matrix in my mind is it breaks down not just the temporality of of a potential injury event,

725
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,449
but it has these kind of different domains.

726
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:55,409
I started to talk a little bit about the host, which is, you know, if it's intentional, we're usually thinking about the person who is injured.

727
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,539
If it's an intentional form of injury.

728
01:04:57,779 --> 01:05:06,449
Maybe we're talking about both the person who's perpetrating, but also or intending versus the victim or the person who usually gets injured.

729
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:13,679
We can also think about the patient, which, you know, if you kind of buy into this idea that injury is the transfer of energy,

730
01:05:13,979 --> 01:05:17,669
it would be what is the thing that's causing the injury?

731
01:05:17,939 --> 01:05:23,519
Right. If you take that kind of lease the person out of business, it would be, for example, the car itself.

732
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:32,609
It could be the firearm, it could be the pool, it could be whichever is kind of a water, I guess, in that case or the fire that's causing the injury.

733
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:37,648
We think about the environment, which I know public health folks want to think about.

734
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:44,639
So what's going on around the event? Right. So not only who is involved, what's involved, but what's happening around us.

735
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:49,309
And then again, still thinking about across the different temporalities.

736
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:54,119
And then this was a somewhat of an addition, which I think is super,

737
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:00,209
super important because this allows us to think even more critically about the environment and what else is intersecting here.

738
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:07,768
So what are some of the social aspects of policy or legal aspects that might be contributing to the event?

739
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:12,269
So what we can do is we can start to fill in some of these reasons, right?

740
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:18,149
So these cells would be thinking about, you know, prior to an event like a car crash ever happening,

741
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:21,959
what are some of the things that we can identify that might be contributing?

742
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:28,919
We can think about some things about the host. Maybe this is a 16 year old kid who has not really started driving before.

743
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:34,349
They just got their license or whatever and are in Michigan for the very first time in the winter.

744
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,949
Right. Maybe it's something to do with the car.

745
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:43,109
Maybe that they haven't been maintaining that the tires, the threat of the trade is very, very low.

746
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:47,369
They're not snow tires. Like any time you talk to a cop actually is driven off the road.

747
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:50,909
The last few days are snow tires. They don't have their snow tires.

748
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:55,219
The environment itself, you know, you can drive in February in Michigan and it's actually okay.

749
01:06:55,229 --> 01:06:59,279
You get some salt in your car, but if it's not snowing, it's not a bad place to be driving.

750
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:04,199
And then thinking too about what are some of the contributing factors?

751
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:08,939
Maybe the roads were plowed or something else that might be going on there off drugs.

752
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,399
Where where does the manufacturer play in this?

753
01:07:13,419 --> 01:07:21,839
And in the example of cars like I'm seeing a lot now, they're news like Sandy Hook and things are going for the gun manufacturers.

754
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,019
Where would they fit in this model? So probably the agent here.

755
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:32,248
So what we might say is that let's see here when we're talking, go forward.

756
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:37,409
I drove forward and I you know, straight forward we've all drive a Ford Escape.

757
01:07:37,769 --> 01:07:41,879
Now, my escapes 2015. My in-laws escape is 2020.

758
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:47,339
So they get to have the new escape that has adaptive cruise control.

759
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:54,539
What they sit there just cruising down 94 and while I'm here,

760
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:59,609
why not knuckle and it just yep it's lower now speeds up slowed down speeds up on its own.

761
01:08:00,149 --> 01:08:03,779
That's a safety innovation that may or may not be effective. I don't know.

762
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:07,529
You have no bubble lights that are you're you're saying it could be a seatbelt.

763
01:08:07,529 --> 01:08:15,359
Right. So whatever we want to think about, the car itself would probably fall to this kind of this category.

764
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:23,219
So for the car manufacturers, I think you can think about the car that they're making specifically, but you could also think about are they?

765
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:33,739
Intel, Intel and all to make their car safer if they're disincentivized to include adaptive cruise control to their cars.

766
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,639
What's the likelihood that they're going to put them into their cars?

767
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:46,309
And so we think about those three pieces, too. Avery does wear that go.

768
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:51,619
Does that change if the driver chooses to use or not?

769
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:56,059
Yep. That future. So then does it end up in the first part? Like if you don't think you're searching.

770
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:59,959
Right, turn off your. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

771
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:03,859
Car manufacturer might say we put them all in there. I can't believe you didn't.

772
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:08,808
You didn't bother to turn it on or you you actively are ignoring some of the warning signs that we have where you put the seatbelt.

773
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:14,089
And that's kind of an individual decisions, the host decision, if you will, that might have created this.

774
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:18,449
We can also think about maybe, maybe, you know,

775
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:24,469
you or your little teenager is is is normally pretty good about putting on the old adaptive cruise control.

776
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:30,289
I have no idea how on or off it is. I don't have one, but maybe one.

777
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:33,709
There are one or two in there, but they're in the car with them all of a sudden.

778
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:40,219
No, I don't want to be looking like I have the adaptive cruise control. I'm going to want if this is how I'm going to drive.

779
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:47,719
Right. So the social environment could potentially contribute in a way that we would want to capture here as well.

780
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:48,949
And the reason why,

781
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:56,269
as we start to look at these cells and we start to look at what's precipitating or at the time over following an injury event where they're engaged.

782
01:09:57,139 --> 01:10:03,349
Right. That's the question. Right. This where this is, I think, really, really good it's doing if we're going to design an intervention,

783
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:08,928
chances are the goal might be, yes, we want to stop car crashes, but we got to be a lot more specific.

784
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:16,369
Right. We're never going to design something that's going to capture all of the things that might be leading up and into a car accident.

785
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:20,749
So what can we do? Where can we focus our attention? Where can we focus our resources?

786
01:10:21,109 --> 01:10:23,629
And if you can start to identify these pieces,

787
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:34,308
it's particularly when you have a inexperienced driver in really scary conditions with a car that's not maintained.

788
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:45,769
Well, sorry, guys. I know you and all of their friends are in the car.

789
01:10:46,429 --> 01:10:48,889
You put all four of those factors together.

790
01:10:49,129 --> 01:11:01,189
The likelihood of a car accident happening are probably astronomically higher than when you have dad sitting next to you saying, Slow down, it's June.

791
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:07,848
We are driving the 2020 Ford Escape instead of the 2015 Ford Escape that really

792
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:14,839
needs some serious maintenance because they're not take care of it very well. And then also, you know, we've done all that.

793
01:11:15,049 --> 01:11:22,668
I don't know where we're we're we're in a speed zone that says slow down when because a bridge might be icy or something like that.

794
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:27,829
Right. All of a sudden this looks very different and the likelihood of injury looks very, very different.

795
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,688
We can think about the prevention side of things. I don't want to just start with prevention.

796
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,419
All my school violence work looks at prevention,

797
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:40,819
but I'm not oblivious to the fact that there could be things that are happening when when risk is imminent.

798
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:44,719
What can we be doing? When the risk is imminent?

799
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:50,988
We teach people how not to slam on your brakes. I don't know if folks remember the days before automatic braking.

800
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:54,859
Right? Where is where you could like literally lock your brakes, right. You had a problem, right?

801
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:58,789
Little things like that. Don't tailgate. Don't tailgate.

802
01:11:58,789 --> 01:12:03,138
It's not a good idea. Right. We can think about the design of the roads.

803
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:06,139
We can think about what's going on in our environment.

804
01:12:06,559 --> 01:12:12,169
Mixed use roads are super, super dangerous. They're super, super important to somebody who lives on the country like me.

805
01:12:12,379 --> 01:12:15,619
I like to walk. I like to ride my bike. I understand that people might ride their horses.

806
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:17,599
I understand there could be a tractor in the car.

807
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:23,269
My guess is if you've never gone out to Chelsea, Michigan, and you're cruising down my road at 45 miles an hour,

808
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:27,859
you might be surprised to see a giant combine that's taking up three quarters of the road.

809
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:34,279
And if you're not paying attention, if you're coming around a tight curve, whatever, you could very well end up smashing that for convoy.

810
01:12:34,699 --> 01:12:38,179
Right. So what are some of the things that we can do at a before?

811
01:12:38,749 --> 01:12:43,969
Right at the time and then ideally in response to so what are some of the things that we can do after.

812
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:47,359
Right. Or to facilitate recovery and and move forward?

813
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,359
Right. I love you. Yes. Yes, please.

814
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,868
So we've known this is a very exciting.

815
01:12:56,869 --> 01:13:01,579
Come on in. How are you today? Are you very, very well.

816
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:07,879
We're a little early. Okay. Yeah. Are you familiar with the Handle The Matrix?

817
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:12,219
I'm familiar with all of the content that you're describing. Excellent.

818
01:13:12,769 --> 01:13:15,909
For all terminology. Yeah. And we'll see.

819
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:20,478
I mean, this might be an interesting challenge. So again, this is an example of how to think about it.

820
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:25,169
Conceptualize an injury, a specific kind of injury or. In this case, it's a car accident.

821
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:30,478
Under these parameters, you should be able to take any form of injury.

822
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,079
In theory, whether it's firearm prevention, whether it's older adult falls,

823
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:42,569
whether it's things that might happen to early in early childhood when it's drowning, burns to be thinking through and start to plug in these values.

824
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:51,299
What is it about exposure, about a household exposure to a chemical based on the child and how the child's

825
01:13:51,299 --> 01:13:55,439
in kind of engaging with their environment based on the actual chemical itself?

826
01:13:55,529 --> 01:14:05,369
Is this toilet cleaner blue or is this poison borax?

827
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:09,508
Is this how someone said bleach or something?

828
01:14:09,509 --> 01:14:12,979
Maybe a little more innocuous? And how are these how are these things kind of store?

829
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:18,229
I mean, what are what is the product itself we might have in our homes? How what does that house look like?

830
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,779
Do we have things locked up? Do we have high up in the shelves? Do we have them wherever it could be?

831
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:28,349
What about the warnings? I freaked out when I used that poison in my little toddler.

832
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:32,609
All of a sudden grabbed a little bottle and put it in his mouth. Very, very scary for me.

833
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:38,429
Right on the label, Poison Control called Poison Control to tell me a little bit about what might happen if he accidentally ingested some of that.

834
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:42,779
Some of that poison. Upset stomach. No need to run to the emergency room.

835
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:45,689
Didn't seem like he had any. He's well. Very good.

836
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:52,319
Very happy outcome to a scary story for me to make sure that I am keeping my environment the best I can safe.

837
01:14:53,099 --> 01:15:01,139
But what kind of laws are we including or kind of labels are we demanding are included among products?

838
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,849
The scariest label in my my garage is chlorine tablets.

839
01:15:06,029 --> 01:15:11,459
I got a pool. And these chlorine tablets have really scary warnings about how you're supposed to store them.

840
01:15:11,699 --> 01:15:17,578
What happens if you touch them? What happens if they get wet and then the gas kind of builds up things like blindness, whatever.

841
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:25,259
So things I would never consider. It makes me afraid to use my garage, but they are still pieces of information that I could know or might not know.

842
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:29,098
There are a lot of other warnings that don't exist that could be related to policy.

843
01:15:29,099 --> 01:15:34,168
There could be a lot of other factors. Oh, no, no, no, no. The poor guy says, don't worry about these tablets.

844
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:38,099
They're not they have to put all these warnings on here. But you're probably going to be good, right?

845
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:44,969
So things that might be happening in our everyday experience that could somehow be contributing to, in this case,

846
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:53,909
a perhaps a poisoned exposure or toxic an exposure to a child that might have access to, oh, look at those big white tablets.

847
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:59,638
They seem like they might be fun to handle. Or look at this little bottle of clear liquid or blue liquid.

848
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:02,689
What, like a washer? Like your car washer fluid. Right.

849
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:08,039
So things that might attract a child's attention. And so can we think through that?

850
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:16,469
Also, if a child does find that windshield wiper fluid and does just a little bit of I'm not talking so out of my own head right now.

851
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:23,969
So tell me if this isn't true, but are there procedures in place so that people in the local hospital or EMT know how to respond?

852
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:31,919
What is the and the idea is I'll stop because I don't want embarrass myself, but can we fill in some of these cells?

853
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,749
And then once we filled in some of these cells with either the risk or protective pieces,

854
01:16:37,169 --> 01:16:41,219
can we begin to design those interventions to or places to intervene?

855
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:51,518
See, now, you know, I was just wondering sort of some other metrics, oh, can I work for other fields with them for work?

856
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:54,849
How or is it specific to undergraduate?

857
01:16:54,869 --> 01:16:57,089
Like could it work with maternal and child care?

858
01:16:57,209 --> 01:17:03,089
Because I'm wondering what like a complicated pregnancy because I know like there's like a step by step thing,

859
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,129
like what happens when you're going into labor? What happens if something bad happens?

860
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,649
Like, could this be applied to like a pregnancy?

861
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:19,709
I think so. Then if there isn't, this is a theory, this is generalizable.

862
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:24,419
We should be able to look at different contexts and see if it applies across.

863
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:27,719
Now, is it possible that there are situations where it might not apply?

864
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:34,888
Probably so. But I'm going to give one last example of how I kind of think about this and show you that I probably could apply this.

865
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:41,369
My daughter, I love her best dog. Can I think about even a situation with a dog?

866
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:44,638
And no, it's not gonna be like a dog bite story, but a dog bite story.

867
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:47,129
You might need to think about how to fill in some of these cells.

868
01:17:47,759 --> 01:17:52,709
But the reason why I say about this is when I came across my house every day and I'm thinking

869
01:17:54,269 --> 01:18:02,549
what happened pre during and following this event to the injury of my economist here?

870
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:13,139
And so retrospectively, can I start to piece together the sequence of events and the circumstances that made this event possible?

871
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:17,859
I bet you know the agent. I bet you I know what caused the injury.

872
01:18:18,299 --> 01:18:23,039
Now, are there some pieces of are there some things about the host if you want to?

873
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:29,589
There they are. The magazine, if you want to call me that we could change to avoid such a terrible outcome.

874
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:33,399
Are there pieces about the environment where I store that magazine where it was?

875
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:41,769
Yes, very silly example. But chances are you can take a lot of different situations and particularly an injury prevention.

876
01:18:41,769 --> 01:18:45,849
But it doesn't have to. It could be other places and start to think through one.

877
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:50,499
How do you kind of categorize these key domains? I think that's an innovation.

878
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:55,689
And then I absolutely think moving away from only prevention, yes, we are public health.

879
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:59,829
And yes, this is where we live. We want to have prevention activities out there.

880
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:07,089
But understanding what's going on at the time of for immediate intervention, is that possible and when is it possible?

881
01:19:07,389 --> 01:19:14,649
And then absolutely, if there's anything that we can do to mitigate the damage or of help with the recovery piece.

882
01:19:15,009 --> 01:19:22,209
So I'll be very curious if we can think about areas where your child childhood burns or other other forms of injury that following the event,

883
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:29,949
if it has occurred, what might be places where the hospitals or physicians or whomever can either again

884
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:34,329
lessen the damage experience or help people or facilitate people back to recovery?

885
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,679
And if there are barriers or opportunities, that's where we intervene.

886
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:42,039
So with that, I'm going to turn it over if you are ready.

887
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:56,199
I'm very clear. I don't have great introductions, but I might have you introduce yourself and I do have your slides.

888
01:20:03,309 --> 01:20:07,659
That is the stuff we love to hear. It feels like such a great stuff.

889
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:12,239
And I do want to. We are recording for. Is that okay?

890
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:15,899
I can see if I turn it off. If you want. This is a little quicker. Okay.

891
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:20,699
So write for black and then the top one is a funny thing.

892
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:24,089
Okay. All right. Hello. Hi.

893
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:30,029
My name is Amy, Rico and I. We just walked across the street from C.S. Mack Children's Hospital.

894
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:33,929
So hearing all the things you were talking about, we see every day, all day.

895
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:37,369
We're with the pediatric trauma program. I'm a nurse by training.

896
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:40,919
I've been on the air in Commentors for 28 years.

897
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:44,129
You want stories? I got stories and nothing to tell any of them, but I've got them.

898
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:47,349
And then this is my coworker, Clarissa, right.

899
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:53,159
And of course, I'm working with the injury prevention program for about six years now.

900
01:20:54,059 --> 01:21:04,029
And this is something that walking into this course and listening to your instructor talk about all of these events and ways to prevent injury,

901
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:10,378
that's going to be right up your alley. So I think some of our programs you can put in your matrix and I think that I.

902
01:21:10,379 --> 01:21:15,928
Oh, I know. So we're going to start out just by telling you a little bit about our program, why we're here,

903
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:20,818
why we do what we do, and then go into some of the projects that we do and see us and then the community.

904
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:24,359
So we're going to kind of trade on and off with some of the topics.

905
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:31,209
If you have any questions, feel free to ask or obviously we'll have opportunity at the end, but happy to take any questions kind of as we go along.

906
01:21:32,549 --> 01:21:38,549
So just to tell you a little bit, pediatric trauma. So we see us as the level one pediatric trauma center.

907
01:21:38,549 --> 01:21:43,799
So there's basically four levels of trauma that you can be designated one through four.

908
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:50,699
One is the highest and four is kind of the lowest. That's more for like critical access hospitals, small community hospitals where they're,

909
01:21:50,999 --> 01:21:54,179
you know, stabilizing and transferring on to bigger centers like ours.

910
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:58,408
We are verified by the American College of Surgeons.

911
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:04,409
We're actually a surgical program that's the department we work for. So we are verified.

912
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:07,558
Every three years they fly in surgeons from across the country.

913
01:22:07,559 --> 01:22:13,139
They come and look at our program and make sure that we're doing what we're supposed to do based on parameters that they've outlined.

914
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:19,199
As part of that is not only like how we treat the injured patients, but we get once we get them.

915
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:23,459
But there's a huge component of injury prevention and we feel especially with kids, right?

916
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:28,799
So we need to do that, prevent education as much as we can to prevent these injuries.

917
01:22:28,799 --> 01:22:32,518
We always say we're trying to put our trauma surgeons out of business. We would love to do that.

918
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:36,479
I don't know that we ever will. But because people drive cars and do really dumb things sometimes.

919
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:42,749
But that's what we try to do. We do have a hospital based injury prevention program.

920
01:22:43,499 --> 01:22:48,509
We're in the hospital Monday through Friday, 8 to 4. We do child passenger safety.

921
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:52,229
Clarissa is one of our technicians and an instructor.

922
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:59,249
So they are the staff that go in and meet with parents when they're discharging home with newborns, if they have questions,

923
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:05,369
some of our teeny tiniest babies just to make sure they're fitting in seats appropriately during our one and

924
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:11,278
a half year olds back around if they'll let us in the car seats and providing resources if they need them.

925
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,789
So if they're in a crash, we need to make sure that they're going home with an appropriate car seat.

926
01:23:16,349 --> 01:23:19,888
We round on all of our patients. We support the air when needed.

927
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:26,129
So if they have an immediate need, they'll page us. And when I say us, I mean Clarissa, and that is your prevention staff.

928
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:33,479
But they'll go down and do real time education on the patient. So just again, we're the lead agency for Save Kids here in Bailey.

929
01:23:33,839 --> 01:23:37,168
We do try to try to focus really hard on underserved communities.

930
01:23:37,169 --> 01:23:42,959
It doesn't do a whole lot of good to do a lot of education if they can't afford the safety items or the other things that,

931
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:46,259
you know for telling them they need to have or that they should have in their environment.

932
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:56,758
Strong CPS, again, that's child passenger safety. We do five community seat checks every month, all throughout the county.

933
01:23:56,759 --> 01:24:00,359
So we do Washtenaw County, Genesee, Genesee County. We have one in Flint.

934
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:05,668
Again, we kind of look at where the needs are at and we try to be there. pre-COVID we had a few more.

935
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:10,529
We were in Jackson at that time, but COVID has changed a lot of things, as you can imagine.

936
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:13,049
So we're down to five, but we really get a great turnout.

937
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:21,179
We provide seats for free to those families that come to those events through through the state.

938
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:26,428
We focus on physical safety wheels, support, safety, pedestrian safety.

939
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:32,338
We really try to look at our injury trends, you know, figure out what we need to focus on for injury topics.

940
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:36,689
There's things that we never thought we would ever have to focus on, like distracted pedestrian.

941
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:42,568
Who knew that we'd have to talk to kids about not, you know, and college students, you know,

942
01:24:42,569 --> 01:24:48,149
looking at their phones as they cross the street, you know, look both ways, all of those things, lawnmower safety is huge.

943
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:54,419
We don't see the minor lawnmower injuries justify. Those are awful and trampolines things like that.

944
01:24:54,419 --> 01:24:58,109
So anything else that our data or our community tells us is a problem?

945
01:24:59,909 --> 01:25:05,099
So this is kind of we took this out of our kind of rule book for a time from the American College of Surgeons.

946
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:06,569
And I thought this was a great statement.

947
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:14,759
So trauma centers must have an organized and effective approach to injury prevention and prioritize efforts based on data in our trauma registry.

948
01:25:14,769 --> 01:25:21,419
So we have to really understand what we're seeing and not just make assumptions or, you know, what, we think this is what we need to focus on.

949
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:26,279
So the way that we do that is we have a pediatric trauma registry.

950
01:25:26,519 --> 01:25:29,789
And actually at Michigan Medicine, there's three separate registries.

951
01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:34,709
We have one for pediatrics that we can keep completely separate, just one for adult trauma patients.

952
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:38,159
And then there's a separate burn registry as well.

953
01:25:38,169 --> 01:25:41,789
So Matt is a level one pediatric trauma center.

954
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:45,778
UAH Or university hospitals or one adult and a verified burn center.

955
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:53,339
So there's all different registries for that. We keep all kinds of information in there and our data goes back to like 1990.

956
01:25:53,759 --> 01:25:57,289
So if we need to look at local injury trends, we can totally do that.

957
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:01,069
We gather information like zip codes, all kind of stuff. We'll go into that a little bit,

958
01:26:01,559 --> 01:26:09,119
but we also use that data to fit up to larger groups so that we can do benchmarking

959
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:13,729
and we can do quality studies based on like centers and other centers ratings really.

960
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:21,149
So we do submit to the state and there's a program in the state of Michigan called MTD Proper, the Michigan Trauma Quality Improvement Program.

961
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:27,719
Unfortunately, that's for adults only. But all level one and two trauma centers in the state submit to this one big repository.

962
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:35,329
And again, they're doing a lot of benchmarking based on that data. We have on every single piece in one piece.

963
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:39,709
When people hear trauma, I think they think of the emergency department of what happens there.

964
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:46,219
But we actually tracked in trend what happens from the point of injury all the way through the patient's discharge.

965
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:51,109
So whether they're discharged to rehab or home, if there's unfortunately a death.

966
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:52,849
We track all of those things.

967
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:59,329
We can tell you where the injury occurred, what their vital signs that were at the point where they were in a seatbelt, where they were in a helmet.

968
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:03,619
We try and track all of that information. With that being said,

969
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:09,228
the data points we have is only as good as the information that's documented that

970
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:13,309
we really go into every record and try and gather as much as we possibly can.

971
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:20,529
We look at injury severity score. You may hear something else, ISIS, that's what that stands for.

972
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:25,399
So the higher the number and that's based on the areas of injury with body regions,

973
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:28,969
the higher the number, the more severely the patient of injured is injured.

974
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:33,859
And that can give us idea of likelihood of survival and of those other pieces.

975
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:40,639
So lots of data. We use this data again for performance improvement, benchmarking and trending research.

976
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:46,219
Injury prevention is the big one. And then we also give feedback to EMS and referring hospitals.

977
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:53,199
We are a tertiary center. So that's kind of one of our main objectives is to provide feedback and process improvement for other centers.

978
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:59,299
We do a lot of that and then we use national data to I don't know if you've this is whiskers.

979
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:05,778
We go into whiskers quite frequently just to look at national trends. So this one is really pretty interesting.

980
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:11,009
And and one of our big focuses, as I talked about at the beginning, was car seats.

981
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:20,058
If you look at our registry data and you look at the number one cause of injury in our database, and our database is only for patients.

982
01:28:20,059 --> 01:28:25,309
It's not every patient that comes to the E.R. it's only patients that are come to our E.R.

983
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:30,199
with an injury and are admitted or they're sent to the O.R. If they get if they go home,

984
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:35,299
they're not included. So we don't have those low level ankle sprains or even a simple broken wrist.

985
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:42,079
It's more so the more severely injured patients. But if you look at our number one cause of injury, it's actually falls.

986
01:28:42,769 --> 01:28:50,299
But if you look at that ISF score, so the injury severity score, the highest assesses are our kids that are in motor vehicle accidents.

987
01:28:50,299 --> 01:28:52,309
So that's where we're really trying to focus our efforts.

988
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:57,139
So we're not just looking at overall numbers, but we look at what's causing the most serious injuries as well.

989
01:29:00,049 --> 01:29:03,469
One of the things that we do and I've talked about this a little bit as we try really

990
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:07,759
hard to take advantage of teachable moments when we have kind of a captive audience.

991
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:13,879
So we every day are looking at all of our trauma patients that we have admitted into the hospital.

992
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:18,469
We meet as a team and we look at those and we talk about opportunities for injury prevention.

993
01:29:19,519 --> 01:29:23,058
So if we have a patient that fell out of second story window,

994
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:28,939
what can we do and what can we provide to teach them about preventing that injury from happening again?

995
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:34,849
So we want to prevent recurrence, but then we also look at opportunities for broader injury prevention.

996
01:29:34,879 --> 01:29:40,459
Okay. Your 18 month old fell out of the window, but how are you getting home and how is he riding in the car?

997
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:42,799
So those are questions we ask.

998
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:48,829
I really, really try to take advantage of not only focusing on why they're there, but then again preventing the next injury.

999
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:56,309
So we talk about that a lot. Again, things we focus at on the hospital.

1000
01:29:56,789 --> 01:30:00,509
This is what we see a lot. Wheeled sports, safeties. Kids aren't wearing helmets.

1001
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:05,629
Teenagers really don't wear helmets. ATV and RV, we see a lot of those as well.

1002
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:13,169
Some pretty significant injuries. People are always trying to put these little kids on these ATVs and it's just not a good combination.

1003
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:19,469
We look at our seasonal opportunities, so with every patient we have for handouts and I've got pictures of them and I'm a little bit

1004
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:25,479
one for each of the seasons and we have our prominent injuries that we see even for that season.

1005
01:30:25,889 --> 01:30:30,299
And, you know, water safety, hot cars in the summertime. Lawnmower again.

1006
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:36,239
ATV and lawn mowers is a good example of one that it doesn't happen very often.

1007
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:40,859
But when it does, it's a very severe injury that we want to bring awareness to because not a lot

1008
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:45,598
of families think to have their kids inside when they're out mowing the lawn

1009
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:49,828
or when the neighbors mowing the lawn because you can't hear they're this really

1010
01:30:49,829 --> 01:30:54,059
heavy machine and we have a lot of kids that suffer amputations due to it.

1011
01:30:54,069 --> 01:30:57,559
So that's one that we prioritize for a couple of seasons, too.

1012
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,199
Yeah, this is life altering injuries, obviously.

1013
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,828
So you're really trying to look at that? Yeah, we have that on spring.

1014
01:31:04,829 --> 01:31:11,489
I think we have it on spring, summer and fall on everyone because again, it's just such a significant injury.

1015
01:31:11,729 --> 01:31:16,349
And when we're dealing with kids, you know, they talk about like the lifetime of work loss and,

1016
01:31:16,529 --> 01:31:19,858
you know, all of those pieces, you figure they're figuring that out.

1017
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:25,588
And a 40 or 50 year old adult, you know, imagine what that number would be for a four year old or a five year old.

1018
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:30,569
So it's significant impact. And then we focus on medication safety as well.

1019
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:36,989
So this is an example. So we really try to provide education, but we also want to provide resources.

1020
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:41,209
We can't go in and shake a finger and say, you shouldn't be doing that. Why do you have your seven year old on TV?

1021
01:31:41,489 --> 01:31:47,669
But we go in and we tell them the facts, like we're giving them information based upon recommendations from outside sources.

1022
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:50,219
Not just our opinion are what we see or what we think.

1023
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:57,119
So this sheet we created a few years ago, and I tell you, this was not easy to try and discern what the rules are for these things.

1024
01:31:57,959 --> 01:32:03,328
The turning point for me, I remember we had, I think, a six year old and we try and like give helmets and,

1025
01:32:03,329 --> 01:32:07,349
you know, make sure, again, that they're leaving safely and we're in the office having the discussion.

1026
01:32:07,349 --> 01:32:10,168
I said, look, do we have a helmet small enough for a six year old?

1027
01:32:10,169 --> 01:32:15,089
And then I'm like, why are we giving them a helmet if he's not supposed to be on it to begin with?

1028
01:32:15,569 --> 01:32:20,609
So then we went and we said, okay, we need to find out the law and really, you know, determine what what it all means.

1029
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:24,989
So, again, the top statement is the American Academy of Pediatrics.

1030
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:30,899
This is what they say. It's not what I say. You know, you can do what you want, but this is what the American Academy of Pediatrics say.

1031
01:32:31,229 --> 01:32:36,929
We don't know what they can do, what they want, but you know what mean? These are the regulations set forth by the state of Michigan.

1032
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:43,949
And then again, these are the laws, what's safest. And everyone that operates an ATV under 16.

1033
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:52,529
Yes. Has to take an operator safety course and then you have to have a certificate and they have to have their certificate with them.

1034
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:56,009
When they're on the ATV, they have to have parental supervision. Those are all the rules.

1035
01:32:56,579 --> 01:32:59,849
And it doesn't do us any good to tell them this is what you need to have.

1036
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:03,058
But then we don't give them a source so that we provide them with the shield.

1037
01:33:03,059 --> 01:33:05,909
So you go to the DNR website and that's where they can take the course.

1038
01:33:08,339 --> 01:33:15,179
And this has been helpful not only for us providing the patients but for our staff because this is a reportable event.

1039
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:20,759
Again, if you have your seven year old on a machine that's designed for, you know,

1040
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:25,978
a 16 year old adult and you're not actively watching them and they're not on private

1041
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:28,889
property and you're not following the rules and they're not wearing a helmet.

1042
01:33:29,909 --> 01:33:33,539
You know, that's that's a reportable because you're not maintaining a safe environment.

1043
01:33:34,379 --> 01:33:40,769
Q But they're not devices you gave able to like five patients on.

1044
01:33:42,469 --> 01:33:49,309
You know, in a way that's kind of more to word of mouth, to be honest, right now.

1045
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:58,099
So we don't have anything in place to track compliance or the aftermath of it, which is really hard for us with what we do with injury prevention,

1046
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:03,379
because we do so much to prevent the injury that we just think when they go home,

1047
01:34:03,379 --> 01:34:07,279
they just live a very long, safe life and we're letting job well done.

1048
01:34:07,549 --> 01:34:16,069
And it's very like every now and then, we'll have the same the same child come back where we can touch base and say, like, oh, they're doing well.

1049
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:21,939
You know, they came back for something completely different. But that's kind of the downside and what we do.

1050
01:34:22,989 --> 01:34:28,478
So it depends because when we do go into the patient room, obviously this has already happened.

1051
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:35,229
There's already an injury. The parents and the caregivers have already heard it from multiple staff.

1052
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:38,559
You know that they shouldn't have been on the ATV, they should have had a helmet.

1053
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:45,729
And it's going in with empathy and having that conversation with the family.

1054
01:34:45,739 --> 01:34:47,978
Like, here are some things that we didn't know.

1055
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:52,749
Like this sheep, for example, every time we have a kid come in, I have to look at it every time to see what we just did.

1056
01:34:53,229 --> 01:35:01,869
Yeah, I just like, oh, yeah. And for the most part, they are pretty understanding and and receiving all the information.

1057
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:07,689
And I would, I have a good feeling that they'll be compliant leaving afterwards because it's

1058
01:35:08,019 --> 01:35:11,529
we hear a lot of I didn't know I thought it was safe because it was my property,

1059
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,619
it was my fitment, it was within the family.

1060
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:18,879
I thought it was safe. They've done it before. We do that a lot. They've done that, yeah.

1061
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:22,309
They grew up on four wheelers now.

1062
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:26,299
So now, now hopefully they get their certificate.

1063
01:35:26,299 --> 01:35:34,418
And do I age appropriately? Yeah. So are readmission rates even relevant for yes or no?

1064
01:35:34,419 --> 01:35:38,709
So certainly we would look at recidivism and if they're coming back for the same type of injury.

1065
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:45,549
One of the issues we ran in too is we kept patients from all over the state, so they're flown to us from everywhere.

1066
01:35:45,879 --> 01:35:49,629
So if they have another minor injury, they may or may not come back to us.

1067
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:54,729
So it's really hard to track and trend in that wave.

1068
01:35:57,799 --> 01:35:59,659
Yeah. I mean, if they come back again,

1069
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:06,138
the trauma registry almost it's funny because we see obviously hundreds of patients in a year and we'll get a patient and be like,

1070
01:36:06,139 --> 01:36:11,179
that name sounds really familiar. Yeah. And we'll go in and sure enough, they've been here for for that or something else.

1071
01:36:11,629 --> 01:36:14,929
But it's hard. Yeah. Yeah.

1072
01:36:15,709 --> 01:36:17,749
At what time are these resources delivered?

1073
01:36:17,899 --> 01:36:22,699
Because I would imagine it's not as soon as they're admitted, but also not towards the end when they're ready to leave.

1074
01:36:22,909 --> 01:36:27,019
So yes and no, we tried we try to reach that sweet spot.

1075
01:36:27,019 --> 01:36:30,619
Right, because you don't want to go. I'm not going in the trauma bay and saying, hey, you know what?

1076
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:38,449
Because that's not the time for that. So we need to make sure that we're at a time when usually right before a discharge or like we

1077
01:36:38,449 --> 01:36:41,899
try to get a feel of when they're going to be going home and that's a good time to do it.

1078
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:48,738
We follow them. So, um, for most of them, it's, it's mainly the caregiver that we're looking for.

1079
01:36:48,739 --> 01:36:52,249
So they're in a procedure and we know that the caregiver is in the waiting room.

1080
01:36:52,249 --> 01:36:57,049
We'll talk to the caregiver or like at that time of discharge, we'll plan with the medical team to say,

1081
01:36:57,049 --> 01:37:01,629
you know, what's what's their plan when I'm going to go home and we coordinate.

1082
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:07,879
And sometimes they keep they don't hold them up, but they'll say, like, hey, like, you know, this group is gonna come meet you next.

1083
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:17,389
So we, we do a pretty good job because in office there, it's five of us that can go at any point to visit the patient.

1084
01:37:17,809 --> 01:37:19,399
And we do have inclusion criteria.

1085
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:27,379
So we track this, we don't we try not to do anything and just do it and not have like a track and a trend of what we've done.

1086
01:37:28,339 --> 01:37:29,748
So we do have inclusion criteria.

1087
01:37:29,749 --> 01:37:35,959
So if we have a patient that comes in on the week and we're only there Monday through Friday, so those are patients that don't meet inclusion for us.

1088
01:37:36,349 --> 01:37:41,808
If they come in and they come in and get a procedure and they go home within 24 hours and we just don't have that opportunity.

1089
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:44,388
They don't we inclusion as far as that.

1090
01:37:44,389 --> 01:37:50,539
Now, that doesn't mean we won't try to get to them as best we can, but sometimes they're just physically king y.

1091
01:37:50,689 --> 01:37:54,379
So growing up, I was always told, like, if something's going to happen,

1092
01:37:54,379 --> 01:37:58,279
you're gonna want it to happen in a week because the weekend is when the hospital visits.

1093
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:02,568
So I'm wondering what made you guys decide that Monday through Friday is when this is going

1094
01:38:02,569 --> 01:38:09,169
to be like you're going to be included if you are in that situation compared to any other.

1095
01:38:10,299 --> 01:38:15,109
So I don't know that that's true, that we're busiest.

1096
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,888
And I honestly, again, this is just my own opinion Monday.

1097
01:38:20,889 --> 01:38:25,289
So the worse than we are Monday is Monday after a holiday. And people don't want to come in on the weekends.

1098
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:29,228
They'll wait till Monday. So it's really I mean, it just depends.

1099
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:34,449
We could come in and lobby for patients and the E.R. and we come in and 24 hours later, there's 36.

1100
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:36,669
Like you, just you. It's really hard to know.

1101
01:38:37,089 --> 01:38:44,029
We do know from working with kids is that our summertime is our busy time when the weather's nice because kids are out, right.

1102
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:49,868
So from a season it's we have a travel season. Adults don't because that happens all year round.

1103
01:38:49,869 --> 01:38:54,879
But with kids, we definitely do it when they're in school. We tend to be a little, you know, not quite as busy.

1104
01:38:54,879 --> 01:38:59,079
But yeah, it's it's kind of hard.

1105
01:38:59,779 --> 01:39:05,678
And then COVID definitely had a huge impact on that because families were being told,

1106
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,539
don't come to the ER unless you absolutely have to go to an urgent care, call your doctor first.

1107
01:39:11,589 --> 01:39:22,419
And there's definitely the change with trends as well. So it just depends on what that post was during the spring of 2020.

1108
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:28,689
One of the major things we had come in a lot were trampoline entries because they were all home and they were just like,

1109
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:32,529
and get us, get a trampoline and have them jump around the backyard, grab some of that energy.

1110
01:39:32,919 --> 01:39:40,689
And that we had like a high number of patients coming in all throughout the week with trampoline injury.

1111
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:42,998
And don't forget, these are admitted patients.

1112
01:39:42,999 --> 01:39:48,549
So most of the time we've got like a five day window or, you know, we have some kids that we've got for weeks.

1113
01:39:48,999 --> 01:39:52,539
So we have longer windows than just that immediate opportunity.

1114
01:39:52,539 --> 01:39:58,889
And to hear that someone else. Oh, she did.

1115
01:39:58,919 --> 01:40:02,109
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. It's okay.

1116
01:40:02,909 --> 01:40:12,389
There's the fear of being deported. Progress on that injury sometimes, especially like people coming in.

1117
01:40:14,829 --> 01:40:21,829
We would like to think that. I mean. But I know that's a hard one to answer.

1118
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:29,209
I would like to say if your child is injured and like that, that's something that's considered but wouldn't stop seeking treatment.

1119
01:40:29,539 --> 01:40:33,829
And honestly, if there's a delay in seeking treatment, that's a trigger unto itself.

1120
01:40:34,219 --> 01:40:36,739
So you're there kind of compounding the issues.

1121
01:40:36,749 --> 01:40:41,629
You know, we have kids that have, you know, I say that have been at home for three days with a broken arm.

1122
01:40:41,899 --> 01:40:44,939
You know, that's that's not appropriate parental care.

1123
01:40:44,959 --> 01:40:49,428
So that's again, that's another trigger. So I think accidents happen.

1124
01:40:49,429 --> 01:40:53,418
We understand that. And certainly, you know,

1125
01:40:53,419 --> 01:40:57,888
we take they take we don't do any of that report while we are and when the mandated

1126
01:40:57,889 --> 01:41:04,579
reporter but one that's elevated like CPS or child protective services they handle that.

1127
01:41:04,579 --> 01:41:09,679
We just do the reporting and they do the best findings. Yeah.

1128
01:41:09,759 --> 01:41:17,379
As I say, that information like that, we rarely will have access to you to know if if that's a concern.

1129
01:41:17,379 --> 01:41:23,358
And. Well, and one of the things we've had to consider in the last two years and so is really going to be bringing this to light.

1130
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:29,688
As you know, we try to go to underserved communities, but then we go to areas where we think we would have like an open door policy.

1131
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:38,658
So we'll go to like fire stations. Well, is that the best place to meet someone who may be concerned about one person or, you know, if so,

1132
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:44,898
we actually go into communities now and go into where the patients live and not try to go

1133
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:49,849
just to places that we feel would work based on the physical environments that makes sense.

1134
01:41:50,119 --> 01:41:52,399
And we did it because the fire department is like, sure, come on.

1135
01:41:52,819 --> 01:41:56,689
But then when you think of your audience, it's like, okay, we have to, we have to think differently.

1136
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:02,478
Yeah, and they're still the one. And I give the disclosure, I'm like, So you familiar with this location?

1137
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:06,319
Yeah. Yeah, that's like the police department. Uh huh. And you can get do that.

1138
01:42:06,469 --> 01:42:12,289
I also have this option so that they know and they select where they want to go based off of their comfort level too.

1139
01:42:13,009 --> 01:42:17,269
But yeah, that's hard too, because some locations do welcome us with open arms.

1140
01:42:17,269 --> 01:42:21,139
Think of all the space you need to do whatever you in. That's that's an extreme you.

1141
01:42:21,259 --> 01:42:24,809
Yeah that's pretty scary. And then when possible we've.

1142
01:42:24,829 --> 01:42:28,489
Oh I'm sorry. Did you on your way. No, go ahead.

1143
01:42:28,819 --> 01:42:37,879
Um, so, so then for clarification, you guys do go to sites and just like not just to, you know, terms that will be released by citizens.

1144
01:42:37,879 --> 01:42:42,049
So we're like, yeah, we do community events to whenever we can.

1145
01:42:42,049 --> 01:42:46,068
Again commits puts the kibosh on that a bit but we do hold five the car seat events I talked

1146
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:52,009
about we hold five of those a month and then we also we'll go more so in the summertime.

1147
01:42:52,009 --> 01:42:59,209
So like if there's community fairs or we've done things in different housing complexes, we'll go there.

1148
01:42:59,989 --> 01:43:03,978
That's a little bit trickier, obviously, just because of the weather and all of those other pieces.

1149
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:11,079
But we really try very hard to go. Clarissa, I know she does classes at Corner House Health and nurses,

1150
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:17,058
so we try to come the community, we try our best and we're happy to go for invited.

1151
01:43:17,059 --> 01:43:22,069
You know, we're like a traveling roadshow. If it if we feel it's a good fit, then we're we're always willing to try and go.

1152
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:28,759
And then whenever we provide education, we try really, really hard to provide equipment to again, if we're telling them,

1153
01:43:28,759 --> 01:43:32,898
you know, we're really sorry this happened to your child, we understand they fill out a second story window.

1154
01:43:32,899 --> 01:43:38,569
You really should be using something like a window wedge. And they said, Well, that's great, but I can't afford a window ledge or what is it?

1155
01:43:38,689 --> 01:43:43,699
Or What is a window? And yeah, so we have this has been I love these.

1156
01:43:44,029 --> 01:43:47,568
So we had some grant money and we developed this program and this is a home safety

1157
01:43:47,569 --> 01:43:52,669
kit and we'll take these into the family and this kind of find them in the picture.

1158
01:43:52,999 --> 01:43:56,109
So we have window. I just as part of this we say here's your window ledges.

1159
01:43:56,129 --> 01:43:59,659
You put this anywhere on your second floor.

1160
01:43:59,689 --> 01:44:04,189
You know, screens are meant to keep bugs out, not kids. And so put this on the window ledge so they can't get out.

1161
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:13,939
Oh, and by the way, here's, you know, cabinet box, here's Pug covers, here's all of these pieces, medication, safety lock boxes.

1162
01:44:13,939 --> 01:44:17,088
If you want to put your medication in there, we have a disposable bag.

1163
01:44:17,089 --> 01:44:20,689
We have pieces to give them, like as much as we can.

1164
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:24,589
Again, in that teachable moment, we have a, I hate to say, captive audience.

1165
01:44:24,589 --> 01:44:29,238
It doesn't sound great, but, you know, they're there and they're willing to learn and they want to prevent the injury.

1166
01:44:29,239 --> 01:44:34,398
And I will say, when we started this process, we were kind of reticent, like you mentioned,

1167
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:43,249
like when do you go in and are they going to be like, you know, my kid, my child's here because they just had a near-drowning experience.

1168
01:44:43,249 --> 01:44:47,209
And you're coming in to talk to me about water safety. We were really concerned about that.

1169
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:50,719
But it's we've actually I found the exact opposite on. Yeah.

1170
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:54,319
If they're happy to get the resources and the information. Yeah.

1171
01:44:54,439 --> 01:45:00,619
Especially when they have because this kit was designed for children under the age of five and then,

1172
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:04,299
you know, we also assessed like developmental needs to.

1173
01:45:04,309 --> 01:45:08,779
And if they have an older child that might benefit from some of these items, we give them a kit as well.

1174
01:45:09,259 --> 01:45:15,049
But the first is like, hey, I'm Clarissa from the injury prevention team.

1175
01:45:15,049 --> 01:45:17,809
And they're like, the injury wasn't prevented.

1176
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:26,809
So we changed the introduction to like I with the pediatric trauma program, I took an injury prevention education.

1177
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:30,829
So I see with every patient we see everybody. Yeah. Not just you.

1178
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:35,479
Every patient that comes in. And I just start listing out water by car seat and stuff.

1179
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:39,769
And what's really nice about these kids is that like,

1180
01:45:39,769 --> 01:45:47,568
let's say we had a kid that tripped on their toys and that's something that like, how do you prevent that?

1181
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:48,979
And I was struck with the parents and like,

1182
01:45:49,219 --> 01:45:55,159
so I have everything in this kid except bubble wrap because that is my my final step is to bubble wrap kids.

1183
01:45:55,699 --> 01:45:59,598
And we start talking to them about like, what about your kitchen?

1184
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:04,729
What about your living room? What are some other areas? Because children learn by exploring their environment.

1185
01:46:04,999 --> 01:46:08,649
And how can we create that environment to be a little. Are safe.

1186
01:46:09,099 --> 01:46:11,318
And some of them will say, why have these items?

1187
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:16,389
But I don't have that or I don't I haven't even thought about any of this because my kid just started walking.

1188
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:21,789
And that really gives us an opportunity to offer the kids free of charge.

1189
01:46:22,689 --> 01:46:28,238
And they I tell them, like, even if you have outlet covers or because those are I think those are the cheapest

1190
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:33,319
items that you can pretty much find anywhere that even if you have that,

1191
01:46:33,339 --> 01:46:35,549
do they go to grandma's house? Do they go to daycare?

1192
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:42,859
Do they go somewhere else where you can take these extra items to create all of their environments a little safer than they were before?

1193
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:49,629
Well, even go to is if you do have a safe place for your infant to sleep and we can kind of assess that with social work staff.

1194
01:46:49,629 --> 01:46:53,828
Our social work in the hospital is pretty amazing and then we can give them a parking place.

1195
01:46:53,829 --> 01:46:57,579
So there are some supplements we can do them. If we don't, we feel we need to have.

1196
01:47:00,759 --> 01:47:09,248
You mentioned, but people taking this to other people's houses, how do you also communicate with people who are parents?

1197
01:47:09,249 --> 01:47:15,488
Like a lot of times I would imagine that the person bringing the child into the yard is the primary guardian.

1198
01:47:15,489 --> 01:47:21,039
But it's not all the injuries and all this happening in the home or with the friend or degrading.

1199
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:24,819
There's like, how are you extending that education?

1200
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:29,198
Is it just kind of like giving pamphlets and hoping that it makes it to the next person?

1201
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:34,869
Or is there a way to make sure it's making it to other people in this child's life who could be responsible for it?

1202
01:47:35,619 --> 01:47:43,389
Yes. And more so, we created a handout that goes with the kit and then it's also available on our website.

1203
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:55,809
And the handout is an outside and indoor picture of the home, and it has a very simplified image of each item in the kit and how to use it.

1204
01:47:56,049 --> 01:48:04,618
So it's just like really short sentences and it's, it's heavy on visual so that they can explain to the next person that they're giving the kit to.

1205
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:11,088
You are using these items and saying, Hey, they said that with button batteries, kids should swallow those.

1206
01:48:11,089 --> 01:48:15,489
So to put a piece of tape over the compartment like they did in this picture,

1207
01:48:16,179 --> 01:48:20,739
and then we always tell them, you know, we have our the information on our website.

1208
01:48:21,009 --> 01:48:30,009
So if you're going back to the daycare center, to the sitters or to the other caregivers home, you can share this with them as well.

1209
01:48:30,009 --> 01:48:34,089
We also give them our contact information, too, and we put that out there.

1210
01:48:34,119 --> 01:48:40,179
You know, you go home and you have any questions about this, or if you want us to talk to someone else, to have them call us.

1211
01:48:40,959 --> 01:48:46,089
Do they ever do that? Not not very often. I don't think I've ever had a call.

1212
01:48:47,499 --> 01:48:55,238
I would get the number. But we try. We really do try and we offer it to them so that they know.

1213
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:58,209
And something else is that we're there Monday through Friday.

1214
01:48:58,209 --> 01:49:07,088
So after hours we are really working with spreading the word with the rest of the medical team to say these are the resources we have,

1215
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:09,388
these are where they're located, so we're not available.

1216
01:49:09,389 --> 01:49:16,899
When you have an ATV injury, here's the handout, here's the guidelines, here's the here's some videos for child passenger safety.

1217
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:24,729
So we have like this tool kit for them to utilize to so that they still have that opportunity to receive education into how to contact us later.

1218
01:49:26,549 --> 01:49:27,749
Yeah. Yeah.

1219
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:37,819
About whether or not these programs are the same year by year or are things kind of tailored based off of looking at trends from the registry that.

1220
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:45,629
So yes. So there are some that we continue from year to year.

1221
01:49:45,639 --> 01:49:47,879
This is an actually a pretty new project.

1222
01:49:47,879 --> 01:49:54,689
But we are ready because, you know, everyone seems to think at the hospital we just have endless amounts of money and that we can support this.

1223
01:49:55,139 --> 01:50:01,859
Everything we do is grant funded. There's nothing that we very little that we do that we, the hospital or our department pays for.

1224
01:50:02,309 --> 01:50:06,089
So really being able to continue a program like this would be amazing.

1225
01:50:06,299 --> 01:50:09,499
And we're already planning for when like we purchased 500 of these kids.

1226
01:50:09,509 --> 01:50:12,809
So what do we do with the 500 or so we do?

1227
01:50:13,559 --> 01:50:17,309
But if we have things that come up again, like I talked about, distracted, pedestrian,

1228
01:50:17,609 --> 01:50:20,789
we have sometimes you have to pivot and be like, okay, what are we going to do for this?

1229
01:50:20,789 --> 01:50:28,179
Like how are we going to do education on this? And actually, we have a video game on the App Store about being a safe pedestrian.

1230
01:50:28,209 --> 01:50:31,438
Like, again, kids are tricky, too. That's what I found doing.

1231
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:36,569
Pediatrics, we can't what works for me doesn't work for, you know, an eight year old.

1232
01:50:37,649 --> 01:50:46,439
So we really, really have to think of what's next and how can we deliver this education in a different way for distracted driving.

1233
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:52,799
We have a VR game like and it's not they're not driving the car, they're driving a spaceship and trying to do all these different things.

1234
01:50:52,799 --> 01:50:58,978
So we're trying to I call it putting putting broccoli in the brownies like we don't eat the brownies, but they're getting the broccoli.

1235
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:02,599
So they're playing the game, but they're learning like what you want them to them.

1236
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,439
So. I always have to shut up.

1237
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:12,379
I just want to say they will do anything to reinforce and reinforce thinking about this, not just ditching.

1238
01:51:12,529 --> 01:51:18,349
For example, as I talk to my students, they are usually much more advanced with like the.

1239
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:22,219
I can't imagine that because I don't think they would.

1240
01:51:22,999 --> 01:51:26,419
I wasn't a fox. I don't know. My friends. I don't know.

1241
01:51:27,379 --> 01:51:31,278
So sometimes maybe we didn't like reminders like this is important.

1242
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:34,339
They need to look after themselves even if the chance is low.

1243
01:51:34,349 --> 01:51:37,489
Like, I know I did all of this when I was my first.

1244
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:47,109
So when we provide resources like we we give every patient, we see a book to preventing injury, a resource book and.

1245
01:51:47,469 --> 01:51:51,698
And. Well, I mean, I know. Clarissa, we'll have the conversation. Do you have other children in the home?

1246
01:51:51,699 --> 01:51:54,629
And have you thought about this as a resource or that as a resource?

1247
01:51:54,629 --> 01:52:02,109
So like injury prevention specifically, we're more focused on the child that's there, but we really try to look at the whole picture and.

1248
01:52:03,379 --> 01:52:08,449
What we can do is provide. Yeah. And the families will bring up the other children in the home too.

1249
01:52:08,839 --> 01:52:14,209
And they'll say, like, well, this happened because I was the I was in the other room taking care of the baby,

1250
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:17,419
and then they got into this or they did that.

1251
01:52:17,429 --> 01:52:26,478
So we do when we do our assessment, we talk about everyone that lives in that environment and how this is not only meant for the patient,

1252
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:30,379
but it can also help everyone else stay safe as well.

1253
01:52:30,769 --> 01:52:34,838
And yeah, we do get those reminders if even if we're talking about car seats, okay.

1254
01:52:34,839 --> 01:52:37,939
If you have a car seat for this patient that's here, what about for your older kid?

1255
01:52:37,939 --> 01:52:42,949
You have any questions about that booster seat? And that's how we try to reinforce that.

1256
01:52:43,739 --> 01:52:49,819
They're very receptive towards a. This is just these are seasonal safety issues.

1257
01:52:49,849 --> 01:52:52,739
I that I just put them out there just for information.

1258
01:52:52,769 --> 01:52:58,779
So, again, we look at the at the season and try and predict what the injuries will be or what they need to consider.

1259
01:52:58,799 --> 01:53:05,158
So like this one here, we talk about winter travel and you don't leave the big bulky coats on your kids when you put them in the car.

1260
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:11,308
So they become and even having them, something like this can open up a conversation, you know, that they're here for or whatever.

1261
01:53:11,309 --> 01:53:14,339
But that's way. I always keep my parka on the kids when I put them in.

1262
01:53:15,179 --> 01:53:20,669
So it's a good a lot of these things are conversation starters are really that's what we're trying to do.

1263
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,769
So I wasn't supposed to keep the big parka. Yeah, well, it's hard to take them off.

1264
01:53:26,609 --> 01:53:30,829
And as you were mentioning earlier, with weather conditions in the winter months, the,

1265
01:53:30,839 --> 01:53:36,058
you know, the road being hazardous and the chances being higher for a car crash,

1266
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:43,679
you have a kid that's buckled in in a coat, even us as adults, when we go in with our coats, that seatbelt is enough to that extra layer of fabric.

1267
01:53:44,249 --> 01:53:50,279
But for a small child or a baby, they can just slip right out of that.

1268
01:53:50,279 --> 01:53:57,239
And that's where we see these really severe injuries in children when they come in due to a motor vehicle accident.

1269
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:00,209
Yeah, I was just curious, like,

1270
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:07,259
are there what particular injuries stand out that maybe you don't have physical injuries you give to parents or you need to get a bit more creative?

1271
01:54:07,259 --> 01:54:11,579
And how do you advise them about guidance around being safe?

1272
01:54:12,299 --> 01:54:18,838
Like what we've seen like for example, on my room when I was little and I was didn't like listening to my parents.

1273
01:54:18,839 --> 01:54:22,589
So I reached out, got a cookie from a hot tray and I got burnt.

1274
01:54:22,589 --> 01:54:25,609
And, you know, aside from, I guess, keeping the tray out of reach,

1275
01:54:25,619 --> 01:54:30,869
even though it was higher than average for my age, there was a whole lot my mom could have done that I can think of.

1276
01:54:30,869 --> 01:54:36,539
So injuries like that, you guys have had to be a bit more creative and how you advise the prevention for if.

1277
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:42,248
I mean, and we don't see this very often anymore, thank goodness.

1278
01:54:42,249 --> 01:54:46,569
But, you know, car surfing was the thing. How do you do? Enter your friend, don't stand on top of a car like this.

1279
01:54:49,539 --> 01:54:53,949
So there are some things where you have to kind of think.

1280
01:54:54,109 --> 01:55:00,769
I can't think of any other. So they're worth. But that doesn't mean the next week it won't show up.

1281
01:55:00,799 --> 01:55:05,529
Yeah, I mean, I get. Oh yeah. That's a good example type tripod.

1282
01:55:05,569 --> 01:55:14,869
That's like, how, how do we predict that? You know, how do we predict, like I said, distracted, pedestrian, you know, they're just things that we see.

1283
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:21,738
Yeah. What comes to mind is ingestion. So, like, unintentional ingestion is a top one, but it's what they're ingesting.

1284
01:55:21,739 --> 01:55:28,519
So like for fun batteries, we have something for, like, medicine that kids mistake for candy.

1285
01:55:28,529 --> 01:55:33,049
Got it. But when it got like now, now we get to this too.

1286
01:55:33,049 --> 01:55:40,188
We have included CBD gummies because cannabis yeah so many cannabis ingestions but you know,

1287
01:55:40,189 --> 01:55:43,668
so that's why as this part of our kit, that's what this is.

1288
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:46,939
So we'll be like, hey, if you have any guys, those can go in there too.

1289
01:55:46,969 --> 01:55:51,768
Yeah. So we really again, we're not there to judge, you know, this is what you have at home, this is what you have.

1290
01:55:51,769 --> 01:55:56,349
But this is here's resources for whatever you have. You don't have to tell us specifically what you have.

1291
01:55:57,739 --> 01:56:00,799
Um, so we do try to go into the community a lot.

1292
01:56:00,799 --> 01:56:08,448
Again, our safety topics, kersee boosters and seatbelts in and around cars that a lot of the equipment we have again is about starting a conversation.

1293
01:56:08,449 --> 01:56:14,869
So this piece of this behemoth piece of equipment here, that's for hyperthermia.

1294
01:56:15,619 --> 01:56:22,248
So this temperature here tells you that ambient temperature outside that's inside the vehicle at the same temperature when it's 76 degrees outside,

1295
01:56:22,249 --> 01:56:25,819
it's 146 degrees in the car. So it's really cool to drive the point home.

1296
01:56:26,299 --> 01:56:29,629
Hey, you think it's a nice spring day, but look how hot it gets and how quickly.

1297
01:56:31,249 --> 01:56:40,219
Medication, safety, safety, water safety, all of these things we have and again, we have information and equipment for most of these things.

1298
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:45,529
And then we are the lead agency, first aid kits, Huron Valley.

1299
01:56:45,529 --> 01:56:50,418
So if you hear of that group Safe Kids, there's different chapters.

1300
01:56:50,419 --> 01:56:51,979
It's actually worldwide.

1301
01:56:52,879 --> 01:57:02,868
But we're the local chapter for that, for Washtenaw, an intensive entry to their site, see, because they'll also post things like what's trending.

1302
01:57:02,869 --> 01:57:12,049
They'll have data that they will refer to in reference and different initiatives or events that are doing to help prevent childhood injury as well.

1303
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:19,308
And this is just some things in the community, again, you know, have interprovincial travel pretty much anywhere.

1304
01:57:19,309 --> 01:57:24,799
But yeah, having conversations about your friends with children of other children,

1305
01:57:25,339 --> 01:57:31,779
because I was raised in a house raised by my sister and I'm like, that's a family responsibility for her.

1306
01:57:31,839 --> 01:57:36,228
And I can't imagine. Like, what does that conversation look like as a child?

1307
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:39,679
For a child? Yeah. Yeah.

1308
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:45,168
I mean, our Safe Sitter program, we do have safe so yeah.

1309
01:57:45,169 --> 01:57:55,219
So do you teach six days that are courses where we meet with kids that are like middle school and above and talk

1310
01:57:55,219 --> 01:58:02,749
about safe babysitting practices and how to keep themselves safe and and the children that they're watching safe.

1311
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:09,679
But that one's really hard because it's not uncommon for us to meet a parent that has three kids.

1312
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,419
The oldest is nine. They have two jobs and it's summer.

1313
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:17,899
They don't have anybody to watch them. So they trust that nine year old.

1314
01:58:18,979 --> 01:58:23,659
And what you want to do about that?

1315
01:58:23,659 --> 01:58:30,379
Right. So we do talk about making sure that they do keep that they teach from safety.

1316
01:58:30,379 --> 01:58:35,039
So when it comes to like heating up like those cups of mac and cheese and what, you know,

1317
01:58:35,059 --> 01:58:40,729
like the temperature goes out of the microwave if they're using the stove to use the back burners,

1318
01:58:40,729 --> 01:58:49,129
bringing those pot handles in and that they're using these home safety products, we have like emergency contact magnets that we give them.

1319
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:54,308
But to be honest, that a lot of us, not a lot of the caregivers are going to be tell us that they're not going to say,

1320
01:58:54,309 --> 01:58:59,479
hey, they're not so much as my kid, you know. So that's not something that would often be offered to us.

1321
01:58:59,479 --> 01:59:03,529
Yeah. So we try to include that in our educations have mentioned it.

1322
01:59:03,529 --> 01:59:08,839
These are good things to start educating these older kids on with the hopes that they they do that.

1323
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:14,779
But yeah, this one I was left at home with my older cousin because who was going to watch me.

1324
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:21,979
Yeah. So someone mentioned law enforcement.

1325
01:59:22,099 --> 01:59:25,549
What? She was reporting to Child Protective Services.

1326
01:59:26,119 --> 01:59:29,609
I'm sorry, what injury triggers your reporting? Injury?

1327
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,558
Yeah. You know, it's more so the circumstances of the injury.

1328
01:59:33,559 --> 01:59:36,979
Again, delayed prevention is a big it's a big thing.

1329
01:59:37,759 --> 01:59:39,769
Lack of supervision. Lack of supervision.

1330
01:59:41,629 --> 01:59:49,609
I hate to say that an injury specifically leads to all this always goes is is reported again it's more so around the circumstances of the injury.

1331
01:59:50,689 --> 01:59:55,098
There's are some injuries that raise red flags if kids come in with spiral fractures.

1332
01:59:55,099 --> 02:00:01,158
I mean, you know, you know, the mechanism that causes. Is that. And you want to make sure that the injury that they're reporting makes sense.

1333
02:00:01,159 --> 02:00:06,289
But their developmental knowledge. If they tell me the you know, the four month old walked across it and fell.

1334
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:12,199
You know, I mean, that just doesn't make sense. Not that anyone would do that. But, you know, if it's not, the story changes.

1335
02:00:12,199 --> 02:00:16,799
There's all kinds of. It's more so in what's reported to us, not necessarily just on the injury.

1336
02:00:20,389 --> 02:00:29,259
And we try to make that very. Objective that, you know, that it's we're looking at what happened and what occurred.

1337
02:00:29,269 --> 02:00:33,219
So we check boxes, you know if they're under a certain age that these types of injuries.

1338
02:00:35,409 --> 02:00:42,189
So we thought it might be helpful because we have so much like every question you ask, I'm like, we've got this, we've got this, we've got this.

1339
02:00:42,669 --> 02:00:45,699
But we thought it might be helpful to take one of our injury prevention topics

1340
02:00:45,699 --> 02:00:51,219
and kind of talk about what we did to develop a broad program around that,

1341
02:00:51,219 --> 02:00:54,969
like what we did in the community, what we did in the hospital, what we did from physicians,

1342
02:00:54,969 --> 02:00:59,768
nurses, pharmacists, and then what we do for caregivers and what we do for our patients.

1343
02:00:59,769 --> 02:01:04,959
And when you think about that, that's hard. Like how do you do education to a four year old and a 14 year old?

1344
02:01:04,959 --> 02:01:08,528
That's very different, right? So we have to have very specific resources.

1345
02:01:08,529 --> 02:01:14,739
So for those age. So we're going to talk about one of the things we went to oh, sorry, I didn't know this was like this.

1346
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:19,629
So the one of the problems we looked at was opioids and medication safety.

1347
02:01:19,959 --> 02:01:27,158
So we looked at our community health needs assessment and we looked at what what needs were identified within our communities.

1348
02:01:27,159 --> 02:01:34,049
And that was lost in our county. It was done by our hospital and then Saint Joe's and Ypsi.

1349
02:01:34,059 --> 02:01:39,369
So they kind of team forced our together forces and did this community health needs assessment.

1350
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:45,939
And one of the things that was identified was the opioid crisis. So we looked at that and said, okay, how can we affect that?

1351
02:01:46,179 --> 02:01:51,369
You know, we've seen an increase in opioid related overdose deaths.

1352
02:01:51,819 --> 02:01:56,259
So in 2011 there were 29 and 2018 there were 80.

1353
02:01:56,499 --> 02:01:57,999
So that's quite a jump.

1354
02:01:57,999 --> 02:02:03,819
And I'm sure even the updated numbers are probably even more striking as we're seeing more and more things coming into the community.

1355
02:02:05,229 --> 02:02:07,899
But we looked around and we said, okay, what is available for kids?

1356
02:02:07,899 --> 02:02:14,469
Run out into reinventing wheels if they're out there, you know, well, maybe slap some amazing blue on it, make them look pretty.

1357
02:02:14,469 --> 02:02:18,969
But we don't need to, you know, recreate a wheel.

1358
02:02:18,969 --> 02:02:26,709
And there was really nothing that was specific for kids. There's a lot of parents and there was a lot for teens, but not you know,

1359
02:02:26,799 --> 02:02:32,618
it talked about the pre event things we're trying to to talk about these issues and problems before they become an issue.

1360
02:02:32,619 --> 02:02:36,869
So we really felt like there was an opportunity to develop things for little kids, too.

1361
02:02:38,259 --> 02:02:43,199
And we were fortunate enough to get a grant through Kohl's department stores.

1362
02:02:43,209 --> 02:02:47,179
It was a multi-year grant, and so that paid for a lot of the things that we did.

1363
02:02:48,429 --> 02:02:53,648
So this is all the things we were talking about. So one of the key things we try to do at community events is just start the

1364
02:02:53,649 --> 02:02:57,519
conversation like come over and talk to us and we'll tell you why this is important.

1365
02:02:58,089 --> 02:03:01,209
And this is a great conversation starter. We actually have two of these boards.

1366
02:03:01,839 --> 02:03:07,148
We learned them out, if anybody's interested, because again, we're not looking to develop resources that only we can use and have.

1367
02:03:07,149 --> 02:03:13,179
We want it to be, you know, something that everyone can do. And this is medication versus candy there.

1368
02:03:13,179 --> 02:03:17,078
Side by side, people come up and they have to guess which is which CBD.

1369
02:03:17,079 --> 02:03:23,019
Now we tell which one's CBD and which ones, candy and which ones the pot and which one's not.

1370
02:03:23,709 --> 02:03:32,558
And that was really interesting when I had to explain to the hospital that was purchasing CBD with my university credit card.

1371
02:03:32,559 --> 02:03:35,799
Yeah. And these rainbow ones are also CBD like.

1372
02:03:35,799 --> 02:03:39,458
So again, it's starting the conversation and saying like if you're having trouble,

1373
02:03:39,459 --> 02:03:44,108
imagine a four year old or a three year old or a two year old looking at those that type have,

1374
02:03:44,109 --> 02:03:48,089
you can maybe see why they would think and I know teenagers also do think.

1375
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:51,219
Yeah, but you know, again, it's starting a conversation.

1376
02:03:51,489 --> 02:03:57,609
Yeah, we've had two little toddlers come and point to this and be like candy and their parents are so embarrassed.

1377
02:03:57,609 --> 02:04:03,269
They're like, I keep those up high on my arm and I'm not questioning you.

1378
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:07,148
This is this is why we're doing it, you know. Well, and we found what we're at events.

1379
02:04:07,149 --> 02:04:12,369
And people are like, well, I don't have kids in the home anymore. I'm a grandparent. I'm like, well, I bet you have a battery of pills in your purse.

1380
02:04:12,579 --> 02:04:17,019
Yeah, like, oh, let me play. Yeah. So is it low trend or is it a tic tac?

1381
02:04:17,559 --> 02:04:20,679
You know? And so it's been really great. It just, again, starting the conversation.

1382
02:04:20,679 --> 02:04:25,419
So that was one of the things we did when we did a community. It's like a book grab to get people to come over and talk to you.

1383
02:04:25,989 --> 02:04:30,669
And again, we try really hard not to just hand out pamphlets as how effective is that really?

1384
02:04:30,669 --> 02:04:35,139
I mean, we tried and sometimes we have to if that's the opportunity we have, but we try not to.

1385
02:04:35,769 --> 02:04:37,808
So I'm actually going to give the graphic, personable back.

1386
02:04:37,809 --> 02:04:43,269
So this was a graphic we designed to be almost like I said, it's kind of like passive injury prevention, right?

1387
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:48,099
People see it, they read it, and then hopefully they retain it at some point. So we develop the graphic.

1388
02:04:48,099 --> 02:04:50,109
We try to keep everything like colorful,

1389
02:04:50,109 --> 02:04:59,588
easy to read and not a lot of words so that someone can kind of get the gist of it just by looking at the graphic that we had there.

1390
02:04:59,589 --> 02:05:04,599
So we focused on the topics for parents about giving medications to their kids safely.

1391
02:05:04,599 --> 02:05:13,808
So you stay you don't use a spoon, you use the device, don't give somebody else's medication to your kid, write a schedule.

1392
02:05:13,809 --> 02:05:16,689
So all of these things and then how to dispose of the medication.

1393
02:05:17,079 --> 02:05:23,799
And we have this great graphic and like, well, again, we don't want to put this on another brochure and just handed out.

1394
02:05:23,799 --> 02:05:28,719
So we had the idea of putting it on a bag, which sounds kind of silly,

1395
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:32,378
but if any of you have been in the hospital or you've had surgery or anything like that or

1396
02:05:32,379 --> 02:05:36,969
someone in your family has you go home with a lot of paper and you go home with a lot of stuff,

1397
02:05:37,689 --> 02:05:43,889
especially if you're wrangling kids and they're sending you up a little bucket in case they throw up and the socks and all of those things.

1398
02:05:43,909 --> 02:05:49,419
We thought, Well, if we put it in a bag, they can put all of those things inside the bag and then they can carry the back home.

1399
02:05:49,809 --> 02:05:55,119
So it serves a purpose and maybe they'll read it, you know, in the moment or at the time.

1400
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:59,619
But it's a heavier weight plastic bag. I keep all my bags, I'm use them.

1401
02:05:59,619 --> 02:06:04,929
So I'm like, well, maybe other people do. And then at some point maybe they hopefully that they would read that message.

1402
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:13,049
We have poison control on there. So if they get a hold of something or too much of something that they can contact poison control and

1403
02:06:13,059 --> 02:06:19,689
on our website from our resources to and this has been hugely I mean that's been great because again,

1404
02:06:19,899 --> 02:06:24,099
the nurses were more than willing to hand these out because again, they served a purpose, they were helpful.

1405
02:06:24,489 --> 02:06:29,769
And we see them all over the hospital. The adult side now has.

1406
02:06:31,079 --> 02:06:35,068
Even adopted this. Know my father a little bit. Yeah.

1407
02:06:35,069 --> 02:06:36,449
So it's been. It's been really great.

1408
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:44,549
So mostly these are in post-op and they believe pack you post on the seizure care unit, they take these bags home.

1409
02:06:45,629 --> 02:06:49,408
So it is a start. And then we translated these materials.

1410
02:06:49,409 --> 02:06:54,809
So we thought about when we did this, we want everyone to get the same message regardless of their ability to read English.

1411
02:06:55,229 --> 02:07:01,349
So we have them in these six languages, seven, including English.

1412
02:07:02,189 --> 02:07:06,869
We looked at what our hospital sees as the most predominant languages that they would have a need.

1413
02:07:06,869 --> 02:07:15,149
So that's the Arabic, Spanish and Japanese. So we actually have the bags made in that in those languages too.

1414
02:07:15,449 --> 02:07:18,808
And then the others we have printed in color that they can insert in one of the bags.

1415
02:07:18,809 --> 02:07:21,899
So they were kind of costly to do them in every language.

1416
02:07:21,899 --> 02:07:28,259
So we just looked at the ones that we could and then we also did posters for

1417
02:07:28,259 --> 02:07:32,789
all of our clinics so they could tell us what languages they wanted on there,

1418
02:07:32,789 --> 02:07:34,859
and then they could have up to four on a poster.

1419
02:07:35,249 --> 02:07:40,259
So you've gone to the clinic since they're in English and Korean, you know, anything that they want it to be.

1420
02:07:44,439 --> 02:07:49,599
And then as we were talking about this, you know, again, we kind of think of what would be our ideal state, right?

1421
02:07:49,959 --> 02:07:51,278
So a lot of our kids are getting out.

1422
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,809
A lot of our kids, we're doing a really good job at reducing the number of opioids that patients are being prescribed,

1423
02:07:56,499 --> 02:07:59,559
doing a lot of over-the-counter like Motrin and Tylenol.

1424
02:07:59,949 --> 02:08:03,429
But some of our kids are having painful procedures and they do get opioids.

1425
02:08:04,389 --> 02:08:11,079
So we were really hopeful. We were like, Wouldn't it be great if a pharmacist could like counsel parents on the dangers of opioids?

1426
02:08:11,469 --> 02:08:14,849
And we thought, gosh, that's such a big ask, how else could we do this?

1427
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:19,148
And we were actually part of a task force and we are having the conversation.

1428
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:26,619
The pharmacist said, Look, we already do that. We were like. So they were more than willing to say, Absolutely, we'll do it.

1429
02:08:26,619 --> 02:08:31,179
We'll do this. We know it's important. We know why it's important. So tell us, you know, how we can do this better.

1430
02:08:31,959 --> 02:08:36,399
So they were already doing it for children 12 and under or caregivers of patients 12 and under.

1431
02:08:36,969 --> 02:08:43,838
And we asked them to expand it to all kids under 18. So now any child under 18 that gets an opioid automatically has this mandatory.

1432
02:08:43,839 --> 02:08:48,009
And I say mandatory because they say, you know, have a seat over here. You'll need to talk to the pharmacist.

1433
02:08:48,489 --> 02:08:53,169
If they say, no, I don't want to talk to the pharmacist, we can't make them. But we hope that they'll come over there.

1434
02:08:53,529 --> 02:08:57,129
And then we asked the pharmacy, we said, okay, what what questions are you asking?

1435
02:08:58,539 --> 02:09:02,019
Or What information could we put on a sheet to make it easier for you?

1436
02:09:02,679 --> 02:09:11,199
So then we developed this. This is two sided. Again, we have our same graphic because they can kind of drive that message home and it looks the same.

1437
02:09:11,889 --> 02:09:18,939
Parents can put emergency numbers there. And then this is the part that the pharmacist will go over with them, like when they give it,

1438
02:09:18,939 --> 02:09:22,349
what side effects they would look for, where they're going to keep it.

1439
02:09:22,359 --> 02:09:26,408
All of those pieces, there is a place for signature. We don't it's not a contract.

1440
02:09:26,409 --> 02:09:33,759
It's not meant to be that. But just some more ways that parents can kind of make it custom to their own situation.

1441
02:09:35,419 --> 02:09:39,549
That's the signature thing I would sell on to with a study, and they felt that if they were to sign a contract,

1442
02:09:39,549 --> 02:09:45,219
they would be more likely to to hold itself up as the resource that was meant for

1443
02:09:45,219 --> 02:09:49,359
them to take notes as they go through that counseling to fit so much information.

1444
02:09:49,539 --> 02:09:53,438
But it's not that's a whole lot of information, but it's overwhelming.

1445
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:57,578
At the same time that you have a kid who just got out of surgery or thinking about transportation and how are we going to get home?

1446
02:09:57,579 --> 02:10:00,789
How am I going to afford this? What what are some of the things I need adapt to my home?

1447
02:10:01,629 --> 02:10:08,918
So the handout is meant to serve as a guide for getting them to think about where am I going to keep this when I get home?

1448
02:10:08,919 --> 02:10:10,749
Or When am I going to give it to them?

1449
02:10:11,559 --> 02:10:16,059
And one of the big things we push is we don't want people to keep the opioids out of pain medications in their home.

1450
02:10:16,059 --> 02:10:19,149
So if, you know, they're giving them a bottle of liquid,

1451
02:10:20,049 --> 02:10:24,659
a medication that their child really doesn't use it because they dosed appropriately with the Tylenol,

1452
02:10:24,689 --> 02:10:27,728
Motrin, and they've got this leftover medication. What do they do with it?

1453
02:10:27,729 --> 02:10:33,189
We don't want them to keep it for a rainy day. We really that they can get rid of those things and dispose of them.

1454
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:36,998
You can't just drain. So we actually have a QR code that will take them to Michigan,

1455
02:10:36,999 --> 02:10:42,009
open some of our take back events and you can take like any of your medications and they'll dispose of it safely for you.

1456
02:10:42,759 --> 02:10:46,359
But then we also purchases and each patient gets one of these too.

1457
02:10:46,359 --> 02:10:50,679
So these are deterrent ads and they're drug deactivation bad.

1458
02:10:50,689 --> 02:10:54,699
So you just open the tap, you put your leftover medication in, there can be pills,

1459
02:10:54,699 --> 02:10:59,289
it can be liquids, it can be patches that can be any form, a little bit of water,

1460
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:06,579
seal it up, it solidifies and deactivates everything that's in there, there's some charcoal activated solvent and then you throw it in the garbage.

1461
02:11:07,269 --> 02:11:10,838
So again, we're not just saying, hey, you need to get rid of that medicine.

1462
02:11:10,839 --> 02:11:14,619
We're giving them the resources so that they can actually come to us and the families.

1463
02:11:14,619 --> 02:11:19,869
They get a home safety kit, also get this bag and the kit with them as well.

1464
02:11:19,869 --> 02:11:26,318
So they'll have the medication safety lockbox so that they can keep it there safely when they're using the medication.

1465
02:11:26,319 --> 02:11:34,629
And then they have a way to dispose of it safely when they are no longer in need of that medication, to which it's really nice.

1466
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:39,189
A lot of people don't know what it is. I mean, how many of you have seen this? I thought it was amazing.

1467
02:11:42,869 --> 02:11:50,559
You know, maybe we should have brought one, too, and asked me to take it to credit a whole bunch of stuff.

1468
02:11:50,589 --> 02:11:58,408
Yeah. So staying on that theme with the medication safety initiatives that we've done for 2020,

1469
02:11:58,409 --> 02:12:02,169
it kind of threw this huge wrench nestico towards us because we were like,

1470
02:12:02,679 --> 02:12:06,849
we had this we had all these plans to go out to the community because they're like, all right,

1471
02:12:06,849 --> 02:12:14,619
we got the providers and education to go out in like in house, throughout the hospital, in the community.

1472
02:12:15,099 --> 02:12:21,579
What are we going to do? So we were thinking about doing presentations, going to schools, doing workshops,

1473
02:12:22,689 --> 02:12:31,119
and then design all these different resources for kids because there really wasn't anything for little like Headstart kids,

1474
02:12:31,329 --> 02:12:36,439
elementary school kids about pain medication safety or alternatives to treating pain.

1475
02:12:37,029 --> 02:12:42,339
So one thing that we did during all of the quarantine time that we had.

1476
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:49,089
Was we created a series of medication safety videos geared towards children.

1477
02:12:49,239 --> 02:12:58,299
This is geared towards school aged children, and they're categorized by age because we had to like have some form of a guide there.

1478
02:12:58,299 --> 02:13:03,668
But really what we tell the providers and caregivers is that you can kind of use the

1479
02:13:03,669 --> 02:13:08,559
age to select developmentally like which one would be appropriate for the child.

1480
02:13:08,919 --> 02:13:13,299
And the videos go about keeping medication safe.

1481
02:13:13,719 --> 02:13:20,229
What is pain and alternatives for treating pain? So like an example would be that in the alternatives for Treating Pain,

1482
02:13:20,559 --> 02:13:28,839
there's a segment in the video where they'll talk about cuddling with a soft teddy bear or reading a book doing some art.

1483
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:35,768
They talk about, I'm no longer in pain, so this medication has to be thrown away.

1484
02:13:35,769 --> 02:13:37,179
And how that's thrown away.

1485
02:13:37,629 --> 02:13:48,099
And the main star of the video is this little dog who whose name is Denver, who's actually modeled after one of our therapy dogs in the hospital.

1486
02:13:48,129 --> 02:13:53,049
There's a lot of golden retrievers throughout MONT. And he was let's see, the first one.

1487
02:13:53,049 --> 02:13:59,529
He was like one of the first. The first he's yeah, he retired right after we did all that stuff.

1488
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,689
He was the after and yeah. So we have these videos.

1489
02:14:03,689 --> 02:14:07,889
So between ages 5 to 12, they have the source and they're sure, you know,

1490
02:14:07,899 --> 02:14:15,609
like little cartoons that they can be that can be played at home or inpatient when they're admitted through their room.

1491
02:14:15,609 --> 02:14:19,449
They have these TVs that they have access to the get free get while network.

1492
02:14:20,379 --> 02:14:25,988
So the other thing we did was have videos for caregivers and these were a lot of fun because

1493
02:14:25,989 --> 02:14:32,889
at first we wanted to do like real kids do the kind of like the shows that they had.

1494
02:14:32,899 --> 02:14:36,969
Like kids say the darndest things and just ask them questions like, what is medication?

1495
02:14:36,969 --> 02:14:40,359
What are your parents do with it? We're like, What makes you feel better?

1496
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:46,179
And because we were all quarantined, we didn't have access to all the children we normally do.

1497
02:14:46,539 --> 02:14:53,469
We did it as a cartoon as well, but we got recordings of the kids saying what helps them feel better?

1498
02:14:53,769 --> 02:14:58,179
Surprise, surprise. A bandaid there, Mom. What an enormous.

1499
02:14:58,539 --> 02:15:03,009
A ginormous Band-Aid. Yeah, ginormous Band-Aid.

1500
02:15:03,029 --> 02:15:08,438
Or, like, chocolate milk. So, like, all these really cute things that they talk about.

1501
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:18,489
So. And this one's meant for adults to hear what kids actually know and what they think and what they say about pain and how to treat it.

1502
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:27,479
The other one with a candy bar, that one's also for caregivers that goes over medication safety tips that it kind of walks through the

1503
02:15:27,609 --> 02:15:34,959
that graphic that Amy showed on the bag comes to life and it goes through the process of proper dosing,

1504
02:15:34,959 --> 02:15:39,979
storage and disposal. The next thing we did.

1505
02:15:40,039 --> 02:15:43,519
Those are all in English and Spanish. Oh, yes, yes.

1506
02:15:44,189 --> 02:15:47,809
Denver. Denver is bilingual. Oh, that.

1507
02:15:48,529 --> 02:15:56,658
There's so much there's some things that I'm just like, yeah, we did do that. So something else that we created was this book Thump.

1508
02:15:56,659 --> 02:16:00,109
Ouch. Marcus Gets Hurt. Also available in English and Spanish.

1509
02:16:00,529 --> 02:16:08,749
And this book follows the journey of this little boy who is in the playground one day being appropriately supervised by his father.

1510
02:16:08,899 --> 02:16:16,219
And that's when he was on a swing. And I'll explain that piece in the second why the swing looks like that he gets hurt,

1511
02:16:16,219 --> 02:16:21,109
goes to the hospital, and then it follows the journey of between injury and then recovery.

1512
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:27,379
One very neat and unique feature that the book has is that it can be read in augmented reality.

1513
02:16:27,379 --> 02:16:31,849
So they download an app called Spellbound on their phone or tablet.

1514
02:16:32,329 --> 02:16:40,219
There's certain pages that are marked that they have like a little star on, and they bring the screen over that page and the page comes to life.

1515
02:16:40,219 --> 02:16:45,649
So that with that one where Marcus is on the swing, they can tap to actually make Marcus swing.

1516
02:16:46,009 --> 02:16:51,738
He does not fall off. You do not see his arm even though it is like that.

1517
02:16:51,739 --> 02:16:54,979
But you had a cool but also retraumatizing, so we're not going to do that.

1518
02:16:55,249 --> 02:16:59,299
There's another one where there's he's getting an X-ray done.

1519
02:16:59,299 --> 02:17:07,489
So the doctor comes in and you can hover the x ray over each character's body and you can see their bones.

1520
02:17:07,909 --> 02:17:13,728
And the book talks a lot about this journey of I Got Hurt and I was in pain.

1521
02:17:13,729 --> 02:17:19,619
I went to the doctor. They explained what was going on done for the therapy dog.

1522
02:17:19,619 --> 02:17:26,329
That was actually his guide throughout and talks about pain scale, reading, pain medicine, how to keep medication safe.

1523
02:17:26,689 --> 02:17:33,319
And then the end of the book has resources for caregivers.

1524
02:17:33,619 --> 02:17:37,969
So so the same thing. But here we also included. So we do have the medications safety points,

1525
02:17:37,969 --> 02:17:46,908
but we also included assessing pain because discussing pain for a baby or toddler is very different than assessing pain.

1526
02:17:46,909 --> 02:17:50,929
For eight and ten year old, his budget could be much more marble.

1527
02:17:50,929 --> 02:17:56,359
I'll tell you, we talk about pain scales and how those are used pain journals,

1528
02:17:56,809 --> 02:18:03,649
but using body maps to help identify where is it that it hurts and then alternatives for treating pain,

1529
02:18:04,069 --> 02:18:08,179
which really ties into the medication safety piece because hey,

1530
02:18:08,299 --> 02:18:14,749
if your kids feeling okay but okay means that they were better than yesterday when they were in a lot of pain.

1531
02:18:14,989 --> 02:18:18,769
Maybe we can make them feel better by giving them their soft,

1532
02:18:18,769 --> 02:18:24,799
cuddly blanket or having them watch their favorite show or giving them that ginormous Band-Aid.

1533
02:18:25,069 --> 02:18:28,699
And then we can slowly get rid of this medication that's no longer needed.

1534
02:18:28,699 --> 02:18:34,549
So these resources are to help. I like for caregivers to identify when they can do that.

1535
02:18:36,949 --> 02:18:46,849
So our community of outreach education. So before 2020, I would say that I was out of the office and at community events when I was in office.

1536
02:18:47,209 --> 02:19:01,418
So one of the things we did is a we had this meeting with this youth group at Corner Health and the meeting was meant to be one of those meetings.

1537
02:19:01,419 --> 02:19:05,539
The Teen Advisory thank you. You were with the Teen Advisory Council there at the time.

1538
02:19:05,959 --> 02:19:13,219
And we really wanted to figure out how can we create something to attract teens

1539
02:19:13,219 --> 02:19:17,839
to get deliver information out the teens about opioids and medication safety.

1540
02:19:19,849 --> 02:19:27,079
So when we got there, we had one of the first question was, all right, so like, tell us what you know about opioids.

1541
02:19:27,769 --> 02:19:33,678
So not take them and then I'll see, you know, they're like, that's it.

1542
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:37,668
They just tell us to not do it. But I don't even know what an opioid is.

1543
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:46,129
And really, what if you don't know what an opioid is? So I started talking about opioids like my colleague and I were like, Well, so this and that,

1544
02:19:46,139 --> 02:19:50,349
you know, like when you get hurt and you have surgery, they might prescribe you this.

1545
02:19:50,359 --> 02:19:56,629
And we were just naming off opioids. And then we can see like, you know, things started to click and there was I never forget this.

1546
02:19:56,629 --> 02:20:00,109
There's this one song by future that was really popular at the time.

1547
02:20:00,529 --> 02:20:06,499
And this one girl goes, Oh, so like when he says, Percocet, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1548
02:20:07,819 --> 02:20:11,929
So then they started like reciting the lyrics to the song and they're like,

1549
02:20:11,929 --> 02:20:20,719
So this song that I listen to and I think too loud in the car with my parents or with my my siblings is talking about opioids.

1550
02:20:21,169 --> 02:20:24,949
And then we like, like went into this like reality TV talking about Bad Girls Club.

1551
02:20:25,169 --> 02:20:32,449
You can't be bothered by it. So after getting all of that out of the way, we were like, okay, so what?

1552
02:20:33,019 --> 02:20:36,179
You know, not to do it, everybody's telling you not to take it. Don't do it. Cool.

1553
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:43,359
We got that done. What would be helpful for you at a handout or like PSA?

1554
02:20:43,389 --> 02:20:48,819
Like, how would you want this information delivered in their life? Honestly, just put it all in a piece of paper.

1555
02:20:48,849 --> 02:20:53,179
What it is. What it does. Maybe some some facts.

1556
02:20:53,199 --> 02:20:57,489
Locally, I don't care what's going on in the whole country. I just want to know what's going on in Michigan.

1557
02:20:57,909 --> 02:21:03,879
And like, I don't take it because it can make me sick and hurt my brain.

1558
02:21:03,879 --> 02:21:09,069
Like, how so? These handouts make us a little twitchy because you're so worried.

1559
02:21:09,579 --> 02:21:14,469
Really? You should like all this in one hand. Yeah, because if I don't want to read the whole thing, I'll just go to what I'm looking for.

1560
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:21,069
All right, cool. I made the handout, so it has the header so they can go straight to what they're looking for.

1561
02:21:21,589 --> 02:21:27,069
I think we're running out of time. So sorry about that time, but thank you so much for coming.

1562
02:21:28,629 --> 02:21:31,659
Is it okay? How can I share these slides? For sure.

1563
02:21:32,109 --> 02:21:37,839
And how about contact information with either view is at the end of the slide right here.

1564
02:21:38,129 --> 02:21:42,059
All right. So this is our website. Everything we talked about, you can find out there.

1565
02:21:42,459 --> 02:21:45,818
This was also we have a curriculum to for kids around opioids.

1566
02:21:45,819 --> 02:21:50,289
So let's just focus on the last week now commemorating the loss of our secret.

1567
02:21:52,669 --> 02:21:58,249
That's wonderful information. That's exciting stuff is so good.

1568
02:22:00,049 --> 02:22:03,279
We try I mean, we're great.

1569
02:22:03,519 --> 02:22:08,349
And we actually noticed that.

1570
02:22:08,599 --> 02:22:11,719
Oh, yeah. And that's how we developed that at the time.
