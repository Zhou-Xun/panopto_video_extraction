00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:22,170
Let's talk about the negotiation process. Negotiation is different from other decision making situations, which involve only one decision maker.

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,390
Negotiation is a joint problem solving process.

3
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:38,750
There is interdependence between the negotiation parties because both you and your counterpart face the same negotiation problem.

4
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,700
If an agreement is reached, it represents a simultaneous solution to each side's problem and the solution to your call.

5
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,980
Obama's problem directly affects the quality of the solution to your problem.

6
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:03,360
So the implication is very simple. Solving their problems is a means to solve your problem.

7
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:15,140
In this sense, putting yourself in the other party's shoes is pretty good advice to generate empathy and foster productive communication.

8
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:27,540
And doing so is really for selfish reasons because to influence their decision effectively, you need to understand their problem as they see it.

9
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,740
What counts here is their perception of their interests, not why you think their problem should be.

10
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,220
The best strategy to understand the other party's perspective and your perception is active listening.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,660
What it means is you need to make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person's saying,

12
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,820
but more importantly, the complete message being communicated.

13
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,700
And in order for you to do so, you need to pay close attention to the other person.

14
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,089
And you cannot allow yourself to become distracted by whatever else may be going on

15
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,180
around you or by forming court arguments while the other person is still speaking.

16
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,830
To change the other side's might, you need to know where their mind is.

17
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,800
Then you can peel a golden bridge from where they are now to where you want them to be.

18
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:38,070
In the words of Daniel Baer, an Italian diplomat, diplomacy is the art of letting someone else have your way.

19
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:49,640
So in this sense, negotiation is a form of selfish altruism or using the solution to their problem as a route to solve your problem.

20
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,480
We can apply this principle to the physician contract negotiation.

21
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:01,430
Example If physician compensation is a main concern to Henry for health system, then chess can actually sink.

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,399
Whether or not they could staff the clinics with more nurse practitioners and physician

23
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,760
assistants to substitute for physicians and therefore reduce the cost of physician compensation.

24
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,270
Or is a physician retention is a challenge.

25
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:26,390
Perhaps chess can offer bonuses and additional Edmund's support to improve physicians job satisfaction and commitment.

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,330
The bottom line is this. We need to keep in mind the interdependence in a negotiation and avoid the

27
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,540
mistake of letting your counterparts solve their problems while we solve ours,

28
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:50,200
which will be self-defeating to either side. Let's recap interests patterns and join problem solving.

29
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,670
All play a role in framing the negotiation process.

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:05,690
Negotiation as a joint problem solving is resolved by the party, both creating and claiming value on a sustainable basis.

31
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,820
We can create value by expanding the pie or increasing the worth of the agreement, we decide what was otherwise available.

32
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,970
And climbing value means distributing value fairly among the parties involved.

33
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,650
To attend the goal of creating and claiming value on a sustainable basis.

34
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,550
We should designing a3d negotiation strategy.

35
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,680
The strategy involves action both at and away from the negotiation table.

36
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:52,290
3D stands for three dimensions. The first dimension is developing and using sophisticated interpersonal tactics and process at the negotiation table.

37
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,940
And they may include choosing an appropriate bargaining style.

38
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,590
Setting a constructive atmosphere. Building trust.

39
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,320
Framing issues in a clear and appealing way. Listening, actually.

40
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,300
And communicating dynamically to explore and understand underlying interests.

41
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,710
Deciphering body language in a culturally appropriate manner, and thinking through offers and color offers.

42
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:30,340
The second dimension is to ensure that your processes are informed by the substance and that you structure value creating agreements accordingly.

43
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,790
Substance means that underlying interests are the fundamental raw material that

44
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,940
the negotiation is intended to serve through a joint problem solving process.

45
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:54,940
So a deep understanding of the underlying interests and values should be the compass to guide the negotiation process, not the positions.

46
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:07,300
In addition to substance process is also important. And the issues that we need to consider should include where should negotiation take place?

47
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,880
Should we control the agenda or every kind of discussion be more free form?

48
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,260
Who should play my role during the negotiation. What to do if they stonewall on key points.

49
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,540
So we or they make the first offer.

50
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:37,020
Finally, the third dimension is to look for entrepreneurial possibilities away from the table in order to change the negotiation situation favorably.

51
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,980
When the parties are engaged at the table in a face to face process of discussion over the are given agenda.

52
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,960
Much of the die is cast. So the most effective negotiation.

53
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:59,700
Is to seek to change the situation other than tediously by focusing on the process away from the table.

54
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,950
Preferably before everything is set up. It means that we should think hard about a couple of issues.

55
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,480
For example, who shall be involved in the negotiation?

56
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,520
What is the best way to get them involved in one sequence?

57
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,270
Should they be approached separately or together?

58
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:31,810
Publicly or privately. What are the issues to be negotiated with each of the parties by what process?

59
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:41,290
What to do if no deal is reached? There's three dimensions constitute the architecture of a negotiation.

60
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,970
Effective negotiators are fundamentally entrepreneurs.

61
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:57,280
They seek to maximize the chance of success by getting the right parties to the table to deal with the rice has issues at the right time,

62
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,550
by the right process, focusing on the right set of interests and values.
