1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,900
Yeah. You can watch your and you know.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,300
All right. We'll get started. Everybody, have a good weekend.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:23,010
And anybody, you're doing fine. I saw my net with anybody else.

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,860
It's the game. The game is too fun.

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:42,390
All right. Oh, so today we're going to get into phase one study design, and today is still going to feel like, did I really join a statistics class?

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,080
But I promise we are going to we are actually going to do a little simulation today, so maybe it'll feel a little bit more like that.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,100
But this will become more and more statistical.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,350
A reminder, your first homework was due today. It's always do before class starts.

9
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,280
If you had an issue with that, let me know.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,169
Otherwise, your next homework is due the 15th, I think, and it will be through grade school.

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,060
And so there's like the practice grades, group submission that you can do before that.

12
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,430
That's worth a point. If you don't need to do it, it's not a big deal.

13
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,209
It's but I think it's a you've never used grades go up.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:31,320
It's a good idea to try to practice. But if you're worried about losing that point because you know, grade scope, I'll give it back to you.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,040
Just let me know that like I've used it. I don't need that or just do it.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,030
It's not going to take a lot of time. Are there any other questions before we get started?

17
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,740
Otherwise, choose your project groups too.

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,059
In this class size is slightly standing.

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,360
Maybe I thought some students would drop it, but I don't know if anybody's dropped it yet.

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,720
And maybe that you there needs to be a couple groups of five, but I don't want to go there for the project unless all the groups have four.

21
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,310
Totally first. Okay.

22
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,770
So if you're seeing that there aren't any more blanks, then you can sign up as a fifth, but otherwise try to go in a group that still needs space.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay, so it's in there.

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,420
You're going to introduce phase one studies. So this class is going to go old phase one, phase two, phase three, extra stuff.

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,390
And so we're going to we're going to spend the majority of September all on phase one.

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,320
So today we're just going to figure out what is a phase one study, what's the dose toxicity relationship?

27
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,680
We're going to talk today about three plus three designs.

28
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,620
And it's not going to seem statistical because it's not really anybody can run a three plus three design.

29
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,809
You don't really need a statistician. So we'll talk about the it's all about the algorithm.

30
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,260
So today is about the algorithms, algorithmic designs and will identify some key features and limitations.

31
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,650
We're going to, at the end of today, touch on a different phase one, algorithmic design or a hybrid design.

32
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,880
It's the bias coin design, and that's what your second homework is on. You're going to be doing a simulation of a biased coin design.

33
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,720
So after today's lecture, you can get started on that second homework.

34
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,200
Okay. All right.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,599
So phase one is all about now we're treating in people and we have to figure out what is

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,750
a safe dose to treat people and to move forward with in subsequent phases of trials.

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,870
So the drug must pass pre-clinical hurdles, right?

38
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,150
We have to go through the cell line, the petri dishes,

39
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:49,530
all of that work in mice and or other animals first and show that it is looking good in animals or in in cells.

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,540
And it looks promising and it's not going to be too harmful for for people.

41
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,430
So now we're really focusing on drugs.

42
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,140
So I think at the very beginning I said, you know, there's behavioral interventions and there's drug interventions.

43
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,050
Primarily the phase 1 to 3 terminology is for all drug interventions.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,520
So our assumption in phase one studies is that toxicity increases with dose level.

45
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,590
So the bigger the dose, the higher the dose, the more toxic or unsafe that dose.

46
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,600
Similarly, the bigger the dose we think, the more likely it is to be effective.

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,100
And so we're trying to find that sweet spot where it's not too toxic, but super effective.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,710
Okay. That's a goal of Phase one study.

49
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,390
We're trying to, at the end of it that we want to have the either maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase two dose.

50
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,970
We're going to use these terms synonymously in this course. However, in the U.K., they're a little bit different.

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,090
Basically what they are is the dose that we want at the end of phase one to go into phase two.

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,970
And they have some level of predetermined toxicity that we feel like is acceptable.

53
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,790
In the U.K., the recommended phase two dose is that dose, which we would move forward with.

54
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,290
It's something that has a level of toxicity that we find acceptable, and the maximum tolerated dose is the dose above the recommended phase two dose.

55
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,570
But in the US we primarily think of the maximum tolerated dose as the recommended phase two dose.

56
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,580
Phase one studies are really safety dose finding studies.

57
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,639
And in it, we're going to do a lot of work to figure out how the drug is working, if there's a target,

58
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,300
how it's affecting the body, how the body is affecting the drug, and mainly assess the safety of the drug.

59
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,600
We also, if possible, want to see if the drug looks effective, but that is not the primary outcome.

60
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:58,620
The primary outcome is safety. A lot of times there is PK PD studies done in phase one research that's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,

61
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,459
which I'll describe in more detail following slides. We're very much monitoring any side effects.

62
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,390
So we have lists of toxicities, those which we are okay with and those which are too toxic or too harmful.

63
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,940
Phase one Studies are done on a smaller number of participants or patients.

64
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,400
They usually have a pretty short duration. So phase three studies could go years.

65
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,909
Phase one study shouldn't usually go much longer than a year,

66
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:35,400
although I have a Phase one study in cancer that's been going on for probably four years, which is too long.

67
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,440
It shouldn't it would have it's likely going to get shut down soon because it's not accruing very well.

68
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,540
But clearly there hasn't been any other advances in that area. So they're allowing it to continue.

69
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:56,250
And we want to use the results from this to move the drug into the next phase or to stop the drug if it's harmful from going any further.

70
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:06,920
So phase one can mean different things in terms of the number of doses and what the side effects are on the patients who are treated.

71
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,690
But it's all focused commonly on the safety of the drug.

72
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,310
So we want to make sure that we're finding the safe drug dose that we can move forward and continue study.

73
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,950
There are lots and lots of Phase one trial types. So it could be a completely new drug that we're looking at.

74
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,130
What's the what's the safe dose? It could be a combination of new drugs.

75
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,970
It could be a new drug plus an old drug. It could be the combination of of two approved agents.

76
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:43,340
However, when used in combination, we need to figure out what's a safe way to combine these things.

77
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,710
It can be that we already have an approved drug, we have an investigational new drug,

78
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,160
but we really want to see these PK and PD, this PK PD information about it.

79
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,320
There is lots of different studies that phase one trials could be interested in cutesy.

80
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,999
Something having to do with heart rate food affect is about the metabolism.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,110
The metabolomics of this of the drug bioequivalence is seeing.

82
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,070
Do these drugs affect the body in the same way?

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,850
Right. So again, we're not thinking about are they equally effective?

84
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,070
We're thinking about are they hitting the same target? Are they targeting the same thing?

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,209
And then is it safe? So I said, okay, NPD multiple times.

86
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,310
Let's describe those in more detail.

87
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,580
This is what, like most students over in the pharmacy school learn about this and those who get their pharmd are often interested in these measures.

88
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,340
So pharmacokinetics is what the body does to the drug.

89
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,430
So how does the body metabolize the drug or excrete the drug absorb the drug?

90
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,730
How is the drug distributed in the body?

91
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:04,200
And for peak studies, you often you see these parameters and these variables such as C max or AUC area under the curve, which you all know AUC means.

92
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,650
But in PK language it means the drug exposure to the one half or clearance.

93
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,790
These are measures in terms of like what's the body doing to the drug?

94
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,620
Then pharmacodynamics is what the drug does to the body.

95
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:26,099
So how is it taking the drug affecting other bodily normal things?

96
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:38,009
Right. So what's the count? So counts of things would be in pharmacodynamics or non other non blood level toxicities, molecular correlates,

97
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,160
imaging endpoints, how is the drug affecting the body and what the body should be doing regularly?

98
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,630
So these are things that we're certainly interested in, those especially who are like creating the drug, studying the drug.

99
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,900
Right. Are really interested in I don't usually analyze PK PD data.

100
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,040
This is something that it seems like maybe I don't know,

101
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:11,490
maybe other statisticians do and or the farm D people who are really interested in this end up having more background on how to look at this data.

102
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,900
So I don't usually spend a lot of time or any time with peak PD data.

103
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,700
What I'm really interested in and phase one studies is how do we what number of patients we need,

104
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:28,290
how do we figure out how they're going to escalate or de-escalate for dose levels, what our outcome of interest is, etc.?

105
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm not usually into this piece, but it's important to know what it is and that we could potentially play a role in it.

106
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,980
So our phase one studies are dose finding studies.

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,560
There are initial safety trials.

108
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:52,310
And often what we see is that our our patients are going to be sequentially assigned to dose levels that can escalate.

109
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,159
Based on accumulating data now,

110
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:02,600
we're going to see that there are differences in whether we start low and escalate and or de-escalate or whether we essentially randomize upfront.

111
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:11,000
That depends on the population. Within the Phase one study and the drug and toxicity expected toxicity effects.

112
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:21,170
Our primary endpoint is safety and we call this an endpoint that we're really interested in or is dose limiting toxicity.

113
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:29,330
So has there been a dose limiting toxicity, yes or no? We have this binary endpoint and we're going to have to define dose limiting toxicity.

114
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,730
And I'll talk more about that in a few slides.

115
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,700
Remember, our goal is to find a dose level that we think is safe and that we can recommend for phase two and further, further research.

116
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:48,710
So we're trying to find the maximum tolerated dose or MTD, which is the highest dose with an acceptable delta rate.

117
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,410
And that deal tree we're going to set at each trial for what we believe is appropriate and reasonable.

118
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,680
It's possible that or maybe not looking for the MTD or the AR pizzuti in the recommended phase two two dose,

119
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:09,440
but instead we're looking for the optimal biologic dose or the minimum effective dose, and those have slightly different definitions.

120
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:18,210
Right? So the optimal biologic dose would be based on like hitting a target and working the most effectively within the body.

121
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:26,910
And we would assume that we could only choose the optimal biologic dose if we already know that there's safety or we have the data that it is safe.

122
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:34,170
Right. It could be that all of the dose levels are C, so therefore we're choosing with very little toxicities or choosing the one that looks like it's

123
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:42,750
really hitting the target or is going to where it should be in the most effective optimal way.

124
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,219
The minimum effective dose could be on the other side, right?

125
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,790
That maybe they're all safe and we don't need to get the highest dose.

126
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,090
We're willing to take what looks like a minimal effective dose.

127
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,150
But for for our purposes, for the phase one trials that we're going to focus on and talk about, we're interested in the maximum tolerated dose.

128
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,160
So the dose level, the highest dose level that has the acceptable level of dose limiting toxicities.

129
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:20,620
And like we've already said, the presumption for these Phase One studies is that as the dose level increases,

130
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,739
so dose level on our x axis rate going from 1 to 7, as the dose level increases,

131
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,640
we can see that in the blue is the probability of dose limiting toxicities.

132
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,940
And so the probability of dose limiting toxicities or the probability of toxic events is increasing as the dose level increases.

133
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:46,120
And similarly, the effectiveness. Right, the efficacy of the drug, which we're going to call response for in red, is as the dose level increases,

134
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,050
the drug can be more effective or there's more responses as we have a higher dose of drug.

135
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,370
And so.

136
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:04,750
Right, we can see that as response goes up, it's sort of plateauing so that as we increase dose, there's very little extra increase in the response.

137
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,890
And so what we want to find is the dose level where we have some acceptable level of toxicity.

138
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,180
So that is but it's hopefully on that plateau point of the efficacy.

139
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:24,760
So like we've gotten to the point where it's almost as effective as it can be and we're not going to have too many toxicities,

140
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,940
but we have some acceptable level. So here, right, this acceptable level is 30%.

141
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:40,120
That's you're going to see why we're showing 30% somewhat in our three plus three design in cancer studies,

142
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,770
three or 30%, especially in the earlier days with chemotherapies.

143
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,430
That was usually the accepted rate of toxicity.

144
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,500
But in other studies that could be lower. Right.

145
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,310
We it depends on the definition of dose limiting toxicities, and it depends on how healthy or not healthy the patients are in the study.

146
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,660
All right. So another graph where we've forgotten about efficacy, right?

147
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,720
Because we're not actually measuring efficacy in phase one or if we are, it's very, very exploratory.

148
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:20,010
Right. So here we're just looking at the probability of toxicity or dose limiting toxicities on the Y axis.

149
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,819
And again, we have the dose levels on the X axis.

150
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,149
And so we're going to define this a priority.

151
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:32,850
What is an acceptable dose limiting toxicity rate and then figure out hopefully, right.

152
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:40,800
Have some idea of what this curve is and figure out what that dose level is that matches with the acceptable dose living toxicity rates.

153
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:52,130
So a dose limiting toxicity is a toxicity that's considered unacceptable due to its severity or irreversibility,

154
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:00,930
and it limits further dose escalation. So this is usually not something just like headache or pain at the site of injection, right?

155
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,310
Those are usually toxicities that we're willing to have.

156
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,359
That wouldn't be dose limiting like, okay, well, people can get those, right.

157
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,210
It's not a big deal. Sure, it's uncomfortable, but that's not going to make you know, that will go away, right?

158
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,660
It's not going to change you forever.

159
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:28,720
Dose limiting toxicities are going to be more like maybe issues with blood counts that could really affect the way your body's working.

160
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,840
Right. Obviously, they could be so bad as like stroke or heart attack, but we really want to minimize those.

161
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,750
So it might not even be that that serious.

162
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,250
These are always going to be defined in advance of the trial.

163
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,550
So we're going to continue to talk about that for each trial that we're going to run.

164
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,670
We have to create this document called the protocol, and that lists all the rules, the design, the reason why we're doing the trial.

165
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:01,610
Right. And so in that protocol, that has to be completely set before the trial starts accruing patients.

166
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
And so in that protocol, it's going to say what is a dose limiting toxicity and what level is acceptable?

167
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,650
In cancer drugs that are often given in cycles.

168
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,670
So you get a drug and then maybe six weeks later you get it again, six weeks later you get it done.

169
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,309
And so phase one studies are usually looking at toxicities when in the first cycle, if it's outside of cancer.

170
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:31,070
Right. We're usually looking at pretty immediate toxicities. So here's an example.

171
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:39,770
I'm not going to read this. This is very long. As you can see, I pulled this directly from a protocol that I was involved with in a cancer study.

172
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,110
But this is this is a definition of a dose limiting toxicity.

173
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,600
And so you can see it's very specific. It's not just like one thing.

174
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,750
It's it's specific and measurable, specific to the disease.

175
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,849
Making sure that as we measure information about patients.

176
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:09,650
Right. We can collect this information and know exactly if it's a DLT or if it's just another toxicity that we're willing to have.

177
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,660
So how do we actually run these Phase one studies or who's running these Phase One studies?

178
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,019
Just like other studies, right? This is either coming out of the pharmaceutical company itself.

179
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:35,350
They're developing compounds of drugs and they're gonna test it to see if it's effective and they can move forward for big pharma companies.

180
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:45,639
So the ones that you've heard of, like Pfizer, Merck, JNJ, other other companies like that, they often select preferred sites.

181
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,960
So they work specifically with like hospital clinic sites, or they might do it themselves on site.

182
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:02,530
And they're going to do this really quickly and really intensely so that they can move their drug pipeline along very fast.

183
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,250
For small pharmaceutical companies, they usually aren't they usually don't have a lot of drugs in the pipeline.

184
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,660
They might have one or two,

185
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,570
and they might be more amenable to working with like academics or with some clinician at a hospital and trying to get this this going.

186
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,170
So a lot of Phase one studies, a lot of drug development in general is funded by the pharmaceutical companies themselves.

187
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,340
However, there are some that are funded by, say,

188
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:40,570
the National Institutes of Health or the European version for cancer at least is ee0rtc so they have money, right?

189
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:49,080
They might give grants to investigators who have submitted a proposal to study a new drug, and then there might be other in-house development.

190
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:56,799
So some people here on campus might be working on drugs themselves, and then they could partner with somebody on campus and they might have funding,

191
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,730
whether it's from a company or from a grant from the government, philanthropic money.

192
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,100
They can they can run the study.

193
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:15,770
A successful phase one team has a lot of people involved, and this is actually going to ring true for all of our clinical trials.

194
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:25,490
It's not just the patients and the doctor, it's the patients and the doctor, but also nurses, research assistants who are saying, Hey,

195
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:31,010
do you want to be in a study to specific nurses or research assistants that are collecting the

196
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:38,600
data to the individuals who are setting up the software to collect the data and cleaning the data?

197
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,170
Obviously, biostatistician statisticians are really important to help with the design and analysis of the data.

198
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,840
Pharmacists are involved when it has to do with the drug.

199
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,380
They're making sure that the drug dose is correctly given and that we're doing this in a safe way.

200
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:02,750
Radiologists might be involved if there's any imaging for looking at the drug hitting target or other imaging that's involved.

201
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,090
There could be pharmacists or other lab personnel collecting this data.

202
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,680
So there are a lot of people involved in clinical trials, even at the very beginning with a small number of patients.

203
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,670
Okay. So there are a lot of questions, right? So how do we choose these doses?

204
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,600
How do we choose which dose do we start with? How do we decide who the patients are in the trial?

205
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,880
And then how many patients do we treat and how many patients at a time can we treat at each dose?

206
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,320
How do we decide when we can escalate and or de-escalate?

207
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,040
What are the endpoints? Right. Lot of moving parts here.

208
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,370
And so that leads to a lot of opportunities and phase one design.

209
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,790
I think there's a big misconception that. Not just phase one, but mostly clinical trials.

210
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,650
Oh, well, it's just A versus B, right? It's just like a randomized parallel trial.

211
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:59,030
You just have A versus B, y, y. How is there room to improve or work on that?

212
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,630
How do you have a job doing clinical trials? Right.

213
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,710
But there's actually a lot of questions. There's a lot of room to improve.

214
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,910
There's a lot of room for innovation. And so we are going to work through some of the more standard designs,

215
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:20,030
but you'll see how there can be a lot of different opportunities for different designs and innovation within these.

216
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,620
So the phase one design says we're focused on safety right there, driven by the type and severity of the expected toxicities.

217
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,740
And this is going to figure out the type and severity of the expected toxicities, who the patients are involved.

218
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,730
Are they healthy volunteers or are they sick individuals?

219
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:46,180
So it's the deal. T's are not terrible, like the worst. These are headache and pain at the injection site.

220
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,990
Right? Then we should use healthy individuals because we're not going to ruin healthy

221
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,390
individuals lives by giving them a little bit of a little bit of headache or whatever.

222
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,610
And when these deals are not terrible, most often the Phase one trials are going to look a little closer to experiments.

223
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,679
They might include randomization. They might be able to treat patients at the same time across multiple dose levels,

224
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,620
as opposed to escalating, because we expect very little in terms of the dose limiting toxicities.

225
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,570
What the DLT is are terrible. So we're working with chemotherapy, immunotherapies, right?

226
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:30,850
Much more intensive treatments, treatments for HIV and AIDS that may have irreversible effects.

227
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,739
Then we're likely now going to work in patients. So we don't want to take healthy volunteers.

228
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,910
We only want to use those individuals who are already sick with the disease and

229
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,379
may not have other choices and are basically doing this either as a last resort,

230
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,540
but is unlikely to be helpful and more for the sake of science and other individuals with the disease.

231
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:59,950
When the DLT is are really terrible, our designs will have very careful statistical considerations.

232
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:06,160
Similarly, you have very specific and careful ethical considerations for the patients on the trial.

233
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,179
And so we spent those first, you know, especially the first lecture,

234
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,100
but also the second lecture really talking about ethics because they're going to continue to come up.

235
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,499
And we need whenever we're talking about human patients, right, human subjects research,

236
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,780
we need to be very careful that we're thinking about the ethics in all that we do, even associations.

237
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,749
So if we have very low severity in terms of the dose limit.

238
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,290
Oh, yes, sir.

239
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:40,690
So is there always like an underlying assumption that the patient population doesn't really determine, like what the safety would be like?

240
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:48,670
It would just be consistent. We're just using healthy or sick individuals depending on the severity of the guilty.

241
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,740
Yeah. So the so the underlying assumption is that the patients don't have enough information

242
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,070
about the drug to make a decision about what they would consider as right.

243
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,860
They don't have enough information about what's being studied to make the decision.

244
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:10,540
So the assumption is that the clinician, investigator or researcher who's writing the study has more information to be able to decide,

245
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,420
plus their clinical background to decide what would be acceptable or not in individuals.

246
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,930
It might there might be some work with patients to figure out what they would consider severe or not,

247
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,570
but usually it's assumed to be well known, determined by the clinical investigator.

248
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:35,980
Okay. I mean, the like for like different patient populations, you wouldn't be worried that like.

249
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,280
The drug would be worse for one. Like you're not really considering that in phase one.

250
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,610
Oh, like, okay. Right. So people are very heterogeneous, right?

251
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:56,609
People differ in many different ways. So because we're going to talk about this and it'll be on a slide eventually, we basically are phase one.

252
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,930
Studies are very small, right? So we're kind of ignoring heterogeneity.

253
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:14,490
And in our inclusion and exclusion criteria, most likely we're going to try to get the best the group that has the best chance in this trial.

254
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,780
And so most often in phase one studies, you won't see really old people.

255
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:30,300
You won't see pregnant women, right? You're going to exclude the individuals who the effects might have more issues.

256
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,069
And then in phase two,

257
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:40,860
you're going to maybe open up that inclusion exclusion criteria and assess more across more individuals and then definitely in phase three.

258
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:53,790
So if we have a low severity dose limiting toxicities and we're using healthy volunteers, then these are often randomized.

259
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:02,490
They might actually even be placebo controlled so that there is no drug group and then different dose levels of the drug.

260
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,309
And instead of saying we have to start low and only if that looks safe, go forward, we might say, you know,

261
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:19,740
I really expect that there's very little dose limiting toxicity in that, which is dose limiting is very you know, is low and severity.

262
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,260
We can just give this to these different groups.

263
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:30,510
And so if you write anything about the way that like the COVID vaccine trials were done, they were more similar to this, right?

264
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,730
So there was little expected in terms of the toxicities of vaccines.

265
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:41,579
And so there is usually like a placebo group and then multiple dose level groups and patients were randomized between them,

266
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,190
data was collected and it was decided which to move forward.

267
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,710
So these are minor and reversible dose limiting toxicities headache, rash, colds and dumps, pain at injection site,

268
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:01,650
etc. And so usually we'd set some level of dose living toxicity is maybe it's 20%, maybe it's 10%.

269
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:10,050
And then we're looking to see that the maximum tolerated dose that has the dose limiting toxicity rate less than that.

270
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,850
In meta analysis of Phase one trials, those which had healthy volunteers there,

271
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:24,030
there are shown that they're were they were highly likely to experience some short term bodily changes.

272
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:30,630
Right. They were likely to have some side effects. However, life threatening or serious side effects were incredibly rare.

273
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:39,930
So in healthy volunteer phase one research, we are mostly doing this right in a there is very little risk involved.

274
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,850
But there are definitely, definitely still ethical considerations.

275
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:55,200
Do you still up the dosage, even though it's beyond like the expected like optimum dose,

276
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:02,129
like would you try to find the safety limit in the phase one trial, even if it's like double what I usually know,

277
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:11,010
like usually is if you if you're also measuring like a target, you're hitting a target,

278
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,400
you usually are going to go forward with the minimum effective dose.

279
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,659
If it's if it looks safe, there might be a reason where you could potentially if it all looks safe,

280
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,740
you could go you could go into phase two with two doses, one,

281
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,030
the minimum effective dose, and two, the optimal biologic dose, which, if it's still effective,

282
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,830
you could go for it and then see if there really is a difference in it in the efficacy.

283
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:43,870
Yeah. All of the levels just determined the dose limiting toxicities that determined before something happens in a lab.

284
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,170
Like how is that decided? Yes. So it definitely is determined before the trial starts.

285
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:59,440
And it's determined based on lab data, based on other trials that have been done in similar populations,

286
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:09,760
based on like what the standard of care in that disease is and what the potential toxicities of that is.

287
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:18,670
So it's mainly based on like previous experience or previous studies and potentially could be based on the lab data as well.

288
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:24,550
Like what did they see in mice or monkeys or hamsters or whatever they're using you?

289
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,479
So the ethical considerations.

290
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,860
There are ethical considerations with healthy volunteers, not surprisingly, because we don't want people to have issues after this.

291
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,890
Right. So when we say healthy volunteers, well, what is healthy?

292
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,700
Right. Like my definition of healthy probably differs from your definition of healthy.

293
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,950
And so the inclusion exclusion criteria for the individuals in the trial needs to be set and very clear.

294
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,339
And it could differ from a healthy volunteer trial.

295
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,280
From healthy volunteer trial. The like I said before.

296
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:05,870
Right, is probably not including old or really older individuals, probably very few comorbidities.

297
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:17,600
Often these exclude people with diabetes or otherwise immunocompromised pregnant women most likely not included in these.

298
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:26,570
And so then there's the question of like, so if this treatment is actually not for healthy people, right?

299
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,080
Like the vaccines are usually for healthy people.

300
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:36,260
It also for not healthy people or others studies that might be going on if this drug is going to be used in individuals who aren't healthy,

301
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,829
is it still effective if we're not looking at those people? Right.

302
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,040
And we don't know in phase one if we're not including those people.

303
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:50,750
So that's the point of phase two and phase three research. Right? Open up our inclusion exclusion criteria and try to understand if it can be used.

304
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,100
You might have to have multiple phase one studies.

305
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:06,020
So a drug dose may depend on if you have specific sicknesses or not and or you might not find a new dose,

306
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,590
but have a subsequent separate phase two or phase three study in a more specific population.

307
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,900
And so with a lot of the vaccine trials, there are taking healthy volunteers.

308
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,920
And then in subsequent phases they needed to see, well, what if someone is a cancer patient and receiving chemotherapy?

309
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,499
Can they get the same dose? Is that effective or not? Right.

310
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,850
So they were looking at data specific to cancer individuals, but some of that doesn't happen until it's called post-marketing.

311
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:43,640
So they actually get the vaccine out and then start looking to see how effective it is, which is definitely ethical consideration there was.

312
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,730
Is that a good idea or should we be doing that ahead of time? But should we also wear them?

313
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,250
Are limiting those individuals who might be the most at need from getting what they need.

314
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:02,130
There's always so there's usually in any clinical trial, compensation for the patients, for the subjects involved in the trial.

315
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,559
Right, which is usually monetary compensation.

316
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,320
We're going to pay you for being in this trial because we know that it's probably not necessarily going to benefit you.

317
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,560
But we appreciate what you're doing for the furthering of science.

318
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,799
But how much do we pay the people? Right. Too much.

319
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,510
And it's like coercive, like, oh, my gosh, I got to be in the study because I need this this money.

320
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,940
Right. And too little is like, you know, not really thinking them.

321
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:36,150
And so figuring out what that what that compensation should be is something that other people work on to get a fair level there.

322
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,780
And it's based on other studies and the population, etc.

323
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:49,860
So I don't work on that part. There are like trial or scientific ethicists working with investigators to figure out those those limits.

324
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,910
And we want to make sure that whatever the compensation is, that it's accounting for the potential risks involved.

325
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,590
Now if we are not thinking about low severity dose learning toxicities,

326
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:10,919
but instead potentially have high severity or potentially irreversible dose limiting toxicities,

327
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:17,730
we're going to be doing the Phase one study in what we're going to call patients, right, like those who have a disease or disorder.

328
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,920
And this is primarily the case in cancer and HIV AIDS research,

329
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:29,460
is that we know that the drugs that are going to treat these are going to be highly toxic.

330
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,790
And so therefore, we would not want to give it to a healthy individual.

331
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,389
We only want to look at the individuals who are already sick or already it might not actually be outwardly sick.

332
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,840
Right. But already have that disease.

333
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,260
In these studies, there's not going to be placebo. There's usually not randomization.

334
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,969
This is going to be a standard dose escalating dose escalation trial where we start

335
00:34:53,970 --> 00:35:00,180
at some low dose and then we only escalate if we believe that that low dose is safe.

336
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:07,590
We're similarly going to have this predetermined level of dose limiting toxicities,

337
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:14,550
and it may in this case be a little bit higher than that which we allow would allow for in healthy individuals.

338
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,400
There are obvious ethical considerations when we're using patients or those with a disease already.

339
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:31,480
We want to know is it is it actually acceptable to purposely induce serious or

340
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:37,509
life threatening toxicity effects when it's possible that these drugs are right?

341
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,440
It's probable that these drugs are unlikely to help the individual actually receiving it.

342
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,400
It is possible that there could be a benefit for the patient involved,

343
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,609
but most likely they're really kind of altruistically giving to science for future patients.

344
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:57,790
They might be too far down the road. And then in that sense, right is informed consent.

345
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:05,769
Truly possible. Maybe the it could be thought that we're kind of coercing these patients to make

346
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:12,400
them believe that this is a last option for getting better when it's unlocked.

347
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,490
You know, possibly or probably unlikely that this drug is going to be effective for that individual.

348
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:27,879
So definite ethical considerations here of when is it feasible to do this and how do you go into writing an

349
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,390
informed consent or getting these patients and making it feel like there is a trusted relationship there?

350
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,060
Okay. So going with these design constraints with which we already kind of hit on by Sara's question.

351
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:50,670
Right. Phase one studies are small, and when we have small samples, we know that our variability is likely to be large.

352
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:59,150
So we're going to have very low precision in our estimates, and we can't start adjusting for those things that are different between people.

353
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:07,139
Right. We can't adjust for these possible confounding factors like severity or their age or their BMI or comorbidities,

354
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,690
etc. We just don't have enough people to do that. Our patients are likely to be.

355
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,560
Yeah. How many people is considered like a small population?

356
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:31,600
That's a good question. So. These one studies were often done on small samples, which I would consider like anywhere from the 10 to 50 range.

357
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:38,200
However, there's been this evolving.

358
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:48,829
Since that Phase one, studies have kind of evolved and where you might see people try to get more data out of it.

359
00:37:48,830 --> 00:38:01,670
And so they ended up testing it on larger samples and kind of say they use what they call what do they call them, like dose extension cohorts.

360
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,600
I forget the exact name,

361
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,829
but they like start treating more patients and almost doing like a phase two design without really being a full face to design at the end of it.

362
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,230
And so they can actually end up being quite large.

363
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:22,220
But the initial definition of small for phase one was probably definitely less than 100, probably less than like 60 or 50.

364
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,720
And it depends on the dose level, right? The more dose levels you have, the more people you're going to require.

365
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,950
But we'll see what the three plus three design. It could be as small as like nine or 12.

366
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,290
So we have these right people differ. We have a small sample.

367
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:51,319
We can adjust for the confounders. There can be a lot of specific idiosyncrasy and idiosyncrasies and those involved.

368
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,270
And so we might you know, there's limited extrapolation and a potential high false positive rate.

369
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,430
And so that's why this is like the starting point for testing safety.

370
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,050
And then we're hoping to expand and be able to control for those confounders.

371
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:13,190
Look in other subgroups in the next phase phases of study and then also in

372
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:18,710
phase one studies primarily we're looking at relatively immediate toxicities.

373
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,629
Right? So what happens as soon as you get that drug? However, it's possible that as soon as you get that drug, you're fine.

374
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,280
And like hours later, a week later or a month later, you're not fine.

375
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:39,830
Right. And those those potential long term toxicities are often not caught in phase one studies.

376
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:46,850
We will talk in a few classes about some extensions which can consider longer term toxicities,

377
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,010
like the time to events, continual re assessment method.

378
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,140
But for the most part, the Phase one studies are looking at these more immediate side effects.

379
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,940
Okay. So how do we choose that? So that was about the patient's right.

380
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:10,429
We're choosing the healthy versus the sick based on the severity of the dose limiting toxicities,

381
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,600
which we're getting from past experience or from previous studies.

382
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,250
How do you decide, well, what are the dose levels that we actually consider in our Phase one study?

383
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:25,909
Well, there's a lot of different ways we can decide this, but primarily it again comes from previous research,

384
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:32,150
whether it's in the lab, in animals and or from cell lines.

385
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:38,690
And we want to find a first dose that we think is slam dunk.

386
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,929
Definitely like not at all toxic. Right.

387
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,159
We want to be able to know that there is some dose level that is going to be very,

388
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,040
very safe and that is going to be our lowest, most likely lowest dose level.

389
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,240
And then we can figure out other dose levels increasing from there.

390
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,720
And so often this is chosen by what we saw in animals.

391
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,800
And a lot of drug research is done in mice or rodents.

392
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,640
And so there is this murine equivalent lethal dose.

393
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,920
And so they can figure out what the dose level was in mice that kills the mouse.

394
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:23,350
And then we want to take a 10th of that. And that would be like the starting dose in humans.

395
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,410
So that sometimes is chosen.

396
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:35,350
Yeah, this might be a silly question, but is there ever a case where if the dose level is like too small, it's like more dangerous?

397
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:43,720
Like, there's a certain threshold where, like, so usually a too small dose is unlikely to be more dangerous in terms of safety.

398
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,240
Like the two small dose will be uber safe, but it won't be at all effective.

399
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,870
And so you're going it's going to take quite a long time to figure out what an

400
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,490
effective dosage you're going to use a lot of patients on non effective dose levels.

401
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:04,989
And that's the that's the primary issue with choosing too small of a dose is that

402
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,260
you're either never going to get to the highest dose level or the dose level you need,

403
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,990
or you're using too many patients or people on the trial that are getting sub therapeutic dose levels.

404
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,910
Yeah. Oh, we talk about those here. Is it just the food we eat?

405
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,290
Oh, we talk about dose here. Is it adjusted for weight? It can be.

406
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:38,510
Yeah. So sometimes the dose level does depend on, like, your your weight or body mass in some way, and that just depends on the drug.

407
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,890
Right. And so at this point, we may already know that.

408
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,780
And me adjusting it alternatively,

409
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,890
it might not be adjusted for weight based on either trying to figure that out and or thinking that it doesn't matter.

410
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,110
So that would in some preclinical work, we should have some idea about whether we need to do that or not.

411
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,689
What is stop. What are the talking of the dolls of our city from Iceland?

412
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,500
From human eyes? Yeah, great question.

413
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:13,319
Right. So what is what is the toxic like? The toxic events or the toxicity is super different from human to mice.

414
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,980
That can definitely happen. And hopefully we find that out with few patients in phase one.

415
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,480
Right. And so that's part of the issues with animal research is that mice are not humans, right?

416
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:32,400
That we use mice a lot because they're very easy to come by it and we can control them very well, but they are not remotely humans.

417
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,260
And so if we start to see different things in humans, hopefully we're seeing that in phase one.

418
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,500
Certainly phase two with smaller amounts of in of individuals and in a very,

419
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,290
you know, in an environment where we're really measuring all of those things.

420
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,450
So will that cause extremely are harmful to human?

421
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:01,439
Hopefully not one. Hopefully not. No. So so they're right in phase one.

422
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,180
We're definitely trying to be super conservative. So if we think that there is any.

423
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:14,860
Possibility of something really bad, right? We're going to start really low dose for the most part.

424
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,940
And this is true for most advancements.

425
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,500
It's not like kaboom! New lightbulb going off out of nowhere, right?

426
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,440
It's like we're making tiny advancements, baby steps off of our previous advancements.

427
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,920
Right. And so we actually know a lot of what we're doing and where we're going.

428
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:38,829
It's the same thing as like, if any of you are considering a Ph.D. in your future,

429
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,240
you think like, how am I ever going to develop new statistical methodology?

430
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,130
Like, that seems outrageous, right?

431
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:51,850
It's not like all of a sudden I'm like, cooking and I'm like, Oh, my God, this new idea out of nowhere, it's going to change life, right?

432
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,310
It's like, Oh, in this trial and this way this could be improved in this small bit.

433
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,360
And so I'm going to work on like this tiny improvement and I'm going to show that it is better in some way.

434
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:08,230
Right. Like most often there are these small baby steps of improvements or new increases in knowledge.

435
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,950
It's not brand new out of nowhere advancements.

436
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:16,300
And so we usually have a fair amount of information about what it's going to be like.

437
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,129
Yeah. Well, this happened in reality.

438
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:34,590
Like if the company said, oh, we have a very like evolutionary updraft that we don't see the same structure from the drugs that have been used before.

439
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,580
And we don't really know the safety like we test on the mice.

440
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:48,840
But I guess the question she ask is not very likely that the reaction from mice can also directly indicates that people is healthy,

441
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:54,450
like useful or healthy enough safety enough for people so that they use monkeys.

442
00:45:54,570 --> 00:46:00,540
This kind of like similar to animals. Yeah. So. So if it is possible, right.

443
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:08,490
The animal chosen may differ depending upon how much we feel like we can extrapolate or innovation or whatever.

444
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:20,220
It's really hard to do research on monkeys. They're very limited and there's a lot of ethical and other constraints, so they're not often used.

445
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:29,340
But different animals may be use based on different targets that we think are closer to humans than, say, a mouse or a rat.

446
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,820
So like guinea pigs, pigs are used.

447
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,230
Sometimes dogs are used. A lot of cancer research is actually done on dogs.

448
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,890
There are a lot of different animals use that. There's some reason that they believe that that system may be closer to a human system.

449
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:53,010
But there in all animal research, there's a lot of ethical issues that need to be considered.

450
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay. So we got this like we have this idea of the lowest dose based on animal research or previous studies.

451
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:11,490
And then we got to figure out, well, what are the other dose levels that we use? And this, I would love to say, is like much more.

452
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,749
Grounded in some idea of the dose levels, but it's actually usually not.

453
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:27,200
Right. So it is scientific, but it's kind of like, well, what do we think the increases could be that we could study and hopefully are safe?

454
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,230
And so there's things like, well, we could just use Fibonacci sequence,

455
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,580
we can use a modified Fibonacci sequence, we could use some sort of constant multiplier.

456
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:42,590
So I start with my dose level one and then right, those two is twice that and dose three is three.

457
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:53,270
How's times dose two and dose four is 5/3 times dose three or you know, just I'm going to choose a common multiplier of like 1.5.

458
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:58,070
So dose two is one and a half times dose one and dose three is one and a half times dose two.

459
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:07,130
Right? This is kind of what happens. It might also be that the dose levels are determined by what's feasible to make in the manufacturing company.

460
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:15,410
So if it's like a pill, right, usually it can't split that up in lots of, you know, an AIDS or something.

461
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,969
Right. And so it's going to be dependent upon what that company how that company can make it if it's an I.V., some sort of liquid.

462
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:33,590
Right. There's a lot more dose levels that we might be able to consider then if it's like a pill or some sort of other other level,

463
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,160
also obviously is going to depend on like what's actually feasible to take.

464
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,630
So if it's a pill, right, could you actually take that large of the amounts or if it's like a nasal spray, could you spray that much into your nose?

465
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:51,200
Right. So there's going to be obviously logistical constraints to these dose levels and then we're going to figure

466
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:59,900
out what they could be and what we hope is still a safe number and size of doses that we could have.

467
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,270
So we want to. Oh, yeah.

468
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:13,360
Um, I haven't read it completely, but like, in terms of cumulative dosage, like, do clinical trials also say like, okay, like, you know,

469
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,750
within 24 hours you can't take like some drugs or if I like it within two weeks, like, you know,

470
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,170
you can't have this process and that dosage because I was into too much of that awesome study.

471
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,330
So. Primarily so.

472
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:36,629
Okay. So it depends, right. Like is so I think you're talking about doses that would be given in like cycles or over time, right?

473
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,960
Some of these studies are just like a one time dosing and gone. Right.

474
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,610
But there are drugs that we might give over time or in cycles,

475
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:55,559
but we usually want to limit the amount of requirements for an individual to take the drug to be effective so that individuals actually take it.

476
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,390
Right. Like we don't want to give a drug that you'd have to say, like, oh, you're going to need to take this every day for a week, right?

477
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,420
We want to be able to like give it to you one time and either that or take it on a weekly basis.

478
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:16,860
We're going to primarily talk about drugs that are either done once or on like a cycle basis, not something that you have to.

479
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:29,720
Take repeatedly over some time, there is definite consideration of accumulated effects in terms of safety.

480
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:36,380
But there is a we're going to usually we're trying to minimize the amount that people have to do something over time.

481
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,719
Mostly just because humans are really bad at following directions. Right.

482
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,620
And so we want to minimize the human error in all the drugs that are taken.

483
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,420
Okay. So we want to start out a safe dose, a low dose.

484
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,010
And then and often actually what we do is,

485
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:03,290
is we have what we think is a safe dose and then we might even have like an even lower dose that is most likely definitely sub therapeutic.

486
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,279
But is just there just an ultimate safety issue?

487
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,190
If we have to de-escalate but we hope to not use that one,

488
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:18,350
we're going to try to minimize the number of patients treated at these super low doses because we think that they're unlikely to be helpful.

489
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,679
And then but we obviously need data on it to make sure that it is safe.

490
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:35,870
Right. And then we're hopefully going to escalate rapidly to increase the dose levels in individuals when there is no toxicity.

491
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,750
And then we're going to escalate slowly or not escalate if we start seeing toxicities.

492
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:48,800
I also should make this clear, which is kind of related to your question, is that we're not actually escalating within a person.

493
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:55,340
Okay. So in phase one trials, we're not giving you a dose and seeing how you do and then changing your dose levels.

494
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:01,580
What we're doing is we're giving like the low dose to some number of individuals seeing how they do.

495
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,920
And then now new new individuals come in and we give them the next dose.

496
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:11,480
Okay. So we're not titrating within individuals or escalating or de-escalating within individuals.

497
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:18,500
You get your dose based on what we know, and then you collect your toxicity information and you're not on our trial.

498
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,160
So there are these two main class. Oh, yeah. Is it harder to enroll patients, though, in, let's say,

499
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:33,730
cancer trials or you expect a severe outcome where the patient is partly enrolling for potential for a benefit?

500
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,200
And you're saying like all you're going to get a sub therapeutic dose? Yeah, good question.

501
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:47,830
So so yes and no because, you know, at the lower doses, it's likely to be safer, but it could be effective, but maybe less effective.

502
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,370
It's just this like balance of safety and efficacy. And often the patients don't actually know where they are in the trial.

503
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,560
And so we'll also talk about that kind of question when we come back at the end of the semester, talking about adaptive designs,

504
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:09,100
it's the same kind of question, like if we start adapting things later in the trial based on accumulated, accumulated, accumulated data.

505
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:15,430
Right, you might be more likely to get the better treatment later, but you don't actually know where you fall in that trial.

506
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,050
But definite ethical concerns. Good question.

507
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,300
So today we're talking about algorithmic phase one designs.

508
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,650
The next five classes are going to be based, are going to be talking about model based designs.

509
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,249
So the model based designs are going to be using that stuff that you learn in.

510
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:44,870
6016 5651 You want to go to what you what you learned last year mostly I think 650 was like a pre rec for this class, right?

511
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:50,170
We're using regression models for the model based designs, the algorithmic designs.

512
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,380
We don't have a model. You don't really need statistics.

513
00:53:53,590 --> 00:54:03,190
Anybody can do them, you'll see. So this first one is an algorithmic design and this is very commonly used.

514
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:09,910
It's called a three plus three design, and it's commonly used because it's so easy and you don't need to engage a statistician in it.

515
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:15,460
So the design goes like this. You enroll three patients at your starting dose.

516
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:22,299
Okay, we'll call that D. One is out of those three patients, we don't see any toxicities,

517
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:30,550
any dose limiting toxicities that we can enroll three more patients on the next on our next dose level dose two.

518
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,510
Right. We can escalate the dose after three people look safe.

519
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,130
There are no toxicities. Let's escalate.

520
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:43,479
If we see that there is one toxicity dose limiting toxicity on that dose one, then we add three more people to that dose.

521
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,850
One to get more data is there is at any point more than one toxicity.

522
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,160
So two or more toxicities on that dose level,

523
00:54:51,370 --> 00:55:00,340
then that means that we have to stop the trial and determine that the that that next lowest dose is our maximum tolerated dose.

524
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:09,690
So in a picture, this is what the design looks like.

525
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,420
And also, when I say those three patients, that doesn't mean like I open the trial and I need three patients to begin at the same time.

526
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:22,290
Okay. In all trials, we might talk about cohorts of patients, but it's never at the same time because I never actually works in real life.

527
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,219
Right. Like, we can't usually get three people. And you're in the clinic right now.

528
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,820
Agree to the study. Okay, we're starting you. Right. It's like I approached the one.

529
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,780
We have this informed consent process. The next week, somebody else might come in.

530
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,620
I approach them and go for this informed consent process. So it's over over time.

531
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:43,110
But we're going to look at it as a snapshot of all of the three patients on this dose.

532
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:56,220
We assess if there are those pre defined DL TS, if there are two or more, then we have to stop re the that dose is not safe.

533
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,670
This says de-escalate inferences in the stores three a it's called a seesaws design.

534
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:08,510
A The three plus three. We don't de-escalate. You just escalate or stop, okay?

535
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,530
In other stores you're going to see we're going to talk about the B, C and D design very briefly.

536
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:20,730
I'll show you what those are. And then at least the C and the D you can do or at least one of them, you can de-escalate.

537
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,819
If there are no toxicities out of those three, then you escalate.

538
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,810
You go up to D2.

539
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:36,630
If there was one toxicity, then you add three more patients on that dose level and then you keep going until you're able to define a DLT.

540
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:44,670
You can see that these using a three plus three design, you're making a decision with that most six patients on that dose level that you decide is the

541
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,700
maximum tolerated dose and you're making a decision with very few individuals total of your design.

542
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,830
It's going to depend on the number of doses that you're looking at. But it could be it could be as little as.

543
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:05,730
They say nine or 12 patients. So here's another figure of what a three plus three looks, right?

544
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:14,810
This on the Y axis is the dose levels are just one, two, three, four, and then time is as we treat these patients.

545
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:20,579
So three patients came in there, no deal to use. We escalated the dose to three patients were treated on dose two.

546
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:28,350
There were no deltas. We escalated to dose three. There is one DLT on within the first three on those three.

547
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:32,070
So we added three more on those three and there were no deal to use.

548
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:37,080
So we escalated to dose four and now on dose four, two individuals had a DLT.

549
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:45,390
So that means that dose three is our maximum tolerated dose or the recommended phase two dose that we would move forward to in phase two.

550
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:51,090
Yeah. What, what, what are we looking at when we consider this patient.

551
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:57,900
Is DLT, are we looking at those effects that they're experiencing.

552
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:01,200
Yeah. So what are we looking at when we decide that a patient has a DLT?

553
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,819
So the DLT has to be predefined and it's going to be different for every disease.

554
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:15,930
So it might be based on blood levels, it might be based on patient reported outcomes, it might be based on some clinician measured thing.

555
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:21,480
Right? So it could be lab data, it could be patient report, it could be clinician report.

556
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:32,880
It's going to be disease specific and predetermined. So especially in cancer trials.

557
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:39,380
This was the first was an article in 2007.

558
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,379
So it was looking at from 1991 to 2006, which now is quite a long time ago.

559
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:52,140
But out of the a little bit over 1200 cancer phase one trials, 98.4% used a three plus three design.

560
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,920
That's very simple. Three, three, decide. All right.

561
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,569
I'm sure that, you know, it doesn't take a statistician to look at that and see some issues.

562
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:05,040
But I think as statisticians, writers, budding professional statisticians,

563
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,120
you can see that there are likely a lot of issues with the three plus three design,

564
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,769
one of which is that you're making a decision based on very few individuals and at

565
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:18,270
most six individuals treated at the dose level that you decide to move forward.

566
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,530
So why is it used? Well, because it's easy, right?

567
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:29,700
Like a clinician wants to start a trial, they don't need to stop and wait for a statistician to help them.

568
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:36,780
They can just very easily write this trial protocol and get started and make those decisions themselves based on the accumulating data.

569
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,559
There's also just like a lack of understanding of why this isn't useful,

570
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,730
and it's probably not that they wouldn't understand is that they're not taking the time to think about

571
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:54,270
it and to talk with a statistician or anyone else who can think maybe numerically about this data.

572
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,880
There's a lot of. This is work.

573
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,010
This is what we've done. So this is just what we're going to continue to do in medicine.

574
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,450
That isn't always the best way to go for it.

575
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:13,220
Right. But unfortunately, it's easy. It's fast, and it's what people know.

576
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:19,610
And if mentors teach their mentees this and they don't learn about other, more innovative designs, that just sort of perpetuates.

577
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,280
So it's important as if you go out into the world and are practicing vital statisticians,

578
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,099
you're knowledgeable of the current or more innovative or updated designs.

579
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,360
And you can you can help educate those that you're working with.

580
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:41,370
Know. Okay, yes. This is fast. Like this is easy to implement. However, here are the problems and here are the alternatives.

581
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,399
Designs that we might consider. And this is why this might be better. And ensuring that this is.

582
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,160
Here are the alternative lines and this is how this might be better. You're probably going to show them what we call operating characteristics.

583
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:59,930
So you're going to show them about how the operating characteristics or features of the trial differ between these different designs.

584
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:07,270
We'll talk more about those operating characteristics. So if we want to evaluate these designs, right.

585
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:13,200
Or figure out what these features of the designs are that differ, we can use the Monte Carlo method.

586
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,650
And this is essentially like simulations. Okay.

587
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:21,549
So how many of you have run a simulation? But very few, actually.

588
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,030
This is actually kind of better. Like a third, maybe. Usually not.

589
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:32,860
A lot of people at your stage have in the program have actually done simulations, but you're going to get some practice if you haven't already.

590
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:41,830
But before we get to what a simulation is essentially right, we're going to be interested in this like binary outcome.

591
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,700
Is there a dose limiting toxicity or not?

592
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:55,540
That's phase one, right? Or we can think about, you know, if we want only want to move forward with phase one is did we find a maximum tolerated dose?

593
01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:00,100
Is this dose vaccine tolerated, dose or not? In phase two, we're interested in moving forward.

594
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:05,319
Is this is this agent active? Does it look like it's effective in phase three?

595
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,400
Is is it is this new agent actually much better than the standard of care?

596
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,690
So for now, we're going to be focused on this one quantity,

597
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:19,360
which we're going to call the probability of C or C is the quantity of interest that some specific dose level.

598
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,530
For example, dose two is found to be the maximum tolerated dose.

599
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,340
So we're going to look for this probability.

600
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:32,390
That dose two is found to be the maximum tolerated dose, which is going to be right.

601
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:38,320
If we did this trial over and over and over again in each trial, is the trial is the probability that we found.

602
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,810
Right that that dose two was actually that TD. Out of all the trials that we run.

603
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:53,360
So we can look at this in this hypothetical framework as if we're doing the trial over and over and over again.

604
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:59,089
And we're going to we're going to run simulations. We're going to run the hypothetical trials, right,

605
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:04,790
with what we believe the toxicity levels are of the dose levels and see how often we

606
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,730
find the dose level to be the maximum tolerated dose across all of these trials.

607
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:16,640
So Monte Carlo methods are saying that we're going to create some number of hypothetical trials, just say thousand here.

608
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,479
Usually we try to do at least a thousand, maybe 2000 or more.

609
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:29,059
We're trying to get it so that the error based on the number of trials we're doing is low, and we're going to try to estimate this quantity.

610
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:35,629
So we want to estimate the probability that dose two is the maximum tolerated dose at each trial.

611
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:41,450
So it is or isn't in each trial. And we're going to sum that up and divide by the number of trials that we actually did.

612
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,829
And this is going to be what we call an operating characteristic.

613
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:50,479
So this is one of many potential operating characteristics of an operating

614
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,620
characteristics or some feature of the trial that we might be interested in.

615
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:59,779
So how many times do we find those two to be in the empty? It might be how many?

616
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:07,510
What was the percentage of of dose limiting toxicities in each trial right there?

617
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,790
These might be different features that we're interested in and figuring out.

618
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:17,520
So these operating characteristics are just some levels that we're interested

619
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,290
in that define the performance of the design under some specified conditions.

620
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:31,479
But we require what we call a data generating mechanism, meaning that, right, we're generating the data, we're creating these hypothetical trials.

621
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,260
We're pretending like there was a clinical trial run, but there wasn't.

622
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,120
Right. We didn't have people involved.

623
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:43,000
We're pretending as if they were in the computer and we're generating this data and then we're going to analyze it.

624
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,709
We are going to specifies all the parameters involved.

625
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:56,920
So how many doses are there? What's the what do we think is the true dose limiting toxicity at each dose level?

626
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,239
And right, we make decisions based on the design that we have.

627
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,100
So if we're implementing a three plus three,

628
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:13,810
we're deciding whether we escalate or say that we need to put more patients on a on that dose level or that we've actually found that in two.

629
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,330
So operating characteristics are going to be conditional on a particular truth

630
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:24,730
or on the particular setting that we set up for our simulation scenario.

631
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:37,850
So for example and this code, I have it in on canvas so you can run it yourself to get experience with it.

632
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:46,999
You don't have experience with running a simulation. So this set speed is just saying that if I run this simulation today, right,

633
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,110
and I set this, see, it's like a starting point for random number generation.

634
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:55,790
If I run it today on this computer, right with this seed, I'll get these results.

635
01:05:55,790 --> 01:06:02,029
If I run it tomorrow with the seed, I'll get the same results. I can actually replicate my results by by setting the seed.

636
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:07,519
If I don't set this seed, then the computers are going to randomly decide what these numbers are.

637
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,839
Right. And they're going to differ between today and tomorrow. If I run enough trials, that doesn't matter, right?

638
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:20,090
I should if I average over time, it doesn't matter where I start. But if I don't run a ton of them, then it can it can matter.

639
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,380
Okay. So I'm going to do 2000 simulations.

640
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:28,309
I'm saying that if I just have two dose levels here,

641
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:36,050
I'm saying that the true probability of dose limiting toxicities for the first dose level is 10%, and for the second dose level is 25%.

642
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:46,780
And then I'm in number ten and I'm running a three plus three design and I'm going to generate the data for every possibility.

643
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:53,700
So this cohort, one way is I want to generate three patients, right?

644
01:06:53,710 --> 01:07:02,170
That got dose level one that their dose limiting toxicity rate is 10%.

645
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:12,549
Cohort one B is if there was one toxicity and I had to enroll three more patients on dose one, that would be cohort one B right.

646
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:18,690
I only need cohort one B if there's one toxicity. Cohort two is going to be okay.

647
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:27,570
Now I've escalated either because there are no toxicities out of the first three or there is only one out of all first six.

648
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:34,050
Right. And so now I get three patients who are on dose two with the probability of toxicity of 25%.

649
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:40,830
And then if there was one out of the three who had a toxicity on dose two,

650
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:52,409
then I would get cohort to be to have three more patients on that dose two and I would see right if there was zero toxicities we

651
01:07:52,410 --> 01:08:01,500
would stop and declare that the MTD because there's no escalation here and if there were two toxicities on dose two right away,

652
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:04,980
then we would stop and declare dose one, then two.

653
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:12,030
Okay. So there's these, like rules of how we're going forward with the MTV.

654
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:23,620
I tried to put in the comments here so you could read this, but I'm going to run this code generating all these code words, right?

655
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:29,410
And then I'm going to figure out what is the probability that my dose one is the MTD.

656
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:38,830
So in order to do that, I'm saying how I have to figure out what are the options for the three plus three running where dose one is the MTD.

657
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:46,389
So that could happen if there were in all of these in all of those enumerated cases, right.

658
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:58,959
If there were zero toxicities in cohort one A and if I had to go on to one B or if I had to go on to one B, there is only one, right?

659
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:06,910
So there are either zero toxicities first or if there was one, there were more than one and I would declare dose one.

660
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:10,719
The MTD if in those two there are too many toxicities, right?

661
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,920
So I'm just writing the logic for how I can declare dose one my MTD.

662
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:28,940
And so you can see that if I run this, I get .40 440, it's 40% and 40% of all these trials where we're going to choose dose one is the MTD.

663
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:37,100
How often are choosing dose two in 48.84%.

664
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:43,970
Now that doesn't add up to one. Why? Why doesn't it add up to one?

665
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:50,430
Less than does one. And could be that there was one is too toxic, right?

666
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:58,290
It could be that we got two or three and those toxicities already on dose one.

667
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:02,520
And so the one minus .404 minus .488.

668
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,480
Right. That would be the probability that neither dose is safe.

669
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:17,670
Okay. So that's like one simple way in a very few dose levels that I could run a simulation.

670
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:21,540
You can see here, I must have had some other seed.

671
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:26,310
Sorry that I got point four, three, five and .72.

672
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:33,209
Also, it depends whether using a mac versus or windows and like what our version you're using for actually replicating those results.

673
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:36,930
So if you notice that you and your friend are going to run these and one has a mac and

674
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:41,640
one has a windows and you're using the same C and it's actually unlikely to be the same.

675
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,830
Okay. So if you have your computer and you get the code and you can use the code.

676
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:56,990
Maybe I'll just maybe I'll just do this. But I, I, I in interest of time, I won't make you do this because we don't have a lot of time.

677
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,780
But I suggest that you open our studio later and actually play with this.

678
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,290
And so we did 2000 simulations.

679
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,740
But what happens if I make this 200? Is it going to change?

680
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,210
Probably right now we have a lot fewer simulations.

681
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,820
So our average is going to be less precise, right?

682
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:32,040
Less close to the truth. It's going to differ. And so it just so happens that right, we went from .404, 2.46 now and we went from .488 to .445.

683
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:39,780
Right. So you can see that we don't want our estimates to depend on the number of simulations.

684
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:43,680
Right. Good operating characteristics are going to be stable.

685
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:49,860
And so that's why we use a high number of simulations.

686
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,050
Let's see if I make it 20,000. This is this is easy enough that it's not going to take forever to run.

687
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,010
Right. But I get 0.4 to 1.

688
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,440
So that's actually different than 1.404.

689
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:11,310
You want the number of simulations to be run to be high so that your estimates are going to be stable and it's not going to depend on that.

690
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:15,660
And so the number of sim of simulations that you run is very important.

691
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,629
And again, you want it to be you want to be high,

692
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:24,630
you don't want your operating characteristics to depend on the number of simulations you want it to depend on the setting,

693
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:31,380
the the probabilities of dose limiting toxicities, the number of patients treated at each dose level.

694
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:39,509
Right. And this is good. It's going to show you that if you change the seed, right, things could change because you're starting at a different place.

695
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:45,210
However, if you use enough simulation, if you use enough number of simulations, it again should be stable.

696
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:56,820
Okay. So there's another. So in this our code there is like that simple code of just two dose levels,

697
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:07,020
but then there's much more general code of use of doing a three plus three where I'm going to let you look at this code and play with it.

698
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,490
But you can see that you input the probability of toxicities that you think.

699
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,299
And that's also going to define the number of dose levels that you have.

700
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,300
So say you are thinking about five dose levels you put like.

701
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:25,070
So you yourself, right. Are just making these up. But like in real life, if you're doing a phase one trial,

702
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:30,440
you're talking to the clinician investigator who says, you know, we're going to look at these four doses.

703
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:36,800
And we believe that the probability of dose limiting toxicities of these four doses are ten, 20, 30 and 40%.

704
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,080
You for just thinking about this concept can just make up some numbers in here.

705
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:50,420
And so you'd put in what you believe are the true deal T rates, which is going to also define the number of doses that you have,

706
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:59,569
the number of simulations, and then set the seed and then you can run this, this function which is quite large.

707
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:06,980
So for example, right, you can use this for sorting where it says we have one, two, three, four, five, six doses.

708
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,890
Right. And we believe that their dose loading toxicity rates are five, ten, 20, 30, 50, 70%.

709
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:17,480
We're running 2000 simulations and we just set to see that one and then.

710
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:29,340
If we run this. All right.

711
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,000
What we're going to get out of it are all the results.

712
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:42,520
We're going to see what our MTD is estimated at, what how many people are on the how many people are on this window.

713
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:52,169
It doesn't look very much how many people are on each dose level, what the truth scenario was, and a summary about our MTD.

714
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:58,260
So here, if we look at the MTV summary, right, that was this last summary information.

715
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:06,479
It's the probability of dose limiting toxicities at each dose level, right.

716
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,389
Based on this, the three plus three design of the number of participants on each dose level.

717
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:17,520
So like for example, right doses five and six have super low toxicity rates.

718
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,960
And that's because we didn't we barely treated anyone ever on those dose levels.

719
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:22,890
Right.

720
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:30,210
And so that's why they looked so low, because it was in most trials, we never got to that point because it was we learned that it was too toxic.

721
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:39,870
So I suggest that you go play with these and thinking about the simulation, because for your homework you're going to do a biased coin simulation.

722
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:44,309
And so it's helpful to have an idea of how those stories a simulation works.

723
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:49,710
In order to go into that, we have five more minutes.

724
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,120
So the source, as we've already said, is super easy to implement, right?

725
01:15:54,120 --> 01:16:00,690
You don't need a statistician. You can as you observe the individuals, you can make decisions.

726
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:04,950
And so it's model free and it's used because it's so easy.

727
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:09,120
However, the target deal t rate is actually quite unclear, right?

728
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,450
So if we're trying to specify what's the acceptable amount of dose limiting toxicities,

729
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:26,730
it's really set by the design in a three plus three design, and it turns out to be around 20%, but it depends on the of the setting.

730
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:33,299
And so the safety and tolerability is only tested on a maximum of six individuals.

731
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:37,770
Right. We decide with three or six about that dose being anti.

732
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:45,299
We have to observe toxicity outcomes in the cohort as we go in order to make that decision of whether we can increase or not.

733
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,890
So they have to be immediately observable toxicities.

734
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:56,849
And because of that, it's relatively it can be slow escalation because we have to accrue all three people see

735
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:01,350
those toxicities before you make a decision and there's no de-escalation in that three,

736
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:03,480
the standard three plus three or any design.

737
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:12,420
We also can't handle complicated situations like combining drugs or multiple endpoints or other information.

738
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:21,149
You can see that one very extreme con of the three plus three is the mass amount of

739
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:26,130
uncertainty in our estimates because they're only based on three or six individuals,

740
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:33,510
right. If we have zero toxicities, our 95% confidence interval goes from 0 to 71%.

741
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:41,310
If we have six people treated at the dose level and one toxicity are 95%, confidence interval goes from 0 to 64%.

742
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:45,390
So we're saying that these are safe dose levels.

743
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:51,150
However, they could have probability of toxicity as high as 70 or 60%.

744
01:17:51,780 --> 01:18:01,290
Right, which doesn't seem very safe to me. So we're making decisions on very few people, highly variable results, right.

745
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:05,910
That is potentially very harmful to go forward in phase two.

746
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:15,150
Also, you can come to the same decision about what the maximum tolerated doses in very different scenarios.

747
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:25,080
And so here these are four different trials that all choose dose two as the MTD, but you can see they look very, very different.

748
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:32,820
And so it's a little unnerving to think about how we can land on an NTD in such different ways and have very little uncertainty about that.

749
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:38,760
Okay. So we'll start with this actually at the end of the next class,

750
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:43,770
but what I want to move on to really quickly and I'll I'll review these slides at the end of next class,

751
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:49,740
but I told you you'd be ready to do homework, too, so I just want to set you up for homework to if you want to get started.

752
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:57,989
So there are other options, but we're going to call up and down designs so that you could escalate doses or de-escalate doses,

753
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:02,910
and one of which is called the Bias Queen Design. And that's what you're going to do a simulation for, for your homework, too.

754
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:15,420
And essentially what it is, is that you enroll a patient or a cohort of patients, and if they have a DLT, then you have to go to the next lowest dose.

755
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:28,460
Okay. So you de-escalate dose levels. If they don't have a DLT, you flip a coin and you decide whether if it shows tails, then you would.

756
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,790
Enroll a patient on that same dose. So say you're at D2, there is no DLT.

757
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:37,570
You flip a coin, it's tails, new person goes on D2.

758
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:44,200
Okay, if it showed heads, this is actually a typo here. Even though it was an application, you escalate.

759
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:49,180
So tails same, those heads escalate.

760
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:57,010
Right. And you you can decide what that coin probability is, right?

761
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:01,150
So it doesn't have to be 5050. You can make it 6040 if you want to escalate faster.

762
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:08,890
Right. If your 60 is heads and you that's that escalate or you can make it smaller if you don't want to escalate so fast.

763
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:13,000
So you're going to have to program this in. R Right. You get a patient.

764
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,520
A patient comes in. Do they have a deal to or not?

765
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:21,290
Right. That's going to depend on the probability of dosomething toxicity that you set for the dose level.

766
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,489
If they don't have a deal, you've got to decide, right? You've got a program.

767
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:28,820
What's the move? You flip a coin, do you escalate? Do you stay the same?

768
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,100
You're going to go through that for a certain amount.

769
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,860
And I give you more parameters of how you're going to do the simulation, but now you should be able to read the homework.

770
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:42,140
So I have some idea. Look at the R code that I've given you for stores A and try to put it all together.

771
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:47,300
If you're interested in reading more about the bias coin design, you can Google it and find a paper to read.

772
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:56,280
Woman Yes. Sarah Is it just based on a total number of patients or is there a stopping role for this one?

773
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:00,950
I tell you the number of patients. So I tell you like 20 max patients.

774
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:06,260
My patients. I think in your homework.

775
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,560
I think maybe that changes. For example.

776
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:17,300
Okay, so we'll stop there. I'll I'll go over the last part of this before we start on the model based on science on Thursday.

777
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:23,210
If you have any questions and office hours or you can email me or thank you.
