1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,690
Okay. All right.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,550
So so today we you know, we have a kind of sorry.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,770
I mean, we have a strange week, obviously, each Wednesday.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,580
Normally, our presenters will won't have it on Monday.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,590
I'm going to continue the conversation about measurement on Monday.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:39,600
And then on Wednesday, Dr. Victoria Alison Kovach, who's a recently completed her Ph.D. here in epidemiology with me,

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,839
is going to talk to you about stress and measurement of stress specifically.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,440
So using some biological functions that she used in her dissertation.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:55,800
So I'll I'll obviously be here, but we'll have a good conversation to to hear about a specific case example of measurement.

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,950
But today we're going to continue this conversation on the DSM and on.

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,680
You know what? There's also there are two videos that were online in addition to the readings

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,930
that hopefully you had a chance to look at before today's lecture maybe.

13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:25,520
So, well, I'll see if you have any questions about approaches, schedules versus scales, and in general, certain sorts of error in survey research.

14
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,739
We'll have a small group discussion about your check point number one, which is, of course, was due today at the start of class on Monday.

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,270
We're going to do an activity where you're actually going to interview each other with some of the

16
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,770
tools that are actually used and public mental health and sort of generating what people say.

17
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,100
Look, for some people have depression. We're going to use the tool that people use to do that.

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,049
Okay. So I'm sure that you've seen headlines like this, right?

19
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:06,350
So this is just some recent stuff with COVID, you know, but you can see that Michigan is 15th in our in the nation in terms of mental health,

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,889
young adults report rising levels of depression, anxiety, depression, triples among us adults, etc.

21
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,190
And what I hope that you will come away with today is that the very first question you should ask

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,599
yourself when you see this headline or headline like this is What do they mean by depression?

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,959
How do they measure depression? What do they mean by anxiety?

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:39,470
How did they measure anxiety? Because as you're going to learn today and next week, there are there is no thermometer for these things.

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,840
There is no measurement tool that always gives us the same answer no matter what.

26
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,729
And feeling the symptoms of depression and anxiety in particular are not unique to the

27
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,320
disorders of major depressive disorder and panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,900
Every one of you knows what it's like to feel sad. Every one of you knows what it's like to feel anxious.

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,010
Okay. And so if I ask you, have you felt anxious in the past week?

30
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,270
And that's the only thing I ask you. Which is what most of these things did.

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,750
That answer that I get. I'm not saying it's meaningless, but it's not the same as do more.

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,390
College aged students have generalized anxiety disorder today than had them two years ago.

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,860
Right. That's a totally different question. Okay.

34
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,960
You could answer that question, but you can't answer it by asking someone in the past week how you felt.

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,720
All right. So so you may have seen this report.

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,650
So this happened to 20th August 2020. So remember back you're getting ready to start Zoom school.

37
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,649
You are, you know, the summers, you know, panics happening.

38
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,580
We don't know what's going on.

39
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,630
We're like, you know, we're still in pretty severe sort of, you know, restrictions on activities, at least here in Michigan.

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,100
And this this study is what report this is.

41
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,790
This is the study that produced this headline. So this is The Washington Post.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,980
And this is the actual study, which is a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report.

43
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,790
As the name implies, the CDC publishes this this type of thing every week.

44
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,940
It's not always about mental health. And this week it happened to be about mental health.

45
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,780
So. This is this is the reality of what this that headline was generated from this exact data.

46
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,740
So the first is the response rate, which was 55%.

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,640
So only about half the people who were asked to fill out the survey answered it.

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:45,560
The measures of anxiety and depression in this survey were the Q2 and the generalized anxiety disorder to turn the page Q2 in the gap to.

49
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,110
And that means there are two questions each. So and those two questions were these questions.

50
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,110
So these were the two things I asked people over the past two weeks.

51
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,549
Have you have been bothered by the following little interest or pleasure and doing things, feeling down,

52
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,290
depressed or hopeless, feeling nervous, anxious or on edge are not being able to stop or control.

53
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,719
These are the four questions and your your response options were this not at all several days.

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,240
More than half a day's nearly every day. So just pause, just like for a minute.

55
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,810
Like how, Mike I know I can't remember back to August 2020 either, but like at least like last week.

56
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,200
How would you answer this question, these questions? So.

57
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,100
That this is what produces this this headline.

58
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,980
Okay. And so now why why might we where are the where's the disconnect between those two?

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,970
Or is there a disconnect? What motivates me is different.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,350
In what ways is there a disconnect between that headline and what these questions actually are?

61
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,300
The data that actually generate headlines.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,570
I think like these questions kind of just show that maybe you have some of the symptoms of these disorders like in the past couple of weeks.

63
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,170
And I don't know if you actually have that disorder or a mental illness or if you've experienced some of the symptoms.

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,360
So so there's so there's some of the symptoms. So first of all, it's only asking about symptoms and it's also about asking you about all the symptoms.

65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,440
So depression is not just feeling sad or disinterested,

66
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,100
it's also sleeping problems and thinking problems and thinking a lot about

67
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,080
death and appetite problems and etc. It's a whole clustering of those things,

68
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,340
which is also accompanied by what are we talk about last time, but what is your considers depression?

69
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,680
What causes what disability?

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,010
Right. And what does it mean to be disabled? It means in this context, it means to just have a decline in functioning.

71
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,370
Where is there any assessment of functioning in here? And the answer is there is no assessment of function.

72
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,750
So we know that you are experiencing symptoms, but we don't understand.

73
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,380
There's no there's no attempt to understand impairment.

74
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,930
So when and that's important because symptoms of depression and anxiety, one,

75
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,999
are not unique to these these conditions of depression and anxiety, okay.

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,580
Like they're they're part of life. But second, when we think about the need for clinical intervention or, you know, screening or etc.,

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,440
there's we need to sort of have some understanding that this isn't about problem.

78
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,799
It's using all of life, but rather we need to be supporting people who are experiencing impairment from their symptoms.

79
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Right. But there was no assessment. There's not been an assessment made of how much impairment would be experienced by folks.

80
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,530
Where else do you see a disconnect or other comments on this? Yeah.

81
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,770
Two weeks in such a short period. Yeah, this is.

82
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:03,770
Yeah. If this is an opportunity to transition into a solution.

83
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,480
Right. So, so the just for the folks in the back. So there is there's this is happening during the pandemic.

84
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,320
There's no pre-pandemic assessment of this. So we.

85
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:27,910
And also what happens when we ascribe, you know, sort of this this story or this interpretation without kind of understanding the broader order.

86
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,580
I'm I'm also suggesting, like, there's not understanding this within the broader context.

87
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,710
We it's presented as though like this is now poor brain health when what may be happening is like this is poor,

88
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,500
like social health that's happening and that's being experienced and being expressed right there.

89
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,140
Comment. Yeah. So that includes like questions like that and care related.

90
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,620
Yeah. Yeah. And like I say, it's like try to assess that in the end.

91
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Like would they be able to say like people have, like the answer is yes to all of them.

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,350
Like they even still say that these people have like depression or anxiety cause I know they like talk about that.

93
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,629
You don't need someone to interview them in person, but it still feels weird to like survey.

94
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,410
And then they're like, okay, you have depression, anxiety. And so a couple of things.

95
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,390
So first of all, they so the person who's filling out the survey wouldn't have been told, by the way, you have to question.

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,830
So there's no disclosure to the respondent, which is which is interesting.

97
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,549
So we do do that disclosure for like if you have hypertension and I take your blood pressure in a survey,

98
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,750
I tell you, but we don't disclose back to somebody that they had depression.

99
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,110
The second is the impairment would have not been that measurement.

100
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,410
It is true would not because this is not the full assessment of symptoms.

101
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,700
And so it wouldn't have we wouldn't have we still would not have been able to get to a diagnosis according to the DSM of depression or anxiety.

102
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,630
But I would have been able to say this is how many people have impairment as a result of the symptoms,

103
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,660
which is a I guarantee you, a smaller number than the number of people who are experiencing these symptoms.

104
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,350
Okay. So it would have and it would have been, I would say, more clinically meaningful in the sense of.

105
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:24,200
It's again, if sadness and anxiety are part of life, but having impairment and it doesn't mean that you're you know,

106
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,399
we've talked about this class already a little bit how, you know, it doesn't mean that you can't get out of bed in the morning.

107
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,910
That doesn't necessarily that's not necessarily what I mean.

108
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,000
But if it's a lot of effort for you to get out of bed in the morning, that is still in parents.

109
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,910
Right. So it's that element of you are having to work your social life suffering.

110
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,410
So your work is fine, but your social life comes right or something like that, right?

111
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,280
There's lots of ways that depression kind of impairs functioning.

112
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,200
So it still wouldn't have gotten us to a diagnosis,

113
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,360
but it would have gotten us to a more clinically meaningful number versus this number, which is symptoms.

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,510
Yeah. I was just kind of curious how they measured this substance use.

115
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,069
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, that's a great question.

116
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:20,270
So this this would have been just like probably binge drinking and like using any, any sort of we can get this actual w r to read it.

117
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,870
It's like, okay, I should,

118
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:33,800
I should also say there's it's clearly there is like there's this language that implies that the pandemic has caused all of this stuff to happen.

119
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,010
Right? Like some are resorting to substances, like the idea that like, you know, with the pandemic or like it's because they're depressed and anxious.

120
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,040
This is happening. None of that like there's no questions about that.

121
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,130
There's no point in which this survey where they ask people,

122
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,060
are you drinking more because of your depression or are you drinking more because of the pandemic?

123
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,180
Like, there's no point where they assess that there's no pre-pandemic assessment or like a relationship of a causal.

124
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,510
They're not asking the respondent to causally report on that.

125
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,370
So, you know, you may well know that like we've been in the middle of an opioid epidemic for like about 25 years now.

126
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:20,029
So, you know, and of you know, we've had declining life expectancy due to substance use and alcohol problems for years prior to the pandemic.

127
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,709
So the notion that it's possible, of course, that like the pandemic worsened this,

128
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,610
but that was already happening, you know, so it's it's just it's important,

129
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,950
I think, just to kind of understand that the headline does not, especially with mental health, often doesn't sort of have that much data to go on.

130
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm not saying that these things didn't happen, but as a researcher, I don't find this data compelling for that statement.

131
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,610
Right. That claim may be true, but this is not from evidence of a claim being true.

132
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:56,790
Other comments or questions, there's one over here, I'm sorry to say. Oh, okay.

133
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,220
Hope so. And there we go. Right. So this is that this is the headline that we get.

134
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,249
So yeah, I'm I'm sorry for the end, of course here.

135
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:16,400
But again, just as a reminder that the DSM three, 1980s, we get the development of these reliable diagnostic criteria.

136
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,170
The point is to get reproducibility, consistency, not to get the truth.

137
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
But of course, we care about the truth. We all want the truth, right?

138
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:36,290
So what does the truth mean when we're in a situation of this kind of comes to serious question around like,

139
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,860
well, how did different providers do diagnosis?

140
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,970
So so how do you how do we assess like what what what is.

141
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,730
Think about these questions like what is required of the respondent to answer this question?

142
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:06,600
What do they have to do? Like if you were if I asked you this over the last two weeks, have you been bothered by the following?

143
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,740
Yeah. You just think back over all your questions.

144
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,670
So I have to recall the past two weeks. So. So talk to me through, like, literally.

145
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,970
What are the micro steps of that? Today's Wednesday.

146
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,430
Is that the first day? So two Wednesdays. That's what you're asking me?

147
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,470
I mean, you're like, exactly. What's the voice in your head?

148
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,740
Listen, I just feel like I would probably honestly, it's hard for me after your article on why I do.

149
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:42,540
Okay. So you're sort of thinking about that. Those times said like, what is going with your life, right?

150
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,170
Could you even remember back to to Wednesday? What other ones?

151
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,830
Yeah. So you're actually probably thinking about like the last, I would guess like 72 hours, actually.

152
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,690
This question. Okay. Yeah, go ahead. I don't know.

153
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,430
I feel like you would also have to identify sort of like a normal baseline.

154
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,729
Yes. Like make comparisons to. Yeah.

155
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:13,290
So there's you sort of there's some you know, these words must have some meaning, intrinsic meaning to you,

156
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,000
sort of little interest or pleasure in doing things like, well, what does that mean?

157
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:24,720
There wasn't a lot to go on. So like, I don't know how to assess that. Right? And then you've got these response options which are not yes or no.

158
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:32,610
They're asking you again in this two week period, quantify that in terms of number of days, right?

159
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,349
So more than half the days means eight or more days, right?

160
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,159
Technically. Right. Right. So, you know, and I'm not saying that that's what you're doing.

161
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,820
You're not doing that math in your head. Right. But but the the point is, is that there's.

162
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,940
In order for some in order.

163
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,540
Well, the first the first is that everything that we're doing with mental health research in the population relies on self-report.

164
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,490
And reporting on your mental health status is a challenging thing to do.

165
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,630
Now it's challenging because people might not want to disclose.

166
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,350
You know, it's stigmatized. They might not understand what you're saying.

167
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,920
You know, they might not think about it in the way that you're asking about. But.

168
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,049
But there's also just sort of like the fundamental like you have to sort of these these

169
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,050
things have to have a meaning in your mind in order for you to tell me about this.

170
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:32,460
Okay. So I think that and when I say depression, right, like the major depressive disorder, like that's usually not what people have in mind.

171
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,390
Like, they don't have to survive. They're not thinking about the symptoms. So so back to what do we mean by validity?

172
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,400
So in the case of a situation here where we don't have a gold standard in mental health diagnosis, we don't have a blood test.

173
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,360
But I know every single time is going to give me a true answer.

174
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,860
Instead, I have reliable criteria that I hopefully are going to get people to agree.

175
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:03,620
We have things that are less, less stringent, so face validity, which is just like it looks like these questions are assessing depression.

176
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,940
Like these questions are clearly have faced with depression and anxiety.

177
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,970
Construct validity means that it's measuring the full construct.

178
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,260
So everything about anxiety, everything about depression. These questions do not have that because they are only part of those conditions.

179
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,490
Okay. So they are face validity. They look like they're measuring what they what I think they're looking they should be measuring,

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,130
but they don't have construct validity because they're incomplete.

181
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,490
Criterion validity means that it's what what there's something outside of these questions that I'm comparing it to.

182
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,310
So maybe later on in the survey, I asked someone, has a doctor ever told that you've had depression?

183
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,670
And you would pretend for the time being that that doctor diagnosis is the true state of the world?

184
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,989
So if they say no and they don't actually have depression, and then their questions are,

185
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,930
I compare their question answers to that, they say yes, then I assume they really did have depression.

186
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,760
I compare their answers to that. Okay. So the point is, there's some criterion outside for most of our assessments.

187
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,130
This is a psychiatrist diagnosis and what a psychiatrist said. But that doesn't mean that that's the truth.

188
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:13,780
We sort of temporarily hold the clinician, the clinical expert, as the the true answer here.

189
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,890
And then the final is convergent and divergent,

190
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:27,010
which is that your questions about depression and anxiety should predict things like panic disorder or dysphoria.

191
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:37,149
They shouldn't predict ADHD and they shouldn't predict, you know, like subsequent will because these things are correlated.

192
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,430
But like,

193
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,320
it should they should they predict they should predict things like alcohol abuse much strongly and they predict agoraphobia or anxiety disorder.

194
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,160
So that's a convergent versus divergent means.

195
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,980
Interestingly, and this comes back to Marilyn's question about like, why would you not have mental health experts?

196
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,780
Why don't you want them doing your fieldwork? And the answer is, is because they will actually they will not stick to the script.

197
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,610
So on Monday, when we actually go through like this is how you ask about depression.

198
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:14,500
Like when I send somebody into the field to go do a depression scale, it is you ask these questions in this exact way, in this exact order.

199
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,690
And when they say, What do you mean by that? The answer is whatever it means to have.

200
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,040
Would you like me to repeat the question? There's no back and forth. You can't get a clinician to do that.

201
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,250
All right. Clinicians will say like, oh, I know where they misunderstood, or I know how to help them understand what I'm asking you about.

202
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,610
Or I, I already know the answer to this question is yes, because I can kind of tell that they're sad and my trip to Egypt over.

203
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,420
So I'm not going to answer.

204
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm not even going to ask the questions like that's the kind of stuff they do because that's what their clinical experience trains them to do.

205
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:54,579
So what I needed a fieldwork person is someone who is going to be a reproducible expert and a reproducible assessment.

206
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,420
When you are an interviewer, you are the tool of measurement.

207
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,800
So you must have you must be able to form rapport with respondent.

208
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,620
And it doesn't matter if I send you out to that person's house or if I send your classmate out to that person's house.

209
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,270
As long as they asked that person the same questions, they should get the same answer.

210
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,420
And the only way they do that is if everybody agrees you stick to the script.

211
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,630
Okay. So all right. So here we go.

212
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,570
You may have also so that the other thing I would say is like we're in this situation where we don't have a gold standard.

213
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,410
And so in mental health research, we refer to what we call the LED standard, which is an acronym that stands for leading experts in all data.

214
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:42,760
So this lead standard is essentially how we think about arriving on like, is this person a case and whatever sense might be.

215
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,150
All right. I showed you this for just in terms of the world that we live in.

216
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,470
This is basically where we are. You know, maybe someday we'll get here.

217
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:09,450
So this is, at least for me, I was always like very confused by why the DSM is called the DSM with the idea this why statistical is in the name.

218
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,600
It was strange. You know, you think about it. The diagnostic makes sense.

219
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,630
But like, why would there be statistical? Like, why would that be part of it?

220
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,630
The strike. Anybody else is strange or makes perfect sense to you. It's just like me.

221
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,429
Well, I think it also feels strange, but maybe it's just like, if it helps you to diagnose people and get more diagnoses,

222
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,060
then it can give you more statistics on the prevalence of certain disorders.

223
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,790
Yeah, I actually don't know exactly why it, but I'm just it's kind of an interesting thing that certainly I think potentially

224
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,470
helps us understand it as a as a tool rather than sort of the reality.

225
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,180
Um, so, you know, again, as I, our goal of the DSM is to provide reliable criteria.

226
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,000
So to get the idea that these are criteria that can be consistently applied regardless of person, place or time.

227
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,510
And as I just said, there is no gold standard for measuring the disorder,

228
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,740
but that doesn't mean that there aren't better and worse ways to do measurement.

229
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,480
So we've just talked through an example before, way to do measurement, which is asking people for questions for the last two weeks.

230
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,310
And then making a statement about rising levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic.

231
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,570
Again, I'm not saying that didn't happen. I'm not saying that's not true. But where's the data?

232
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,260
And so instead, we have the situation of leading experts, all data.

233
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:51,430
And so the where where I think that the sort of rubber hits the road in terms of I statistical data or I'm going to propose this,

234
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,020
I guess not as an alternative history,

235
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:00,430
but as a way as a way that I think is useful for you to think about why statistical is in the name is the following is that.

236
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:09,520
When it comes to mental health disorder, disease and diagnosis are not the same thing.

237
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,890
So what do I mean by that? So a disorder is what's described in the DSM.

238
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,910
That is a health problem or condition that is described in terms of signs.

239
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:30,430
This is a sign of something somebody else can see about you. So you're limping or your speech is quick or you were agitated, etc.

240
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,930
And a symptom of certain symptoms, which are things that you know about yourself you can report on.

241
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,250
But it's really hard for me to tell about your internal state. So this would be.

242
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:52,240
So what is it? So for something like schizophrenia, a sign might be a catatonic face.

243
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:59,259
So sometimes people with schizophrenia have trouble or they will flesh.

244
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,870
It will speak in a way that is really difficult to understand, like their speech doesn't make sense to us.

245
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,030
And a symptom would be something like a hallucination that I can't observe.

246
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:16,360
They can only tell me about. Okay, so that's a disorder is basically a description of this health problem.

247
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,340
You can contrast that to a disease which is a known technological process.

248
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,290
And so already we can see that the Venn diagram of.

249
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,950
This. Like if that's disease and this is disorder.

250
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,120
We can already see that these aren't the same things because it could be that

251
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,209
we have a situation where there's one disorder that has more than one disease, right?

252
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,480
So cognitive impairment as a a phenomenon,

253
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,400
which is simply a decline in cognitive functioning that we're going to talk about this in terms of executive functioning,

254
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,090
memory, etc. What are some ways that people become cognitively impaired?

255
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,780
TBI Traumatic brain injury, yes.

256
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,310
Of dementia, Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's.

257
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:21,320
It's actually probably six or seven different types of dementia. So there's also HIV related dementia and alcohol related dementia.

258
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,880
There's Parkinson's dementia and Lewy body dementia.

259
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,510
Okay. All of these as cognitive impairment.

260
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,080
And you know, with an Alzheimer's disease, there's early onset Alzheimer's disease, which we think is associated with autism, will dominate.

261
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,240
There's some autosomal dominant genes that are driving this.

262
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,920
And then there's the rest of Alzheimer's disease, which we don't we have some genetic markers, but that is not strong.

263
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,999
There's also Huntington's dementia. I forgot about that. Right.

264
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,910
So there's lots of different diseases underneath the umbrella that if all I had was your performance on a memory test,

265
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,280
I could not tell you which of these things is actually underneath driving that poor performance on the memory test,

266
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,210
because every single one of these diseases has poor performance on that memory test.

267
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,099
Okay. You can also have a situation where you have one disease that's viewed as more than one disorder.

268
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,770
So if you have you have you have a family history or personally have autoimmune disorder,

269
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,300
you're well aware that these are really difficult things to diagnose.

270
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,080
Where, for example, my mother in law is lupus.

271
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,090
And before she was finally diagnosed with lupus, she was diagnosed with like six different other autoimmune disorders.

272
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,569
That and because there's not again, there's not a gold standard test for lupus, it's based on a diagnosis of exclusion and and things.

273
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,260
Finally, what went wrong that they're going to give her this diagnosis of lupus.

274
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:50,020
But the the point is, is that the initial disorder was her spleen, the thrombocytopenia, her spleen kind of went out.

275
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,040
Then she stopped making tears. So she had this other disorder.

276
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:03,790
And then, I mean, literally, these are the and so those if you look at her chart, it's like spleen problems, no tears with chronic pain all the time.

277
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,270
And now we get the answer of lupus, which was probably underneath her the whole time.

278
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,869
Okay, so that's different. So that's one disease.

279
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,450
But it's, it's, it's appearing like it's multiple things.

280
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,200
And both of those things, both disorder and disease, are characteristics of the person in question.

281
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,740
The disorder is the symptoms and signs that the person is experiencing or can tell you about.

282
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,850
And the disease is a pathology. What's actually happening in the person.

283
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,469
Okay. Both of those are characteristics of the person. And this is the crux of some very important piece,

284
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:47,750
is that a diagnosis is a procedure that is used to decide whether a certain disorder or disease is present.

285
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,210
And by that and that means it is not a characteristic of the person.

286
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,710
So you're not going to hear me say.

287
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,150
This person was diagnosed with depression or people saying, well, was it diagnosable depression or depression diagnosis?

288
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,469
That's not a that's not I want you to I want you to sort of set that language aside.

289
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:11,380
We use it in our regular language, but it's not helpful for us because it's helping.

290
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:19,800
This is where the statistics come in. So the diagnosis is a determination or an assessment or I can be less generous.

291
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,930
It's an opinion of a clinician.

292
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,540
So if you're sitting in a psychiatrist or psychologist office or a measurement tool,

293
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:37,270
like those four questions that we just looked at for the NWR that are trying to decide whether it increases or disorder,

294
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,700
is whether this person has a disease. But it is not a characteristic of the person.

295
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,940
It is a procedure that is trying to figure out what is going on in the person.

296
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,020
And so what so let me pause here first quick, because I'm going to go ahead.

297
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,240
So how would you say this? So you say like someone has to question their diagnosis.

298
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:09,580
Let's say someone has symptoms of depression. Symptoms. And if they had it, if a clinician had, I might say they meet criteria for depression.

299
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:16,110
The other way I would say that. So meeting but that meeting criteria is still kind of like not the same.

300
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,900
Like that's it's by. By framing it that way. I'm not saying they have depression.

301
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:31,440
They have symptoms of depression. And those symptoms of depression may or may not meet criteria, diagnostic criteria for depressive disorder.

302
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,150
But it separates those two things. One of them I know is a characteristic of the person.

303
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,259
They're experiencing sadness. They're experiencing a disinterest.

304
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:46,740
They're experiencing sleeping problems. I have this nomenclature that tells me when a bunch of those things occur together,

305
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,230
and I don't have another explanation for why they're occurring together. We call it depression.

306
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,740
But that's that is this procedure, this diagnostic procedure.

307
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,890
It's not it's not a characteristic of the person.

308
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:06,330
So this is a this is an interesting sort of if you think about the distinguish the other way to think

309
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:13,500
about this in terms of recall from Bruce Link's lecture where where is stigma do you think most salient?

310
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:24,930
Is it in the disease of depression? Is it in the disorder of depression, or is it a diagnosis of depression?

311
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,050
Where is stigma most salient, do you think of this process?

312
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:34,320
Three Diagnosis Because I think that stigma around someone like having sleep problems or someone being sad,

313
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:40,200
but when you give it a label, they're like, Oh, well, you have depression and what does that and what what does that label mean?

314
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,350
So there's something about the process of deciding why these things are the symptoms and signs are fine.

315
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,760
Yes, because you get to the like it's like you realize like if you categorize someone's having depression,

316
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,169
you know, that they have all these things and they get like they meet the threshold of having like so severe.

317
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:04,800
They like have depression. It's so, so, so this is so the stigma is happening in the diagnostic label.

318
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,190
It's not necessarily happening in the experience of the symptoms itself.

319
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,440
And you can think about that even interpersonally. Right. So you might tell somebody, you know, I'm really not feeling like myself.

320
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,840
I'm really having trouble with something. Right.

321
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:22,379
And so that that that person is now it's possible that they might say, like, you're fine, don't worry about it.

322
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,650
Right. But but it's also possible that they might sort of start under, you know, looking for an explanation.

323
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,920
You're looking for an explanation yourself. Right. But the point is, you're not seeking this.

324
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,270
You're seeking help for your signs and symptoms. You're not necessarily seeking this diagnosis itself.

325
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:49,769
Right. So that's the other thing is so a diagnosis by definition is something you have or something or you bestow upon someone because it's procedure.

326
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,110
But it is it is binary. This is the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.

327
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:01,370
Are you meet criteria or you don't? There's a yes or no question. The symptoms of depression are not yes or no.

328
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,660
They're going to continue. Even the disease process anything is not a yes or no question.

329
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:16,080
Right. But it's a it's a continuum. Right. Think about, you know, hypertension is when your blood pressure is consistently over 140 or 490.

330
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,169
But there's a continuum of blood pressure. Right.

331
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,600
And we can think about depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms in the same way as like a continuum as your blood pressure everybody has.

332
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,080
It's the question is, is it high and persistently high and is there something you should do about it?

333
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:35,159
So what we are again, we're making this diagnostic procedure, this diagnostic assessment.

334
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,260
We are applying a categorical diagnosis.

335
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,069
Whether that a clinician says you mean diagnostic criteria or whether I administer my scale or schedule to you.

336
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,600
And I determine based on my algorithm that you also meet diagnostic criteria.

337
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:56,850
That is that is a categorical diagnosis that I'm applying to what I fundamentally know is a dimensional construct.

338
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,489
So and what do I mean by dimensional for depression? So only 3%.

339
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,510
This is from older data. This is all the data. So this is 1980s data.

340
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,980
What is powerful about this?

341
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:20,140
This data is the instrument that the SCA used to assess major depression asked every symptom, every every symptom of depression of every person,

342
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,270
regardless of whether or not they endorsed what we're referred to as the cardinal symptoms of depression.

343
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,350
So most studies of depression today will ask you, do you feel sad or disinterest?

344
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,290
If yes, then you get asked these other all these other symptoms.

345
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,190
Okay. So the only way you can ask all these other symptoms, first you tell me this is true,

346
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,530
but then there are lots of people who have depression that don't want to admit to this.

347
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,889
Right, or this isn't how they're thinking about it. Okay.

348
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,520
So maybe they have different words for like, well, you know, it's just really hard for me to get going,

349
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,280
you know, which would certainly be part of sort of disinterest.

350
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,270
Like, I'm not really motivated to do anything.

351
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:11,610
So what, what the data, what this instrument, the diagnostic interview schedule did is it asked every symptom of everybody to sort.

352
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:17,229
So not conditional on did they first endorse feelings of sadness or just sadness or disinterest.

353
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:25,030
And so what we're actually getting is this is the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the population, not depressive disorder, just the symptoms.

354
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,880
Just I just straight up ask you the symptoms. I don't apply any criteria.

355
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:34,060
So what I get is 8% of people in the past six months tell me that they felt sad.

356
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:40,750
8%, right. That's a huge number, right? 10% tell me they've been having sleep like insomnia.

357
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,649
You know, this is hypersomnia. This is back in the eighties.

358
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,060
So the way they measured disinterest was asking people if they didn't have any interest in sex.

359
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,299
I didn't write the questions. Okay. I'm just going to tell you. So this is thinking a lot about.

360
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,390
That's right. What you think like, oh, that's a part of suicidality?

361
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,049
Well, sometimes people just think about death. Maybe they've had somebody die recently.

362
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,100
Maybe somebody sick. Right.

363
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:12,280
So so the point is, is that even though major depression, only 3% of respondents actually met all criteria for or met diagnostic criteria.

364
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,870
The symptoms of depression are very, very common. And so when you think about what are the w what did this CDC report measure?

365
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,219
It measured dysphoria. Right, which is not the same as having all these things come together,

366
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,240
which is also not the same as having impairments doing due to all these things coming together.

367
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:37,229
So but why? So why don't we just why should we just throw out the diagnosis?

368
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:44,639
Like, why? Why do we even need it? Well, we need it because I'm in order to generate an estimate of, like, what?

369
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,060
Percent of people have depression, I have to have a numerator and denominator.

370
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,810
Okay? Like, there's no categories. It's not.

371
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,280
So I need I need a categorical, categorical number in order to get incidence and prevalence.

372
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:10,290
But more importantly, they I need a category in order to make decisions about what to do about those signs and symptoms,

373
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:18,320
what to do about what's happening. So there's if I need to if I to to the way that we should.

374
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,440
Again, this helps distinguish between a disease, a disorder and a diagnosis.

375
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:32,880
A diagnosis. When I apply that categorical label to what you're experiencing, I am essentially making a determination,

376
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:40,140
especially from a clinician, as to whether you should be treated. And then the next question would be, and what would I what would I do?

377
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:48,120
What type of treatment might I offer you? Okay. So without that, if I just say, well, you've got six symptoms of depression.

378
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,160
What you want to do about it or if anything, you know, as a as a patient or if you were on the other side of that, you would say, well, like what?

379
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,690
What do you recommend? You know, like there has to be some sort of decision point, categorical decision point.

380
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,879
We also use it for service planning like, okay, well, how much depression is there?

381
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,480
That tells me how many providers I needed and of what type, where should they be?

382
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:17,000
And so no matter what I do at some point, because the nature of the world for depression is this this is the true nature of the world.

383
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,180
Depressive symptoms are common, but I have to apply some cutoff point.

384
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:27,169
No matter what I do, I am going to get a decrease in statistical power, which refer to as precision in public health.

385
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:32,780
Like that's a word that we'll use to describe this, to actually like do any research or kind of understand what's going to happen.

386
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,610
So no matter where I apply that point, I'm losing information.

387
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,209
And so that loss of information,

388
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:51,680
that idea that you're taking what is fundamentally a continuum and applying a cut point in to in service of these sorts of questions is,

389
00:37:51,680 --> 00:38:00,480
I think what why we call it statistical, because there's nobody who thinks that people that people just have depression are linked together.

390
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,850
Everyone knows that depression is on a continuum and there's not a line in the sand.

391
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,610
There's no blood test, there's no brain scan.

392
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:15,140
There's no like there's no like intensive interview I can do where I'm like, that's a that this this is this is the true depression.

393
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:20,420
Rather, what we ask about is how is your life going, what's going on with you?

394
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,120
And would you be willing to consider what kind of treatment options would you be willing to consider if it's something that you would have?

395
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,720
Okay. See? Pause here. See if there's questions.

396
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,870
It's almost, oh, oh, yeah.

397
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:49,310
But this might be a little unrelated, but in terms of like insurance and access to treatment as a diagnosis, I think our diagnosis is what's needed.

398
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,830
Absolutely. Yeah. You know, there is no access to it.

399
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,860
And so and oftentimes what providers will do. So the question is about, like the importance of diagnosis for treatment access.

400
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,600
And sometimes providers will give a diagnosis of adjustment disorder and then kind

401
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,450
of arrive at a different diagnosis later once they kind of get into treatment.

402
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:12,720
But, you know, there's there's no and I had a student who did a project on this couple years ago.

403
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:23,000
That was the the fact that you basically because we don't have like how would you know it's just all all this whole week it's just going to hot mess.

404
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,370
At least for me, it's only Wednesday.

405
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:33,380
So what's been interesting is like more recently because the kind of recognition of the fact that this is a continuum

406
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,930
and I shouldn't have to wait until you sort of meet diagnostic criteria to do something about your mental health.

407
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,610
We have this idea of like minor depression, there's major depression and there is minor depression.

408
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,890
And that sort of this idea of like there's pre hypertension and there's hypertension and like a pre hypertension,

409
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,990
I would sort of like send you to like diet and exercise and like maybe we could get your blood pressure down without medication,

410
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,070
but like once in a couple of discussions,

411
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:02,450
now I know I need to use medication and it's really not going anywhere and it's not used to help people get treated like.

412
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,550
So we use minor depression in research.

413
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:10,430
But in terms of like would a doctor give you a diagnosis of minor depression to kind of get you into some like lifestyle kind of or like.

414
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,520
Exercise therapy or other stuff like this, which we actually know is effective for minor depression.

415
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,780
The answer is no.

416
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,560
So right now, you basically need that diagnosis to get into any kind of mental health treatment, and even that is going to wait 6 to 9 months.

417
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:35,650
Okay. So a couple of the last couple of days I would say so we again, the world is a continuum of depression or anxiety.

418
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,060
Even even things you don't necessarily think about. So like how many of you had déja vu?

419
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,010
All right, so that's a hallucination. You were not there before.

420
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,450
It's like you're like, oh, there's a glitch in the matrix.

421
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,989
That's also a hallucination. Okay, so you know what?

422
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,990
That. No, I can't. There's nothing I can say. Or how. Maybe you've seen a ghost.

423
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,770
Also hallucination.

424
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:04,750
Okay, so, like, listen, there there are continuum on these things, even on things that you don't necessarily think of as being on a continuum.

425
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,170
So. So as a result of the world being a continuum and I'm applying these cut points,

426
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,979
I get co-morbidity, which is simply the co-occurrence of two or more disorders at a time.

427
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,090
So I told you last week that if somebody had depression, they almost certainly had anxiety.

428
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,640
And part of that is because of the reinforcing nature of the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

429
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,510
But part of it is because sleeping problems and thinking problems are also and appetite problems are also symptoms of anxiety.

430
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,360
And so when I ask you a bunch of symptoms that are shared and then I kind of apply cut points, I suddenly get like,

431
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,040
Oh, you have both of these things, but you actually probably don't have both of these things.

432
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:47,080
You have one thing and are diagnosed again is showing there's a difference between the underlying disease process,

433
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,900
the symptoms and signs you're telling me about, and the diagnosis that I'm applying to that.

434
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:01,060
Yes. Okay. So, again, this is co-morbidity. Is the rule, not the exception. It's like psychiatric diagnoses.

435
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm not going to answer all these rhetorical questions other than to say yes to all is true.

436
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:14,800
Okay, so this is my last slide I think today or one of my last slide, and then you're going to break into your small group.

437
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:23,080
So we don't have simple indicators that can reliably indicate the presence or absence of a psychiatric disorder.

438
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:31,569
And you use the word disorder and syndromes. The most valid ways that we do this are very comprehensive.

439
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,910
They require talking with people, sometimes even observing behavior, which is time and labor intensive.

440
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,560
On Monday, we're actually you're actually going to go through you're going to do a role play exercise where you're going to

441
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:47,320
use different instruments and you're going to see how you're going to ask people about depression in 5 minutes.

442
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,220
But you can ask people about depression in 25 minutes. All right.

443
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,990
There are two options for you for that, right? Same thing with alcohol problems, same things with anxiety.

444
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:02,379
So let me I'm sure you can guess which version is used in most of our research.

445
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:10,959
It's the shorter version. Okay. So the symptoms of mental disorders are not readily distinguishable from transient disturbances in cognition,

446
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,920
emotion or behavior that occur over the course of the life span and are just a part of life.

447
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,210
Right. So there's lots of reasons why people have sleeping problems that have nothing to do with depression.

448
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,280
And then the last thing I'll say is that many symptom disturbances are subclinical.

449
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,599
That is, they don't warrant clinical intervention and they don't impair functioning.

450
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,649
So again, it's understanding that symptoms are not the same as impairment.

451
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,200
And that's that's an important distinguishing feature. Okay.

452
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:42,410
So. I'm going to save this till next week because I kind to do this.

453
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,990
Although you can always talk to me after class type questions about this business.

454
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:56,030
For some scales, this is a word club that I made from the projects that have been submitted as of midnight last night.

455
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:02,030
So I just wanted you to kind of see what types of things people in the room are interested in broadly.

456
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:11,150
And now what I would like you to do is you've all submitted your club, your class project ideas,

457
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:19,400
and I'd like you to just share them with a partner here and the type of feedback that I want you to get, you get and give from each other.

458
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:25,940
And and what are these seems most interesting. Like which of these are you kind of most interested to kind of see what the outcome is?

459
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,800
You can share this yourself. Your partner can sort of say like, you know, that also sounds interesting to me.

460
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,260
Or actually I was also thinking about this idea, but I didn't write down.

461
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,990
It was like a fourth choice. Which one of these do you think sounds like really hard to do?

462
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,640
This one in particular, these last two, a do you know do you know anything about that topic?

463
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,290
Do you like oh, you should read this book or I watch this TEDx talk.

464
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,920
I think it would really help you with your project. Right.

465
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,019
So just kind of like sharing information here, you're not going to have to turn anything in with this.

466
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,470
It's just a way to kind of like learn.

467
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:05,219
Many of you are interested, as you can see here in and now you can actually when you're on campus, you can see everybody's things.

468
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,800
So you can see what people are interested in. So also, you know, many of you are interested in adolescence.

469
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,110
You know, young adults in terms of getting to a right diagnosis.

470
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,180
There's a lot of interest in what else is another one.

471
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:28,770
I saw quite a bit of time, but the tone you can see on here, so.

472
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,399
Right. So we're going to do that just for the last 10 minutes of classes.

473
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,020
And so then we'll regroup around 1240 and then we'll kind of get out of here.

474
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,460
Okay. So the actual activity.

475
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:54,660
You don't want to think about all. I'm to raise the first one.

476
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:09,300
Depression now? Yeah. I don't know anything about it.

477
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:28,490
Here's what hard to say.

478
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:42,980
This is what happens when you grow up.

479
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:59,260
So this was my idea, like if it was out.

480
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:32,750
So I was like, the next day and my last one was the one I wanted to take on this one.

481
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:44,770
Yeah, I like that.
