1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,300
Doing all right. So.

2
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,450
So, Tony, this little wind sample that we got started because I want to know,

3
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,559
go back and read that and get further than that today where there are questions from yesterday's letters.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,240
Class, produce class. Well, the point.

5
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:53,470
Okay. So. So just to kind of get our heads back in, we're in this setting now where we have these potentially broken randomized experiments.

6
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,020
So subjects are randomized but to a particular treatment arm.

7
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,360
So the case of treatment versus control, which is what we're focused on.

8
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,920
But they can end up going on to different people arm.

9
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:18,400
And so we're focusing now on a case where basically people can essentially refuse treatment or be unable to take treatment.

10
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,470
And those folks may differ dramatically from individuals that can.

11
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,400
So we are going to try and separate those people.

12
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,330
And for the people on treatment arm, we know whether they can take the treatment or not.

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,850
Right. So we know if they're the so-called compliant. So they take the treatment if assigned to it.

14
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,810
And they don't if not or if they're a so-called never taker.

15
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,350
So they don't take the treatment even if assigned.

16
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:59,920
So we're going to consider the situation where there could be some residual effect of the assignment itself.

17
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:16,510
So whether you're on. So essentially subjects that are never take that are.

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,729
So subjects that are never takers, even though they don't take the treatment.

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,810
Either way, they might have a different mean based on whether or not they were assigned.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,940
We obviously expect that to be the case for the for the players because they're actually on the treatment when assigned to it and when they aren't,

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,870
when they're not. So a couple of things here.

22
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,909
One is our goal here is to sort of consider these treatment differences, right?

23
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,760
So the differences between theta one in and theta not N and theta one C and then let's see.

24
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,669
And as I said,

25
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:07,600
we can see it's very simple for the people on the treatment arm because we know that they belong to a compliant class or never take the class.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,750
Right. Because they either did or didn't take the treatment.

27
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,640
The tricky part is for the folks on control. Right.

28
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,720
We know they didn't take the treatment because they didn't have access to it. We don't know if they would have taken it had they had access to it.

29
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,100
So our controls are kind of this hidden mixture of compliance and ever takers.

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,290
So and then the last part of the finance model, we want to know the proportion of compliance.

31
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,790
So I guess a few things to just point out.

32
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,160
So there are some things we can just directly identify from typical sufficient statistics as model.

33
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:55,340
So. So for the players.

34
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,620
Right. We can we can tell what their outcome is under treatment.

35
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:12,170
Right, because that's those are the people that take the treatment. And then for the never takers,

36
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:19,160
we can also identify this because we see on treatment that there are never taken up in a fight that very easily just as the music.

37
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,080
What about this piracy? And I'll give a little hint on this.

38
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,680
So we have a randomized trial here. So is there somewhere we could look in the data to try and estimate this pie of sea?

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,030
Defining the sample average sample average of the treatment,

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,389
the people who take the treatment rate in the treatment arm because they are going to look just the same on average,

41
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:05,410
their mixture is going to be just the same as the people in the control arm because that part is randomized.

42
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:16,390
So we can we can, we can we can estimate that the part that we can't estimate easily from the data is this pi 0cx by zero nine.

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,150
So that's why we are going to go to use the An algorithm, right?

44
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:29,120
If we could observe this for everybody on the control side, if we knew whether they were compliant number taker, we would need to do that here.

45
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,670
But since we don't, we have to. So.

46
00:05:48,030 --> 00:06:47,360
Again. So the final treatment if you take a treatment that implies.

47
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,330
Put the date on your deal. It's going to equal one, right?

48
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:18,250
The fact that we can observe their treatment standards, their behavior is expected to whether or not they're under treatment.

49
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,600
There's no answer. And the same thing, right?

50
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:47,060
If they're saying treatment, they don't take it. And.

51
00:07:51,790 --> 00:08:03,620
So. So the tricky part comes, right.

52
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:16,020
And we're trying to get this. So that equals zero.

53
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,760
You know, when I say zero today, he tells me. So what we need is to get this expectation of this right, because we don't deserve it.

54
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,400
So we're going to replace it with this expectation on Tuesday.

55
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:39,600
So this is the I.

56
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,740
And. Yes, sir.

57
00:08:46,760 --> 00:09:09,440
The Russian. So that you get that basically this basic rules.

58
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,970
Right. So the probability of you giving a.

59
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:40,410
Probability they get. Although the probability of.

60
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,710
He says, basically. So you have to go on to one of the other.

61
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,230
So what's the other? The other point is plastic.

62
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,480
Yeah, I think.

63
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:36,630
So. Remember, there are ways to remember we distributed.

64
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:44,160
So what can earn?

65
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,800
As to make this. Oh.

66
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Sorry. Um. The problem is.

67
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:36,170
So. That's good.

68
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,300
Going to plug in my current estimates of Theta in pi. Right.

69
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,129
So I've got some something that I've got from the M step or a difference.

70
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:59,690
I'm just the initial guess here. So that's just going to be the PDF.

71
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:19,410
It's got to normalize that spread of news about the experience. So.

72
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,000
Services. This demands.

73
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:17,940
So. So this is the probability of being in a compliance class.

74
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,420
If you weren't quite you work. We were on the control side, so we don't know which one they're in.

75
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:34,139
And give me a third data. Right. So basically the closer way is to our current estimate of fate or not.

76
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:41,170
See, then the more we give to that and then sort of average, you know,

77
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:50,060
the fact that this is sort of the overall average in the third class, this figure is just indexing it.

78
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,960
This is our current estimate. So let's find this case. All right.

79
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,390
Let's define this case in a very.

80
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,870
This is a standard role.

81
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh. Yeah.

82
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,010
Right. So standardized.

83
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,880
So this is the probability. I'm going to call this PI.

84
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:11,760
I come to see this is the current assessment of the probability of the IIF observation being in the compliance class.

85
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:31,570
So Holder's so tired senior doesn't really ever change is just going to be one thing to zero degrees right.

86
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:42,740
And of course, again, that's just one mindset problem.

87
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:57,920
So basically we just use the data to try and estimate the probability of the one class or another given the current estimate.

88
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:07,360
Yes. So it's like those high seas and those are for the controls and then for the people, for the.

89
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,020
I mean, the general performances are. This is true for everybody.

90
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,620
Okay. For these subjects. Zero.

91
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:26,600
For the subjects of control. I have something to talk about if you don't want to other.

92
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:34,540
So. You sit there like that for a second?

93
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:55,260
So this is important because when we go to the step, right, whenever we want to have we like to use an indicator for this.

94
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:03,879
We're going to have to use the cars instead. So you go to maximize the estimate,

95
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,580
maybe the probability of being acquired class or just made with the means and variances

96
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,160
are of these underlying individuals in the different classes under the pre consensus,

97
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:21,010
we're going to need to use these values to the second.

98
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:28,460
Tribune. We also see that some of our leaders play an important role in how we decide the kind of weight we get based on the data determined by.

99
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:38,670
So those are all positive. And basically, yeah, it's a weighted average.

100
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,100
Yeah. Or you can think of this as the normal distribution. So you need.

101
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:55,800
That's make. If the distribution of the wire is change, can we still just put that definition in instead of logic?

102
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,980
Basically, whatever the probability theory is, why just three?

103
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,639
So log normal this time I found this binary.

104
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
It's going to be a little bit a tricky issue because there's going to be some aliasing

105
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,390
between the that be in the class probably received widespread continuous nutrition.

106
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:35,680
What? That's when we saw the news.

107
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:44,320
Instead. So don't care about race.

108
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,430
So. Rather than that affair.

109
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,170
I'm sorry about to remind everybody what is here.

110
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:28,950
Okay. So respirator failure one c.

111
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,500
Essentially the three hands on their Lebanese going. So this is this is obviously has to be another true reality.

112
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,590
The U.S. in the Philippines are escalators.

113
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,370
But nonetheless and because this is you don't have to update this one.

114
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:05,870
So how would I have to make this for my. Began treatment arm right into the treatment arm.

115
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,629
So what do they have to be? What is the treatment side?

116
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,340
They have to be. They get treatment.

117
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,720
Right. And what do they actually do with respect to treatment taken?

118
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,580
Right. So those are both going to be definitely a part of this.

119
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,280
Which is the same thing. Is that my.

120
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:56,840
See. Wait, I use for. Where?

121
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,490
We want to see this one. Okay.

122
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,610
I guess I was one zero otherwise.

123
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,860
But why are we dividing, by the way?

124
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,570
Oh, sorry. It's just. It's just going to be the number of the players and players in the.

125
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,210
And then we do the same thing. I'm sorry.

126
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,650
I mean. Haven't takers.

127
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,880
So now what? In this current.

128
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,470
Minus over eight times.

129
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:07,300
What my. And the same thing you think of this is kind of what we've been hearing.

130
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:17,310
I guess I could him for his. If you want to.

131
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,160
There's a canister assigned to the treatment, but they don't take it.

132
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:56,190
That's. Why are you calling it?

133
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,800
W I'm here to see if they're getting treatment and they aren't complying.

134
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,930
When you're ready. So you should be ready.

135
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:28,260
To the folks who get treatment that are never taken. Yeah.

136
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:42,400
All right. So then that. So I can't really write this precisely in terms of being.

137
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,890
So because. It's call this.

138
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,080
So these are the pliers on the controller.

139
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:28,030
So what's this week going to mean? Work that out from the previous is going to be the easy step, right?

140
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,180
We don't know. We know that they're on the control side of things.

141
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,469
What we don't know is the is we're not their employer.

142
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:46,870
So we replace that with the expected value of them being a player. So sorry, could you keep us all on board?

143
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,330
But the previous board we had a definition for that wasn't.

144
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:11,110
I. So what does what is a there's only works if 438 zero.

145
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,860
Right so this one this is.

146
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:28,180
Should be one. So was one in the weeks when they were including all of these.

147
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,710
In our. Controller.

148
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:45,400
That's where. We want that. So what we would have would do with all those cases.

149
00:26:47,890 --> 00:27:06,650
Even now. Well, Fernando, you could have written, I suppose, in this fashion, but one might say I turn here, just.

150
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,830
So we're trying to keep all of this warm and see it can be very easy to actually make that changes.

151
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:35,090
And finally, for one. Right.

152
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:54,940
Which is going to be the same thing. Why?

153
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,950
Vera and I, it's going to be this again we are fighting for.

154
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:22,300
Sergeant treatment site. Now I've got each one of these meetings estimated.

155
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:38,420
So my theta one C as I mentioned before with you just estimate that from the folks that are observed to to imply

156
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:49,549
on treatment to they take the treatment and then the theta one n from everyone who doesn't comply on treatment.

157
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,440
So they didn't take the treatment, but they were assigned to it.

158
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:01,190
And then for the theta zero, see it's basically going to be a weighted mean among the controls weighted by the probability, posterior probability.

159
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:12,470
So these were all thing where the posterior probability of being in being a supplier or never taker because it was picks and pans we go for.

160
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:35,730
I have a little bit left to do. In particular, we've got an estimate.

161
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:47,850
It's probably been acquired. So you could you could just sort of stick with what you have, but you can sort of get a little bit of extra information.

162
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,930
So. So don't.

163
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:13,600
The subjects that are. Obviously we take account of who's an observer, implying we can also take.

164
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,900
The weighted power on the control side.

165
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,670
My gosh. I mean, the fact that, you know, these are randomized.

166
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:42,269
Actually, Sydney, you really don't need that part to get an unbiased estimate of it.

167
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:52,620
You might get a little more information, including both pieces. And then.

168
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:11,000
We actually think big assessment of the variance. What?

169
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,140
So there may be different ways to write this or have written this.

170
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:15,430
Basically they're just trying to subtract off the correct mean square some squares and

171
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,490
four subjects for whom we know that the points class this is either going to be one zero.

172
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:29,379
Right. So we just take the residual sum squared. And so we feel research and treatment is going to be no uncertainty here.

173
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:39,110
You're just going to get. So you just saw this, and then there's native ones here and then.

174
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,170
But for the subjects I control. Right, there's going to be probably some community, some positive probability that he's the one.

175
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:55,360
So we're going to subtract off differences in the control sign and squared in accordance with the mean.

176
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,490
Sorry for the computer science.

177
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:07,260
We're not going to even take our side squared and then we can either duplicate cluster of the people they are and right.

178
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:17,860
So basically just replacing the indicator which one of these or groups you end with your posterior or expected value, which is the posture.

179
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:42,739
Just some squares. This is maximum life events that take you on a central theme you could use and minus one.

180
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,160
But the estimated variance actually divide by ten.

181
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:59,830
So one. That's liquid, so.

182
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,900
Okay, so that's it. All six long term results.

183
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:19,770
We're. It took months.

184
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:46,430
And minutes a man. Maybe you said this and maybe it's just me, for goodness sakes.

185
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:54,170
But if this is the only things we have to worry about bias, it will be biased.

186
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,790
But that's just the nature of maximum likely doesn't here and be biased very much as a subjective twin.

187
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:10,250
And yeah, that is an issue in every society and that's what the investigators so.

188
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,850
She's someone important to get the right estimate of the other status debate.

189
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:27,950
But yet. The point.

190
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:50,830
So. What's the reason why it's crashing when you multiply it by an one minus one?

191
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,720
I think. Different expectations, plugin and expectations.

192
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,090
Which of the expected values are indicators or which components?

193
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,090
Those were just the probabilities we worked out.

194
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:30,750
Previous. Okay.

195
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:42,000
So I was going to take a look at a simulated example. So I'm sending theta one, C2 two, theta zero C2 two.

196
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,139
So my intent to treat them as two players is two theta one and two one theta zero and 2.5.

197
00:36:49,140 --> 00:37:03,600
So i t t among the number takers is. Write it up there and figure it out, I think.

198
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,090
So the intent to treat effect among the never takers would be what?

199
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:26,570
It's a difference between. Their outcome under treatment and their outcome under control assignment.

200
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:39,180
But when they actually didn't take the treatment. To remember the 100 hour assignments for the season ends how they actually behave.

201
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,860
So remember Tigers 0.1. 0.5.

202
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,960
Right. It's going to be one minus point five.

203
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:57,350
The difference between these Thetas and the number takers for the agency and the same thing for the Mexican players,

204
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:04,460
typically the first one is sort of what we were very interested in a month. Probably any kind of fun.

205
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,630
No, really, you shouldn't try and understand how the treatment works in people who take it.

206
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:22,070
But if you could look at this and then I just because three quarters of people I signed to compliant status and then just a residual variance one.

207
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,020
So then so I'm going to look at it the sample of 2000.

208
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,069
So, so you can see it looks pretty good here, right?

209
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,810
This is I'm going to go to set it.

210
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:48,250
So this is. Sort of the way that you just generate the data given that your Z is.

211
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,940
So this is it again, this is the observed data, not the not the underlying truth.

212
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:02,799
So in my observed data, again, for people that are assigned to treatment,

213
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,700
about three quarters of them comply and take the treatment for people that are assigned a control.

214
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,999
Well, they'll not access treatment.

215
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,930
So that's just what they what they took there. So you can look at my intent to treat estimate looks maybe a little funny.

216
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:33,760
And that's kind of the fact that we have a mixture of individuals that have zero and 2.5.

217
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,880
All right. So the people that are never takers under under control.

218
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,660
I mean, the. Yeah. So the the never takers are, you know, the players are not really exactly the same.

219
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,990
With respect to that, they're sort of if you all are fundamentally giving status.

220
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,880
Right, there's some systematic differences in them. So.

221
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:13,160
So. But the fact that that that occurs doesn't really change the fact that we still have an unbiased estimate of the overall treatment effect,

222
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,200
the fact that the people not under control site are a mixture of these two.

223
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:33,510
That's just the state of the world. And so for our overall ADT estimate, we get about 1.6, which actually if we think about what that would really be,

224
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:44,430
if three quarters of the people are zero or one quarter or .5.5, then that's an overall estimate, about one point about .12.

225
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,120
So we know the same thing up here. So you actually would as a practice, you did something I think close to around 1.5.

226
00:40:54,380 --> 00:41:02,210
Of course, this is data. So some here. So the as treated estimate, it's a little bit different.

227
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,940
Too much. Both of them are clearly below.

228
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,470
What we know from the underlying simulation is the intent to treat effect among the players.

229
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,270
So we run our algorithm and we get stuff now that looks more like what we would expect.

230
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:31,440
So we know our truth here was to its truth. Here was one, this was zero, and this is point five.

231
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:40,560
Of course, the pie hat really is pretty much on the money. Remember, we can observe that from just the fuel treatment variance as close to one.

232
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:49,590
So yeah, so I actually have, I actually have code run it here, but.

233
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:09,130
And this is up in the module if you want to look at it. But quickly.

234
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:33,570
Course. Okay.

235
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:41,190
So. All right.

236
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,100
So is that reasonably visible? So, yeah.

237
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,470
All right. So that was just a little bit of code here to kind of generate this data.

238
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,050
All right. 2000 individuals, my secret compliance class status.

239
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,230
I just said to one, if it's a C and zero, it's an N.

240
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:08,400
So I just for the first three fourths to precisely to beat the players and then ever takers for our potential outcomes.

241
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:15,660
Right. So if you're a compliance under treatment,

242
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:27,820
they haven't made it to the fair never take her under treatment ever mean of of of one and then instead here's the same thing on the control side.

243
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:42,490
So 0.5 is they're never take her so my observed data then so I just now this is my random assignment I guess I you see here I've been using a um,

244
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:56,370
but same idea and then my, my actual treatment taken is going to basically be this sort of interaction with the, and like a player class, right?

245
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,399
So if they're assigned a treatment and they're a compliant, the s is one.

246
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:08,370
They took the treatment. If they're assigned treatment and they are a never take her this is zero so that zero and of course if they're

247
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:14,580
assigned control and by definition as it's going to be zero in this world and then their observed outcome,

248
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:21,810
well, that just corresponds to whether they are a oops.

249
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,950
It looks very wrong. That should be.

250
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:40,160
Yes. Wait. No, it's. That's. Well, that's that's correct.

251
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:48,370
Right. This is going to be. Because it's based on what they.

252
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,950
They're taking what they're actually have have been assigned so.

253
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:16,320
We're damn near there. Okay.

254
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:24,820
Well, in outside. So our starting point for our algorithm, right, I just kind of needed some somewhere to kick things off.

255
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,590
So but actually I have a very good starting point for this because I can actually just use

256
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:36,639
the observed actually not to throw away any point from my estimates of theta or this case,

257
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:47,830
I call it view the means under the subject's under treatment or compliance for the subjects under treatment that are never takers.

258
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,479
Then I just took the overall mean for the compliance and never takers.

259
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,970
And to actually make this algorithm work, there had to be a little bit of difference in these.

260
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,150
So I just added a small value to make them slightly different from each other.

261
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,229
Otherwise, it's going to be kind of stuck and it's going to think there's no difference.

262
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,610
And so I can't use any information to estimate the different remember the word well,

263
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:18,700
the previous picture we were using that difference between the wise and the estimate to move this, to push them one direction or the other.

264
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:27,460
So it doesn't really matter because I was going to sort this out and then just the overall variance of the wise for Sigma.

265
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:37,510
And of course, an estimate, because I'm on the control side, how they whether or not they took the data corresponds to that.

266
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:43,660
So okay. So basically I just need to go through and do these steps.

267
00:46:45,460 --> 00:47:04,610
So. So four, basically.

268
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,710
So the Z here is basically going to be used to just create these weights.

269
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:13,010
So basically what I'm doing here. Right. The same thing as this place.

270
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:20,340
So if Z is one, then I know there are comply.

271
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,470
If they took the treatment and I not if they didn't.

272
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,390
So this will either be one or zero. C is one and then aza0.

273
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,480
Then I have to bring it to the key point of the board and the previous board that I raised.

274
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:44,030
Then I have to bring in this PFC times of probability for y given C.

275
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,170
Right. So the remote control. So it's basically the compliant under control.

276
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:03,530
And then that PFC times P of why given C plus P event one minus PFC times P of Y to an in and to that.

277
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,360
So that's the beauty for the member takers. So.

278
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:20,310
And so basically it one down zero from treatment and then it becomes this this thing that runs between zero and one basically by the probe.

279
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:25,330
The posterior probability of being a good player never taken. All right.

280
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,890
I'm just going to sum up those weights and divide by end to get the overall probability of being a good player.

281
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:43,190
And then for the step. So.

282
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,970
I don't need one save for the new ones.

283
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,900
I don't need to rerun these because they never change. They just came in.

284
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:59,800
So basically what I need to do is update my escalators of new zero C and zero in.

285
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:06,040
And that's basically the individuals that are in control times their probability of being under

286
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:16,270
control divided by the sum of those probabilities so that with it being up there and the same thing,

287
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:25,180
I'm sorry, probability being the player. So you control the player, use it, and then the probability of being a member taker.

288
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:37,440
Right. So what it these. For the subjects you control with the probability of either being a player for this or being an ever taker that.

289
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:54,020
So then for the Sigma, I guess it's written out a little more, not quite as neatly written here,

290
00:49:54,020 --> 00:50:00,170
but basically for the subjects that are on treatment, we know whether they're a.

291
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,570
Controller never, never take individual. So if they're.

292
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,640
So these are. These are either zeros and ones. But, um.

293
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,310
So we're basically just going to take. Right.

294
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:26,470
Subtracting off this new one seed, if you will, the first one up there for the subjects under treatment.

295
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,490
And the same thing for the never takers under treatment.

296
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,990
And then you do the same thing for the control here. This is not going to.

297
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,880
This will be something between zero and one. Control becomes.

298
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,930
So it could be, as I said, sigma, but it's really sigma squared my plan.

299
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,250
So that's why I have to use a little square root sigma up here.

300
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:04,380
Because this is the density and distribution would mean know standard deviation, you know.

301
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,590
So then I just have little containers to hold my estimates from.

302
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,930
And then I just printed out the various things you're going to see here.

303
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:26,130
So. So the.

304
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,600
Okay, so I'm sorry. Let me stop here. Are there.

305
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:38,350
The question is kind of working through exactly we did this was the step getting those past year

306
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:44,300
probabilities and just choose those past two year probabilities to get my updated estimates.

307
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:57,510
So. And I didn't need to mess with these because these are this is all fully observed here.

308
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:08,350
There's no uncertainty in the compliance class. So.

309
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:18,490
All right. So you can actually plot this is a feature of the film where they sort of climb and stop.

310
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:27,370
So the likelihood is increasing each time so that the the values may or may not be monotonic.

311
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:37,600
So for the main probabilities, they basically were for I mean, they sort of started the wrong direction and worked its way back down.

312
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,159
So basically these things should all stabilize sort of when, you know,

313
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,320
you're one of the things with the is that you're never quite sure you're all the way there.

314
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,999
But there are various sort of tests you can do.

315
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,050
But usually just visually looking at these that these plots and these aren't going to go anywhere.

316
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,350
So that corresponds to the the estimate.

317
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:12,270
So in the end, I have to subtract point this from this to get my estimate or my intent to treat effect in the Complera side.

318
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:19,750
The never take your side because we've track for 93.6 to 3.31.

319
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,950
And so usually easiest to do variance estimate is using bootstrap.

320
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:34,809
So I didn't I guess I didn't run that for the slides, but I do have plots for this,

321
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:41,830
which basically means the only thing is you're going to just go through and re sample your Y, z and S.

322
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:58,920
And then you just rerun the work you just did after it's 200 and to be plenty to to get stable estimates.

323
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:10,090
So then you get the point estimates the end of each one of these bootstraps and then you can use the percent,

324
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,810
the variance or the percentiles here actually use percentile.

325
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,890
So when you get a 95% confidence interval.

326
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:27,239
So I'm going to use the 2.5 percentile of my bootstrap distribution, the 97.5 for the bootstrap distribution term.

327
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,730
You can take the variance and do plus or minus one at 96.

328
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:37,050
If there this actually if it's if there's no guarantee that these bootstrap estimates are going to be widely distributed.

329
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:44,960
So there's actually a slightly more robust way of doing it. But.

330
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,590
I guess I only did 200 here. So you probably say.

331
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,660
Yeah. So for it, using the percentiles, I probably should've done some like 1001.

332
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:03,050
So let me. What precise about it?

333
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,960
Okay. So questions about that.

334
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:21,570
Yes. With the estimate obtained by the post, ray was from the CMC.

335
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,940
So each time I'm doing the eml rhythm with the bootstrap sample. Um.

336
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:36,690
So, so that's that's basically how bootstrapping works since you're going to just use whatever estimation procedure you're using,

337
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,800
but you re sample the data with replacement so you based, right.

338
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,070
So basically I just did my sample here.

339
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:52,200
And then if you kind of look, these are how I got my initial point estimates and then I'm just running the algorithm,

340
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,740
same algorithm I just went through. And then at the end, I'm saving out.

341
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:08,160
My point estimates. What I'm ultimately said are these differences between these these these data is

342
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:12,030
between among the players among the never takers in the different treatment arms.

343
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:17,280
So that's why I, I used the distribution of differences.

344
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,960
Well, I was a kid. I was focused on the premise themselves. I could just pick those.

345
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:27,170
So, yeah, it's not alternative way. It's just a way to get the variance. Yeah.

346
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,690
All right. I'm sorry. We had a question. Yeah.

347
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:47,500
No, I think I've thought about it more, but it is basically that the algorithm is, you know, to the extent you can change your.

348
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,750
Oh, yeah. Doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Yeah, you could.

349
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,610
You could do. I mean, some would be more straightforward.

350
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:07,689
Yeah, you could. You could start off with your estimate of sigma using whatever your current, you know, because you're.

351
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:15,110
You're updating these. These. You should probably be here.

352
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:31,290
Some. But at some point, this is one.

353
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:51,900
You know, I guess. So you're going to go through an update.

354
00:57:54,690 --> 00:58:06,890
So. I mean, in terms of history, the parameters, anything, you know, this is what you wouldn't have here for this status to apply.

355
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:12,720
Yes. I was just curious if there was you know. Yeah. If you've got a you can use whatever your previous estimates were to.

356
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:40,759
In the square you could run through an from. Although it would not be ideal because the states are expected to value space to produce data.

357
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,370
So there probably is a bit of. To make sense of this.

358
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,510
To update your segment. We want to hear your latest.

359
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:01,780
Hmm. You've got these letters which were used on the previous estimate by.

360
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:36,740
Okay. So it's going to sort of push this this area, this example a little further.

361
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,940
So one very common assumption that's made is the so-called exclusion restriction.

362
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,690
So this intent to treat effect estimated there might be something about being assigned a

363
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,260
treatment that might impact the outcome irrespective of actually taking the treatment.

364
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,430
So in many, many settings, you might think that's impossible.

365
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:04,969
For example, you might assume the drug can only have an impact if it's actually taken or a therapy have an impact of its own.

366
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:12,860
It was actually given. So. So in this case.

367
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:23,729
If you're in a setting where. The treatment taken.

368
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:28,050
Doesn't matter with your assignment. So who who is it going to be?

369
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:45,770
Of our four compliance. So we have work and players always take her center never takers or the fighters.

370
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,370
The wording won't give you the answer. They're right.

371
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:59,740
So when one does. Which of those classes? Is the treatment taken the same regardless of whether you're assigned to treatment or control?

372
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,600
Almost always taken and never taken straight.

373
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,570
So basically in those groups, we're going to assume that the means are the same.

374
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:15,730
So is the always takers, whether you're in treatment or control, if they need somebody with an undertaker's.

375
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,030
The only way you get a difference means is if we actually do something with the treatment.

376
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:28,220
So this is something you can't. So we verify this.

377
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,550
But since board.

378
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:39,440
So another common assumption is a so-called notifier assumption, where it might be assumed that if you're encouraged to take the treatment,

379
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,200
that shouldn't make you more likely should not make you more likely to not take the treatment.

380
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,600
It should make you more likely take the treatment and vice versa.

381
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:57,850
So in the strict form, that assumes basically that if you're assigned to treatment, you will.

382
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:09,630
Basically either take the treatment or not. The value of X when you take the treatment is going to be greater than or equal to diabetic under control,

383
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:17,910
which if this is just zero or one, that means basically you can't have somebody be assigned to treatment and not take it.

384
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,270
And then counterfactual you had been assigned to treatment, they would have taken it.

385
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,920
So basically that basically the probability of the fire is zero.

386
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:31,800
So this is also sometimes called the monitoring C assumption because of this feature here.

387
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,740
So if there are sort of multiple levels of treatment, it basically means that you're encouraged to stick higher and higher levels.

388
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:46,520
You're never going to go the other direction. Were you encouraged to be encouraged to be a doctor?

389
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,280
All right.

390
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:09,250
So we're going to kind of finish up this discussion of of our example of principal stratification with this physician encouragement designs.

391
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:19,390
It's actually where I first encountered this this work. So this was an application I had, you know, going back now, Universe Pennsylvania was there.

392
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:28,580
So you can look up the paper, which is going to be much accurate. But basically this in encouragement designs are kind of interesting studies.

393
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:37,400
So in particular, this exclusion restriction a monetarist the assumption or meaningful and settings where the always takers and ever takers may exist.

394
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,710
Right. So if you're in a setting where you have a physician encouragement design,

395
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:48,980
what you're doing is you're encouraging physicians to give what's considered to be the correct treatment.

396
01:03:50,990 --> 01:04:02,240
But the patients may or may not get that from the physician, and it may differ by individual patient associated with a given position.

397
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,390
So they're really common in mental health settings,

398
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:11,569
know where physicians feel tailored treatments are important and they may not want to give up control of the treatment assignment to.

399
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:16,190
They're not willing to say, yeah, I'll take this patient and I'll do this with them.

400
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:21,310
You know, if they're randomized to treatment and I'll do this other thing, if they're randomized to control,

401
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:29,240
I'm going to I'm going to I'll I'll try to to follow your your rules, but I'm not necessarily going to do it precisely.

402
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:39,139
So some of the particular example, I think we were we were looking at physicians being asked to add cognitive

403
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,740
behavioral therapy in addition to a standard drug treatment regime for depression,

404
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:48,200
roughly for veterans in a VA hospital in Philadelphia.

405
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:55,520
So basically, they're near or at least for vets, they're in there for for issues related to depression.

406
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,830
And sort of the standard treatment would be to be given some antidepressants.

407
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:06,740
And then this additional work would be to add this CBT or cocktail therapy on them.

408
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:18,049
So so physicians may or may not have followed through and on on that they actually we were I think we were assigning physicians to the treatment,

409
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,040
not individuals, but physicians.

410
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,660
Even when they were assigned to doing one, they may have retained some control over that.

411
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:32,959
Now, conversely, individuals might have sought out CBT or their physicians,

412
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:39,380
and physicians might have given it to them even if they weren't even if the physicians had not been given this additional encouragement,

413
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,400
this additional sort of discussion of the value of CBT for these patients.

414
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:55,849
So so we can we can see that maybe we want to we want to allow for always takers because these would be patients who,

415
01:05:55,850 --> 01:06:06,110
regardless of what their physician had been told, that they would they would get the extra therapy.

416
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:12,080
So but we might still assume that the exclusion restriction amount of tenacity could be reasonable.

417
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:23,150
Right. We might and assume that there's probably not patients where if they're.

418
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:36,400
They're probably not physicians that would sort of move away from CBT had he been encouraged to do it.

419
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:41,110
Well, that is potentially possible, but we'll make that assumption.

420
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:48,070
And more importantly than that, I think we're more reasonably or very reasonably the exclusion restriction is basically

421
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:53,649
that in order to have whatever benefit you're going to have from the treatment,

422
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:59,860
you actually have to have taken it. Right? You actually had to have gotten the CBT or conceivably no benefit.

423
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:05,499
Right. Could be helpful. But anyway, whatever effect is going to have is going to be a result of that.

424
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:12,780
Not not from the fact that unknown to you, your physician was assigned to one or the other.

425
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:19,989
Now, it may be I say that, that but it's not necessarily impossible for there to have been effects like this,

426
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:26,200
because it could be that the physician themselves has had some sort of overall change in the way they treat patients,

427
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:35,000
even if they're not, you know, moving down the CBT road or not in the process.

428
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:39,729
So it could be that there there could be failures of both of these.

429
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:44,910
But in general, I think there are sort of reasonable. So.

430
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:54,089
All right. So the actual example here, we had 71 patients that were randomized to either usual care or typically patients

431
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:58,710
whose physicians were randomized to either usual care or telephone encouragement.

432
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:07,950
So the basically the telephone encouragement just basically about the hearing nurse checking,

433
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:13,470
assessing the patient by telephone and then giving feedback to the patient's physician saying, you know, we think you should be doing this.

434
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,100
So so treatment in received correspond to adherence to these guidelines,

435
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:29,760
this sort of CBT use regardless of treatment arm and an outcome was was roughly normally distributed to number of distress depressive symptoms.

436
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:41,150
So so these are folks who are if you took this C ESD measure, a general population would kind of be left skewed with,

437
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,709
you know, relatively low scores and then some high scores for individual.

438
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:49,320
But in a in a fairly depressed population, it's actually available and really distributed around a fairly high level.

439
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:58,440
So okay, so observed data, right?

440
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:05,700
So there's some evidence of encouragement, right? So some folks that were who's whose doctors were in on the encouragement arm

441
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:14,400
you 26 out of 34 were receiving the sort of believed to be correct treatment.

442
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,820
But on the control arm a fair number of the minority now were receiving it as well.

443
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:24,930
So the diagonals, there's definitely some effective treatment, right?

444
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:29,880
Because if there wasn't and this would basically just there would be extra individuals on the diagonal.

445
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,410
But but as clues of noncompliance. All right.

446
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:42,120
So there looks to be some individuals that were never takers, always takers.

447
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,830
And now, interestingly, here, it gets a little more complicated because for the people on the diagonal.

448
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:55,560
Right, these could be always takers. Right. We know they got the the they took the treat when they got it.

449
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,230
They might have taken the treatment had not been assigned.

450
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:05,670
So conversely, as before, the control group could be a mixture of never takers and compliance.

451
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:12,150
So we also assume here that the people who were encouraged, they like actually picked up the phone.

452
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:18,420
So, so, so just to review that. Oh, no, I know what you are.

453
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:31,500
So, so basically this is a measure of of whether or not the when we think about that for a second, it's been a well.

454
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:45,250
So so so again, the the this was this was the intervention.

455
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,690
So the actual measurement of this was they were adhering to guidelines.

456
01:10:50,230 --> 01:11:00,400
So basically that's an issue that their that their their physician was doing this this additional CBT piece.

457
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:06,190
So there's a slight disconnect between the Z and and the S here, I guess,

458
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:17,770
but c it designed it to drive s not to be exactly the same as s so, so, so everybody was, you're right.

459
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:28,959
So if they didn't pick up the phone, you know, they could that could basically have have some some impact.

460
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,020
But but since the best practice here is considered to be CBT,

461
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:36,610
whether or not they were picking up the film wouldn't change the fact of how the physician was treating them.

462
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:47,950
Well, you could. But that that measure of of of the of the s itself would be would be consistent.

463
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,860
So but. Right. So I mean, that's actually really how you get some never takers, right?

464
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,180
Pretty much takers are having a hard time getting communication going on.

465
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,220
So they the doctor might not be.

466
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:10,470
The patient doctor interaction may be such that they don't end up doing this work, even though they were signed into that encouragement or.

467
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:19,620
So it's a good question. Okay.

468
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:28,380
So I said it's sort of mentally disturbed, but it's not ideal, but so it's slightly skewed,

469
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:34,620
but we're going to rely a little bit on the law of origin or maybe intermediate numbers here to normality.

470
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:45,450
So our intent to treat or if we just look at the difference between the controls and the means and the siesta here, lower is better.

471
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:53,820
Right. This is a measure of intensity, of depression. So some evidence that it was working, but it didn't reach that evidence.

472
01:12:54,870 --> 01:13:02,070
If we look among the folks who are actually treated, then a stronger effect.

473
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:10,769
So as one might expect, if you're actually taking treatment to do better, but to dig out.

474
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:17,849
Right. Because this is again, these are both. And as I said, it's a little funny thing now because we can tell the always takers are never takers,

475
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:27,149
but but the completers never takers are mixtures of of the compliance are sort of mixed in with the always

476
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:39,420
takers the treatment arm and the never takers are mixed in with the compliance on the on the controller.

477
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:45,540
So and we're going to assume monitor, see, so we don't have the fires.

478
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,440
And we're also going to assume the exclusion restriction. Right.

479
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:55,590
So basically, the only time you have a difference in the mean then is going to be when you're assigned,

480
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:00,740
when you're in a compliant, when you're in a compliance class and you are when you comply.

481
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:08,370
Otherwise the treatment, there'll be no difference in the means by treatment.

482
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,320
If you're in, never take her or always take her.

483
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:20,250
For some reason I used I think because I was using a to index the the treatment I used ill always for the always takers.

484
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,510
And of course they have the other one. Yes, as I said that.

485
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:32,120
So and so I'm going to be using a Bayesian approach here who could maybe use it in approach.

486
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,560
But I decided to show the base approach as well. So we saw some of this a little bit before.

487
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,850
So I'm going to have to come up with priors here.

488
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:49,970
So I'm just going to have very flat, essentially uninformative priors on my means and this inverse schema.

489
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:58,880
So on the inverse of gamma, it's a gamma distribution, very small values, basically sort of quasi non informative on the on the variance side.

490
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,870
And then for my probabilities,

491
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:12,120
there's a sort of standard approach in that because the posterior of the probabilities is actually follows the so-called garishly distribution.

492
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:16,159
So a prior that's directly as well follows this.

493
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:22,760
And it basically says you sort of have one observation out of your out of three, if you will,

494
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,590
or it's sort of equal probability of being in one of these individuals with

495
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:33,170
basically the the the number of categories being the the the sort of prior.

496
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:42,080
It also has a feature that when you when you look at the posterior corresponds to the likelihood because dursleys have this sort of.

497
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,950
And minus one type characteristic of the. So.

498
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,340
And I think we have some discussion of this in the base based review piece.

499
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:17,730
I think we should take that out. So from ultimately those individuals.

500
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:27,130
You can look around and I'll try to put you in that direction as well.

501
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,740
So I mentioned this before,

502
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:42,250
that basically the folks that are observing compliant patrol arm are going to be a mixture of compliance and always takers.

503
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:50,260
And then as before, on the trip on the on the the people who don't comply.

504
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,870
Right. They could I mean, the people who were observed to comply on the control side.

505
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:06,219
So they don't take the trip when they're assigned to it or a mixture of compliance and never takers, because we can just from this observed data,

506
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:14,410
this could be somebody who's, you know, clued there is yes equals a on when they're assigned to control.

507
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,559
We don't know what this is going to be equal to.

508
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:24,100
If it was assigned to one if it was one, they'd be a compliant was zero and they'd be a never take the setting up here.

509
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:30,040
Right. If they're in treatment and they take it.

510
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:36,190
It could be a supplier. We don't know what would happen if they were in control, if they were in control and still got it.

511
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:39,730
They could be in always there. So.

512
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:47,110
Can. Conversely, subjects that are discordant with encouragement are here, never takers.

513
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:53,940
Right. So they're in the encouragement encouragement arm but aren't engaging in the full treatment.

514
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:59,579
Or if they're not among the so, then they're never takers.

515
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:05,490
And then if they're on the control side, but they're are able to engage in the full treatment, then they're always.

516
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:11,130
So if all that distribution. All right.

517
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:16,350
So we basically fit this model with the Gibbs sampler and we're running low on time.

518
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:20,490
So I think I will save this, but you might want to go ahead and take a look through it.

519
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:29,520
Basically, it's a slightly more complicated version of what we worked through previously, and you can kind of see some of the results from this.

520
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:38,140
The change in the posture distributions. So I will leave that for next week.

521
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:46,240
We keep plugging away and having office hours on Thursday, and I apologize for not bringing the nametags today.

522
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:49,760
I realized I. Definitely try to do that on Monday.

523
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,650
I was going to give everybody a little so I can try to get people's names out of the class and settle down.

524
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:57,710
Sorry. I guess I mentioned that some of you were not. So.

525
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,470
Yeah, just. Just so I can try to get with so many people in there, in and out.

526
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:10,640
I just decided to wait. But as of the end of this week, David, I think some of the.
