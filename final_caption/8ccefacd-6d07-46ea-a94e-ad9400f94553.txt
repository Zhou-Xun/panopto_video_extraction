13
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:39,290
As a student in this course and at the university, you are expected to maintain a high degree of professionalism.

14
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:50,240
Professionalism includes a commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior out of the classroom.

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,990
In this class, we expect preparation of papers to reflect your unique individual effort.

16
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:07,310
Papers will be evidence based and require citations in this course, all papers should use AP a formating.

17
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:15,320
Cheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated and will be dealt with firmly.

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:26,870
Academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on exams or assignments, fabrication of data or sources,

19
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,260
falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials,

20
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,830
including library materials, or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts.

21
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:50,250
If you have any questions or concerns about appropriate conduct, either yours or your peers, please reach out to a course instructor.

22
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:59,770
We want you to be successful in this course to learn a lot and to meet your own expectations for your academic performance.

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:08,000
There are lots of tools available on campus to help students succeed. One support we want to highlight is for student writing.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,140
As you'll learn, writing in public health courses looks a little different than in your typical high school or college English class.

25
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:24,770
Sweetland Center for Writing can be helpful in organizing your papers and meeting basic standards for academic writing.

26
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:33,500
In addition to the support offered by Sweetland, I'll be hosting a writing workshop during our forums and your eyes will offer

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,650
extra office hours to help support you as you work on your writing assignments.

28
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:47,390
Please pay close attention to the assignment prompt and advice offered by our instructional team.

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:54,540
Performing well on the first writing assignment is an important step to doing well in the course.

30
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,760
We know that some of you have additional needs when it comes to academic success,

31
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,310
if you are a student who is registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities Office.

32
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:16,970
Please make sure that all of your instructors in the course have been notified of your needs via the new accommodate online portal.

33
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:25,540
So what can you do to be successful this semester? Here are our recommendations to get the most out of this course.

34
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:34,180
First, complete online lessons weekly, completing these lessons carefully by watching all videos,

35
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,930
doing all the readings and taking notes throughout will help you keep up with course content to be prepared

36
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:48,910
for discussion section and forums to help you avoid feeling stressed during pre exam crunch times.

37
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,320
Second, we know learning in isolation can be tough.

38
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Attending discussion section in person each week will give you an opportunity to see your GSCI and interact with your peers.

39
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:12,760
This is your time to ask questions, to listen to the ideas of others and simply connect with other learners around course content.

40
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,800
The instructional team will also be popping in to discussion sections throughout the semester so we can meet you in person to.

41
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,530
Third, watching forums and submitting questions to our guest lecturers will also help you learn.

42
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,600
And of course, we would like to see you and get to know you via office hours,

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,780
don't hesitate to attend office hours with any member of the instructional team.

44
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,430
You don't need to have a question or be struggling with core concepts.

45
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,620
Just introduce yourself to us and tell us why you decided to take this class.

46
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,730
We'd be delighted to meet with you.

47
00:05:52,730 --> 00:06:03,320
Our penultimate tip is to seek help from your GSCI on writing assignments, as I mentioned, writing in public health is a unique and important skill.

48
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:13,430
Talk to your GSCI as you are drafting your paper to make sure you are addressing the key components of a public health paper.

49
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,730
One final tip, you should read and reread the syllabus in its entirety.

50
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,480
This video has only offered a broad summary of the course.

51
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:30,950
So to learn more and understand our expectations fully, please read the syllabus posted on campus.

52
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,670
You are responsible for understanding the content of the syllabus.

53
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:43,400
If you have any questions about policies listed in the syllabus, please reach out to one of the instructors.

54
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,390
In closing, I want to remind you how important it is to take care of yourself this semester.

55
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,210
Our minds and mental health are all strained by our current circumstances,

56
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,000
and we know that our physical health isn't something we can take for granted these days.

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,010
Please take care of yourself, respect the university and public health guidelines to protect your health and promote the well-being of others.

58
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:19,390
If you are unwell, either physically, mentally, or because you need to take care of someone who gets sick,

59
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,590
we ask you to let us know as soon as possible,

60
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:34,190
contact your GSCI so that we can work with you to modify deadlines, provide extra support to keep you on track with your academic goals.

61
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,260
We're all in this together and we are here with patience and flexibility.

62
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:48,570
Communication early and often will be critical to support students who become sick or need additional resources,

63
00:07:48,570 --> 00:08:00,160
please feel free to reach out to any member of the teaching team if you are sick, worried about being sick or don't know where to go for help.

64
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Welcome to Public Health two hundred, we are so pleased you've enrolled in our course and we look forward to learning alongside of you this semester,
