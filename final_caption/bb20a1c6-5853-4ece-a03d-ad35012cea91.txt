Hello. This video is a supplemental video to the How to Apply to Graduate School video series.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:17,820
This will be a brief video and is made to provide you other important consideration when applying to graduate school.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,690
So just some things to consider how so maybe you should consider how an advanced degree will benefit

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,750
you. Obtaining a professional degree is not always necessary to pursue your interests.

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,000
Sometimes students can rely simply on their bachelor's degrees depending on their career goals.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,540
It is important that students have an idea of their future career goals and know when an advanced degree is needed or not.

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,600
If you do realize an advanced degree is in is is indeed necessary,

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,190
would you need to pursue a master's or a doctoral program. Doctoral students often aspire to be professors

9
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,890
or researchers and a doctoral degree may be required to advance their careers. Students may consider

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:11,850
a dual,  may need to consider a dual master's and doctoral  program to assist in this process.

11
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,660
Also, students sometimes decide to pursue a dual degree program such as a degree in urban

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,180
planning and public health or a masters of public health and a master's of social work.

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,120
This, students often find that both these degrees are useful in their career trajectory.

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,390
It's important to know that when you're thinking about pursuing

15
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:42,390
a dual degree how you can apply that knowledge from both programs and how both degrees will lead to a career advancement.

16
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:51,870
Lastly, um pursuing a graduate degree is often more harder, or more strenuous than undergrad school.

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,990
Oftentimes your workload your school workload kind of takes over your social life and

18
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,590
it's important to consider how you will be able to juggle this potentially.

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,160
These are just some additional ideas to consider.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,000
This is not an exhaustive list, there maybe be some other things that you personally need to consider as well.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,317
So ideally, I would hope that you all consider these things and also other issues as well when applied to graduate school.
