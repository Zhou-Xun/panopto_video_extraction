1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,090
All right.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:17,320
So, like I said, I apologize for having to step out when I have to step out, but it's it's the only time that would work for everybody else.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,510
And so I said, I'll text me when you're ready and I'll show up and you take the pictures.

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:32,030
Take it. So today's our last point of conversation about the substance use.

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,860
I hope you all had a nice fall break, were able to decompress a little bit.

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,390
I certainly enjoyed the date, you know, but I actually want to say yes.

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,080
I want to say at the top that I know this is a difficult topic.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,330
I know that statistically many of you are directly affected by the opening self watch funeral for someone who died of an overdose in September.

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:01,960
So I know this is not something that is an academic exercise for for many of you.

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,490
So today we're going to talk about two epidemics.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,370
So and I said we'll start with cocaine and then talk about opioids.

12
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,819
You know that for those of you who are doing projects on substance use and a lot of that,

13
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,149
the points are going to hopefully be useful in terms of your thinking there.

14
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,610
But also for those of you who are doing projects on policy,

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,610
I talk a lot about policy today and sort of like how policy contributes or does not contribute to abuse epidemics.

16
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:39,580
I just reminder that your assignment, your in-class assignment of measuring drug use in the population is due out this Friday.

17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,370
I'll try to save some time at the end for us to answer any questions about that.

18
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,230
And then your checkpoint number for which is potential stakeholders, is due on November 2nd.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,790
So let's talk about cooking so that the first thing to understand is that there was a time in

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:10,560
in the U.S. and just globally that cocaine was considered as a very prestigious thing to do.

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,540
Like it was a sign of wealth. It was. And part of it was it was extraordinarily expensive.

22
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,399
So this is an advertisement. It's like an actual advertisement that was in a magazine that is an advertisement for cocaine, but for razor blades.

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,290
And there's, you know, just a strange, nondescript white substance underneath it.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,400
Like, what could you possibly use these so-called razor blades for?

25
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:41,160
But the point is, is that this was a this was, you know, if you've seen movies from the eighties that kind of like glorify.

26
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:50,370
You know, the use of cocaine like it was under it was perceived publicly as something that was relatively

27
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,730
safe to do and was essentially highly limited to a group of people that could afford to do it.

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,230
The vast majority of people could not afford. Okay.

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,020
So this is what cocaine use look like in the United States among non-Hispanic whites.

30
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,420
So the x axis here is years. We're starting in 1972, we go to 1989.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,050
The Y axis here is in the thousands. Okay.

32
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,990
So the first thing to notice is just that we are going to get the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America in 1986.

33
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,720
Okay. So just kind of imagine that here.

34
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,469
But this is this is but drug uses lots of alcohol and this is looking like among non-Hispanic whites in the United States.

35
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,400
And sure enough, you know, you see this dramatic increase beginning in the 1970s.

36
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:51,450
Remember I told you last time that widespread use of marijuana and other narcotics is essentially a post World War Two phenomenon,

37
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,110
essentially pre-World War two. This is not something that people are doing. Alcohol and tobacco.

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,020
Yes. But it's not until after World War Two and the baby boom generation that that we kind of really see that take off.

39
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,150
This is the same exact square.

40
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,660
But now I'm showing you new cocaine users among non-Hispanic blacks who are in the the squares and Hispanics and we're in the triangles.

41
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:19,020
Notice the y axis. Every all of this graph would fit within this part of this graph.

42
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,390
You understand all of this graph, the y axis goes to 250.

43
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,729
Fits within just this part of this graph. So who was using cocaine in the seventies?

44
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,190
Needles. Overwhelmingly.

45
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,010
Not even close. That's who was using cocaine.

46
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,370
And what cocaine was at the time was one form of cocaine.

47
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:51,400
There's only one. And we're going to talk about the one we talk about, like opioids, like synthetic opioids versus heroin versus prescription opioids.

48
00:04:51,820 --> 00:05:02,230
So this is this is an example of a the cocaine epidemic is also change as new forms of cocaine essentially became available on the market.

49
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,870
And this is what it looks like. So, again, all of this graph fits within right here.

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,670
Okay. So I'm showing you side by side, but I don't you need to kind of notice what those Y-axis are.

51
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,910
So what happens in 1986 are for people who read this week what happened in 1986.

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,080
Who died. Basketball player basketball by Len Bias.

53
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,390
How many of you have heard of him? So it's easy.

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,020
So imagine if LeBron James had died.

55
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:51,559
You know, or Michael Jordan. Like that's the level of sort of conversation around my bias that people were having the he had been drafted

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,870
by the Celtics it was either the day before or a couple of days before this had been on national news.

57
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,880
And he dies of an overdose a couple of days after this. It is it is massive.

58
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,380
Yes. So in 1986, Len Bias dies.

59
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:14,960
And it is it is that event along with other events.

60
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:22,219
But that event sort of becomes the public impetus for this,

61
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,750
which is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America, the first page of it, which is called not the.

62
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,519
Yeah. So the short title is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,530
It's got this much longer title.

64
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:43,510
And you you if you are familiar with this act, you are likely familiar with it because of its association with these types of pieces.

65
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,580
Maybe you heard just a little crack. Okay. Maybe you do.

66
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:56,040
Howard Jackson was a famous basketball baseball player or cocaine.

67
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,760
Can't really hurt you. Well, you heard wrong. There's no home run on cocaine.

68
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,080
You get me. Are you listening to just a little bit of crack?

69
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,470
Cocaine can be a detective or even kill you.

70
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,440
That's what the real truth the lie is. It's the other guy who was going to die.

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,360
Cocaine. The people I call one 866 two.

72
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,510
So what? So what stood out to you about that?

73
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,860
Not an example of a public service announcement. What is he using?

74
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,690
What is the what is the sort of ideas? Kind of what will motivate you to not use drugs?

75
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,580
Yeah, it is very much like a scare tactic. You. Yes.

76
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,020
Yes. Fear. Well, so fear is the is sort of what might happen.

77
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,670
Um, we, we now know it's, I guess it's possible.

78
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,600
We know at the time, but we now know that like when you start sort of hearing something that's a little scary,

79
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,450
you kind of tune out within about, know, two, 3 seconds, like you just sort of.

80
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,180
It's not a motivational it's not a thing that helps people approach a difficult topic.

81
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:20,250
In what ways was the ideas that I told you last week about what causes a reinforced behavior like those that are those represented in that?

82
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,870
What's the assumption as to why people use? I mean, what are they?

83
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,060
What are some of the kind of what do you think the creators of that ad thought about why people use drugs?

84
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,860
Yeah. They think it's safe. So it's no harm.

85
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,880
So the risks are low? Yeah. I think that is not going to happen to them or a chance occurrence.

86
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,190
Yeah. So it's a kind of random thing, you know, it's not, it's not controllable potentially.

87
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:05,100
Or is it is. Right. But there's nothing there about your antecedents.

88
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:11,530
There's nothing there about that. The drive that is underneath the hood that sort of causes the reinforced behavior.

89
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,310
They talk about the consequences, which is there's this risk of death. Right. This risk of overdose.

90
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,320
But there's that's the that's a that's what we've learned last week is like that's the end effect.

91
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:29,760
The consequence. Right. That's not what motivates the behavior, is that what interrupts the learned behavior, the reinforced behavior.

92
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,329
So there's other ones that have been that you've probably seen on, you know, like the famous one up, like an egg in a frying pan.

93
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:49,770
And this idea that like, you know, if people only knew they would be sorry, they would they would not use.

94
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,670
Sorry. Sorry.

95
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:10,940
Okay. So this is that this is the this is the actual text that sets up what was in the reading that we learned about during the quiz,

96
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:18,499
which is the mandatory minimum sentencing differential for powder cocaine versus what at the time was not called crack cocaine,

97
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,940
but was called base cocaine. So the first part here in the highlight, it says.

98
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,690
So in the case of violation this. And so the first thing it says, it tells you about 100 grams of heroin,

99
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:38,419
500 grams or more of a mixture containing coca leaves, cocaine, something else like cocaine and any compound.

100
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,719
Right. So this is powder cocaine. So that's the very first heading here.

101
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,310
So this is where you get this 500 is 100 to 1 ratio. This is how it set out in the law.

102
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,319
Or five grams or more of a substance described in here, which contains cocaine base.

103
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:02,020
That is the sort of the official chemical term for crack cocaine or ten grams of PCP or one gram of LSD or,

104
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,639
you know, so there's other drugs involved in it. Right. But the big one that people are using.

105
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,150
So because most people are not using heroin or these other drugs is is cocaine.

106
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,780
And then down here is what is called the mandatory minimum sentencing,

107
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,460
which is that person will be sentenced to a term which is not less than five years, not more than 40.

108
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,030
So not less than five and not more than 40. This is the set up here. Right. I'm sorry.

109
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm going to run that up. Right. That doesn't make I'll.

110
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:44,710
Something to think about when I think.

111
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:26,620
You can. I like to say something important.

112
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah, it's. I know.

113
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,600
Because you left. I mean, I really can't get.

114
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,550
So. All right.

115
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,040
So the action is initially written to target drug traffickers.

116
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,809
That is, people who are without possession,

117
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:23,470
with intent to sell is what is kind of the official term as amended two years later to include just straight possession.

118
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:34,870
Okay. So the original act, the thing that kind of has all the public support is not not to target drug users, to target drug traffickers.

119
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,670
Two years later, we forget about that distinction and are using the exact same policy to target drug users.

120
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,790
In 2002, we get the, uh,

121
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,470
this the United States Sentencing Commission report produces this report on cocaine in federal sentencing, which has you know,

122
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:06,969
it's always helpful, I think, when like to see an organization reflect on its past mistakes, like to see an external critic reflect.

123
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:14,410
So this is the federal government's words like if the federal government could talk, this is what it's saying about itself and it's saying that it,

124
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,840
uh, that the current criminal penalties exaggerate the relative harmfulness of crack cocaine,

125
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,079
um, that current penalties are way too broad if they're applying to lower level offenders at these quantity based

126
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:33,040
penalties overstate the seriousness of most crack offenses and the penalties most severity mostly impacts minorities.

127
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,120
I can think of another example of a policy that the government has been this forthright about how it's screwed up.

128
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,540
Okay. This is from that report.

129
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,790
So before we get too much credit, this is from the report.

130
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,000
It says The overwhelming majority of offenders subject to these heightened penalties are black.

131
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,900
85% is their estimate in 2000. And then they say.

132
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:04,140
So it says that has contributed to the widely held perception that the current penalty structure promotes unwarranted disparity based on race.

133
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,160
And I was like. Perception. Interesting. Okay. And then it says, although this assertion cannot be scientifically evaluated and I'm like.

134
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,579
Why would that? So is it. Why is it saying, you know.

135
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,760
So anyway, to the point of although this research cannot be scientifically evaluated, they find that even this perception is a problem.

136
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,830
Well, and then I thought, well, why do they say they cannot scientifically evaluate whether the policy was discriminatory?

137
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,340
But it's kind of just struck me as like a little bit of a strange. Sure.

138
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,480
And this is why they say they can't scientifically evaluate it.

139
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:45,050
Like, for example, if 85% of people who are convicted and sentenced for selling for selling crack cocaine are black.

140
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,280
The fact that the same percentage of all crack cocaine traffickers are black would basically say there's no disparity.

141
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,450
So like if 85% of people who traffic crack cocaine are black,

142
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,130
then we should expect that 85% of the people who are convicted for trafficking crack cocaine to be black.

143
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,370
Right. Like that's the that's what they're saying. Right.

144
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:12,860
If, however, some other number some number, less than 85% of people who traffic cocaine are black.

145
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,330
The fact that 85% of people who are sentenced for trafficking cocaine are black

146
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,160
would suggest or would be supportive that there's this unwarranted disparity.

147
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:30,380
Does it matter what proportion of the U.S. population is black? Remember back to my very first day where we talked about numbers this.

148
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,210
Is it 85%? No. Is it 50% now?

149
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,970
Is it 30%? Is it 20%? It's about 14 to 15%, depending on the difference.

150
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,820
Okay. So okay, so just mass. So in order for this assertion to be true, we'd have to massively over represent.

151
00:16:53,060 --> 00:17:01,160
Okay. And then they say, because we don't have although we know who uses cocaine, we don't know who sells cocaine.

152
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,219
That is, there's not a survey of people who sell cocaine. Therefore, we can't actually and we didn't ask about their rates.

153
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,240
Or maybe there's maybe there is a survey of people who sell cocaine, but we actually don't know their demographics.

154
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,940
Right. So as a result, it can't be tested scientifically.

155
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,330
So this is I mean, but as hopefully you've kind of got a little bit of an understanding of like most people get their substances from their peers.

156
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,020
Most people don't buy from a stranger. Okay. Like that's how people get drugs.

157
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:37,340
And so what that means is that the the drug users and drug sellers are not that distinct a group of people.

158
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,260
So who uses cocaine in the United States?

159
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,940
Because we do know this from the National Survey on Drug Use and health, which you're using for your homework.

160
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:54,680
Well, here you go. So here's in 2014, 3.8% of non-Hispanic whites said they had used had ever used crack cocaine compared to 4.7.

161
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm sorry, this is. Yes, crack cocaine. This is compared to 4.7% who had ever used in 2015 or sorry, among African-Americans.

162
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,880
And, you know, if you go back down to the past month, these differences are, you know, remained very small.

163
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,600
So that is less than a percentage point difference in 2014.

164
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,120
A little bit more than a percentage point difference in 2015. Certainly no evidence that 85% of people who use crack cocaine are black.

165
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:35,500
Right. There's no evidence of that. So again, I want to I want to commend the government for sort of at least sort of recognizing this.

166
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,220
But then I also want to sort of call out the way that they basically used

167
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:48,500
science to just sort of justify how they could not be certain about the whole,

168
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:58,810
you know, that they could not be certain about. A key fact that every that if it's not true, sort of none of this really, really sort of rings true.

169
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,510
You know what I'm trying to say? It's a little bit of a false confession.

170
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:10,030
So in 2010, we get the Fair Sentencing Act, which revises the mandatory minimum sentencing.

171
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,690
It is. You are still sentenced. If you were if you were if your judge applied a mandatory minimum, you would still be sentenced.

172
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,800
It's not 1 to 1. And so it's not it's 18 to 1 in terms of how they landed on the 18 is.

173
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,480
We haven't. This is a story for some sort of bureaucratic whatever.

174
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,859
But I want to point out that while Obama signs this into law, this is actually a this is a this topic,

175
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:46,890
at least more recently in in American history has been one that has had proponents for across the political spectrum.

176
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,680
So this is really interesting. This is Rand Paul who is sort of a husband father.

177
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,800
So this is. Yes. This is this is Ron Paul, who is the father of Rand Paul, who is a current senator from Kentucky.

178
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,760
And this is him. He's a libertarian.

179
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Both of them are registered in the Republican Party. This is him arguing in support of the Fair Sentencing Act, which Obama ends up signing into law.

180
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,510
Support of this legislation is called the Fair Sentencing.

181
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:29,979
Like to rename it? No, I don't like the Slightly Fairer Sentencing Act because he really makes an attempt to correct a very,

182
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,420
very serious problem in equal justice system that I think we saw a lot.

183
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:44,680
I would have much preferred age of 30 to 45 a revision co-sponsor that along with Congressman Scott.

184
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,650
I think this is a typical example of trying to fix the problem that we invited upon ourselves.

185
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,690
You know, the economics. I, I, you know, I don't really listen to all of it.

186
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:06,160
But the point I want to what I want I want to sort of say is that people who sort of may disagree on lots of different policy issues more broadly.

187
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:18,130
I can sort of in this case around mandatory minimums have found some sources of common ground in that a policy of.

188
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:26,350
Punishment. That is, deterrence is nonsensical when it comes to effecting drug use.

189
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,840
So to end, one of the optional readings you could have done today is a paper that I did with a student

190
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,690
who took the graduate version of this class that I taught several years ago that again,

191
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:50,200
kind of demonstrates empirically the whether the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America that is the specific that the high penalties for

192
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,980
crack cocaine use relative to powder cocaine whether that actually changed the proportion of people who were using cocaine.

193
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,239
Right. Because that supposedly that's the purpose of the law to decrease the number of people who are using cocaine and other drugs.

194
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:12,700
Right. So if and this is all based on a kind of criminology theory called deterrence, which is that.

195
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:23,970
The reason that we must have severe penalties for things that we don't want people to do, so we can to the state can execute you for murder.

196
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,680
This should help you quell your desire for murder.

197
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,910
That would be that's part of the argument that people make for why we should have capital punishment.

198
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,460
But it's part of the argument.

199
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:44,370
So what we wanted to know is, okay, well, if deterrence, that is these massive sentences of at least five years in prison and up to 40 years.

200
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:55,260
If that if if that's the thing that's sort of driving people's decision making about drugs, then we should expect that when the law passed,

201
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:03,089
that we should have seen a decline in base cocaine use without a decline or without as much a decline in powder cocaine use,

202
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,649
because that's deterrence for base.

203
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,710
That is, crack cocaine were much greater than the penalties for base cocaine were much greater than the penalties for powder cocaine.

204
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,330
And also,

205
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,580
even though I showed you there are a bunch of drugs that were covered by that law and there were some drugs that weren't covered by that law,

206
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:30,479
specifically prescription drugs. So there was no additional penalty for misusing things like Xanax and trying to think of other Quaaludes,

207
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,660
other things that you could get from prescriptions. Okay.

208
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,080
So there was the anti-drug abuse did not cover misuse of prescription drugs.

209
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,659
So what we did in this paper is we used what's called a difference in difference approach, which is again sort of building on this,

210
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,860
like let's imagine the thought experiment of what should have happened if the

211
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,640
entire Drug Abuse Act of America by imposing these mandatory minimum sentencing.

212
00:23:53,090 --> 00:24:00,950
What should have happened is that we should have seen a massive decline in crack use, a modest decline in powder cocaine use,

213
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,930
and no change in prescription drug use because the prescription drugs were not subject to anything in this law.

214
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,370
They weren't even mentioned in the. So that's the prediction. If deterrence is causing people to say, you know what, I don't want to try crack.

215
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:28,490
Similarly, when Obama signs the Fair Sentencing Act, which now makes it, it removes some of the punishment for using crack cocaine.

216
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:34,460
Right. So we go from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1. I should have seen an increase in crack use.

217
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,180
Right, like that. That would have if if deterrence is the thing,

218
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,280
that's if the if the massive the possibility of spending up to 40 years in prison is the thing

219
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,239
that keeps people from using crack then by by relaxing that that affects that punishment.

220
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
I should have people should have been like, you know what, I think I will try it, right?

221
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:01,400
Like if that's if that's the logic, right? That's I don't know. It sounds kind of childish and very simplistic for me to present it this way,

222
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,950
but that is not too far from like what people think when deterrence theory works.

223
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:14,149
So again, this is just to summarize. So if we if when when the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America is passed,

224
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:21,140
we should have seen a reduction in both forms of cocaine with a stronger reduction in base cocaine, that is crack cocaine.

225
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,130
If when the Fair Sentencing Act is passed, we should have seen an increase use in base cocaine with no change in powder cocaine.

226
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,510
But if these changes if we don't observe that,

227
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:39,020
if instead what we observe is that drugs were just declining over time anyway and the law just kind of dropped in,

228
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,960
but it actually did nothing to the slope of that decline.

229
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,890
Then that would suggest that there was something else happening, just like awareness campaigns or other policies,

230
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,430
etc., that were in the water that were already causing drugs to decline.

231
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,000
And we can test that by using these prescription drug issues because prescription drugs are not affected by either of these laws.

232
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:11,540
So what do we observe? So this is cocaine based cocaine, cocaine base cocaine powder and prescription drugs in 85, 88 and 90.

233
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:21,080
So this is right before the law is passed. Right when it's extended to include people who possess even if they don't sell.

234
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,000
And this is after the law has been in place for a while. This is the Fair Sentencing Act.

235
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:31,209
This is 2009. Before it's passed. So before it's passed into law one year after and then another year after.

236
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,080
And what do we observe? Let's just take powder cocaine for an example.

237
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,250
Since it's the tallest bar, what do you see?

238
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,740
What happened to use of powder cocaine over time?

239
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,060
It dropped. It dropped? Yes.

240
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,670
And what happened to the use of crack cocaine, which you can also see is much less common than powder cocaine just based on this.

241
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,330
And also drug. And what else? What happened to their use of prescription drugs?

242
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,209
This latest part. It also. Even though there was no additional penalties, there was nothing.

243
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,380
They were not covered in the law. And what happens after the Fair Sentencing Act?

244
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,430
This is before Obama signed it into law. This is right after.

245
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,300
No changed. And this is another. So what?

246
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,420
Essentially there's no evidence that these mandatory minimums, the threat of a mandatory minimum,

247
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:32,060
the policy had any impact on cocaine use, whether powder or base cocaine at the population level, no evidence.

248
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:44,930
Um. And I say this because this law has.

249
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:54,260
This, you know, really destroyed many people's families because people have been incarcerated for a very long time as a result of this law.

250
00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:01,160
And you could sort of say, well, if it works, maybe, maybe somehow this would be worth it.

251
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,080
Right. But it didn't even work. It didn't even do the thing it was supposed to do.

252
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:14,730
You know, and so that the harm that is caused by it is not outweighed or even offset by any benefit that we got.

253
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,260
So one of the things that the the Drug Policy Alliance, which they actually produce,

254
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:30,810
this is sort of a main advocacy group around like around the decriminalization of marijuana and other types of efforts.

255
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,080
If that's something you're interested in, I recommend you sort of sign up for their stuff.

256
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:41,790
And one of the things that they've asked policymakers to do is to always do what's called a racial impact statement,

257
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:49,830
which is essentially asks policymakers to essentially do is simulate what would happen,

258
00:28:50,710 --> 00:29:01,800
what would the law inadvertently or what are what would the law result in disproportionate impact for racial minorities if implemented as intended?

259
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,900
Right. And so they specifically call out the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America as an example of had,

260
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:14,010
but that basically everything that happened after the 1986 law was foreseeable.

261
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:24,420
Okay. Like had they done this type of assessment? And so it's helpful to sort of see that this is that this type of conversation happening.

262
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:32,210
Now, these are not necessarily required, but it's something that is a important you know,

263
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,030
this is this is a specific policy that advocacy groups can push for.

264
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,660
So even if even beyond their specific policy goals. Right.

265
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,620
This this idea of how do we how do we consider issues like racial disparities when we're talking about policy?

266
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:54,660
We get an we get a report on the Fair Sentencing Act a couple of years after its passed there.

267
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:04,229
So just to summarize, they basically say that there have been fewer crack cocaine offenders prosecuted since the Fair Sentencing Act,

268
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,200
although there's still a lot of people who are still being prosecuted.

269
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,550
They it does appear to getting that the the effect of the law does appear to be making the sentencing.

270
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,390
The sentences that people get if they are convicted for crack cocaine or powder cocaine possession are more similar.

271
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,680
So, again, it's not it didn't solve everything, but there's evidence that it's at least accomplishing some of its goals.

272
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:38,790
So to summarize, powder, so cocaine is in the first form of cocaine that was widely used in America was powder cocaine.

273
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,419
And it was extraordinarily expensive. It was a drug that was almost exclusively used by people of higher socioeconomic status until the mid 1980s.

274
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,180
When we get a new form of cocaine on the drug market, which we which is sort of publicly called crack cocaine,

275
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,339
but is officially called the base cocaine or cocaine base. And because it was so much cheaper,

276
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:02,370
it essentially created a new market of drug users that otherwise could not access this more expensive version of the drug.

277
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,120
The net result is that typical cocaine users in the 1990s and onward had a lower

278
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,780
socioeconomic status than people of the typical continues in the seventies and eighties.

279
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:24,450
And then we now have some government recognition that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America and its provision in 1988,

280
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:32,190
which again applies the law that was originally written for traffickers to people just for possession, was misguided policy.

281
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,260
And I also want to just point out, I guess, way that you're kind of consistent with this idea of drug use.

282
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,510
So 1986, led by US dies and we get the anti-drug act in America.

283
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,290
And what has been what is happening with cocaine use in the United States when that happens?

284
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,950
It has been declining from for several years.

285
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,060
So this is a situation of sort of like the tail wagging the dog.

286
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,240
Okay. So it's like the crisis is on its way out and we and we pass a law.

287
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,900
It was never a huge crisis in this population.

288
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:18,400
It was most of the users were here. If if what we're talking about is use of cocaine that the risk of.

289
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,460
Now because base cocaine and powder cocaine are ingested differently there is a different risk of overdose.

290
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,810
There's also a potential different risk of developing substance dependance.

291
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,440
We talked about a little about this like nobody gets addicted to nicotine from using a patch.

292
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,730
They get addicted to nicotine from smoking and then they might go to a patch.

293
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,190
Right. But that the way that that drug is the way the drug is consumed does affect its it's

294
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,200
that how quickly how quickly you feel high and how high how long that high lasts,

295
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:56,380
which results in different risks of dependance. But the point is, is that this is a law that's coming after the worst, that everything's crested.

296
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:10,250
So let me stop here and ask, oh, this is my last slide on that substance use and I'll just take questions.

297
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:20,120
So because of the decriminalization of Schedule one drugs under schedule and many schedule two drugs,

298
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,040
we see that the legal system is is just we cannot talk about substance use without talking time, the legal system.

299
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,160
But the way that the legal system,

300
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:36,140
the other ways that the legal system impacts substance use disorders is that it impacts your ability to get treatment.

301
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,810
Right. We talked about this with the close. It impacts your actually how harmful drug use is.

302
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,629
So it's not just that you might become dependent, but that you might get arrested, you might lose your job.

303
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:56,420
You might not be able to get access to federal federal support, you know, social services,

304
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,980
because if you have a felony conviction, oftentimes states will not allow you to get access to social services.

305
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:10,370
And more broadly, the net result of that is that the law through the criminalization is increasing the burden of substance use.

306
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,080
If you think about this social health and economic waste.

307
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:29,150
Let me pause there for questions. Yeah. So like after 1986 with like the client, it's like, okay, do we know why, like at that time or something?

308
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:37,130
Yeah. So. So the short answer is no. Except that all drug epidemics and like all epidemics coban will end.

309
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:50,020
And it ends for, you know, why do epidemics send more general? Like a lot of people die and the disease, we don't infect as many other people.

310
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:58,930
Mm hmm. Yeah. What else? And it could just, like, become endemic and, like, there's not shots, but there is, like, the use.

311
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,300
I guess more people are living with it. Well, what also like if you're going to so once.

312
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:12,440
So part of what happened with COVID is that very few like at the beginning, we all have had opportunities for exposure yet.

313
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,680
Right. So none of us had immunity.

314
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,990
But now everybody's got some level of immunity either because you got it through a vaccine or because you got the or some combination of it.

315
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,770
And so the net result is that that's why we're not seeing these massive increases in cases,

316
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:31,290
because if there's not many more susceptibles left in the population, so drug use,

317
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,570
you can think about it like some people are just never going to use a drug.

318
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,140
And so once a drug becomes why when a drug is first introduced, the people who are interested in using it,

319
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,200
once they have that for the first time, they see this increase in use.

320
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,500
But once everybody sort of has relative access to it, you sort of you just run out of people who want to try it or want to use it.

321
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:58,080
Right. And what also happens with when bias is death is that the social perceptions or the perception?

322
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,320
One of the other things we talked about last time is like perceptions of risk.

323
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,810
So when bias is death causes this massive increase in the perception of risk of use.

324
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,750
Okay. So but that it's he was not the first person who died of an overdose.

325
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:20,010
Right. So I'm sure you can name 15 people who died of famous people who died of overdoses like prior to 1986.

326
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:29,820
Right. So it's not that people hadn't had some understanding that risk of death was was could affect even people who had a lot of wealth.

327
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:39,270
Right. So it I think it's that kind of conversation that was happening more generally that causes this general decline in use.

328
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,580
So to Susceptibles and then we get this changing risk perception.

329
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:51,630
Yeah. Oh, no. I guess cause that what you're talking about was like decline in use.

330
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,500
Yeah. So we've already got the decline in use before Lennon dies, but he's not the first person to die of cocaine.

331
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:05,010
He's just a very it was it was literally within I feel like it was within hours of him being drafted by the Celtics.

332
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,480
Like, it was it was it was a specific moment in time.

333
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,940
But this is. This is. You know,

334
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,570
you can't get a massive increase in the number of people using cocaine without

335
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,710
also getting a massive increase in number of people dying from cult like.

336
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,350
So that is even though it's not shown on this map that's happening at the same time.

337
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:39,560
The questions. So the guy who is responsible for implementing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in America was guy named Drone Jaffe,

338
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,890
and he was that America's first drug czar who was appointed by Richard Nixon.

339
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,010
And he taught my course at Hopkins on drug drug use.

340
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,030
Epidemiology is really fascinating character.

341
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,850
So I encourage you if you're going to really want to go down the rabbit hole, too.

342
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:06,559
I'm sure YouTube has a lot of interviews with JFK asking the questions about cocaine, but you're not supertasters.

343
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,780
Don't ask you that. Right. And okay, let's talk about opioids.

344
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,880
So so opioids, which is no surprise to you, are a massive, massive increase in use.

345
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,509
So this is the number of new users of substances in 2019.

346
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,440
So that is people who for the first time are trying to substance the most commonly

347
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,400
used substance for the first time in 2019 is alcohol followed by marijuana,

348
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,440
followed by cigarets and prescription drugs prescribed specifically.

349
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,060
Those are prescription painkillers killers.

350
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:44,870
So not look, we're not talking about tranquilizers or stimulants or other types of prescription drugs, specifically prescription painkillers.

351
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:53,960
So so kind of what that means is there are as many more new users of tobacco as there are new users of opioids each year.

352
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,590
To help you understand how massive those are, different age demographics for each new user.

353
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:09,440
All these folks are young. Like once you get out of like essentially the so the average age that most people try marijuana is going to late teens or

354
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,959
early twenties that's and all of these are going to be early twenties spent like nobody's trying that stuff in their forties,

355
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,920
fifties and sixties. That must be correct.

356
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,440
So it is very possible that so this is specifically misuse of prescription opioids.

357
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:31,070
So it doesn't mean when you get your wisdom teeth out and you got a script for OxyContin, that's not what we're talking about.

358
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:37,399
This is this is a taking a medication more than you were prescribed or somebody else's

359
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,270
medication so that you weren't prescribed or more often than you were prescribed.

360
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,799
Or just to get high, like not not that you were not in pain. You just take it just to get high.

361
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,340
So that's what prescription drug misuse means here. So so to clarify my answer,

362
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:00,079
so those folks are going to be a little bit older because part of what get you access to those things is accidents and having painful conditions.

363
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,820
Right. So it just is part of the the access. But even for young people, this is a very complex.

364
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,069
So this is from 2015 to 2016 to showing you the accidental overdoses.

365
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,149
We're talking about suicide next week. So suicide is now the 12th cause of death.

366
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,840
But that's because we have COVID now, which has pushed these things out.

367
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:33,170
But before COVID happens. Accidents, which include unintentional overdoses, are the third leading cause of death overall in the entire United States.

368
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,040
And currently it's the fourth leading cause of death, all accidents.

369
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:47,090
Again, the vast majority of those are accidental overdoses. So we didn't talk about this with cocaine, but this is also true of cocaine.

370
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,469
Is that one of the key features of substance use epidemics, both new and old,

371
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,299
whether we're talking about I'm going to show you some data from actually this is a paper by Jerome Jaffee,

372
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,700
who's the senior author here of a heroin epidemic that happened in Chicago in the 1970s.

373
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:09,709
But that, just like an epidemic of common substance use epidemics cluster within and operate through social networks.

374
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,970
You almost certainly if you got caught, but you almost certainly got it from somebody that you spend a lot of time with,

375
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,830
like you didn't get it from like your trip to the grocery store if you got it from yeah,

376
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:25,639
most, most, most likely you spent, you got it from somebody you spent a lot of time with and they cluster by geography, right?

377
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,430
Which we've seen all these maps of, like which county is red or whatever.

378
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,000
And, you know, that's that is exactly what drug use epidemics look like as well,

379
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,110
that they they operate through social networks in a cluster by geography.

380
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,959
This is 1972. So we don't have you know, computers are the size of this room, you know, not quite,

381
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,230
but still the author, I tell you so 1986 was like when Drake was formed.

382
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,600
So to help you understand, sorry. Okay.

383
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,729
So I don't I didn't look up 1972.

384
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:59,750
But anyway, so the point is, is that this is time and that how heroin uses is traveling through different neighborhoods of Chicago,

385
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,700
right through specifically through friend networks. Well, now we have much better technology.

386
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,790
And so we can actually use social network analysis, which you may have seen some of these things with COVID, like how cocaine got transferred,

387
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:18,800
what we can use the exact same thing to understand how and this is a this is a study of people who are misusing OxyContin in Appalachia.

388
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,780
So we're showing how it moved through these different social networks.

389
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:34,650
So last time we talked about the ways of using surveys for measuring drug use in the population,

390
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,209
and we talked about how we need to make sure that we preserve confidentiality because you're asking about something that is illicit,

391
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,490
that is potentially has legal implications for someone. And we talked about some of the problems because like a household survey,

392
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:53,490
like the national the national survey on drug use and health is not going to include somebody.

393
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,880
It's not going to include people who are in prison or jail or rehabilitation facilities.

394
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:05,930
So another way that we try to measure epidemics is through other types of data that don't require us to talk to somebody.

395
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,580
So I'm going to show you some examples of some of these data.

396
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,970
So if you were ever arrested, one of the things that would happen is you would they would be on drugs screen.

397
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:22,740
You you said we can look at that. We can look at entry into drug treatment programs, although we've talked about how rare drug treatment is.

398
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:29,040
So this is not a very good marker because this epidemic begins with prescription medications.

399
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,160
We can actually look at prescription medications both for the thing that people are using,

400
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,220
but also for medications that people take when they are dependent on a prescription they are abusing.

401
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Okay. And then I've even seen papers that look at.

402
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:47,580
So one of the things one of the side effects of chronic opioid use is constipation.

403
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,170
And so you can also track the drug use epidemic by looking at sales of laxatives, which have also increased exponentially.

404
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,300
Right. So there's different ways that you can measure epidemics. I'm sorry.

405
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,920
You can look at emergency room admissions, mortality records and drug seizures.

406
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,870
So I'm not going to show you data from all of this.

407
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:16,170
But what's important to understand is, like, if you want to sort of if it's that long before you're asking somebody about their driver's values,

408
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:24,690
you can you can say these are the things that might be like the canary in the coal mine in terms of is there something happening in this?

409
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:29,010
We might see it here first before you before you even know to ask about it on a survey.

410
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,020
So this is 1991 to 2010.

411
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,910
This is the number, total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed by U.S. pharmacies.

412
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:47,420
So this you know, this is per number of prescriptions in the millions.

413
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:54,649
So with the you can you can specifically see the two main opioids at this time.

414
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,639
These are not the only ones,

415
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:02,210
but the two main opioids at this time that are being prescribed are hydrocodone and oxycodone treat from forms of this drug.

416
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,030
So you can see here that and this is this is again in the nineties.

417
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:17,610
Okay. So this is. Peak like Backstreet Boys, like insane because I'm going to.

418
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,000
But it goes beyond that. So this is now starting in the 1970s.

419
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,630
This is now all drug. This is any unintended drug overdose death.

420
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,480
Okay. So 1986, we get the American music to America.

421
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:41,109
What is happening to drug overdoses? Crazy, crazy, crazy.

422
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,160
But, you know, you got to kind of look, it's not very much.

423
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,379
Right. So, you know, to the point of like where what was the you know, so, yes,

424
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,160
there was a mild increase, but like certainly not anything like what we're about to see.

425
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,620
Right. So this is 1986. This is when you get the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of America again.

426
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,230
These are drug these are deaths from any cause, any drug overdose deaths.

427
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:16,970
In 1990, we get this drug called drug user, which is becomes FDA approved steroid use, which is a is a sort of very highly potent product.

428
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:24,200
The OxyContin approved in 1995. We get that now approved in 1998.

429
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:24,770
At the time,

430
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:35,160
fentanyl is only available in a liquid form that has to be given in a patient like it must be an inpatient in a hospital to get access to that.

431
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:43,100
There's going to be a change in the formulation of that. That comes later. But at the time, this is a liquid that is put in somebody essentially.

432
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:55,710
The FDA sends a hey, what you're doing letter to Purdue Pharma, who is the maker of OxyContin in the mid-nineties.

433
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,600
This is the first time the FDA sort of starts getting anxious that something's happening.

434
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:08,559
So just to kind of but it's helpful to kind of see as these drugs are getting approved.

435
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:16,540
Again, this are all these are all cause overdoses. These aren't just opioid overdoses, but you see this dramatic increase, that epidemic.

436
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:23,890
So this is 1999 to 2004. So this is where this is happening is essentially right here.

437
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:31,930
Okay. So this part of the epidemic and the question is, where did that massive increase, where was it disproportionately felt?

438
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,979
And what I'm showing you here and this is a map that is areas in white are states

439
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,390
who might have a relatively low proportion of their population that is rural,

440
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:50,409
like living in a rural area. Areas of blue have at least a third to over a half of the population lives in a rural area.

441
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,470
Okay, so more rural states are blue. Michigan is right here in the middle.

442
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:01,930
So you can see and the number that's represented here is the percent increase in overdose deaths in that state over that time period.

443
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:10,209
And so what you can see is that more and more rural, the state on average, the larger increase in overdose deaths.

444
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:20,560
So specifically, I'll call out West Virginia, which had a 550% increase in mortality, overdose, death, mortality over a five year period.

445
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,680
Okay. In Michigan, our our increase was 74% over that same time.

446
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,900
So one of the things that the opioid epidemic as it's kicking off, I mean, I guess it's already kicked off,

447
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:39,769
but we're talking about right here is that this is predominantly an epidemic that's occurring in rural areas with the deaths.

448
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,770
Deaths due to overdoses are predominantly occurring in rural areas.

449
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:53,620
There was a hypothesis this is before Cochrane is is has happened that we maybe had sort

450
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:00,280
of reached this point of saturation in terms of number of new users and that student use.

451
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,860
So I mean, people like literally people wrote off. It's like it's like the time has come.

452
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,600
By the time this crested, we're on our way out. So we had a 10% increase.

453
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:19,060
This is pre-COVID March 2020. During COVID, we had another increase of 30% overdoses during.

454
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,080
Again, these are all substances, not just opioids, but the vast majority of this is opioids.

455
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,060
The only state, three states, had a decline in overdose deaths during that same time period.

456
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:35,940
Everything that's in orange is the increase, and the two states that are in bloom are three states that are in blue decreases.

457
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:44,860
This is post COVID. So this is the most recent data that the CDC has discovered in May of last year, from May 2021 to May of last year.

458
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,230
And we've had a still an increase, but only 6.7% increase.

459
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:58,840
So it is it is possible that the rate of increase is declining, but the increase is still happening.

460
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,190
Okay. So there's this if there is not a decline in overdose deaths.

461
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:17,000
Um, but. And part of what is going on in this is that just like the nature of computers changed over the course of that epidemic,

462
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:26,720
the nature of opioid use has changed over the course of the epidemic as additional medications have increased increase in use,

463
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,930
and some of this change in use is being driven by cost.

464
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,359
So there was a point in time, I don't know if this is still true, but it was cheaper to buy this for the same amount of heroin.

465
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,330
It was cheaper to buy heroin than it was to get a pill of OxyContin. It was a cheaper way.

466
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:47,950
So if what you are looking for is an opioid. There were and you were like needing to, you know, had a limited financial means or whatever.

467
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:52,280
It just didn't want whatever point is that the price of these things is changing over time.

468
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:59,400
You can see we get these synthetics. This is fentanyl and similar type things that are really not there.

469
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:05,150
They exist a little bit in 2000, but they're really taking off in the most recent,

470
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:11,690
more recent years in terms of and this is this is now not use this is deaths specifically.

471
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:18,500
So what you can see is that synthetic opioids now make up the largest proportion of overdose deaths.

472
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:30,780
Okay. And the thing that's really difficult about this is that most people and I guess that's shown here, people don't know what they're getting.

473
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,470
So you think you're buying a pill of OxyContin and you're not you have no idea that it's

474
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,410
not OxyContin or you think you're buying Xanax and you have no idea that it's not Xanax.

475
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,079
So that that's what is happening here.

476
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:55,680
Is that because these there's not an easy way for somebody to know what is in there, that they're buying, that, you know,

477
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:03,660
if if the other thing that's happening here is that opioids develop tolerance, that is, you need to use more to get the same high.

478
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:10,360
Okay. And the way that opioids cause death is that they suppress breathing.

479
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:16,770
And so if you are using more, even if it's the exact same pill that you've taken,

480
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:23,909
even if the exact same substance that you normally take, you can use so much that it suppresses your breathing.

481
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,030
And if you're not using it with other people, they might not notice that you've stopped breathing.

482
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,280
So that's the that's when people talk about like safe use sites, etc., like that's why they're talking about them.

483
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,120
Because the notion is that I could either, you know,

484
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:46,380
if somebody had Narcan and they could reverse your overdose epidemic or you're going to start reduce your undu your attempts to reverse your overdose.

485
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,549
Although there's also debate about like whether those whether Narcan is even keeping up with the amount of

486
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,840
the over that because the thing is like it's actually it's another drug that you're giving to the person.

487
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:06,180
So we actually don't know that what's in Narcan is enough to reverse a fentanyl overdose so you can get somebody Narcan.

488
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,490
But if they've taken too much, it's not going to stick.

489
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:15,360
So, again, part of what what is part of why we're continuing to have this increase in deaths despite,

490
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:20,459
you know, just a massive amount of media attention on it,

491
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:30,270
is that there's the the drugs that are being used are much more lethal than the drugs that were being used in the beginning of the epidemic.

492
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:39,270
So another couple of people that have a role to play in this, which, again,

493
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,740
is not we don't necessarily think about the Drug Enforcement Administration as being a public health agency.

494
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,460
But as far as the opioid epidemic is concerned, they are right.

495
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:59,399
They are they are a group of people who do have efforts, too, because one of the things they do is they monitor prescription drugs.

496
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,920
Prescription drugs specifically schedule to that is your opioids.

497
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:09,389
And so if you if you ever if you've ever received a prescription for an opioid from a physician, they give you that prescription.

498
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:15,810
They had to write their DEA license number on it, which means that that prescription is tied to that doctor specifically,

499
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:23,670
not just tied to you, but that that, too, is tied to the doctor. So the DEA can notice how many prescriptions a doctor is is writing.

500
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,810
Another thing are these state prescription drug monitoring systems.

501
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,930
This is an example of Ars, Michigan, the MAPS system.

502
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,909
It's kind of misnamed. It doesn't just cover Michigan. It covers several different states and kind of the Midwest here.

503
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:44,040
And so what is what this does is it is it checks that if you go to fill a prescription at a pharmacy,

504
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,820
the pharmacist will run that prescription to see have you have you tried to fill a prescription

505
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,090
at any other pharmacy in this in this like in the states that are covered by this system?

506
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,799
The problem is that this is potentially has the potential for abuse from the side of the pharmacists.

507
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,560
That is where they will refuse to fill out legitimate prescriptions,

508
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,180
which is the other thing that we need to talk about, which we'll talk about in a few minutes,

509
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,979
about why what makes this such a difficult conversation, because these medications may not I mean,

510
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:20,760
even fentanyl has an appropriate FDA approved medical use, but that is to treat things like cancer pain.

511
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:26,010
It is not to like that is that is the FDA approved use of something like that.

512
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,870
So in June, I think this is 2020. We see.

513
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:44,310
Start 2018. So in June of 2018, we we get our first kind of first policy effort that's coming from the federal government,

514
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,960
which is to expand Medicare and Medicaid services for opioid treatment.

515
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,040
So again, this is 2018, right? So that's what it's happening.

516
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:58,440
That's not even represented here. So we've already had all of this happen plus a decade.

517
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,250
So we got our first, which is again night and day.

518
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:06,300
If you consider the policies that were the anti-drug act of America.

519
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,070
So the first thing that Congress passes for the opioid epidemic is to expand access.

520
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:18,360
It's not to criminalize people who are selling opioids. But more than the federal government efforts,

521
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:29,430
policy efforts has been state lawsuits to try to essentially recoup Medicaid costs for treating people who have opioid.

522
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,990
So states. So most of the people who are are states.

523
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,470
States have these large behavioral health services.

524
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,180
And most people who get access to substance use services are getting them through Medicaid.

525
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:55,690
And so what states have done is an example from Ohio's suit is sued drug distributors for essentially being a public nuisance.

526
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,740
So there's a law. There are laws. Most states have these laws on the books.

527
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:08,310
So they're not being sued for killing people. They're not being sued for their they're they're literally being sued for being a public nuisance.

528
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:17,660
And they're being sued for monetary damages because the states are covering Medicaid payments for people who have substance use like that.

529
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,290
That is the logic behind that's why the state of Ohio as legal standing to sue

530
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:29,280
Cardinal Health which is a McKesson these are like big distributors of drugs.

531
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:39,000
So talk to your pharmacy. It goes to one of these places. In 2019, there was a massive settlement of 260 million.

532
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,309
This has now been revised multiple times, but there have been also other settlements since then.

533
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:54,660
And so the drug companies are not not sort of seeing this, that juries are convicting drug companies, which is kind of amazing.

534
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:03,600
In September 1st of last year, Purdue Pharma is dissolved and they are now have 200 billion.

535
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:16,230
So. And that what makes this epidemic so different than the the cocaine epidemic is because there's a legitimate medical use for these things.

536
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,740
And it's not like. I mean, there are people who make cocaine.

537
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:28,250
Right. But those people are not like within the jurisdiction of, like, American courts.

538
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,819
Right. You don't know where they live, but like, you know, where Purdue is.

539
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,090
Like, that's a corporation. Like we know where their address is. They have to, like, answer their mail.

540
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:44,090
Right. And so it's made it's made the ways that we can try to manage the supply side, essentially, of the epidemic.

541
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,760
It's a very it's a totally different thing you're talking about.

542
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:56,130
So just to summarize, the opioid misuse is unintentional drug deaths, the vast majority of which are at least partially due to opioids.

543
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,900
We didn't I didn't talk about this. But the other thing that's important to understand is it's not just the opioids.

544
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,930
That's opioids in combination with something else.

545
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,770
Opioids plus alcohol. Opioids plus more. Right. It's those drug most.

546
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:13,460
When you look at what overdose deaths, the toxicology, oftentimes it's multiple drugs.

547
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:19,190
Sometimes, though, the person didn't know they were taking multiple drugs, so they didn't know that the Xanax also had sat in on it.

548
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,569
Right. So, I mean, it's not that it's intentional mixing of drugs.

549
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,340
There can be unintentional mixing of drugs.

550
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:34,110
Again, we get this epidemic beginning in the mid nineties where we get the first big FDA approved opioids for outpatient use.

551
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:40,830
So we've had opiates like we've had morphine for literally hundreds of years and we didn't have what happened here.

552
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,590
But you can't get morphine in an outpatient setting. And in fact, if you are impatient and on morphine,

553
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:51,660
you have to get your pain managed well enough in order to even be discharged here at Michigan Medicine.

554
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,220
They will not discharge you on morphine at the mercy.

555
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,420
You have to have your pain under control with an outpatient, with a with a prescription like Trazodone.

556
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:08,760
Which is still an opioid, but it's much, much lower risk of abuse and much, much lower risk of overdose again.

557
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:14,560
So we've had this very different epidemic is different because of these different stakeholders essentially that are involved.

558
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,250
And again, the thing that makes it so difficult is that chronic pain is real.

559
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,439
And this is from Michigan Medicine.

560
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,300
This guy, Daniel Klock, says if all chronic pain conditions were lumped together and considered to be a single disease,

561
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:34,060
this aggregate would be the most common, disabling and expensive health condition in the world.

562
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,310
So that's the needle we're trying to thread is how do we prevent accidental overdose deaths due to opioids,

563
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,020
while also allowing people who are living with a painful reduction to get medications they

564
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,550
need in order to have the functional quality of life that they deserve or that they want.

565
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:59,840
And I should to say that it is possible to prescribe an opiate and have low overdose risk,

566
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,810
because these are patients who are managing a comprehensive peace.

567
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:10,719
So this is the percent of patients who say these are people, just general patients, who are seen at a comprehensive pain clinic.

568
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,150
And these are the percent of people who had an overdose.

569
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:23,760
And you can see that the majority of people who are having their pain effectively manage are on one doctor and they're on one low dose medication.

570
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:29,260
Right. And they have very low relatively low risk of overdose. I mean, should not even realize they have a low risk of overdose.

571
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:35,380
People who have overdoses, again, if that are being medically, their pain is being medically managed,

572
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,410
they're often seeing multiple providers or they're on a high dose of an opiate.

573
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,000
So what needs to what we can do is to try to reduce this risk by both educating

574
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,340
providers and educating patients about different ways to manage their pain.

575
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:56,350
Really late to the game. The CDC does not issue guidance on the opioid epidemic until 2016.

576
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:01,330
This is its first guidance that it would like people to not prescribe so many opioids.

577
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,570
Okay. So don't forget your heroes type thing. So this is 26 years after the producer disapproved.

578
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,489
And the last thing I'll say is that, again, we're talking about mental health.

579
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,799
But interesting factoid.

580
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:24,540
The vast majority of people, when they're getting their first dose of legal like legal prescriptions of opioids, are getting it from a dentist.

581
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:31,320
So dentists just prescribe more opioids than any other type of clinician in the United States still to this day.

582
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:38,430
So, you know, that it's just it's a it's a lot of different players here.

583
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,270
Okay. So we pause there for questions. You got a couple minutes.

584
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:51,659
You were saying that a lot of like the synthetic opioid use result in a lot of like overdoses.

585
01:02:51,660 --> 01:03:01,740
And sometimes it's not as effective as they're aware like this that they've been trying to increase the potency of like one Narcan dose.

586
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,730
So they are. Yeah. So I mean, that's that's part of what the conversation is about.

587
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,800
The challenges is that it really varies place to place.

588
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:14,190
I mean, so drug use is the types of drugs that are used here in Ann Arbor are not the same.

589
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,379
They're used in California are not the same that are used.

590
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,160
I mean, like it's just there are different distribution networks, I mean, for lack of a better word.

591
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,350
And so it makes it really challenging in terms of that.

592
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,760
There's also just like I mean, it's very difficult still to this day to get access to Narcan,

593
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:34,709
you know, I mean, people like pharmacies still handed out, like, you know, that they should.

594
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:40,110
And and part of it is like educating law enforcement to be able for them to hand out when they when they're out and out.

595
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,860
So they are trying to address it.

596
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:50,220
But it's a it's a it's a moving target, you know. Other questions.

597
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:56,970
You know how you're saying that people can take Xanax and not know that they're all in it or something like that?

598
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,500
Is it is it just the patient that doesn't know that or with a manufacturer not know about?

599
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,430
Like, how does that happen so that they're getting a pill that is this counterfeit.

600
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,010
So it's not it's not the manufacturer or rather, I mean, it's the counterfeit manufacturer.

601
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,790
And so, you know. Yeah.

602
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,850
Answer your question. So, I mean, are you asking are they intentionally putting fentanyl and Xanax to sell counter?

603
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,350
I guess I'm just wondering like how that has be causing such a big problem knowing as well.

604
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:37,800
Well, I mean, so, you know, part of it is just that, you know, the people who are manufacturing counterfeit pills are.

605
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:44,750
I don't think they're really thinking about the end user of their stuff and what they're using.

606
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,810
So it's just like cheaper.

607
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:53,850
If it's good, it's probably cheaper, but it's also probably like that, just like a laziness of, like, making up your pill, you know what I mean?

608
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,810
And so, again, you don't know what you've taken until after the fact.

609
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:05,710
And so and it looks identical. I mean, these things look identical to real people because it's just like more pressing.

610
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:10,380
And so that is a friend of mine who passed away like we thought he was.

611
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,220
It looked like he was trying to buy Xanax and not get tax.

612
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:26,800
You know. Because you were talking about earlier how there's more overdose deaths and like rural areas is like part of the issue.

613
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:34,450
Like our providers like prescribing more of foods or because of the health disparity, they're massive, massive overprescribing.

614
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:40,479
I mean, they've done studies. It's I mean, it's ridiculous. Like they've done studies are mirror studies is the right word.

615
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,150
But just like record review showing that there were doctors that were essentially

616
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:52,090
these like pill mills that were prescribing like thousands of pills per capita,

617
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,180
a number that is insane, you know. And what is the motivation?

618
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,240
I mean, these are these are people of medical licenses who are getting money.

619
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:06,180
I mean, that's like this is I can't I don't know what else is the reason for that, but it's so that's one reason.

620
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,719
The other reason it's hard is there's less access to, you know, an emergency department.

621
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,990
So let's say you do have an overdose can get you to unsafe.

622
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:20,710
I mean, it just takes you an hour and a half to get to emergency. Medical is less benefit.

623
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,370
Okay. Well, I will stay for a few minutes if you have questions about the homework that is due on Friday.

624
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:34,800
Um. Now will be this hard. Next week will also be a hard week.

625
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,090
And we're going to. We're gonna have some fun and we'll talk about the anti-vax movement and autism.

626
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:43,710
It'll be it's going to get it's going to we're going to turn the corner. All right.
