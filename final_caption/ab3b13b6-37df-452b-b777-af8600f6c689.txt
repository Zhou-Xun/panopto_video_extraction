1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm moderate. Please. You're going to go for this kind of person?

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,910
I think maybe Charles and I.

3
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:50,430
Oh, and I really long for like the only thing that happened today was it didn't feel kind of like.

4
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:01,320
And. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,830
I mean, I hope I'm right.

6
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,330
Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay. Here I am.

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,760
Inside. No.

8
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:26,210
No, but I'm sorry to say, everyone.

9
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,010
How's it going? Good. My name is Mike Flynn.

10
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,750
I'll be instructing the course this semester. And the shot.

11
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,510
So then graduate student. Instructor. I'm part time faculty.

12
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,440
Just finished my Ph.D. in epidemiology, so comment on my first name.

13
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:54,080
It's kind of weird to be used to being on that side of the room. Um, but so this is, uh, we'll meet, we'll go with couple minutes.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:05,240
Um, but erm, as I said, my first season at the University of Florida, my interests were and psychiatric epidemiology and I'll let you go ahead.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,750
Yeah, I was raised. Yeah, I mean it. Yes, I was.

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,430
Of course. I also used this course last year. I did the third year.

17
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,710
He just didn't have an allergy. And my research was mostly biology all the I own.

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,200
And so I was I didn't have anything.

19
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,239
I'm here. It was better than we do.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,690
Brief introductions real quick. Just names and maybe what you're interested in.

21
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,240
Sorry, I got money for my first year in the global health sector and understanding that.

22
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:54,650
Executive Vice President Chief Executive Officer General I'm just interested in this release and also first year

23
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:03,920
which you started and you've seen and I'm interested in this disease and some media and some student as well,

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:12,880
and perhaps even someone who I think allows us to see nutrition.

25
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:32,730
Great. Hi, I'm Sam. And I was just Connie is very little and I'm in the back and forth.

26
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,170
On the first night it was I wanted to go with school and then.

27
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,530
So this will make it really.

28
00:03:48,900 --> 00:04:03,960
Where it started. I'm back on the first. I'm that student and I'm also interested in the first year.

29
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm Alicia. I appreciate your help. And I stayed throughout the morning in honor of her.

30
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:28,090
Here he is, in session and understands that there are 42 very important black women.

31
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,159
And I'm very concerned about of this,

32
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:45,020
as I'm sure I'm certain that Mr. Middleton just had an actual German student student introduced

33
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:54,470
to every student groups student at which student association has been ineffectual from 1 to 2.

34
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,799
I'm afraid she is a happy student and I'm interested in a social activism, which I'm Sophia.

35
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm a person as well, and I'm interested in a section Infectious Disease and Climate Change on Merkel's first two years of life every time.

36
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:21,299
Interesting LGBT and I like health care and health care and so and social I think there's a million more

37
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,700
first year to each student are interested even down to my name is revealing my first year global health A B

38
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:39,860
student and I'm interested in maternal and child health as well as nutrition and I can go online and also

39
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:57,500
learn about I don't have to do that change and also environmental knowledge and things that are larger.

40
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,920
Thanks, everyone. A wide range of interests and different measurement issues across the board,

41
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,260
but some of the same issues that will apply regardless of what subfield of epidemiology are interested.

42
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:20,660
So I'm that now this course is going to introduce everyone to kind of basic concepts of measurement theory and instrument design.

43
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,969
So that might be survey design or other types of instruments in addition to a range

44
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,890
of metrics of measurement quality that are relevant to types of health assessments,

45
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:39,709
health research. And then we'll use lectures, we'll use some labs in class labs and then homework assignments.

46
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,820
And finally, the course will include a third project, I should note that.

47
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,130
So the syllabus should be on the canvas page today, slides should be on the campus page too.

48
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:59,060
So some objectives here. So the master principles of measurement theory and how we apply that and everything else,

49
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,569
and research principles and design of measurement instruments and then providing

50
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,160
oral written accounts of the application analysis of specific measurement methods.

51
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,120
So we'll have five lectures today being number one, two of us.

52
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,480
So on. During two of those lectures are after two of those lectures in the same class, we'll have laughs.

53
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,090
And then in the final week, you'll have a group that will present your group project with.

54
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,310
Other than that you'll have to homework assignments and then the pilot project.

55
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,770
So I'll take questions about that in a little bit here.

56
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
I'm going to let teacher explain SAS on demand.

57
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,120
And then here's also the textbook that's I think the chapters are on campus, so you ought to buy the textbook.

58
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,910
Actually. Let's do the survey part. That's right. Sure. All right.

59
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,470
If you can pull up the slides and canvas and take this very short survey,

60
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:04,160
you'll enter your last four of your, um, ID and then take the survey and take more than a few minutes.

61
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:27,410
Okay. It's not as simple as it was before.

62
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:55,240
I do. Yes, I do.

63
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,090
I understand. Yeah.

64
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:11,250
This is why we have to stick the service employees in the next 30 seconds or so places to work.

65
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,060
Oh, that's great. Oh, right, right, right. No, no. Yeah.

66
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,540
Yeah, I just heard about that.

67
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:41,130
What? Like. So, yes, I think that.

68
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,100
On YouTube and Instagram.

69
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't know. I don't know.

70
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:07,830
I don't know. But, yeah, it's pretty close to the picture there.

71
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:25,230
It is important to note as much as everyone done, I didn't do it.

72
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,520
I'll come back to that and let you go.

73
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,680
So for this class and also for next semester, for the next seven weeks, when you guys go to doctor first class leading sass.

74
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,540
So I think. Everyone should know. Like the SAS virtual.

75
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,910
Let's call it the virtual computer we use. It's also something called SAS on demand.

76
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,740
People know what this is. So anyone heard it? Okay, SAS OnDemand is like, how is Google Docs for work?

77
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:02,300
And it's so much easier if you don't have to go into the virtual network. So to make everyone's life easier, this works really well last year.

78
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,920
I want everyone to create a SAS on demand account.

79
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,570
And I believe I would have been at that moment.

80
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:20,510
But if you are the reason why you do it today, or you can do it later, save before next week.

81
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,540
If it takes a day to like register and authorize yourself, you don't have to do it right now.

82
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,420
Senator Kennedy's announcement to remind everyone to do it before next week's class.

83
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,250
But I'll just go through really quickly. Again, you just clicked. It's like a little like online portal.

84
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,450
You can use our studio. You have code. It's so nice.

85
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,839
You put it in the data into the online portal and then you create a folder and then that's it.

86
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,530
And then you've a pan. Everyone's familiar with SAS, right in the.

87
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,300
Have you taken a test class? Yes. Okay, great. So the same thing. But it's online, so I won't go through this code stuff.

88
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,379
But when we do our first lab, the code will be provided.

89
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,240
But you'll be using SAS OnDemand to run the code. So that's it.

90
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,860
And then. Yeah, you can run it and save it and it's pretty easy.

91
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,050
Yeah. Any questions? Yeah.

92
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,270
Is it, say, to the cloud or does it say to what I will do?

93
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,840
I should say to your account on the cloud. Okay. Yeah.

94
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,970
So every time you upload data, it's going to save it. Not like you have to like link and each time kind of but makes really easy.

95
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes. And you have to manually upload the data to that value, correct.

96
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,410
No, it actually manually updated to the cloud. Okay.

97
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,140
It's great overall for any type of data processing.

98
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,179
I think if you have sensitive data you can't be using on demand, that will be a problem for this class.

99
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,830
But for your own research, just keep that in mind. Yeah, well, all right.

100
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,680
So these, like I said, this, you can refer back to these slides.

101
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,210
And if there's questions, just reach out to us. Yes. And our email addresses are on campus today.

102
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,390
All right. So back to some of the syllabus stuff. So here's the schedule.

103
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,799
So today's the 10th. We'll have four more courses, classes.

104
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,870
After this consecutive weeks, there will be a week off for everyone to work on their group projects.

105
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,960
And then you'll come back and present those projects. In terms of the grades.

106
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:33,230
There's an attendance sheet that she's going to pass around next week and following weeks, you'll just sign in beginning of class.

107
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,500
And so that's 10% of your grade. The two homework assignments are 25% of your grade.

108
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:46,850
And then the pilot project, which we'll discuss more next week and the details on the project are on canvas already.

109
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,620
That's 40% of your grade. Other questions about anything kind of horse related logistics and of course.

110
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,360
And yeah, I'm going to be assigned a group. Yes.

111
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, you'll be assigned groups by next week. You know, right now, you guys like for like.

112
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,900
So if we think of epidemiology research having five pillars, we're focusing primarily on the top right of measurement, instrument design.

113
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,730
And we'll also talk about how this all plays a role in the study design bias and confounding populations.

114
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,350
And then doing a little bit of analysis to all kind of inference,

115
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:43,040
but you can't have causal inference without focusing on measurement and the design of whatever tool that you're using.

116
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,310
So what do we measure in epidemiology? We measure exposures or risk factors.

117
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,150
Some type of outcome, health outcomes and then covariates.

118
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,230
So anything that might affect that relationship between your exposure and your outcome.

119
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,780
And how do we measure these variables? We there might be different scales that we'll talk about.

120
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
There's different methods of measurement that we'll talk about.

121
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,490
And then after we figure all that out, we have to ask ourselves, how well are we measuring?

122
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,100
How well are we getting close to that true value of what we're trying to specifically measure?

123
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:27,700
What is the role of error and bias in that? So exposure management, exposure, measurement.

124
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,250
So this list could be any attribute of a person or the environment in which they live

125
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,230
that may cause or predict the related to the health outcome that we're interested in.

126
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:48,580
So if we're focused on the person, individual might be interested in genes, behavior, emotion, physiological state, their environment.

127
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,400
Again, things that we want to measure air, soil, water, but also where they live.

128
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,050
What what are the attributes of their neighborhood that we might be interested in?

129
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,550
What is their work environment?

130
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:11,580
And don't think of these as always, bad things, these risk factors that can also be protective factors that we might be interested in measuring.

131
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,919
And then finally, if we look at particularly like evaluation work or clinical trials, you know,

132
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,910
we are interested in measuring the effects of interventions or treatments that the individual or the population is exposed to.

133
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,750
So in terms of exposure measurement, we want to measure this as accurately as possible.

134
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,090
We want to do it within practical constraints of two things cost and also subject burden.

135
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,340
To subject burden can be the amount of time that we ask the participant to do something.

136
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:58,350
The rareness of how what we're asking them to do is something that's incredibly burdensome versus filling out a survey like everyone just did.

137
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,840
That's why the low end of burden. But there's a lot of things that require more.

138
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,270
So beyond that, beyond burden and cost, we're also interested in the validity and the accuracy, as I mentioned.

139
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,760
So how close is our measure to the true value?

140
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:23,700
And do we even know what the true value of what that exposure is or that outcome is, which we'll talk about kind of as a class a little bit here.

141
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,970
So then those are some things we might measure in terms of exposures.

142
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,790
What do we measure in terms of health outcomes? So vital signs. So this would be births, deaths, things like that.

143
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,490
Mortality. We can measure disease status or progression of disease.

144
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,560
Mental health and well-being. So that could be something that is already classified.

145
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:56,219
And what would be the DSM that considers that defines depression and anxiety.

146
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,290
But there's also a lot of tools to diagnose depression. Anxiety, or we might be interested in quality of life.

147
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,190
And then finally, we could also measure health behaviors, mostly physical activity, diet.

148
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,300
We'll talk about why some of these are easier. Hard.

149
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:20,210
And then those covariates that we might want to include to control for some type of effect that we're concerned about.

150
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,000
So these demographic variables, social status variables, are pretty standard.

151
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,860
All right. In your table groups, think of one exposure or one outcome.

152
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,510
It doesn't matter one or the other. That's easy to measure and why it would be easy to measure.

153
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:49,120
So we take the initiative as not to do something like that.

154
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:05,750
She explained here in a compilation of a lot of stories.

155
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:19,440
Maybe. Maybe some of the firefighters. Yeah.

156
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,830
Last time I was.

157
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:38,150
But it definitely does.

158
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,030
Yeah, no doubt. Yeah, that's what highlight that.

159
00:19:47,730 --> 00:20:02,530
You know, I see right now you see a very small window and it's not controversial at all.

160
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:17,450
Okay. Okay. Like, say, like.

161
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:27,160
Like. Your house smells like you have this kind of thing like.

162
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,020
I think. Here, love.

163
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:44,570
Where. Where's your. Thank you.

164
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,330
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:58,710
Like I said. Who's right?

166
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,320
The medical.

167
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,750
Recognize. Oh, you.

168
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,500
All right, let's let's hear the let's hear what everyone thinks is easy to measure.

169
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,970
Sorry. That's my kids. Yeah. Oh, I start here.

170
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:41,149
All right. Um, we sort of thought about this for months, or, like, what to find is that we had to come from, like, the resource headings.

171
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,959
Like what measures would not be easy if you don't have access to a laboratory to store those and dealing with a population,

172
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,570
you know, you might need reviews and whatnot, but I mean,

173
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,450
sort of came down to the idea that maybe simple measurements like weight and height in the public BMI map,

174
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,710
as much as we don't love BMI, might be an easy one exposure that could be alcohol and exposure.

175
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:16,250
But if you have some kind of exposures, like a binary questionnaire, type A, do you drink coffee or that kind of simpler?

176
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,500
Yeah, I think height and weight is easy for a few reasons.

177
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,390
And you know, the burden is lower like you're talking about.

178
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,300
It doesn't cost much to do that. Also, those two things don't fluctuate too much relative to some other things.

179
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:41,630
Thank you. All right. What is what was your easy record?

180
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Yeah. So they said a rare disease.

181
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:51,230
A rare disease that a household, a reportable disease, so that a hospital has three or four.

182
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:01,580
So that's it could be easy to measure, but one of the issues with that would be that it has to be diagnosed first.

183
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,650
So are there any diagnoses that are missed? Right.

184
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:13,910
So but again, this is a this is we're talking this kind of a trick question, but nothing's particularly too easy in the middle.

185
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:25,010
We said that you it would be gender or age something as reported by the person demographic information and

186
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:35,270
the outcome was that those who did not get that I could increase that mortality as long as that cause.

187
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:42,320
Right. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Well, in the back, we are all four of them.

188
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,510
Seriously, we're talking about life or death because verify, we're really like professionals.

189
00:23:49,520 --> 00:24:02,310
It's all of our time. And back here before, it's just nice to.

190
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:12,990
I mentioned that sometimes it is rare. That isn't easy in areas where birth certificates are commonly used.

191
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:21,240
I had to say, yeah, yeah, that was an excellent experience with that.

192
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:33,300
Yeah, well, I guess the current age difference and the person's a period of like when you have the whole life partner, international expert.

193
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:45,120
Yeah. So this all ties back to population there until we could say older adults too, that might have some type of memory issue that might not work.

194
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,250
And the other one was. Oh, oh, no.

195
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,980
I would say one of the easy ones, whether you're my lady.

196
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,050
Oh, yeah, that's pretty easy.

197
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,170
That is something that could be easily accessible. It just happens that often.

198
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,030
And it's also let me get rid of that. That would be pretty straightforward.

199
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,040
So I understand that, yeah, we're going into the national questions of that.

200
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,170
But what I mean, I'd be like, what?

201
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:29,160
What would be a major barrier that they'd be like if we were like they might have like the gravitational wave or something,

202
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,530
so they would fall into the category or you can't predict that.

203
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,570
So that'd be like social desirability bias. But we'll get into biases later on.

204
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,670
Great. Thank you. All right.

205
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,400
So in terms of defining measurement.

206
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,040
So there's a couple of ways to look at the assignment of numbers or labels to objects and events, but in a rules based approach.

207
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,060
So the objects and events could be exposures, outcomes that we just talked about or those other covariance.

208
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,299
So how do we what what numbers are we using a metric system for.

209
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:16,620
Hi. Like just kind of some simple things that we need to think about how we add numbers or labels to those things we just talked about.

210
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,630
And then there's this quote from them, Alex Clark, I believe it's his book.

211
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,380
He was a pilot, I think, in the Army and like, I don't know, the forties.

212
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:35,240
And he was like fascinated with the tests that he took to get in to pilot school.

213
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,690
So he after he was done in the military, he wrote a book.

214
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:46,189
He wrote the book on psychometrics. And so his definition here is, again,

215
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,249
rules for assigning symbols to objects to represent quantities of attributes numerically so

216
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,479
that be scaling or defining whether the objects fall in the same or different categories,

217
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,370
which is classification. So let's go to those scales.

218
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,780
So here's four scales. Some of them should probably look familiar.

219
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,760
Nominal scale. So you're only using labels. There's no ranking of those labels.

220
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:22,480
An ordinal scale. So there is an order, but the differences between the ranks don't necessarily reflect the size of the differences.

221
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,610
And then an interval scale so assigned in such a manner that they reflect the true differences in the values.

222
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:39,799
So there's an order in the space in between each values the same, or is there there's an actual difference actually measured and then a ratio.

223
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,310
So interval values, but there's a true zero. So let's just make sure we're all on the.

224
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,719
Same page here in a minute, but then continuous categorical and binary that yes no smoking status question be a

225
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:02,350
binary or dichotomous variable continuous variable ranges categorical with categories,

226
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,709
but let's make sure we're all on the same page with that.

227
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:14,020
So if we want to know the mode of transportation use modes and options are a car, a bike walking or public transportation.

228
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,690
Would this be? What would this be?

229
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,920
Continuous, categorical binary. Categorical.

230
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,460
So then from there, we know that categorical variables are nominal or ordinal.

231
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,340
Would that be would this be nominal or not? No, no, no.

232
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:43,750
Perfect. All right. What about the next one? Participating in strenuous physical activity with the response options of never to all the time.

233
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,320
Categorical. Categorical?

234
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,950
Yeah. Because there's an order.

235
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,610
But. The ranks don't reflect the size of the differences.

236
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,940
And then participating in strenuous physical activity a number of times per week with these response options.

237
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,540
Continuous. Anyone? Anyone else? Or.

238
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:28,290
So with those response options, this isn't this can get confusing where there's not like you can always.

239
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,099
You can treat variables differently. And when you I mean,

240
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,950
when we're talking about statistics or certain types of test especially is based on that's a continuous scale or categorical scale.

241
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,190
And sometimes you can use those tests both ways. So I would consider this categorical with an order to it, but it could also be,

242
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,980
you know, the interval scale because there's that true difference between the values.

243
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,520
And then minutes per week, some take more. This is more straightforward.

244
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,650
Yeah. Perfect. And there's a zero there. All right.

245
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,670
Now, here are some features. If we're measuring the dose of something, the exposure dose.

246
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,570
So we want to know the level or the quantity of exposure.

247
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,990
So this can be very simple. Were you exposed to this or not?

248
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,600
And we can figure that out in a variety of ways.

249
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Or it can be very difficult to ascertain very specific values depending on what that exposure is that we're interested in.

250
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,580
You know it does.

251
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,140
So this would be the summary of the levels or the quantity of exposure over defined period of time that we're interested in for our study period.

252
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,180
So how long do you have to be exposed to X to have y effect?

253
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,750
That threshold exposure. So we know that exposure above a certain quantity means something.

254
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:03,010
So we have certain guidelines for drinking water and we know that there's a threshold, there's certain thresholds based on different criteria,

255
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,590
similar in the sense when we're thinking about measuring an exposure based on threshold.

256
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,740
And then there's also keep exposure. So what's the highest exposure level that somebody experienced?

257
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,920
So, you know, we say that we have we want to measure dose and we want to measure exposure.

258
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,800
There's from there, we have to figure out how we want to measure that.

259
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,750
And then we also had to think about time. So the exposure time window.

260
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,810
So this is the time during which the exposure is ideologically most relevant to disease causation.

261
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:46,210
So does this time period reflect when the exposure causes biological changes, for instance, that we're interested in?

262
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:54,880
And there's the induction period. So this is the interval between the time the action of the exposure is complete to when disease onset occurs.

263
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,920
But then we get into thinking about when how do we measure the onset of disease?

264
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:07,300
And then a latent period of time interval from onset of disease until it becomes manifest and is diagnosed.

265
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:16,209
So keep that in mind going forward that there's the time that it's diagnosed or there's the onset time.

266
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:25,020
But do we have which one do we probably know more often? Onset time or diagnosis.

267
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,440
Time? Yeah. Diagnosis. Perfect.

268
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,790
All right. Now, this is not the trick question. Let's think of something that's difficult to measure.

269
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,720
It can be an exposure or an outcome and why that would be difficult to measure.

270
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,450
And will be.

271
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:13,330
Alright. So yeah, that's where I first got this one.

272
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:28,510
But the language began. So I know what I can do, but I don't the right.

273
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:52,980
We found out during the Super Bowl, and I said to myself, well, yes, that does.

274
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,300
Donald Arab-Americans. And I don't know why, but that's not.

275
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:08,740
There's no guarantee that Americans have.

276
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:23,710
Yeah. And then, of course, they are much. Oh, sorry.

277
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,700
Another. Yeah.

278
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:38,840
I guess I was hoping.

279
00:34:43,480 --> 00:35:09,370
Do you go? Otherwise, we're over there.

280
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:26,149
All right. Let's hear the the difficult background talking about these three studies of sleep disorders just

281
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:36,350
because a lot of people out a diagnosis to something that a lot of time during the recession,

282
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,010
an awful lot of just not eating at all.

283
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,760
Yeah, I heard that.

284
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,580
That's right. Well, we talked about overexposure.

285
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,820
And overexposure is really hard for us and for our clients.

286
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:04,100
But it can be a little difficult when you're doing something that's going to be with a lot of pressure.

287
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,370
Yeah. Yeah. Let's start with the microwave subject.

288
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,730
So in terms of being with somebody on that basis, why not?

289
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,470
Let's say we're in Texas at points all the time.

290
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,180
And then the second one was like.

291
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,910
Yeah. So I mean, they were familiar with the DSM for themselves for that.

292
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:39,380
So I mean, there are different tools that accompany that diagnosis, but it's based on which we'll talk over here in class,

293
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,760
the person who's conducting that already and that kind of patient.

294
00:36:46,820 --> 00:37:06,380
Right. So that, according to the persons who are most likely to be targeted for outcomes is the space industry.

295
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,480
It's very bad. Yeah. We'll talk more about different class measurements later on.

296
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,130
And I don't want anything with this class.

297
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,700
Don't think about the instruments. Ah.

298
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,220
Biomarkers are more reliable than sort of shoes.

299
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:41,090
I don't know how much. But you said you were eager to get out way.

300
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,740
And do business with her.

301
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:54,990
That's what that's like when you actually get behind the factors that all of a sudden.

302
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,530
This that covers day and night.

303
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,470
There you go. Yeah, that's right.

304
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,190
That's all I want to say is that I don't have the resources to do this.

305
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,360
Yeah. Yeah. So this is very strange.

306
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,490
You can see as a business, I work for the CIA.

307
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,080
I don't know why. Why this is the problem.

308
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:46,180
I think that basically all of us in the building of the building and most of the times I think people like is because it uses the the idea.

309
00:38:46,220 --> 00:39:00,640
Yes. Yes, exactly. You know, when you go to the stars, these are excited because you just fall on a tower for over 90,000 square miles and 20 trucks.

310
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,040
The tracks are not going to blow your [INAUDIBLE] thing.

311
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,990
Right. That's more related measurement than we have to people that identify here.

312
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,159
That's clock tower. But what they should be over that day that they forgot to wear the glasses.

313
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,280
It could be anything. So there's, there's gonna be some error and bias there.

314
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:31,809
Yeah. Go. Um, we were sort of thinking about subjective measures like diet quality, how that continued to decline in the first place.

315
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,900
And then also measure of answering in a survey, you have issues like social desirability bias.

316
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,760
And you mention earlier we also sort of spoke on a little bit about gender and how that's very difficult to define,

317
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,280
like pollution, urine and might many different things, but different populations.

318
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:57,010
You also have social desirability of maybe not wanting to identify certainly or just issues and your comfortability and identification as well.

319
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:01,030
Yeah, perfect. I mean, there's a lot of good work that's been done too.

320
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:10,870
On how social desirability does affect demographic items so easy in a sense, but it could definitely be difficult.

321
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,200
Um. Who was interested in nutrition.

322
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:25,690
There. Yeah. So I mean, this is what refer back to nutrition throughout the semester as examples of things that are difficult to measure.

323
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,990
Um, because what are some different ways we could measure, um, diet.

324
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:49,480
You know, just think about how we get that information from that first 24 hour, 24 hour news record.

325
00:40:50,020 --> 00:41:11,480
So typically for us to account for all of the problems that it's hard to comprehend or maybe two things that you're never gonna die of.

326
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,070
So there's a lot of learning that we can do a survey to ask them how many servings of this every day.

327
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,500
That's the last seven days. You can do a diary, but that's for some period of time.

328
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:35,450
So that's an example of things. We'll talk about drugs that are considered hard to about.

329
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,660
Yeah, I really can't stress.

330
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:54,280
That's all right. I think this is a good activity just to kind of prepare for the coming classes where we'll talk

331
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,830
more about reliability and validity and how we estimate error and bias and how we get to that.

332
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:06,700
Again, that the goal is to get as close to that true value, whatever that is, for whatever measurement we're interested in.

333
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,260
Okay. Back to what we were just talking about with nutrition, but what are some different modes,

334
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:21,750
the so-called modes of measurement that are used in epidemiologic studies so we can do an interview with somebody that could be more qualitative.

335
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:31,499
We can use surveys. Per variety for surveys of almost anything biological specimens, which we talk about.

336
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,730
There's difficulties there.

337
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:42,330
We could record or observe somebody's behaviors, and then there be devices that we can use to measure various exposures and health outcomes.

338
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:50,950
All right. Now we're getting close to end. We are very early the first week.

339
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,580
But let's take the survey. Let's don't click on the last survey.

340
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:03,910
This is a different length, so make sure to use this survey this time. I still don't know what.

341
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:31,560
That's exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I always say for my customers that don't want to go to a small market is still young, I suppose.

342
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,410
I know. Like for most.

343
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:56,810
I think we've got such a great time because I learned something that I don't think they knew.

344
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,410
I just hope that that's what it is.

345
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,150
Oh, yeah. Well, I know that.

346
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:26,000
I mean, now as just. You stay here until the water so we don't have to go anywhere.

347
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:35,200
Yeah. He calls it a.

348
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,520
All right, everyone, get on, Survivor.

349
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,930
All right, we're almost done. All right.

350
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,479
So we're going to these are just some things that we're going to talk about in the next two weeks in particular.

351
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:04,070
So we're going to talk about validity and reliability. So you can't have validity without reliability and vice versa.

352
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,550
But we're going to find these well in the next few weeks and give examples.

353
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:13,040
Solidity is simply the accuracy of some type of measurement and having a lack of bias.

354
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:22,249
Which is different from air. And then we'll talk about reliability, which is the precision of or the repeatability of that tool.

355
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,410
How well can that measure the same thing over and over again, consistently with a lack of random error?

356
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,160
And then we'll talk about what those sources of error are,

357
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,060
which we've touched on a little bit when we've talked about these difficult types of things to measure.

358
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:45,350
But that's coming up in the next two weeks. There's nothing due next week, so it should be quiet.

359
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,890
You know, enjoy your week of nothing for this class.

360
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:55,060
Yeah. Yeah, I like the.
