1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this module, we'll be talking about seminal environmental health events.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These are major disasters that have had a tremendous influence on how we view environmental health.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before we start into the slides, though,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I encourage you just to pause for a moment and recall the last big environmental health disaster that you are aware of.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Feel free to pause and take a moment to ponder this. But my suspicion is it probably won't take you very long because unfortunately,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
these events have been quite common, particularly in the 20th and the 21st century, and they absolutely continue.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Of course, it's our job and environmental health to foresee these things and prevent them wherever possible.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So I'd like to run you through a couple of examples again of some of these higher profile events.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, since you're taking a public health degree, I'm assuming you probably already heard of John Snow,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but his story has very important environmental health ramifications that you may not be aware of.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So let's go back in time to 1854 in the heart of London.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
London, unfortunately, at the time was experiencing a series of outbreaks of cholera, which unfortunately killed thousands of people.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now enter into the equation a man named John Snow who had the idea of mapping out how these people

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
were dying and where they were dying and trying to link that to the environments in some way.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The germ theory was not well understood at that point. So it was a mystery as to how these people were getting cholera.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So what John Snow did that was so incredibly innovative was to create this map that you see on the left and basically

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
mark out how many people died at each address and see if there was some common unifying geographical feature.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And what he quickly came to a conclusion on is that all these people were drawing water from the Broad Street pump.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, most of the pumps in London at the time drew water from the River Thames. But this happened to draw from a particularly contaminated spot.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So John Snow identified this as a potential source of transmission of disease and convinced the authorities to take the pump handle off.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So people had to go elsewhere to get their water. Now, this was not the only thing that caused the cessation of the epidemic.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In fact, it was already waning by the time John Snow came on the scene. Unfortunately, six hundred and sixteen people died.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But this was a very concrete step in a way that the authorities could absolutely prevent exposure to this very dangerous pathogen.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go ahead about 100 years.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll stay in London, though, so London, due to some unique geographical features and also climactic features in the mid 20th century,

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
had a series of what we're called Great Fogg's. And the one in 1952 was the worst.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
These aren't actually fog. So if you look at the two photographs here, these are actually daytime photos.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
London was heated almost completely by the burning of coal, which is a very burning, very dirty process.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And so when the right climactic conditions and the right temperature came along, there were massive emissions of coal into the atmosphere.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And this is the result. Even in the middle of day, it looked like night because the air was being filtered by all this pollution.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So even back in 1952, we were already making measurements of the environment in the graph.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
On the right, you'll see a couple of different lines.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So the line with red squares is basically the level of smoke that was observed between December 1st and December 15th, 1952.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The blue triangles represent the level of sulfur dioxide and other contaminants in the air,

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the blue squares are the number of people who died on each of those days.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In December. Nineteen fifty two.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you'll look here, between December 4th and December 10th, there was a massive spike in the amount of smoke in the air.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A massive spike in the amount of sulfur dioxide and a massive spike in the number of people who died.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So this was one of the very first events where we could say the environment changed and people died as a result,

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
somewhere between four and ten thousand people. We'll go forward another couple of decades here,

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
many of you will have already heard of the chemical called DDT, a very potent pesticide and insecticide.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some of you have probably already read the book Silent Spring as well by Rachel Carson.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you hadn't if you haven't read it, you absolutely should. It's an amazing book.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, it turns out DDT was not invented to be an insecticide.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But in the mid 1940s, Paul Mueller discovered that it had very potent effects when it came into contact with insects.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In fact, this was such a huge revelation that he received the Nobel Prize in 1948.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, why is this important? Well, it turns out DDT is very effective at killing mosquitoes, mosquitoes, the vector for malaria,

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
which is a pathogen that's killed more humans over human history than any other cause.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So how effective is this? Well, let's look at the mid 1940s and the island of Taiwan, 1945.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There were about a million cases of malaria. Fast forward twenty five years after repeated DDT application were down to nine cases of malaria in 1969.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So that's a tremendous public health improvement. In fact, this and other new chemicals led to the catchphrase better living through chemistry.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So that's great. On the downside, though,

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Rachel Carson and other early environmentalists started to notice that certain species seem to be disappearing or becoming less common.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There were fewer songbirds around, fewer birds of prey like hawks and falcons.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
she was able to demonstrate that there seemed to be a linkage between pesticides in the environment and the death of these sort of sentinel species.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It turns out DDT and other pesticides bio magnify their present in concentrations at low on the food chain.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But then as you go up the food chain, eventually to birds of prey or humans, the concentrations are much higher and toxic.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So here's a case where we had to balance very pronounced benefits to public health against very sort of detrimental impacts on the environment.

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll give you a fourth and final example here in detail.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So many of you will be aware of Shaw Noble, the nuclear reactor that melted down in the Ukraine in 1986.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ironically, as a result of a safety test gone wrong. So the great London fog and the cholera epidemics were very localized.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
DDT was very much a global incident. And here's an incident that was sort of regional in scale.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So on the map, on the right, you can see the deposition of a particular radionuclide cesium over Europe and parts of Western Asia.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so you can see here in red the areas that were most heavily affected.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The bright red splotch in the lower red corner is the area around Shau Noble.

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So here is a tasteless, odorless contaminant,

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ionizing radiation that some parties think will kill up to 16000 people as a result of this single event.

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In 1986. Again, these events happen much more often than you think.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I'll go through very quickly a list here of other events you might have heard of.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
M.A. Japan experienced tremendous contamination from a chemical called methylmercury from 1943 to 1961.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Two thousand three hundred people were permanently disabled as a result of that Love Canal here in the United States,

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
in the state of New York was a toxic chemical dump that we'll talk about later in class that

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
involved hundreds of chemicals and thousands of people exposed and impacted in 1984 in Bhopal,

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
India. There was an accidental release of a chemical called methyl isocyanate that killed almost 4000

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
people and injured and disabled tens of thousands here in the state of Michigan in 1973 to 74.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A chemical was accidentally introduced into our food supply and hundreds of thousands

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or even millions of people were exposed to chemicals called beebees in Servais.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So Italy, 1976, there was a gas leak of a chemical TDD that exposed thousands of people and also heavily contaminated the food chain.

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
2010, you may recall the Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers and impacted hundreds of thousands of people in the Gulf of Mexico.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
2011 in Fukushima, Japan. The nuclear reactor meltdown there, the evacuation killed about 1400 people and hundreds of thousands were impacted.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Going ahead a little further and again, closer to home, Flint, Michigan,

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the crisis regarding lead and drinking water that we'll focus on later in the class.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And finally, you may have heard in the press of chemicals called P fast or P fast.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Michigan appears to be one of the more impacted states from these chemicals, but it's only because we're already measuring them.

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These chemicals are absolutely in other states as well.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So these seminal events are tragic, the impact they do is irreversible and very, very tragic, but they also provide motivation for change.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So the cholera epidemics in London led to the field of environmental epidemiology.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They also led to dramatic improvements in water treatment.

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The smog events in London and elsewhere led directly to the development of air pollution standards.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The realization that DDT was not a magical chemical led to its ban in the United States and increased awareness

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that pesticides are designed to kill things and they don't always kill things that we want them to kill.

92
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Extra Noble, of course, resulted in improved nuclear power plant safety.

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I want to emphasize that with these events comes environmental health responsibility.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,643
We need to be proactive and anticipate and prevent these tragedies and impacts before they occur.
