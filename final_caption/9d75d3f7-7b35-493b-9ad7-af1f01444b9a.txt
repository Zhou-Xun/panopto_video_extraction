1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,820
Four, four, three. How are you doing today? I'm great. I'm going to do an excellent.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:14,340
So perfect. What made you apply for this position at the Health and Safety Department at the university here?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,700
Well, I used to work for Denver Health Department as an intern back during the summer,

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,680
and I really liked my experience with the research group there, especially with Mr. Garnett, who is currently working there.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,750
And I want to get to have a bit more exposure with the other groups.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,760
Most likely will Fire Safety Department Group and everyone else into department.

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,610
Okay. Can you tell me about some of your strengths and weaknesses?

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,199
Well, I think the main strengths that I have is that I'm more sociable.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:59,549
And in this case, I'm able to communicate with the professors and that staff more efficiently and more equitably than Wolfram and others.

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:09,150
And that usually helps detentions that both professors have with everyone health safety reps, and it resolves a lot of more issues.

11
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:18,510
Also, I have experience with both of the technical issues that they may have, and so I could help more, more than just that inspection.

12
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:26,040
When I do an inspection, I know if there's something wrong, I could possibly fix it on the spot or I could indicate issues and help bring down

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,450
resources that they probably need in order for them to have a more efficient,

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,170
safe and efficient lab. Okay.

15
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,510
And what about some of the weaknesses?

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,090
Some of the weaknesses is I'm still quite clumsy or I am taking a course on anti-PD-1 since I know that sounds very dumb,

17
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,290
but it's something that, as someone who's been diagnosed with ADHD has to be have to do often.

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,810
I'm hoping that this course will hopefully help me to overcome this issue.

19
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,730
I think that's probably the biggest issue got out. Got you.

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,960
All right. And then lastly, why should we hire you over other applicants?

21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,399
Well, as I also went to University of Michigan for my master's in public health, it's actually an accredited program.

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:26,460
And so I actually so the program is a lot more crossword drawing than other universities because it's accredited and most other universities aren't.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Also, I've experienced overall safety department already.

24
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,350
I know most of the people, and I also know most of the professors that I've done inspections of.

25
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,140
All right. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,730
Mr. Gretchen.
