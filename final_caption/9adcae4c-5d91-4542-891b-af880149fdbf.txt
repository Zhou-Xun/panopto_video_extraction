1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,160
I'm very intuitive.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,940
What do you think? You're everybody who should be in this time.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,800
Shouldn't we all feel a day? I mean, genetics?

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,530
No. All right.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:34,290
Let's wait here before we start. There was probably, I think, about six viewers.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,310
So that still haven't signed an integrity affidavit.

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:49,440
Do that if you haven't yet. There was also one person who hasn't put themselves into a group yet.

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,810
So you haven't done that. You know, you are fine.

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,390
You to work by yourself, just put yourself in one of the groups of people have.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:06,780
All right. So any questions about the last time?

11
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:27,100
Right. Well, the plan for today, then we will briefly just talk about this.

12
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,909
Told your paper with it and read it last time and then we'll cover module three, the modules,

13
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:48,240
the three slides and probably talk briefly about this burning paper as well signed for today and the rest of the time after that,

14
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:56,290
I'll let you work together on your problem since there is a problem set to that actually got posted today,

15
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:07,420
I don't expect you to have the finished problems at once. Don't worry problems that one is due the 19th and problems at two is not due to the 31st.

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:16,540
So you've got got some time to finish those. But just be aware that it's posted and when you do finish problems at one, you can move to that one.

17
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,190
Of course, you put yourself into groups. Your groups are self assigned.

18
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,130
You're certainly welcome to move in, in and out of those groups and switch you as you want.

19
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,740
You guys regulate those. You should be able to just drag yourself out and put yourself into another one.

20
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,580
But don't do that like in the middle of an assignment and it'll screw things up.

21
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,250
So, you know, once one is already do and it's turned in, then you can switch.

22
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,330
That makes sense. All right.

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,780
Okay. You'll get a chance to read this paper.

24
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,540
I'll be the most studied James Rinella.

25
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,230
Wow. Okay. No response.

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,679
Let me generate it. Well, okay.

27
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,850
Well, isn't is an interesting article kind of outlining some of the top genes that are very well studied.

28
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,410
Um, anybody who read it.

29
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,480
Were you surprised by those genes that were listed there? Yes.

30
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,030
Not necessarily surprised, so to say. But I think there were three of them on there that I focused on really heavily in my undergraduate research,

31
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,340
and I never heard of them in any of my biology class leading up to that.

32
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,240
But for them to be so important in my research, I had to learn all about them and for them to be on the top.

33
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,750
So I did. I thought it was weird. I didn't learn about it after that.

34
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,840
Yeah, they keep coming up in all kinds of research now.

35
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:17,820
Which ones? Where there's been a TGF beta and il6.

36
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,260
Yeah. Some of those inflammatory things.

37
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,580
Right. Excellent. So that was one of the kind of hot topics is those inflammatory genes.

38
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,680
But there are other kind of big, broad topics that seem to pop up a lot in these genes.

39
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,110
Yes. A lot of them are involved in cancer. So it's not very surprising that they're focused on a lot more.

40
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,190
Yeah, absolutely. It's a huge public health problem and it's ongoing.

41
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,780
So, yeah, a lot of those problems had to do with cancer.

42
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:06,800
That's right. The other ones. Right.

43
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,320
Well, there is things like technician there is a but we we've already talked about that in class.

44
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,429
Right. It's also interesting to see a lot of them kind of trended in time.

45
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,870
Right. So like in the eighties, for example, there was there was a lot of stuff done on a medium.

46
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,200
Sickle cell and so on. So that was really trendy at that point.

47
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Also, there was the CD4 gene, which had, uh, influence with HIV, which was obviously a big problem in the eighties as well.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,360
So those kind of trended during those periods. All right, good.

49
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,260
So let's go ahead and start your screen.

50
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:10,640
Like most structural in sequence variation in genetic material. So we'll talk about structural variation.

51
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,730
And these are kind of these big chunks of abnormality.

52
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,230
You can have a numerical structural variation,

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:31,520
which is like whole chromosomes are whole for very large pieces of chromosomes and that are either added or deleted.

54
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,150
Right. And you can have them either whole chromosomes or you can have like pieces of them as well, large pieces.

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:50,150
Then you get your sequence variations, which are smaller pieces of the chromosome sequencing.

56
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,309
You get your point mutations right there. A single base change.

57
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:04,100
Right. And then you've got other little pieces as well that could get in there added deleted.

58
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:12,890
You can have silent missense nonsense frame shift, all of these different types of mutation about as well as repeat sequence expansions.

59
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,940
There is a carrier type of a person with trisomy 21, also known as Down's Syndrome.

60
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:43,970
You can see there that they have three copies of chromosome 21 and these triploid is actually can occur fairly often,

61
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,750
say 1 to 3% of conceptions, but most of them don't last very long.

62
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,210
Most of them are not viable at all.

63
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:10,430
Trisomy 21 happens to be one of the ones that is somewhat viable, along with Trisomy 13 and 18 and the ones that can sometimes be viable.

64
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:23,780
These translocations this round Roberts only and translocation is one where two chromosomes kind of get stuck together and then.

65
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,930
So you can have things like that as well, or pieces of chromosomes get stuck on to other pieces.

66
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:45,800
This actually happens, this particular one, where you get the whole chromosome at one end and actually occurs most often with chromosomes 13 and 14.

67
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,049
There's actually only certain ones that this can happen, 13 and 14.

68
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,250
The most common, I think, 15, 21 and 22 can also be involved.

69
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:05,550
Most of the time it's 1314. What would you expect the pregnancy outcomes to be for?

70
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,560
For some of these abnormalities we already talked about, trace means are not very violent.

71
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:21,950
Do we think about anything else? And ideas.

72
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, most of these are going to going to be a pretty major problem and usually are not viable.

73
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,330
And plenty of these translocations it's not make sense.

74
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,080
So you get a lot of spontaneous abortion with these types of animals.

75
00:09:50,190 --> 00:10:10,050
Okay. Here is kind of a graphic of how these triploid is these trisomy z minus mes can actually occur in student knowledge non disjunction meiosis.

76
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:23,250
So here we learned last time in meiosis one the homologs pair up together.

77
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,910
There is some crossing over and recombination that occur in can occur at that point.

78
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,770
And then the homologs are separated into two different cells that might be pulled apart.

79
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,540
Or what happens here in non junction is they don't separate.

80
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,410
So you get both of the analogous pair in one cell and none in the other.

81
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,090
That can happen in Meiosis two as well. So they might the homologs might get separated.

82
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:17,110
And in the process of separating those sister chromatids, they don't come apart in separate into, into two cells with the same piece.

83
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,150
Right. So instead, both sister chromosome chromatids end up in one cell and not in the other.

84
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,000
Once that happens, then let's say these are eggs here.

85
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:41,590
If the sperm comes along and fertilizes those eggs and you end up with three copies and half of those gametes and just one copy in the other half.

86
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,440
Right. So that's how this happens.

87
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,670
This generally occurs most often in meiosis one. What do you think the reason for that might be?

88
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,930
You know, want to make. Yes. Yeah. Crossing over might not finish.

89
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:16,590
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a good point. So we have this whole process of this crossing over, this recombination that's occurring.

90
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,100
It's certainly possible that a lot of times they get kind of bound together.

91
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,380
There's supposed to be an exchange of information. They're they don't come back apart correctly and they can move together instead of being separated.

92
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,450
Yeah, that's a good point. It also happens more often in females and males.

93
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,620
The reason why that might be you can think of.

94
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes, it's like the age of the egg. Yeah, the age of the egg as a as a big piece of that.

95
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:06,990
Yeah. Um, as we know, females develop their gametes at birth rate and so there's a lot of time that passes for those, for those eggs.

96
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:19,120
In fact, what happens is they develop up to a point in this area where they're starting, where they're crossing over and try and recombine.

97
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:28,680
And they're kind of frozen in time at that point. And then once a month they're reactivated and the process finishes.

98
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,140
So there's a lot of time where they're kind of connected together for them not to get to get bound,

99
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:45,610
bound up and not separated during the rest of the process. And where for males, you're always starting right here at the beginning.

100
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,640
So there's not that big time chance that that occurs for the for the whole process.

101
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:04,750
All right. I already said most nondescript stinkers and malice is one.

102
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:11,070
These are some of the examples Trisomy 13, 18 and 21.

103
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,720
These are the only ones that are really reliable.

104
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:22,210
And one of the reasons for that is they happen to have the smallest number of genes in them acting less your function.

105
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,790
You can also have trisomy though in the x chromosome of trisomy x.

106
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:51,460
Which is not typically a very big deal, actually. Trisomy X, you'll have some problems with with reproduction maybe, but in general,

107
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,970
it's not that big a deal and it can actually go undetected in a lot of people.

108
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,670
As far as monogamy is, though, you don't really see any here except for Turner Syndrome, which is one X.

109
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,530
And that's because, Nancy, these are really not very viable at all.

110
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:26,190
You hardly ever even see them in anywhere because they get they get recorded in very early stage.

111
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:42,190
But you can't have a sure theory. We've also got x, x, y, which is known as KLINEFELTER syndrome.

112
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,470
And you've also got X, Y, Y and an extra Y chromosome there.

113
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:59,110
This is sometimes known as super male syndrome. This tends to be linked to to be more aggressive and so on.

114
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,290
How would you tell which period the nine destruction occurred?

115
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:26,200
Well for that. He's really just gonna take some markers and essentially compare that to the

116
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:33,970
parents phenotypes of those markers and see which one the child had two of.

117
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,390
Two from mom or two from dad, one from the other.

118
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,420
Right. So that's how you would do that.

119
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:52,210
How could you tell whether the non disjunction was from meiosis one or to help to make this picture?

120
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,830
Yes. If it occurs in meiosis two, you'll see two copies that are almost identical.

121
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,880
Right. For you. Yeah, that's exactly right.

122
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:16,730
So if it happens in meiosis two, then they'll have two chromosomes here that are nearly identical,

123
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,050
nearly because there could be some recombination occurring.

124
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:31,840
They'll be very similar to each other. Whereas if it happened here in meiosis one, then you have three very different copies of the same chromosome.

125
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,960
Right. Let's wait until that.

126
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:56,080
This is just another look at Down's syndrome. It's the risk of Down's syndrome is quite dependent on maternal age.

127
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:12,280
As maternal age increases. The risk increases. You can see if you get up to age 50 or so, you've got 80 cases per thousand, it's 8%.

128
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,390
So it gets this higher, exponentially as you get older.

129
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:25,570
And again, it's really due to that the age of index. There's a higher chance that that destruction and non destruction will occur.

130
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,590
All right. Structural abnormalities.

131
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:44,780
You got your chromosomal abnormalities here on the left, you've got a reciprocal translocation.

132
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,660
So basically here you've got two chromosomes that kind of swap a chunk of their coat.

133
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,300
Right. So here, you know, this little piece, if this is a chromosome one or two,

134
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,550
then this is a little piece of two and a little and a corresponding piece, one swapped here.

135
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:18,200
And if this is kind of done in a balanced way like this on the left,

136
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,280
this will actually be stable in mitosis and it will be able to reproduce just fine.

137
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:35,300
However, you get some weird cases here like this where you might end up with one that's got two centimeters and one with none.

138
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,410
And this will be unstable and not reproduce.

139
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,780
Okay. Roberts Robert and Translocation.

140
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:56,730
Remember, that's where a whole chromosome sticks to another one. The this will actually be stable in mitosis.

141
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,360
What can happen here is something like this where you actually end up with kind of these two centromere at the center.

142
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:17,160
But the the cell can actually recognize, too, that right next to each other as one and still go through mitosis properly.

143
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:27,900
However, the little these little parts, these little satellite stocks and so on, those will get lost during mitosis.

144
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:39,750
But the gender tend to be non-coding regions. None of these cases are really good for that.

145
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,090
So that's something to keep in mind as well.

146
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:55,550
Can you expand things like how do we determine for the reciprocal translocation which one is stable and which one is possible?

147
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,950
Yeah, so really it's stable. If it's if this translocation occurs in kind of a balanced way.

148
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:12,770
So if the result is what looks like a normal chromosome, even though there's parts exchanged and it will be stable,

149
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:23,060
but if it's not looking like a normal chromosome here, there's two centromere, for example, that one will not be seen.

150
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,360
That makes sense. Yes.

151
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,750
What is the the difference between the reciprocal and Roberts, Sonia?

152
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:48,820
The Roberts Sonia is whole chromosomes that get binded together where the whereas typical reciprocal translocation

153
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:57,340
is a chunk of chromosome swaps with a chunk of chromosomes on a different cross instead of the whole.

154
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,910
Anything else? Yes. So what are those like the satellites in the satellite stocks?

155
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:15,110
Is that a result of the translocation or is that something that just the chromosomes have and then get lost as a result of this translocation?

156
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,790
Yeah, there are these little parts around the centromere that that are there normally,

157
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,790
but because of the way this gets stuck together, they get separated.

158
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,230
And then in the most if you're if you're going through mitosis and.

159
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,260
Right. Chromosomal abnormalities.

160
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:46,740
These are within the same chromosome. You can have deletions, duplications, copy number, variance version and so on.

161
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:57,630
So this picture kind of represents some of those. If you had a normal sequence ABCD, you might get a single base that gets duplicated.

162
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,880
The second example you get to CS, you could have multiple versions of that as well.

163
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,690
So multilayered copy number variant for example.

164
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,430
You can also have very complex copy number variants as well.

165
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,970
Like for example, you get a bunch of these and then a CDC CD and so on.

166
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,400
They can get fairly complicated.

167
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:46,110
You can also have an inversion where two bases get slapped and sort of ABCD, you've got ACP detected and these are I shouldn't really be saying bases,

168
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:56,310
these could be chunks as well and these could be sequences that could be up to two megabytes in size.

169
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,130
You may also be tandem repeats.

170
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,820
So this is where the same sequence would get copy multiple times.

171
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,360
So an example that might be like a CBD, CBD, CBD.

172
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,350
Right. Same sequence arranged and have had to jump in succession.

173
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,640
All right. So types of mutations occurring in gene regions.

174
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:44,930
I think you've probably seen some of this terminology before, but you've got substitutions,

175
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:51,380
deletions, insertions, nice table kind of outline, a lot of those for substitutions.

176
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,690
We got synonymous or silent mutations, which are ones that don't actually change in, you know, so that's produce.

177
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,330
And then you get your nones anonymous ones which do change the amino acids.

178
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,980
This sense changes it to different amino acid nonsense,

179
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:20,060
changes that it's supposed to be an amino acid to a stop codons that gets terminated prematurely.

180
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,690
These can also happen in splice sites affecting how the splicing occurs.

181
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,340
Or they could happen in promoter regions which might alter the gene expression.

182
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:50,450
Or deletions. You can have an insertions, you can have frame shifts of an insertion or deletion that's going to kind of change the reference rate.

183
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,229
So it when it's when the code is read, it's these triplets, right?

184
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:03,950
These codons. So if you insert something in there that that whole thing is going to get shifted over and not to be the appropriate reference.

185
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:13,790
And these can these can happen in partial or whole gene deletion and an insertion.

186
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,430
These can certainly occur anywhere in the genome.

187
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:29,660
So in exons and trans, in promoters, all of those regulatory sequences surrounding the regions as well as non-coding regions.

188
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:47,240
This is happening all over the place in. This table kind of shows you how common some of these mutations are, relatively rare frequency.

189
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,510
So a lot of these are missense mutations which actually change the amino acid by 50%.

190
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:04,340
So then you have fewer nonsense and RNA mutations and splicing mutations.

191
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,220
You get a rather large chunk of which are additions or deletions, small numbers of bases.

192
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:18,780
And then a smaller a smaller portion that are large lesions or inversions and so on.

193
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:34,230
So the effect of mutations on the actual protein product, most of these are going to be loss of function mutations.

194
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:46,680
That's what occurs most often, and that's where the mutation actually causes the protein not to be able to do its job properly.

195
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:57,120
It's not functioning, but you can have some which are a gain of function by that.

196
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,790
It's really what we mean is just it's a function, but it's some new function that you didn't really want necessarily.

197
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,470
A lot of times that's going to be dangerous to the person.

198
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:24,690
But, you know, it could also be a gain of function where we start to be able to do telekinesis or shoot fireballs out of your hands.

199
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,409
Right. That's a gain of function, isn't it? Yeah.

200
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,710
All right. X-Men doesn't really see to movies much.

201
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:46,320
There's not very good. There's there's a it's a good science pieces in this that's not really that clear.

202
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:55,440
You can also have dominant negative mutations. These are extra bad because you have to cells.

203
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,149
Right. So one is the mutated alien and one's not the mutated one.

204
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,300
Not only will not be functional also inhibit the functioning of the the properly.

205
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,130
Okay. All right.

206
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,470
Here's a nice graphic here of missense and silent mutations.

207
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,640
So actually, this is a missense.

208
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:41,830
So and the top here, you've got a DNA strand that creates this RNA, which then gets coated with those three base codons into all of the amino acids.

209
00:29:43,540 --> 00:30:03,700
Missense would actually replace here this key with an A, and now you're coding for spare gene instead of sharing.

210
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,410
And that's a missense mutation.

211
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:21,210
Silent would be where if you changed this C over here to something that was similar and you still made serine.

212
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,809
And we're going to talk about this terminally ill quite a bit.

213
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:32,870
So it's important to understand that it's really this just the particular version of DNA sequence.

214
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:40,370
So here someone could have a G or they can have an H at at that particular position.

215
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:54,540
So it is at a particular position. It about. So this is graphic for a nonsense mutations.

216
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:13,490
So in this case, you've got this a T which is replaced the C and you end up with a stop code on here.

217
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,740
This you aim instead of UAC. Yes.

218
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,220
So this is a little bit part of the dominant mutation.

219
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,850
So I was wondering like what would be a situation where it would occur,

220
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:35,190
where one nonfunctioning protein would interfere with the function of the normal protein?

221
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:46,910
So you're looking for an example? Yeah. Like, yeah, these ones don't occur as often.

222
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,200
Trying to think of something here.

223
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,930
I think by the end behind like amyloid plaques, as if you have like one that's misfolded,

224
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,660
like really sticky and it kind of just includes functional amyloid as well.

225
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,990
And just the plaques grow that might be. Yeah.

226
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah. That could, that could be a possible example. Well, I'll think about that more and get back to you for sure.

227
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,040
All right. Thank.

228
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,570
Okay. Yeah, very good questions.

229
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:59,670
Yes. So we're talking about nonsense, but you're seeing it's replaced in an A and you end up with a stop coda.

230
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,050
Not only do you not end up with the dire scene in the and allow any.

231
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:13,050
Not only is the entire scene sorry replaced with the stop around, but you end up missing this and allowing the narrative as well.

232
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:23,420
Right. This is a grassroots reframing shift.

233
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,790
Now we've got the insertion 80 and CG here.

234
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,620
So the sequence starts just fine.

235
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:41,540
And you've got these couple extra bases that move everything down and you end up with a whole new set of amino acids on this chain.

236
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:51,550
As you can imagine that probably more deleterious than in other things.

237
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,010
We didn't mention it.

238
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:14,250
But it's worth noting here that in general, having added genetic materials, you're going to be better off and having deleted genetic material,

239
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,470
your genome can kind of deal with that extra stuff a little easier, can the absence of it?

240
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:37,210
So that's probably why you get some viable tracer means, for example, and you don't see any liable bonuses other than just the so.

241
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:50,690
The term centers. They can also have mutations at splice sites.

242
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,880
So these are we need insurance.

243
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:10,540
So here in this graphic know a we've got a normal splicing that occurs so your lysosome enzyme comes along and

244
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:19,660
it's looking for is say in this case for example it's looking for a GTI at the beginning and AG at the end.

245
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,550
You find that it cuts it there. Right.

246
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:31,830
But if you had a mutation where it's G turned into an A, you wouldn't find the GTI there.

247
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,030
It's still going to look for it. So it might find it somewhere else in the middle here and then just cut a smaller piece out.

248
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:51,400
That's panel B, you also have various other cases, but here it gets cut multiple times.

249
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:57,400
If it were, another example might be if it doesn't find the egg because of mutation,

250
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:09,790
it might continue and find it in the coding region in this exon over here and cut out more than the various versions of that that can occur.

251
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,320
Expansion of unstable repeats. So this is kind of an interesting one.

252
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,230
This is actually occurring during replication.

253
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:41,990
And what's happening is as the replicating strand is getting copied, it can actually slip off of the template strand momentarily.

254
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:53,510
And then when it gets back on, it gets back on earlier in that sequence and so it ends up making another extra copy.

255
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:05,780
So essentially it slips off for a minute and it can kind of bind up if you think of a row or something that can like a rope can bind up like this.

256
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,139
Right, and set back on the template strands.

257
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:17,660
They end up with this little loop, but when it detaches, then you get this extra repeat in there.

258
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,480
It makes sense. So that's kind of weird.

259
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,950
This is kind of implicated in things like Huntington's disease.

260
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,840
Fragile X is not. She's not that.

261
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:52,200
All right. So when we're actually talking about disease susceptibility, what's interesting here is, you know,

262
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:59,170
you've got some causal variant and it can affect gene expression or splicing or protein structure, and that can lead to disease.

263
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,430
The basic idea, what's interesting is most common is that there's a change in the gene expression.

264
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:18,430
So instead of altering the actual protein, it might just change how much is made.

265
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:28,580
Might be too little or too much, maybe. It's estimated that one in every 300 basis is polymorphic.

266
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:39,620
It's pretty common. You polymorphic and polymorphism, you need to recall.

267
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,330
It's just the existence of two or more variants at relatively high frequency.

268
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,750
This would be highly polymorphic if it's greater than 1%.

269
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:58,960
Right. So you've got your snips to single nucleotide polymorphisms.

270
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,020
And again, this is really just a single base change.

271
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:16,690
Usually there's only two possible appeals that occur here. So in this example here, you've got it either A, C or T at this particular locus.

272
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:28,390
We would say snip is common. If it's 5% or greater, you might say it's low frequency.

273
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,710
Between one and five. We would call it a rare variant.

274
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,870
It's less than 1% and has a particularly.

275
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,060
Right? Yeah. It's important not to get confused.

276
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:56,450
Like, when you look at something like this box, it's. It's tempting to say, well, you know, but C matched with G, right?

277
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,030
But these are these are only single strands we're looking at.

278
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,280
It's important to remember that you'll feel that a chromosome has it.

279
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:13,590
And one of these specific snips is depending on which the DNA strands are measured, we're only measuring one strand when we say,

280
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:27,360
you know, an illegal could be C or D, what we mean is it can be seen on that measured strand at that particular spot on the genome.

281
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,860
And you're looking at the double stranded DNA would look more like this.

282
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,230
Right. So here you've got to see your genes.

283
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:47,910
If you're measuring this top strand, then they have a C or G at that locus, our CTC or T at that locus.

284
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:55,980
And if you are measuring the the other strand, you would say they have a G or an eight at that locus.

285
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,130
It does depend on which strand you're measuring, right?

286
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,730
Intel's Intel's are insertions or deletions.

287
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,530
They can be categorized depending on effects on the genome.

288
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:28,590
So you have a single base pair that's added or deleted.

289
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,550
You can have expansions by multiples of only a single base pair.

290
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:43,830
Mostly base pair expansions, repeats, and you can have kind of random DNA sequence insertions, mutations as well, or transposable elements.

291
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,690
One example is cystic fibrosis.

292
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,340
That's one of the causes. There's actually many causes, cystic fibrosis, different types.

293
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,890
One of those is caused by a three base pair deletion, the C.A.R. gene.

294
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,850
And we already talked about Huntington's disease.

295
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:18,880
You have those those repeats that are occurring there that's implicated in Huntington's, Huntington's and petulance as well.

296
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:30,540
Other types of variants. Well, you can have whole blacks that are substituted, you can have inversion variance.

297
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:39,630
So in this example here, this block looks like actually swapped.

298
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,060
Looks like it's swapped with its corresponding strand.

299
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:54,840
So the two strands kind of got tangled up and pieces got swapped where you can have those continuity rates again.

300
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:13,290
So the Thousand Genomes Project, this was kind of a kind of your landmark reference panel that was created early on in genomics.

301
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:20,540
It's was really the first one that was truly multiethnic.

302
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:32,760
That was important because of that in a larger sample than what they had previously included 2500 individuals that were all sequenced.

303
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,480
See, that's the critical piece here, that they're all sequenced.

304
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:47,340
And that is was done for 26 different populations, including African, East Asian, European, South Asian and so on.

305
00:43:50,460 --> 00:44:04,590
What that project found was about 85 million variance, less common in rare 85 different locations on the genome that were very.

306
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:14,580
Low frequency and rare variants are enriched for potentially functional mutations compared to countries.

307
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:23,680
This would not be. I would rare variance.

308
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:38,630
Tend to functioning more in common bearings could be due to the impacts that these potentially protein changing mutations would have.

309
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,270
Having that be widespread would be, of course, solitary and not beneficial.

310
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,050
So there's probably a selection against the presence of those.

311
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,100
Exactly. You've got natural selection coming into play, right?

312
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,850
So because these things tend to be ad they're going to be selected against

313
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,060
keeping that those frequencies of those variants very low in the population.

314
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:17,270
That's exactly it. 10,000 genomes is getting kind of old at this point.

315
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:26,750
There are other reference panels that we tend to use now, things like haplotype reference consortium know for top Tom.

316
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:44,060
It's another one. So there are newer ones. But this was really a very pivotal landmark in creating and continuing with this thousand genomes.

317
00:45:45,650 --> 00:46:00,830
This is some of what they found as well. So what they saw is that a typical person is actually different from the reference about 4 million sites.

318
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:15,770
The typical genome would contain about a thousand large deletions, 160 copy number variants, around ten versions,

319
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:29,690
you know, 25000 to 50000 private mutations, which led to led them to about 75 new mutations per genome.

320
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:41,570
Every individual has about 75 mutations that occur, brand new mutations.

321
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:51,260
So really the idea here is this biology is pretty messy.

322
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,170
There's a lot of mutations that do occur, although the genome can compensate pretty well for a lot of these,

323
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:12,260
unless it's at a location that specific that's going to cause some major problem you can deal with with a lot of these things on its own.

324
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:20,050
But it does make it hard to study this biological effects and those interplays with environment in some.

325
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:35,870
Questions about that. And in those slides.

326
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:49,230
There's more. There was more in the burning paper that was assigned as well.

327
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,250
When your chance to read that it's burning paper here.

328
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:04,890
So they talked about thousand genomes and and why it was important and some of those benefits of sequencing and so on.

329
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:23,969
So what do you suppose? Somebody give me some ideas of what some of those benefits of sequencing actually are in compared to what I'm really

330
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:32,940
referring to areas in comparison to like chip data where you measure a bunch of snips in the millions but not all of them.

331
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:47,070
Right. And then you use properties of L.D. you some reference found to to impute the remaining remainder of them as your typical dual scenario.

332
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,160
But here you actually sequence all the bases essentially.

333
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:01,860
So why would that be better? Can't catch variance with chimps.

334
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,620
Yeah, yeah. That's definitely a big one. You can you can see those rare variants.

335
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:14,340
It's going to be at least more accurate to find them because you're not relying on the imputation to find them.

336
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:19,560
Right. If you haven't measured it. Right.

337
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:26,500
That's good. Anything else? Yes.

338
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,680
Does it have anything to do with geographical differences, by any chance,

339
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,440
when you're more likely like to say, like, for example, for reference, population is mostly Caucasian.

340
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,270
You might be doing something like that. Yeah, that's that's definitely a good point.

341
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,820
In order for that amputation to work, you have to have a reference panel.

342
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:55,720
That is. And as a good reference for your population that you've studied and measured from.

343
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:08,020
Is exactly right. So if you had if you had a population that didn't have a good reference panel and you wouldn't be able to compute very accurately.

344
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:13,269
You know what? My sequencing. Well, you don't need the reference panel anymore.

345
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:17,230
You can just measure everything. And it would be totally fine.

346
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:26,570
That's right. So that's a big benefit. Anything else you can think of?

347
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:45,890
Well, it would certainly also be easier to study some of those large insults and so on, some of those larger abnormalities,

348
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:54,379
because since you're measuring everything, you can see them as a as a chunk as opposed to one base and then some mutations around it.

349
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,490
Right. So that'd be another other idea there.

350
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:08,100
All right. Questions remain at Thomson genomes.

351
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:37,040
This paper. I think it's a good time to take a break in 10 minutes or so and come back and work on the premise that I'm with you.
