1
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:08,993
The ABT narrative structure is
actually really quite common in good

2
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,180
science communications.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,090
And now that I know to look for it,
I often see it in some of the better

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,190
articles that are written about
science for the general public.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,630
So I've taken a few examples and

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,870
I wanna show them to you so that you can
see the structure in real world contexts.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,940
So here's one.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,900
This is an article that was
published in The Conversation.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,750
Can low doses of chemicals
affect your health?

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,160
A new report weighs the evidence.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,649
So this first paragraph is about and
stuff, it's background.

12
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,530
Toxicology's founding father is famous for
proclaiming the dose makes the poison.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,428
The phrase represents the pillar
of traditional toxicology.

14
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:51,164
Essentially chemicals are harmful only
at high enough doses all background

15
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:56,740
information, and then what's the next
word that leads off the next paragraph?

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,570
But.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,760
But increasing evidence
suggests that even low

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,320
levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals
can interfere with hormonal signals.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,910
Standard toxicity tests don't
always detect the effects

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,990
that chemicals can have at lower levels.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,640
And even when the data do suggest effects,
scientists and

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,310
policy makers may not act upon this
information in a timely manner.

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,620
Notice that all of what I
just read are but statements.

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,420
They're all things that are increasing
the tension that we might feel,

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,813
which leads directly to
the therefore paragraph.

26
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:34,870
Therefore, it doesn't say therefore but
it's implied.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,410
Recognizing these challenges,
the US Environmental Protection Agency,

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,590
the EPA, has asked a committee of
scientists to study the issue in detail.

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,150
Notice that that makes total sense now.

30
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,896
Now that we've gone through
the background, the and part and the but,

31
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:54,519
we've established a tension and
we want to resolve that tension, so

32
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,877
it's a really good idea that somebody's
gonna be studying this issue.

33
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:04,600
Notice also that the paragraph
structure makes this easy to follow.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,840
You have an and paragraph,
you have a couple but paragraphs, and

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,010
then you have a therefore paragraph.

36
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,480
The but paragraph serves as the focus.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,360
It tells us what the problems are,
why we should be caring about this.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,220
Now here's another one that
presented its core ABT narrative

39
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,040
after a couple of introductory paragraphs.

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
So, I'm only getting down.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,060
I've clipped out the introduction but
I'm getting down to the but.

42
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,090
So, here the story is, the title of
the story, beaches are becoming safer for

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,010
baby sea turtles, but
threats await them in the ocean.

44
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,290
So the and
paragraph has background information.

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,760
Today most coastal areas protect
beaches during nesting season.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
Agencies, researchers,
volunteers monitor beaches and

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
help hatchlings make it to the water.

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,860
And these measures have helped
turtle populations increase, and

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,790
there's an example statistic.

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,260
What comes next?

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,790
But.

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,350
But turtles face many hazards in
the water, including plastic pollution and

53
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,420
accidental harm or death in
encounters with commercial fishermen.

54
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,520
Now here they've included
the therefore in the same paragraph.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,710
It doesn't say therefore,
but it's obvious.

56
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,550
Therefore the future of sea sea turtle
research depends on finding new ways

57
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:28,800
to assess turtles' status and
trends at sea as well as on the beach.

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,980
Notice the tension here is
we're good on the beaches.

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,080
We're not so good on the water, and

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
by highlighting that tension
it leads to the therefore.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,610
Therefore we need to study this more.

62
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,338
We need to find new ways to
assess the turtle status and

63
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,086
trends while they're at sea.

64
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:55,110
All right, pretty much,
also notice the ABT is even in the title.

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,540
Beaches are becoming safer for

66
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,750
baby sea turtles, but
threats await them in the ocean.

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,780
The therefore is unsaid in the title,
which is actually good for

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,000
a title because it makes
you want to read more.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,150
Like, therefore,
what are we gonna do about this?

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,530
I need to read more.

71
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,040
All right, one last example.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,130
A bit more subtle but still,
the structure's there.

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,980
Here, ticks and
mosquitoes are bringing more diseases.

74
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,750
What can we do?

75
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,690
So you've got two paragraphs at
the beginning that are about disease,

76
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,360
cases of vector borne disease have
more than doubled and mosquitoes and

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,340
ticks are bearing most of the blame.

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,880
Second paragraph.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:43,100
Mosquitoes, long spreaders of malaria and
yellow fever, also spread other diseases.

80
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,935
The insects are largely responsible for

81
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:48,520
out-breaking West Nile virus
endemic in the continental US.

82
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,510
So you've got the second paragraph,
it's setting you up.

83
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,420
Mosquitoes, mosquitoes,
they're big and then you switch.

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:03,070
It doesn't say but, but it implies but
ticks, which are not insects but

85
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,740
parasitic arthropods, actually cause more
disease in the US than mosquitoes do.

86
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,930
Notice there's a sudden tension there.

87
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,450
Whoa, wait a second!

88
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,150
It's not actually about
just the mosquitoes.

89
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,750
It's also about the ticks.

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,250
And the ticks cause more disease.

91
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:25,000
And because of that but
now the therefore paragraph

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,880
focuses us on, whoa, wait a second,
why is this happening?

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,580
Why the uptick in disease?

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,815
And more importantly, how can we
protect ourselves against these things?

95
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:39,787
So the structure here is that tension
between mosquitoes who the vectors

96
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:43,450
who we often think of
as spreading disease.

97
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,402
But ticks actually cause more disease.

98
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:50,330
And that's the tension that draws
you in to wanting to know more about

99
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,040
what we should do about this.

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,650
The point is,

101
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:00,170
ABT structures are actually quite
common in clear science communication.

102
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,550
They help structure the way
in which the story is told so

103
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,010
that you want to learn more.

104
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,250
And as a result,
you should be considering using them too,

105
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,650
when youâ€™re trying to
communicate about science or

106
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,943
about health information that
you want people to care about.
