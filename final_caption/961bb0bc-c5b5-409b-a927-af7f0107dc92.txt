00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,080
Welcome to Epit, six thirty four's module on the SBIR model.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,550
In this module, I'll introduce the NCAR model.

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:27,390
In this model, we now include the exposure state he that represents the state where an individual is exposed but not yet infectious.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,300
We call this the latency, the time it takes from being exposed to being infectious.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,260
This is in contrast to the more familiar measure, the incubation period, which is the time from being exposed to being symptomatic.

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,130
They're learning objective of this module are to one,

7
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:54,740
analyze an SVR transmission model and to identify the unique dynamic properties of an SDR transmission model.

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,900
BFC air model consists of four state variables and four parameters.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,280
What is new in this model is the explicit introduction incorporation of the exposed state.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Which creates. Which increases our state variables to four compared to the essay, our model, which has three.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,170
As with our previous transmission model, new represents the birth and death rates.

12
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:33,240
Batur represents the transmission rate. Sigma is our new parameter, represents the rate that latent infections become infectious.

13
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,120
And Delta represents the recovery rate, as you can see.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,410
We have similar endemic, as you will see. We have similar endemic properties compared to the essay our model,

15
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:55,200
except that we will show that are not for the SGI model is an intense weighted version of what we have for the essay, our model.

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,320
Furthermore, the epidemic curve will be delayed compared to the ESSI, our model given.

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,820
Now people are in the latent exposed state for a period of time before becoming infectious.

18
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,080
Given we have four state variables, we now have four equations.

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,150
The new equations being X, being the exposed equation DADT.

20
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,210
So after a successful transmission event, people enter the exposed state.

21
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:37,590
They leave the exposed state at the rate at a rate sigma and suddenly enter the infectious state Hattery segment.

22
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:45,750
Again, the Essere model now has a delay going from susceptible to infectious to the infectious state.

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,240
But the SDR model has the same epidemic threshold.

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:03:02,200
S t is has to be that susceptible threshold has to be greater than Delta over Beda in order for an epidemic to occur.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,750
To draw the milk lines requires an additional algebraic step.

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:18,030
Yes. Now Klein looks the same as CSIR model because the yes equation is all it is, is the same.

27
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:27,190
So the extra algebraic step is to eliminate e the variable in the eye equation.

28
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:35,050
Once again, we have to know two. I know Clynes, the first eye equals zero, like the S higher model.

29
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:45,480
The second is the same as the S higher model with an added factor sigma plus mbewe over sigma.

30
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,850
Therefore, we wind up with no clients that are similar to the USA, our model.

31
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,430
We have one as Snow Klein. We have two.

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,190
I know Clynes. We have two equilibrium points.

33
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,780
The main difference, again, is the scalar factor for the horizontal.

34
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,240
I know Klein. This quantitatively changes the threshold value that results in the elimination of the disease.

35
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:30,100
But qualitative does not impact the dynamics. Again, we have two equilibrium points.

36
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,220
The first at X equals one and I equals zero, representing elimination.

37
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:48,840
And the second. Representing the endemic state, the point as equals, I, I equal zero is unstable.

38
00:04:48,840 --> 00:05:03,100
And the endemic point is stable. As with the essay, our model, this is only for the condition that the horizontal neckline is less than one.

39
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:14,520
Under this endemic condition, we have a slightly different value for the endemic high values in the SARS model.

40
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,200
When this threshold values greater than one, we only have one equilibrium point at as equals one equals zero,

41
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:30,400
which represents the equilibrium, which represents elimination and is now a stable equilibrium point.

42
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,540
The arithmetic understanding of this threshold is that elimination occurs when the loss

43
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:44,160
of infections gamma plus new is greater than the rate of replenishment of infection.

44
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,150
This time, the rate of employment is equal to Beda times a fraction.

45
00:05:48,150 --> 00:06:01,830
Sigma over Sigma plus new. This fraction represents the fraction of population of the population that becomes infectious before dying.

46
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,330
So in summary, when the horizontal I know client is greater than one, there is only one equilibrium point.

47
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,660
His point is stable and represents elimination.

48
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:22,150
In contrast, when the horizontal I know client is less than one, there exists two equilibrium points, but only one of which is stable.

49
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,860
The point representing indemnity again by taking the inverse.

50
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:39,510
We arrive at the expression for our not, which has this attenuation factor sigma over sigma plus mue that doesn't exist for the essay our model.

51
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:47,220
So the impact of adding the East state is that I are not is attenuated.

52
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:55,920
But the Ristic understanding of here's the understanding of the endemic is the same.

53
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:06,810
The rate of entering the infectious state is greater than the rate of leaving.

54
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,280
So I'd like to end this module by introducing the idea of a delay process.

55
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:20,150
So latency is a delay process. That is, there is a fixed time between getting exposed and being infectious.

56
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,850
There are there are many ways to model delays.

57
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,840
The first is through ordinaire differential equations using just one or a differential equation

58
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,530
like we do when we're modern latency and a SBIR model is a crude approximation delay.

59
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,910
And we'll see this more in a later module.

60
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:51,900
Using a series of two or more compartments provides a Gamage is Crooge distributed delay process, which is more biologically plausible.

61
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,110
It represents the fact that everyone experiences a different latency following infection.

62
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,240
This is due to susceptibility dose and other factors.

63
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,310
A is a more accurate and complete way of modeling to delay process.

64
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:19,860
But PD partial differential equations are complex and often intractable to solve a pure delay is a third way to model delays.

65
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:27,450
It is also often intractable to solve, and it is also not often not biologically plausible.

66
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:38,190
That is dense. Delays are seldom predictable and seldom does everybody have the same exact delay.

67
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:45,870
For example, everyone has different experiences with an infection and latency times ranging from a few days to a few weeks,

68
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,220
as we see with covered 19 currently.

69
00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:00,650
We will talk in this in this class. We will focus on Odie's as our option for modeling delay processes.

70
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:11,500
And again, we'll be looking at this more in detail in a subsequent module on delay processes.
