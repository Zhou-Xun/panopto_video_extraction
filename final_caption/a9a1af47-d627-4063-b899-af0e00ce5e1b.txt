1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,800
I said, I want you to something here.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:23,990
That. Stop restarting the music sequence.

3
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,920
I know. Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,670
Sorry. All right.

5
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,810
Hey. Hey, everybody. Hi.

6
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay. Thank you. You're totally fine.

7
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,450
I just thought my heart was hungry. I hope you're okay.

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,780
Yeah. Yeah. I know this room is a little challenging.

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,260
This is, like, literally as big as you can get, I think. Okay.

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,860
So everything is, like, loose. Okay.

11
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,820
Why don't we get started? Thanks, everybody, for chiming in on Resilience Film.

12
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:42,620
We'll talk about it a little bit in class. I've been going through your guys comments, which are great, and I will say one thing,

13
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:51,770
that meeting our parents is now the former surgeon general of California, but she was the first like in that position.

14
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,469
So that to to to do this emphasis on assets and everything.

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,370
So she's really kind of been at the forefront of this movement.

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:09,350
Just kind of cool. And so definitely wanted to hear your guest thoughts of the film.

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,070
Today we can discuss and also.

18
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,979
Oh, and I return the baby's papers. Oh, and I. I messed up last time.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:26,840
So this thing is like somehow I think it's like tweaked out that I put that survey out and I

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,840
thought I was going to I thought I had scheduled it to come out at the end of last class,

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,989
but it's actually going to come out at the end of this class that's like mid-point survey.

22
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,740
So go ahead and let me know feedback from that.

23
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,320
So today I gave sort of a range of readings.

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,070
I think that and Masten of people don't know her and are interested in this area.

25
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,490
She writes and has written for like 30 years in this space.

26
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,590
And I think she's got a lot of really great kind of accessible pieces.

27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:04,970
And I give you guys one of those for today, and then this one is much more of a, you know, like a standard kind of literature review around.

28
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,370
Here are some interventions that we've, you know, looked at in the field around stress and toxic stress and biological stress in particular.

29
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,610
And so what I want to get to by the end of today is talking a little bit about your guys papers and interventions and thinking about

30
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,060
how do we kind of identify interventions that might exist for like these topics that we're that we're looking at in the papers.

31
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,010
The other thing that I gave you guys to read is that a policy statement,

32
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,630
American Academy of Pediatrics, I think of, referenced it a few times around a relational health.

33
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:48,499
So it's a little bit dense. But as with some of those other policy statements we read, it kind of gives like I forget who said aspirational,

34
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,969
but that is one of my favorite words in this space in particular.

35
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,570
And it gives some ideas of kind of like, here's plate, here's where we could go.

36
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:07,490
We're so not there yet. But, you know, these are some ways to shape thinking about this this mission about improving child health.

37
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:16,790
And then this McKoy reading not someone who writes a lot on global, you know, interventions and in lots of different settings.

38
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,060
And so this is I know it's like a really short just sort of it's kind of like a little blurb or blog or commentary.

39
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,929
But I think, again, it's helpful to just if you guys, you know, again, want something for your back pocket that's like,

40
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,899
oh, what are some good ways to summarize that points we need to think about when implementing these interventions.

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,180
And this is talking about a global context,

42
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,010
but it kind of ticks through points that are just relevant for any kind of intervention you might want to think about.

43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,040
So talking to the community, etc.

44
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:56,450
So we'll talk about resilience. And then like I said, I do want to transition and you guys don't have to like know today by any means.

45
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,240
People are still working on their topics.

46
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,650
But I just wanted to give you guys some like guidance for looking for interventions for your papers, if that's helpful.

47
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,040
And these are sites that are helpful in general.

48
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,589
I think when you're sort of out there in the in the practice world going like, what do we know about this topic?

49
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,230
What has been shown to work? How do we find that info so we can get to those?

50
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:29,480
Okay. So I wanted to hear first from from you guys, what did you think of the film?

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,450
And we can but the kind of questions I was asking and the response was like, what surprised people?

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,550
And, you know, what do you think could be relevant to kind of work on why do you think there is pushback around this?

53
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,280
What what did people think about the film in general and had people seen it before?

54
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,329
I can't I don't have a sense of how far out most their practices.

55
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,910
Yeah. Okay so not too much. I know some people had seen the babies film before.

56
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,530
Like a psychology class. It's kind of interesting to see like what makes its way up there.

57
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:19,000
So resilience. And I was really surprised, I think,

58
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,440
at the beginning of the film when they were talking about like all of the conditions that are highly correlated with places like obesity,

59
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:35,230
heart diseases like it was like in the more aces you had, you're like increased prevalence of that.

60
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,530
I was really surprised. It can be very stark. Yeah,

61
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:49,509
those data and we've discussed some like mechanisms for why you're talking about the biology of stress and immune function and all of those things.

62
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:59,110
So now let's say like now compared to when that kind of these studies came out, we know a lot more because that's really kicked off a lot of research,

63
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,239
or at least I would say it's not kicked off like pulled together a lot of research

64
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,370
under this kind of like pieces and help also like course health development umbrella.

65
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,450
So it's definitely turned the attention to that.

66
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,290
Anything else about the film was surprised by.

67
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,120
Interested in. Enraged by. Yeah.

68
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,560
Really. And the thing is that, like,

69
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:32,280
surprise was just kind of like reiterating that even that is emerging as just the importance of like parents the buffer and like it was,

70
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,689
I guess a little bit surprising to me that like that's the number one thing.

71
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,059
And even if a child does face like so many different adversities,

72
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,600
like having a parent that's like a strong buffer can mitigate a lot of outcomes from that like that alone.

73
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,829
Interesting. Certainly gives us a focal point for intervention.

74
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,230
And I know we've talked a lot about parents kind of in our early childhood section of this course

75
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:10,040
and certainly in the infancy section and as well about really starting from the beginning,

76
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,749
like how do we support those parents, right?

77
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,450
Because parents are just adults who are, you know, experiencing all these same stressors a lot of the time.

78
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,240
Other thoughts kind of going off that I like how they showed that like it wasn't a support group for like the mothers or like the people,

79
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,770
the parents and stuff like that. And I thought to think that one mother that they really highlighted,

80
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,450
like I was at home, for example, and it just shows like how it can be like lasting.

81
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,100
These effects are like how maybe she had a lot of aces growing up to now.

82
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,729
She's kind of like passing it on to the children and stuff and not in a, in any way like directly like she wants to do that.

83
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:54,950
It's just like this is the system that she like grew up in, the situation that she had to deal with, and now her kids are having to deal with that.

84
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,950
And at least she's getting the help now and the support she needs.

85
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,210
So I thought it was really great.

86
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,340
I think that that that that that story in particular to like speaks to this parenting like early parenting time is a really

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:14,629
powerful time for intervention because it just sort of brings to the fore all of these desires to like break your own cycle,

88
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:24,860
help your kids. And I think that, that that I think it illustrates well why this is like a key time for intervention around this stuff.

89
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:36,350
Anything that you guys thought about in terms of the movie with regard to like public health,

90
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,460
you know, the kinds of things we do in public health policy,

91
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,710
community based were ways that public health and kind of inform or interface with this topic and building resilience.

92
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,280
Yeah. And they talked about just the billions of dollars we spend on programs that

93
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,799
are essentially ineffective because they're not really addressing the problem.

94
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,070
And so it's like, okay, I think that we can do that, like try to mitigate that,

95
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:13,360
that shift away from this sort of tertiary care piece to prevention, which is hard, you know, for lots of reasons.

96
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,720
With that said, we'll talk more about that in the child care sessions as well. But absolutely.

97
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,380
And a number of people commented on the funding. So thank you for bringing that up.

98
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:34,489
Yeah, Jackie not exactly relates, but I did like how and the one of the seminars that he was giving, he like gave a questionnaire to everyone there.

99
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,210
It's like break the mentality of like us versus them like over there.

100
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,120
Like I think that really hit home.

101
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Like everyone has something in their life that is causing them stress, whether it was years ago, like in the eighties or it's happening right now,

102
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:59,900
making it more relevant to I don't know if that group and everyone especially to be able to understand the importance of delivering care.

103
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:10,200
I think. Yeah, I mean because as we as we can all reflect and I think we talked about a lot in our I'm just going to talk this

104
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:19,290
down because it's really interesting to today maybe I think remember we talked about our vaccine session.

105
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:25,079
I mean politics is so wrapped up in this. Beliefs are so wrapped up in this child rearing school boards.

106
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,860
Like there's so much going on that even if we're all kind of working towards a goal,

107
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,200
making it relatable to individuals, I think is a really important thing to do.

108
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,390
It is a hard thing to do, especially at this time. We're like just so deeply ingrained right now, our divisiveness, divisiveness.

109
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,220
But kind of figuring out how to engage people around this issue is is critically important.

110
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,860
Yeah. Jennifer, I think to like the other examples about like the elementary school where they partnered with the center.

111
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,360
At first I was like, oh, like these are all like kindergartners and they're like partnering with a trauma center.

112
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,540
Like usually you think of Trump level also like how trauma is depicted.

113
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,370
I think we think about PTSD or like adults and things where it's gotten so severe,

114
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,320
but I think like seeing how they implemented them as Kendra curriculum,

115
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,570
I thought that was like so interesting and how like with other things like my problem with like sexual health too,

116
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,100
they talk about like all kids are too young,

117
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,680
but like they're implementing some of these things at a level where like kindergartners are able to normalize some of those things.

118
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,509
And I thought that was a pretty clever way that we could see that that example and implemented

119
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,710
the things that sexual health and how can we implement that stuff in the classroom?

120
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,449
Because what they're talking about is like as we move on, like Internet is more accessible to younger children.

121
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,450
So like a lot of these things are coming up for children at younger ages.

122
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,210
Absolutely right. Things that kids are going to be finding, you know, have access to lots of information.

123
00:12:51,220 --> 00:13:02,240
And I like them as example that actually a student who's currently a second year HBCU student this summer actually met the developer of that program.

124
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,420
She was telling me the other day and just sort of talked with them about how

125
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,329
they came up with that program and how it's going that's like still going,

126
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:16,290
which is pretty cool considering this movie is now a little few years old and yeah and I like that you think

127
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,909
it also to talking about teens again that are just sort of hot button issues like sexual health and you know,

128
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,030
some people are interested in that for their papers. How do you do that?

129
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,540
A developmentally appropriate way? And I think that, you know, kind of marinating your thinking in the early,

130
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,810
early childhood spaces is important for kind of making that translation to lots of different topics,

131
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,100
like how we deal with screen use and we deal with, you know, talking to kids about race, how do we deal with kids?

132
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,490
I think it's about sexual health like from early on and how do we do that and

133
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,220
understanding how a lot of those interconnected development pieces that is is good.

134
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,999
Any other thoughts? I like that phrase or that that's kind of like you guys can probably tell.

135
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,410
That's kind of like my mission of like separate out in the science from the rooftops.

136
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,930
Um, and I do think that this idea like that, a lot of the ideas that we, you know,

137
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,050
have talked about in here a lot that I think are well summarized in this film are kind of a way to,

138
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,089
you know, I talk about giving you guys like talking points and some of these like, like things that I have.

139
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,220
And I think that's one way to kind of think about, okay,

140
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:29,999
going forward in lots of different settings like you guys will, how do you kind of carry this forward?

141
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,330
So it's sort of like individually, seriously.

142
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,140
Got to actually kind of think outside.

143
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,110
Well. That's a good idea.

144
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,300
I'm really glad it's not tomorrow. That's supposed to be brutally honest here.

145
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:06,850
I don't know whether nobody cared enough to do what.

146
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:19,380
Like. No drilling for hard.

147
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,170
Yeah, I remember what it was like.

148
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:35,360
Hopefully the fact that this will just be natural selection.

149
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,610
I'm. The Class of two.

150
00:15:45,920 --> 00:16:06,530
Oh, my God. I. Oh.

151
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,570
And I'm wondering about.

152
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,860
I think we're. Yeah, but what are you right?

153
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:29,950
I. I.

154
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,500
It is. Do they do a lot in China?

155
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:49,450
No. Never. Never. There's still something to like over.

156
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:16,250
Question on campus. It was difficult for me to place the response limits for students, but I usually try to make it like in the beginning.

157
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,540
I just have a minutes. Oh, okay.

158
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,990
Yeah. See if we can submit it if it doesn't.

159
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,680
And I was just talking to Dave, but yeah. Later. But I just had.

160
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:38,290
Okay. But yeah. Because it has to get out of the way.

161
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,910
Well, that's a good. Oh.

162
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,830
Just in case, you know, you out.

163
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,590
Yeah. I don't know that I'd open an email about that.

164
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:10,650
What happened was my brain went through that and that's to me, it's also.

165
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:28,590
Yeah, international kind of stuff, like all these different, you know.

166
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,759
Well, thanks, guys, for coming back. That was the little freak. And yeah, I think tomorrow has to be like cold and rainy.

167
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,400
So whatever other additional outside time people can get today, you should take it.

168
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,710
So sorry, I can't do the rest of the outside.

169
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,650
All right. So let me click through and to talk more about resilience and what we mean by that,

170
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:11,479
because this is like a whole another one of like Alison's pet peeves a little bit is that this word like trauma is sort of thrown around a lot.

171
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,299
And I think it's kind of important to think through what we mean by resilience when we talk about it.

172
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:26,030
And so like, for example, this was a piece in the New York Times that was really focused on like learning to become resilient.

173
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,569
And it's a very sort of individual focused piece, I would say.

174
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,000
And it's sort of about, you know,

175
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:40,400
how you perceive events in the world happening can sort of shape your resilience in responding to them, which is not wrong.

176
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:48,829
It's just like if all of the focus is sort of like reframing bad events individually,

177
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,959
I think that can be kind of it can kind of undermine that point that the movie makes.

178
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,950
I think pretty well that like it takes more of a community effort and social supports.

179
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,740
So that's one example. And I think the other thing that comes up a lot is this idea of like, is resilience a trait or is it a process?

180
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:15,409
And in resilience research, which is like what E.M. an article is talking about, it's kind of gone from being a little treat,

181
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:22,790
like in sort of early phases of research where people were like, Oh gosh, we have this huge population of kids.

182
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:31,040
There's some variation among them. You know, if they've experienced this bad event or they're growing up in like dire circumstances.

183
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,809
So kids who do better must have a resilience trait, you know, oversimplifying.

184
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,840
But that's kind of where the beginning of that research was.

185
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,729
And so I think hopefully all of us can kind of reflect like, well,

186
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:52,040
it's probably not only a trait like there may be some individual like genetics or other things that can kind of contribute to,

187
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,900
you know, responding to situations differently in a more resilient way.

188
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:06,150
But I think it's also important to point out that process piece like how you continuously like change and adapt to your circumstances.

189
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:14,120
This is a process. It's not this stable, necessarily static thing, but it could also be a little bit of both.

190
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:23,779
So just to kind of point out that like terminology thing with resilience is with resilience because I think people do kind of it can be damaging,

191
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:31,939
right? Because you could have kids who all experience a stressful or traumatic event and some kids look okay after and some kids don't.

192
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,139
And, you know, sort of saying like, oh,

193
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:44,450
these kids have the resilience trait that looked okay after that event may not be well serving those kids because you might then,

194
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:52,339
you know, reduce supports to those kids for, you know, another question is this idea of like, where does it reside?

195
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:59,870
And I feel like this gets to kind of those public health opportunities that I think are important to think through.

196
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:07,400
So, like, does resilience reside inside a person in their perception or does resilience reside in like the context in which we place people?

197
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,639
And I think when we think about public health, this is a good way to think about it because we're talking about all of these sort of bigger

198
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,490
picture factors that we focus on a lot like social determinants that we've talked about in here.

199
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:27,710
And if we can kind of make changes, at least the goal in public health, right, is at least to make a little change in these big factors,

200
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,470
to create change on a broad scale, even if it's a little bit for the the the public.

201
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:43,160
So if we're thinking about where does resilience reside, thinking about building up resilience in the soil here in this metaphor is,

202
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,860
I think, helpful in terms in terms of how we promote resilience.

203
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,749
And so I also pulled this graphic because this is like what drives me a little bit crazy.

204
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,799
Like, do you possess resilience? Like have you built your resilience muscles today?

205
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,610
Like, I get it and I get like the marketing of it and why that's sort of a sticky idea.

206
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:14,540
But at the same time, this idea of, you know, having resilience and then you're done seems not very helpful to me.

207
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,110
So I do.

208
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:25,250
What I do like about this graphic is that it does talk about like the change process and it talks about like you're adaptable,

209
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,890
your like building strength, you're able to sort of cope with.

210
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:37,660
It talks about the processes, but the way it's presented is like this is a resilient learner and that means somebody else isn't a resilient learner.

211
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,940
And I think that's all problematic. So that's like my soapbox about resilience.

212
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:50,260
Any thoughts or questions on that? And people, you know, if you like, I think resilience is a trait, you know,

213
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:59,560
but I think that that's why that I like that in an article because it kind of does walk through all of these different ways of thinking about it.

214
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:07,630
And so here's the mastermind kind of key points. This idea that resilience is dynamic changes in different environments,

215
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:15,820
like we were all interrupted by Fowler and then we came back and then we have the dose of adversity and timing matter.

216
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,350
Right. And we've talked a lot about this. This should feel very familiar.

217
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:29,530
So when in your developmental process does some dose of adversity happen and it can be different across different individuals?

218
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:42,730
So when we think about I'll just put that up there, she kind of goes through as small tables and it's like little tables, summary tables.

219
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:50,590
She goes through like kind of this short list of resilience factors and reading through these,

220
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,680
I didn't put them up, but they're like things that we've talked about in here.

221
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:02,920
So family relationships, agency motivation, problem solving, self regulation, self-efficacy, you know, faith, hope.

222
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,560
There's a lot of people who look at religiosity, for example, as protective factors.

223
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,309
Making meaning of your life may be related to that sometimes routine rituals, engaging in school,

224
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:24,580
connecting with communities, anything that she kind of leaves off that list or other other features you guys could think of.

225
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:36,990
That could help support child development, especially from a public health standpoint, that kind of big picture standpoint, that's at table two.

226
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:51,140
She could have covered it all, but. I think people would add.

227
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:10,900
Yeah.

228
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:20,350
Well, I was thinking about I think it's discussed in other articles, kind of like the vertical community hubs and like the health care like structure.

229
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,320
Yeah. Yeah. So I would say and I love and Marston.

230
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,210
She's awesome. She's a psychologist.

231
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,990
But like, no health, no, like health insurance, like social determinants kind of don't really figure in some of this.

232
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,070
I'm sure she's thought about those, but she doesn't kind of put them up front.

233
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:46,940
And I think that's what's really cool about linking this stuff that's very processing developmental science,

234
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,930
psychology based with these broader pieces that do come up in other articles.

235
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:59,120
Yeah, I feel like there's no like basic needs or like basic necessities, like food and stuff.

236
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,259
So obviously if they're like hungry, I don't think you can really be worried about your resilience.

237
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,210
You need to get your next meal for, like, just basic necessities, like food and water and housing.

238
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,320
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

239
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:18,350
They, I think, like, like some of the ones that she covers, like connections in a well-functioning community.

240
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:24,310
I think that's like with the basis that, like, you are in a well-functioning community, I'm going to find that to like what I'm saying.

241
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,200
If you're in a community where some of those things are not there, then like those connections are probably not going to sit.

242
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,470
So and I would agree like that point does cover a lot.

243
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,170
So maybe it's sort of assuming these kind of more basic needs are in place.

244
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:45,950
But I think it is interesting that it's not kind of called out in that list because I think, you know, a lot of us,

245
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:54,200
if we have that kind of like public health hats on, we would say, oh, these things are actually really deeply foundational for child well-being.

246
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:00,340
And then on top of that here, all these resilience factors that we can we can think about too.

247
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,790
So, um, I think it's just good to kind of keep those both in mind.

248
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,739
And I feel like that came up a bit in the film the thing but that mom,

249
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:14,120
when she was talking about just different supports and we've talked about like child tax credits and,

250
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,310
you know,

251
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:24,170
policy changes that give money directly to families or give money to families and better in terms of specific benefits like food stamps or wick.

252
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,190
So there's lots of those different basic need pieces that kind of in the definitely

253
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,150
in the traditional kind of resilience literature are really not discussed.

254
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,010
So I think that's important to kind of call out in this class because we're gonna have a couple.

255
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:52,250
So thinking about that what might like a resilience and find kind of practice look like for public health public health practitioners.

256
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,030
Versus kind of more of a trauma informed.

257
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,370
And we've talked, you know, and again, just like it's an idea to sort of muse through because we've talked a lot about trauma informed,

258
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,710
but what would sort of putting a resilience informed spin will play.

259
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:20,360
Yeah. I mean, you try to take like a strengths based approach and drawing and thinking about the like short list of common resilience factors,

260
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:29,540
like maybe trying to utilize those as a form of a way to bolster public health initiatives or like universal.

261
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:41,110
How dare. Those specific actions are whether good for community or family or a sense of belonging or meaning making, how that can be used.

262
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:48,639
Yeah. And I think, remember, like you said, you start out saying that the parents matter and then with remember the mom power intervention.

263
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,100
An important part of that intervention is like bringing in your support person, like whoever that might be.

264
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,260
Where's that in your kind of broader context?

265
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,530
And I think even going to like the find intervention, right, the scientists like hovering.

266
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,900
You could look down that short list and sort of think about ways to engage maybe a parent

267
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,850
who's in that kind of find intervention about these ideas that are on this short list,

268
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,490
like, you know, sense of hope. What is meaning making to you?

269
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,220
You know,

270
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:29,770
kind of exploring what that individual has in terms of these these short list factors and that has like they have stuff or they don't have them,

271
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,929
but like where they are on the short list factor.

272
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:45,380
So I think in public health, this is not necessarily the like this word is used a lot, but I feel like this process isn't quite like fully ingrained.

273
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:51,490
Even though we talk a lot, we do talk a lot about trauma informed and that's good and I think that's a good start.

274
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:58,840
But I think this could be like the next wave of really trying to integrate this resilience process,

275
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,080
thinking into entire different intervention spaces.

276
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,940
Yeah, I've had thought that's not fully finished,

277
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:17,709
but I still struggle a lot of like some of these practices is they still even outside of a support of like a practice or whatever it may be,

278
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:22,750
it's sole responsibility is still focused on an individual or like the family.

279
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:30,760
And so I'm trying to think of like, what would the practice actually change to be like when thinking about resilience

280
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,749
informed versus like something that would be on the practice responsibility,

281
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,490
not necessarily something that would that extend to having the individual have to do something.

282
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:47,200
So kind of like how the policy in the film had talked about like they changed like the policies around incarceration for youth,

283
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:53,200
like something like that where it's like they wouldn't actually need to do anything about it as an individual.

284
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:05,290
Yeah. So that would be a very great like again, public healthy approach or a setting based accident maybe.

285
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:11,800
Caroline do you say space based and sort of thinking about building supports in a space

286
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:20,140
and kind of infusing more of a resilience informed perspective in the support systems,

287
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,599
like you said, Jackie,

288
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:32,170
in a way that the individual would not have to be as not as much responsibility rely on the individual for like fighting upstream around that.

289
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:40,060
Would you have a thought? Just like as this society has become more individualistic,

290
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:47,530
I feel like this has become more and more of a problem just because there's no connection between like you, yourself and the community.

291
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,530
So like at some level, people are going to have to start taking this.

292
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,840
Possibilities for what's happening in their communities.

293
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,860
And I don't know how you make people do that.

294
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:06,900
Yeah, I don't either. Well, and I'm also just kind of reflecting on when we watched the child care movie.

295
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:17,220
That's another one where that's like a big space where we can think about infusing some of these practices in into child care.

296
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:25,740
But right now, child care is even more of a crisis than it has been in the past few decades because of COVID.

297
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:33,810
And so there's a lot of opportunity, but it's it's that individual versus social,

298
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:38,879
you know, public good debate that will play out again in the child care space.

299
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:46,560
And I think that that's why I kind of harp on resilience not being an internal individual trait.

300
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,680
It's really it, you know, depending on sort of your context,

301
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,739
we have to build resilience in those contexts where people exist, which I know sounds very vague,

302
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:03,540
but if you think about it in terms of specific settings and like programs we might be involved with kind of taking

303
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:11,820
down this kind of short list and figuring out are there ways that I can infuse these short list kind of goals or,

304
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:20,670
you know, practices into the setting could be a way to start to become more resilience informed in our programing or program delivery,

305
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,939
because I think we've also talked a fair bit about parent blaming and this certainly is sort of along that line of parent blaming,

306
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:36,540
right, for saying that parents are the ones who are buffering child resilience.

307
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,770
Then if the child is not resilient, do we blame the parent? And so it's just resilience is a tricky concept in this way.

308
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:55,740
Uh, let's see, um, let me move a little bit to talk about intervention stuff and I'll keep an eye on time.

309
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,190
So this, like I mentioned,

310
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:09,839
this was this reading was really kind of just this overview of these different interventions that have been used out there and what is really cool,

311
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,870
I think, and potentially powerful.

312
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:19,230
And this is back to this idea of like what what can we do to kind of shout this science from the rooftops?

313
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:27,030
What we know is that so not every intervention impacted like stress biology, but some did.

314
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:34,440
And they were all these behavioral interventions that are focused on parenting support, the kind of things that we've been talking about in here.

315
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:43,530
And they actually could change biology. And I think we will talk about more more about this with regard to child care.

316
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:50,610
But when you get change on sort of biology through a behavioral intervention,

317
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,780
that seems to matter a lot to policymakers, to decision makers in general.

318
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,749
And so I think it's a really powerful message to say, hey, this parenting intervention where we, you know,

319
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,979
focused on supporting parents and show them about sensitive parenting and they parent to

320
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:13,140
their children more sensitively in those early childhood years that actually changed,

321
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,310
you know, the child's biological stress response.

322
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:27,210
And so parenting is this really powerful context that we can support that has impact on, you know, a health kind of outcome for children.

323
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,819
And so we'll talk more about this with the child care stuff.

324
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:40,250
But they say in the film, and I often say, like, in order to sort of get the policymakers of the economists involved,

325
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:49,469
you have to show like some sort of hard outcome. And it's like if you do the brain changes or stress biology in terms of a biological

326
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,850
outcome that tends to carry a little more weight than the that if we say like,

327
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:03,570
oh, the, you know, children were rated differently on questionnaires after this intervention, people are somehow sometimes less convinced by that.

328
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:11,160
So again, from that, like trying to get this message out there piece, I think that that's where that's helpful.

329
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:16,980
And then this hopefully should not and should not surprise folks,

330
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:23,010
but the ones that had more impact in this early years were focused on parenting and the were early intervention.

331
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:29,970
Also, the kids who got families who had a higher engagement or higher dose of the intervention benefited the most.

332
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,830
So that's like a really nice result.

333
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:39,299
Again, to say, oh, you know what, two sessions may not be enough, because what we know is that if you do engage in more sessions,

334
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,400
if you need it, then you'll have stronger outcomes in terms of this intervention.

335
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:51,000
And then this was again, this is this policy statement that's about.

336
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:00,610
Just sort of summarizing a lot of what we've talked about, but in a handy dandy place to talk about why relational health, this is what that means.

337
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,270
Safe, stable, nurturing relationships like attachment relationships, but a little more broad.

338
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:12,830
That's a sort of nicer frame than a toxic stress frame that we've heard a lot about in recent years.

339
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:20,420
And why it's important is that it matters for reducing the impacts of sort of

340
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:28,520
toxic stress and community supports can build that resilience in the parent,

341
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,500
child or caregiver child relationship across different settings.

342
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:43,370
And that community supports peace is really important in terms of that kind of resilience in the community or in the context and framing.

343
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,680
What else about that AP piece?

344
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:59,060
I know this one is kind of well, it's long, but it's got a lot of like, you know, these are short action point paragraphs.

345
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:08,150
And one thing I was going to say is that for those of you interested in this space and in the pediatric space in particular,

346
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,059
there are certain like subgroups of pediatric practitioners who are really out in front on this issue.

347
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:23,450
And I think it's really exciting. And I would say like, watch this space, because when this statement came out,

348
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,840
like sitting in this classroom, I'd be like, Yeah, well, of course that's all we talk about.

349
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,049
But like people were like, Oh my gosh,

350
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:38,570
this is huge because it was really centering those early relationships in a way that like hadn't kind of been put forth before.

351
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:42,080
And like, if you guys remember that video on the first day, it was like that.

352
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:50,540
AP You know, it's very powerful and we have this monument building and all this stuff and sort of like link early relational health

353
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:58,610
with that I think is actually really cool and really powerful and it's a way to sort of connect these ideas to,

354
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,670
you know, the professional organization that's really concerned with child health.

355
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:09,260
Right. Okay. Um, let's see, this is also talking about intervention.

356
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:14,570
This is similar to that triangle we were looking at before with like the early intervention up here,

357
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,469
you know, really focused the test for baby down here.

358
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:22,700
So it's just another way to represent those ideas. But this is from that paper.

359
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,730
And so they're talking about, you know, again,

360
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:32,150
this public health approach to prevent childhood toxic stress is a public health approach to promote relational health.

361
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,690
So it really explicitly links those ideas.

362
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:41,690
And again, this kind of hadn't been done before. Here's a bunch of acronyms.

363
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:47,900
And as you guys start really researching different interventions, maybe for papers,

364
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,550
there's like thousands and millions of acronyms out there for different interventions.

365
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:57,350
And so these are mostly parenting focused interventions.

366
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:05,380
So C is the attachment and biobehavioral catch up intervention ABCs, great acronym PCI,

367
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,370
that parent child interaction therapy that I think I've talked about before where that a therapist has like a,

368
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,680
it has a microphone and it's like telling parents with a bug in the ear what to do next in this interaction with their child.

369
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:24,650
And that's actually shown to be pretty effective. It's very intensive, right?

370
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,969
Like that's not going to happen on a daily basis as you're like running around, you know, in your life.

371
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,370
But parents come into the lab and interact with the child.

372
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:43,430
They get this coaching in their ear and it sort of changes parenting behaviors from sleep that might be conduct disorder, prevention, I'm not sure.

373
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:52,040
And then this is trauma informed CBT. So probably a lot of people have heard of CBT and that's much more of this sort of idea of individual

374
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:58,760
reshaping the way you think about events in the world and connecting that to how you behave.

375
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:08,059
Because CBT is a huge intervention, really used in lots of different ways, starting to be used actually.

376
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:18,560
John Peet, who's in this department, has a project looking at and it was like this, but it's like text based CBT and sort of mobile health,

377
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,080
CBT approaches and then trauma informed CBT is kind of trying to overlay that, you know,

378
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,570
what happened to you, what's in your background that is sort of helping to contribute to this.

379
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:36,020
We talk about in CBT like disordered thinking and but it's very individual, right?

380
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,499
And then sort of as we go up the scale.

381
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,600
So this is this idea of like you have strained or compromised relationships and here's how we're going to prepare them.

382
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:51,490
This is this is like where we spent have spent a lot of time like parent and child aces social determinants of health to.

383
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,780
Within the public health frame.

384
01:01:54,670 --> 01:02:02,290
And sort of this is the idea of targeting interventions for people who may be experiencing toxic stress due to a social context environment.

385
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:08,320
And then this is this universal prevention. So positive parenting play.

386
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:16,150
We'll talk about incredible years a little bit more later, but that's sort of in that space as well.

387
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:26,350
Borrowers reach out and read, which is the national program for promoting reading from early in development in pediatric settings.

388
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:36,739
So I think this is another helpful table where you're thinking about, okay, what, what developmental issue am I thinking about?

389
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:43,780
It may totally not be relational, have to be whatever, but where's my level of intervention and you know,

390
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:51,760
what interventions have maybe been used to do this and sort of you could bring in relational health, but you don't have to.

391
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,880
This is just in the relational health set of examples.

392
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:06,160
Okay. And then I just wanted to walk through that. McCoy one this is that like one pager piece that's just talking about.

393
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:19,109
I would look at these steps and say that their very core public health HBC steps, so co-create these interventions with local stakeholders.

394
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:24,960
So like what do local stakeholders or whoever you're working with and I know I guess stakeholders is now not a good terms right now.

395
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,800
So it's my, my ideal of that.

396
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:35,440
But what outcomes are values like what outcomes are value by the community that you're working with?

397
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,079
Then what kind of inner intervention strategies would you use?

398
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:49,570
So if you think back to this table, we're kind of starting with like, okay, relational health doesn't have as a valued outcome,

399
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:57,400
but what kinds of strategies even across these three levels might be welcomed by the community that you're working with?

400
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:07,030
And then of course, importance of valuation. And of course, even though we don't do this, even though we adopt interventions all the time,

401
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,110
maintaining transparency about how we might adapt interventions.

402
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:18,909
So again, those of you who have ever done intervention research or delivered interventions or been

403
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:24,310
involved in programing like we know that this happens all the time adapting interventions,

404
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:29,020
but we're not always so good about documenting and being transparent about all the changes.

405
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:34,090
And I would say there's a balance here between like adapting something that is

406
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:38,820
evidence based and like making it work with the community you're working for.

407
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:44,799
And I think that's a really important part of that article is that it sounds like there's evidence based that was

408
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:51,040
like maybe tested on this population over here and then we adapted it to make it work for this population over here.

409
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:57,220
I would say like, that's not bad, right? Like you're just making it work for your population.

410
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:04,840
But you do you then still have to test the, you know, gather the evidence that what's working for the new population, if that makes sense.

411
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,830
So you conduct evaluations with your new population and your new intervention.

412
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,790
You're not doing exactly the evidence based one that you started with,

413
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:19,629
but you may have more staying power, sustainability, etc., with the adaptive intervention.

414
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,650
But that's often a really tricky process and I think it's just important for

415
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,430
highlighting the transparency of what we're doing when we're adapting interventions.

416
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:38,350
Okay. So, you know, kind of talking about trauma, resilience, intervention stuff.

417
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:47,320
And so thinking back a little bit more, we've got to be able to talk about intervention, seeking interventions.

418
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,479
Okay. So kind of reflecting themes like the babies movie with the, you know, for different contexts,

419
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:02,020
the resilience movie, the best intervention in that reading from last time about these sort of goals.

420
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,740
These would be like the goals that we'd maybe be moving towards in an intervention with kids.

421
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:14,830
What do you think? Would the potential sort of, you know, challenges or things you'd have to think about, you know,

422
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:20,559
maybe adapting like I was just talking about to something like Miss Kendra to keep it sort of stick with that example,

423
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,360
like this idea of like writing letters.

424
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:33,790
And this is really important, like this example in schools or, you know, for example, in schools serving diverse families of varied belief systems.

425
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,500
That is like critically important right now. That's like ripped from the headlines.

426
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:43,269
And this I you know, I wrote this question a few years ago.

427
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:49,239
Right. I did not write that yesterday. But this is what's going on right now in terms of schools and education systems.

428
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,049
So. Like if someone wanted to implement Ms.

429
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:59,210
Kendra in a school, you know, that is.

430
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:09,950
Not friendly to thinking about kids in trauma or stress, for example, like what what challenges of like how we might, you know,

431
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:17,560
how might we like start to think about how we would overcome the challenges of implementing

432
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:23,320
a program in a school that's serving diverse families with very varied belief systems?

433
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:34,059
Any ideas? This is like really, you know, you could put critical race theory into them.

434
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,360
This can where you could put like, you know, reading varied books there you can talk with the poet,

435
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:45,489
like talking about, you know, the fact that transgender youth might possibly exist in this space.

436
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:52,690
Like you could put a lot of different things that would be controversial in that space. So what do you guys think?

437
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:02,830
Like, Would this be a helpful thing to engage personnel, parents, policymakers about how to do that?

438
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:12,070
But they didn't mention in the movie, like, these kids are showing this stuff or at least recruiting them.

439
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:19,320
It's not like a framing attempt. So I guess just telling parents like they're talking about it anyway,

440
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:30,110
like this is a third attempt at trying to like make it useful and age appropriate, like it's in the parents and definitely it is.

441
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:39,700
Lots of those things I just mentioned all are some people are trying to like stamp it out of the common the discussion.

442
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:45,999
Yeah I guess one thought I'm having is that in the movie they also said that

443
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,920
like people don't want to recognize or think about like kids having a problem.

444
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:56,130
I think a lot of people just don't think about kids in that way, even though they do and kind of like smoking.

445
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:04,570
I think what you had said about it earlier about the one of the seminars in the movie where like they just made everybody like fill it out.

446
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:09,000
And then it was like we're having these realizations of like, Oh yeah, I didn't want these.

447
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:14,170
So in a way, like, your parents are having a lot of backlash to having those kinds of conversations,

448
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:19,719
like, I guess involving my parents, really anybody else who is against it and saying like,

449
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,920
that's just kind of like having a workshop and you keep having a feel of this for a movie like,

450
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,840
look, this is your score and you were like reflecting on your own childhood.

451
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,510
So kind of like trying to relate that to like this can be happening to like your kids and that there's nothing

452
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:39,070
wrong with like talking about that because that's only going to like help them have like better outcomes.

453
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,629
So I don't know. Yeah, that's kind of not a fully formed thought but yeah.

454
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:47,680
Yeah that some way of engaging and I certainly yeah.

455
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:59,290
I don't know. Right. But absolutely like that idea of kind of engaging in the topic and this topic went off on like current events,

456
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:08,709
but this topic feels possible to kind of engage parents and especially with, with COVID.

457
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:13,040
Like, could we turn that to our advantage having lived through all of that, you know?

458
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:18,129
Caroline Yeah, I really like thinking about like, for example,

459
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:25,030
like inserting critical race theory there like and also maybe addressing like misconceptions that parents might have.

460
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:30,069
Like especially misandry hasn't been as politicized, but I know what race theory has.

461
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:38,559
And I mean, you're not like literally teaching critical race theory, like in elementary schools or middle school.

462
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:48,550
So maybe just like having like a common knowledge of what actually is happening and like trying to combat some misinformation could be useful.

463
01:10:49,000 --> 01:11:02,930
Um, I don't know how effective that would be, but. And maybe like I think in the way that Miss Kendra or some of the aces.

464
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,320
Like in the film or through that questionnaire how it kind of.

465
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:18,200
Illustrates what is actually happening and what kids are actually experiencing or thinking about and saying,

466
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:28,210
you know, here's what's facing a lot of kids. A lot of this can sort of kick off all of these stress responses.

467
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:33,880
And so we think these are important goals, you know, for these goals to be achieved.

468
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:43,059
Here's what we know might be helpful. And that could be things like, you know, like what what would kick off the sort of stress or trauma?

469
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:49,150
I guess maybe that's way of a way of thinking about it. But it's it's really hard.

470
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,090
Like I said, I totally don't know the answer here,

471
01:11:52,090 --> 01:12:02,460
but I think that thinking through what's causing a lack of this in kids and maybe starting with COVID and the experience that that,

472
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:08,799
you know, many kids have had with COVID has sort of challenged these things.

473
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,780
So how do we build these things up in kids and how do we get these?

474
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:22,210
Stakeholders and vested parties to, you know, work on behalf of kids with regard to this.

475
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:30,580
Jennifer, now, I mentioned earlier a comment you made about like policymakers often being driven by like concrete results.

476
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,450
And I think even in the film too, they address like they give percentages about like improvement,

477
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:38,099
like reduction in fights and stuff like they did in elementary school.

478
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:44,589
And they also implemented mass control for all high school and like they saw drastic reductions of like violence in the school.

479
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,490
And I think, like, that might be a way to engage policymakers for like wanting more.

480
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,880
They're more results driven and been wanting numbers.

481
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:58,749
I think about like, yeah, there may be some some complications about like what specifically gets addressed in the curriculum,

482
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:06,240
but maybe like seeing like how effective it can be may sway some people to see like we're actually seeing concrete things we're measuring with,

483
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:14,980
with this program, with this great idea that to that like importance of evaluation, burns of data, different sources of data.

484
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,650
This is great. So I would say we will discuss this more.

485
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:28,809
And it's I know it's a lot so much. And I will say this is sort of shift like it's shifted a little bit, not entirely,

486
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:33,459
but it's become more prominent just in the relatively few years I've been teaching this class,

487
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:39,820
this idea of just division, misinformation, like it just split with everywhere.

488
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:51,430
But it's it's so critical because of what we know in terms of what's good for kids when kids are harmed, what kids are harmed by, etc.

489
01:13:52,660 --> 01:14:04,630
So let me switch a little bit to just we can end on this note, but this idea of figuring out interventions for our paper.

490
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,959
And so I think you can draw from lots of different sources,

491
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,680
but certainly if anybody has like had experience working with programs that they either were like, Oh man,

492
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:26,200
this program would be so much better if this or just programs that you were interested in, things you went through as a kid,

493
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:32,270
even like the programs that you remember participating in, you're like, What the heck was that?

494
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:40,839
We'll talk later about some programs like that and adolescents and also kind of research evidence based programs.

495
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,410
And consider and this is a way you could like talk about what to improve in your paper and that like final intervention paper.

496
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:53,710
What populations were these programs tested with and like what do we need to kind of do next and project first point like

497
01:14:54,400 --> 01:15:01,090
what more data can we gather to show that these programs might work in the new population and then in what settings?

498
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:07,300
So like what settings and who delivered? Those are all the things to kind of be musing about for interventions.

499
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,390
And then I just put a bunch of links here for you guys.

500
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:20,410
If you're not, you know, if you haven't kind of searched around in these before, but there's a few key places just sort of to start.

501
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,680
And these are interventions that just sort of have had, you know,

502
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:34,480
federal funding usually been tested in broad swaths of the population at times and have some promising evidence behind them that they work.

503
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:42,579
And so from the NIH site, I can pull it up, but there are a few different lines of programing.

504
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,990
So like Bright Futures is a lot of programing around kind of childhood.

505
01:15:47,440 --> 01:16:02,679
The U.S. Preventive Task Force that's that us PTF they're they're a group of mostly medical and public health professionals who review this, you know,

506
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,390
the state of the literature in the state of interventions and research on different interventions

507
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:14,110
and make recommendations at like different tiers of recommendation for different interventions.

508
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:25,870
The community guide is the CDC, one that they they pull together a lot of different, you know, findings from a lot of different interventions.

509
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:32,650
Blueprints is sort of a child violence prevention focused site that pulls together a lot of violence prevention interventions.

510
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:38,320
And then the California evidence based clearinghouse is also another good site to look for.

511
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,709
Again, like what interventions are out there? What do they focus on?

512
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:44,560
Do they do school achievement? Do they do violence? Do they do parenting?

513
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,020
Like what in the world of lots of different child focused interventions do they do?

514
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:59,040
And these are good places to start. And then the Cochrane reviews is just like a state of the art evidence on this topic.

515
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:08,409
So I just wanted to like leave you guys with these links that you can go to and

516
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:15,390
this and I each one like contains I think the community guide that might be the.

517
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:18,929
Only when there's a bunch of you know, as with that, there's a bunch of links in them.

518
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:25,040
And I say, but that's a good one to sort of start that and actually see.

519
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:30,330
I just thought I had pulled it. Oh, I don't think I did get to pull it up.

520
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:33,850
But let me just show you guys for one quick second. Sorry.

521
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:45,230
And then this is kind of all in service. If people have questions and stuff about paper and they're like, I don't know what to do.

522
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:48,970
I'm sort of interested in this. Where do I go from here?

523
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:52,630
Definitely reach out and let me know. And this is like what I mean.

524
01:17:52,660 --> 01:18:02,260
So this this sort of evidence based practices and programs like across the board and again, for just practical knowledge,

525
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:08,500
you might need to know what interventions are out there around whatever carrier you're working in.

526
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,809
And so here's Bright Futures.

527
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:22,360
This is like clinical guidelines and a lot of different information about child and family, kind of different areas of health, etc.

528
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:34,690
Where's the community guide? Those of you in HPT have needed to look at the Healthy People 2030 guidelines I think for other things.

529
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:38,470
And then, okay, here's a community guide. Sorry, this is a good one.

530
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:48,070
So you can search here topics and interventions that are like broadly on those topics and it takes a little bit of digging.

531
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,310
So I would say like the more specific search terms the better.

532
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,540
But also just, you know, cruise around and here a little bit.

533
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:03,040
I think it's helpful because you can look at like these big, big picture things and obviously not all, not all, not all our kids.

534
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:20,380

535
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:27,640
I wanted to also just highlight again, happy to meet with people and talk about papers.

536
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,690
I've met with some people also the week, the Thanksgiving.

537
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:37,870
You guys don't have class in here. And so if people are around, I will be around if you want to meet and discuss paper.

538
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:49,330
And then just another plug for the speech writing lab on either paper and then just ideas for avoiding unintentional plagiarism,

01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:57,400
