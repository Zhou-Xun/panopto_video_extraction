1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:25,790
What? I don't think you're great advice, but it's not conducive to go there otherwise that you have to.

2
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:39,220
Sherlock, somebody like you.

3
00:00:43,830 --> 00:01:25,740
Well, I think you need to take the time to think that you're going to have to matter so much to you here.

4
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,300
And we're going to review where we are.

5
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:57,390
Just want to remind them that the 33 m this morning, it seems that the economy is similar to the midterms.

6
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,910
You know, it's a calculator out and they provide music and Spotify.

7
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:22,530
Anthony Weiner points. I don't work for 45 minutes while the comprehensive but again it's like I have the spouses but you have that study guide.

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,870
No. I mean, the question part is the second half of the semester,

9
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:35,670
but you definitely need information from the first of all, you don't know how to draw any out.

10
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,030
That's going to be a problem right there.

11
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:51,150
We're going to review what we learned this semester, hopefully, although we all know actually in the back of your mind,

12
00:02:51,510 --> 00:03:14,780
given that, I'll make sure that I go back to some of my lessons on a calculator, any regular calculator, I need calculators.

13
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:25,730
And he was not allowed to use your phone. I had one calculator that functions.

14
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,219
Right. All right. So let's get started and start from scratch.

15
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:48,370
The one. So in chapter one, we start with the basic definition of probability.

16
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,970
So that's everything I started off with.

17
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,020
And so we talk about the set of operations, right?

18
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,850
That operation is really the foundation for probability and the counting process.

19
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:15,580
So that operation. And in.

20
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,870
Compliments of the patient.

21
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:38,280
And from that operation we talked about the counting process and think about we have to talk about how to do the counting for sampling,

22
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,940
with or without replacement, with or without ordering.

23
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,380
And so our different kind of accounting, we provide the formulas and the reasoning how to do those counting different set up.

24
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,540
And there are many samples and once we define it sense that operation the counting we

25
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:05,250
talk about probability which is essentially defined based on 33361 is sample space.

26
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,260
One is event and one is the probability.

27
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:32,490
So we three we have this probability space, the probability we find out that event space and and for probability in particular,

28
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,870
we need it to satisfy the so-called axioms.

29
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,180
All probability is now recall the overall.

30
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:54,490
Yes. He.

31
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,200
Overall axioms of probability content.

32
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:11,730
Three important items are the probability of the sample space is always equal to one second.

33
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,860
The probability of any event is always greater. Zero, always non-active.

34
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:25,850
And third. What is the third third axiom felt on about the additively?

35
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,870
Right. If you have a set of events you want infinity that are mutually exclusive,

36
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:55,980
then we should have the probability of a union if it is yet to be equal, any probability of each event coming out of a carnival activity.

37
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,300
And we also talk about finite activity and it's not equivalent.

38
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,850
So the first function to be a probability, we do need this carnival.

39
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,459
It becomes the common world axiom as a function.

40
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:26,370
Satisfy all three conditions then is a probability, and from there we can talk about the calculations of probability.

41
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,690
In particular, we talk about all events.

42
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:42,900
That is essentially a set. So we have the set operations, how to do the calculation of probability of this source on this operation self sets.

43
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,010
And there are two important inequalities.

44
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:56,400
One is the force inequality and one is the variety are.

45
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,070
What does inequality size the possibility of the union?

46
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,160
It's always lost to this nation of individual probabilities.

47
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:28,170
I of ironic probability of a party inequality to one on one side is the fourth inequality.

48
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,060
On the other side.

49
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,670
Some of this API finance some of.

50
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:57,950
The unions. It starts in class and notes the kind of high school approved and the details of this,

51
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,380
the inequalities, those are important inequalities that we have talked about for years.

52
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,090
And from there, we talk about a conditional probability. All right. Regional.

53
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:26,800
And also independence. And when we talk about independence, there are two kinds of independence.

54
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:37,060
One is a mutual independence. One is terrorizing the French, which follows later on be extended to the random barrels.

55
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:49,960
This is a first place one way to introduce this notation of independence or dependance for this or probabilities or these events.

56
00:09:50,830 --> 00:10:02,320
And recall that definition of independence is if you have p b equal to pay times p b, then we say A and B are independent.

57
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,590
A probability of A and B is equal to the probability of eight times the probability of B.

58
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,300
Then that's kind of the same idea applies for the transferable.

59
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:27,310
So if you kind of some random variable rules here and a conditional probability of type even B is defined as to be over 80.

60
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,490
That's also the foundation of how we define a conditional distribution going on about our roles later on.

61
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:42,280
And using this conditional probability and independence. We also have the two important theorem.

62
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:58,180
One is called the Total Probability Theorem, and the other is the total probability theorem.

63
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,980
If you recall, that gave you a way to calculate the probability of event.

64
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:11,770
If you can easily evaluate the probability of conditional probability of that event, given some quotation of the sample space,

65
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,220
is that you can use this total probability theorem to easily calculate the probability of the event.

66
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,310
And the veteran, on the other hand, deals with this sweet ordering of two events.

67
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,239
You have probability of any given B, but you are really interested in probability of being given.

68
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,100
A Then you can think about use in the. I know that.

69
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,950
Then what does this does with the order of the two events as conditional release?

70
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:51,250
That's the probability. And in chapter one, we also talk about a marvelous.

71
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,520
And. Later on, of course we talk about different property.

72
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:08,879
Also random variables generalizes to the multivariate space but really an of you know at the very foundation

73
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,230
of this random variable is just imagine if not the original sample space through the real space.

74
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:26,010
That's what a random variable random variable is, a mapping real variable function as you know,

75
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,060
by the function that matched the original sample space to the real space.

76
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:44,970
That's really what variables not every single event to in number, right.

77
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,700
So you can write the random variable regrets meeting.

78
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,540
You should write the random variable as if in the function form is a function of this.

79
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,069
Events are possible outcomes, but in process people typically draw the properties.

80
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,350
Just use X or Y or some letter to represent a random variable,

81
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:16,080
but what they really represent is a map function and with that we can define the probability.

82
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:24,720
With that we can transfer the probability in the original sample space to a probability function that is on the real space.

83
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:37,799
Even the variation that the probability of fact along to some viral set in the real space is defined as a probability of all these outcomes,

84
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:51,780
such that Max of W is in this or set, and that's how we define the probability in the real space.

85
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,160
This is our original probability function in our original sample space.

86
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:06,180
And with these relations we have the probability probability function in the real space, and now we have the probability of the random variable.

87
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:13,980
Everything's all right. So we also talk about the ways to define fusion for the random arrow.

88
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:24,630
You see the idea and the CDF is more universal, but any random variable you can always define.

89
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:30,960
Cydia, a cumulative distribution function. I recall the property function.

90
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,250
I just write continuous from 0 to 1,

91
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:45,950
right in that suppose that infinity you have zero in NASCAR Xfinity you all want to stop monitoring non decreasing and that's

92
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:53,940
the cap function and see how uniquely we find the distribution of a random variable as if it's a continuous random variable.

93
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:02,850
Then you can also have the PDR function probability density function if it's at this point random, a piano probability mass function.

94
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:10,890
Those are our statistic functions that define the distribution for the random variable.

95
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:24,210
And so that's that's the chapter one mostly is just the introduction of probability and some key definitions that we can

96
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:40,030
use for subsequent more complex than we talk about in more detail and talk about the transformation of our game in random.

97
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,769
Marvel at this point is going to be a random variable.

98
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,460
We can define a version using CDF, CDF, PMS.

99
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,980
What about it? Transformation of this random variable?

100
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,480
How do we got that distribution transformation of a random variable?

101
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,140
So that's what we talk about in chapter two.

102
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:12,050
If you spot Y to the g of where G is that transformation, first of all, we notice that Y is still a random variable, right?

103
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,510
So axes are marking the right number, but it's a mapping from the symbol space to the real space.

104
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:26,040
If you composite it with another function, t is still a mapping from the sample space to the real space.

105
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,890
In that to this Y which is a transformation of x is still random variable.

106
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,160
And then we talk about how to derive the distribution of Y.

107
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:56,400
So the basis is that. Anywhere else that a the probability of y belongs to a is equal to the probability of action belongs to j inmarsat.

108
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,270
That's really the foundation of how we derive the distribution for what we want about the distribution for y.

109
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,620
I need to know if this g inverse function of course here that the of is that is in the general sense.

110
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,760
I specifically mean it's a monochrome function that has numerous but in the general sense.

111
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:26,070
Okay, so if you can define one g inverse as you can use this probability to quantify

112
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:31,020
the probability of Y any parallel set and activate the distribution of line.

113
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:40,230
And more specifically, we have this nice properties if G is monitor, right?

114
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:49,379
So these relation can becomes a famous explicit formula for the CDP or not for

115
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,800
the PDF or PM of this g function or for this Y run of Oracle in particular.

116
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:09,240
If we do these moments when we have Y of why the PDF of Y is equal to x to numerous y times,

117
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:21,870
absolute value of the derivative of this universe works on y to support of y.

118
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,970
So that's the generic form of our for a monitoring transformation.

119
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,680
This formula to derive write out the pdf for the transform random variable so you can say all I need

120
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:43,650
is the original PDR and this inverse transformation and also the derivative of this transformation.

121
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,590
Here, I need to pay attention to this support.

122
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,790
I recall how we define a support for the original random variable.

123
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:08,970
A support is defined as the a region where this PDF or PM is greater is greater than zero, and if all the transform random variable,

124
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:16,440
a support is defined in a slightly different way, since you do not know the PDF or PM or Y directly.

125
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,920
So that support is based on X, based on the support of x first support of back then.

126
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,180
Based on this transformation, you define the support for life that's not really supported by this transform random variable.

127
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,350
These idea function only applies to Y in the support.

128
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,550
And also we have a slight generalization of this result.

129
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:50,180
That is when g is piecewise small ensemble and satisfies some additional conditions use.

130
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:06,160
We also have. A generic form in our formula for this pediasure function.

131
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:16,540
A lot of detail here, but it can refer to the lecture notes or the specific conditions and the specific expression of this PDA.

132
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,650
So that's how we got the distribution for this transform random variable.

133
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:39,790
And another important component of chapter two is we talk about this expectation of errors and more general moment generating functions.

134
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:51,510
In particular, we define key expectation of key has to be the integration of these attacks.

135
00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:00,340
That's the X or continuous variables and place this integration by summation or discrete roundabouts.

136
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,140
So that's how we define the patient. Now, of course, you need to check.

137
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,510
The existence of that expectation and to make sure that the expectation of this absolute

138
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,150
value object is lost to infinity in order to fully define the expectation of teams.

139
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:35,710
And similarly, the variance of acts is defined as an interpretation of x minus x squared.

140
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:46,630
And we also have some nice alternative expression of the balance, which is x squared minus x squared.

141
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,520
So later on we the lot of application of this equivalent expression.

142
00:21:52,330 --> 00:22:00,610
So that defines the expectation of variance, which is which corresponds to the first order and second on our moment for the random variable and.

143
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,880
And we talk about the properties of this expectation on Barron's in particular.

144
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,580
Excitation is a linear operator, right?

145
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:18,340
So if you have made X, well, we want to calculate expectation of that.

146
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:30,700
That is equal to eight times the speed of that expectation as this linearity of the Barron's study.

147
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:40,470
And so to calculate the balance of hands of speed, what does that imply to that?

148
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,240
His words, a square. That's right.

149
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
So that is the property of Barron's.

150
00:22:50,280 --> 00:23:00,550
It's not linear. If I could find a random variable with a constant, then you can take that up, take that content out, and you have to square it.

151
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,390
And if you add or subtract, that comes from the right.

152
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:15,630
It doesn't affect the balance. That's because the variance really just measures the random variable if you shift it right.

153
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,370
If you just shift it, that does not affect the spread of the roundabout.

154
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,420
Adding or subtract that constant doesn't really affect the balance.

155
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,870
So that's to me and Barron's and we can further generalize as to higher orders.

156
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,560
But instead of directly calculating those higher order moments,

157
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,440
we introduce that notation off the moment generating function which is defined or a

158
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,400
random variable as the moment generating function is a function of t t around zero,

159
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,610
which is the specifications of e to the power of p assets.

160
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:09,280
And so that's the definition of moment generating function. And we only care about t in the neighborhood of zero.

161
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,910
Okay. And think about why that's called the moment to moment generating function.

162
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,200
How is that related to the moments of the run of our blacks?

163
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:29,810
It's essentially if you take that. Ah.

164
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:38,550
I think the hours are derivative of this moment generally and function and evaluate t zero.

165
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,400
You got the hours moment for the random variable.

166
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,090
That's why it's called the moment to moment generating function.

167
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,060
Okay. So these are as any integer.

168
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,230
One, two, three, four.

169
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:03,230
That's why it's called the moment generating function because once you know this function of form, you can easily got all the different moments,

170
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:09,630
all different at the moment, all the random variable by just taking the derivative and evaluate does zero.

171
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,170
So that's chapter two. Again, just focus on the universe, right?

172
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:25,190
About all but defined in the more general sense, talking about the transformation of the random variable as well as different moments,

173
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:35,400
moment, general function for the ground roughly. And then in chapter three, we talk about different distributions,

174
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,960
different distribution families, and the reason why we want to introduce those families.

175
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:46,920
First of all, many distributions that we typically come across in practice.

176
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:56,910
We share very similar forms, so we can use in the general format the countries, those different distributions and put them in the same family.

177
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,060
So it's easier to study those distributions.

178
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:10,770
And second, for different distributions for different distribution families, there are specific properties that we can take advantage of.

179
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:22,470
So that's why we define families of distributions in the first place and in a family of distributions is controlled by a parameter,

180
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:34,500
by some parameters. By varying those parameters, you got different distributions in the same values and we start from the described distribution.

181
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:52,640
It's. So the first discrete distribution that we talk about is the discrete.

182
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:06,750
Uniform distribution, which means you have equal probability of sampling from a finite or a infinite or finite

183
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,490
number of items and that actually have very close connection to the counting process.

184
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:22,470
Because if you have this quite uniform distribution, you have equal probability of sampling from the outcome.

185
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,800
Then at the end of the day, if you want to evaluate the distribution or you want to calculate the probability,

186
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:35,040
it boils down to this counting process that has very close connection to the counting process.

187
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:48,450
And then we talk about another monumental discrete distribution, which is called the No Distribution or P.

188
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,990
So optionally running parallel only takes two possible outcomes zero and one,

189
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,400
and this parameter P defines the probability of the run available taking value one.

190
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:10,830
But that's very simple, right? Honorable. But it's the building block of a lot of more complicated random animals.

191
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:19,230
And in particular, it's the building block of the binomial roundabout, which have two parameters.

192
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,760
And an owner is the number of independent trials and is the success rate.

193
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,489
Each trial, essentially a binomial random variable,

194
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,340
can be considered as a summation of an independent or normally run a variable with the same property.

195
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:47,910
So that's binomial. And also this Bernoulli is also related to the geometric distribution.

196
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:02,010
You. With parameter P to recall that geometric distribution.

197
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,010
How we construct a random variable follows a geometric distribution.

198
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:17,970
Essentially we're counting how many trials do we have to perform apart without before we got one six?

199
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:26,740
That's right. So that's the geometric distribution and there are different ways of defining out.

200
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,200
You'll have a distribution if I don't count that final success.

201
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:44,550
I've lost my model for how how many such how many seniors you have before and in practice,

202
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,690
for example, which version of this you'll have a distribution,

203
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:58,830
say, or pharmacy because using different versions you have different farmers playing arm for you mean barrens and pdf cd such.

204
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:10,290
And that's closer relative to potentially around environment because it is still a sequence of independent Bernoulli only trials.

205
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:19,680
Each time it's either success or failure. So you're just just interested in the number of failures before the first success.

206
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:25,380
And if I take that one step further and not give you that negative binomial.

207
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:45,830
Contains two parameters. Which is an AP so that the way that enacted binomial is a relative geometric it is is that of counting how many

208
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:54,680
years you got before the person says now or how many counting how many trials you have done before the P's success.

209
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:05,420
In other words, you be there. If it is a success, it says it is success, and so on and so forth until you got the piece.

210
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,130
Success. Very interesting. Knowing how many tries.

211
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,650
You have to not be honest about that. Please.

212
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,070
Success or success?

213
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:28,340
Second, third and final normalization of your market don't I think can be considered as negative binomial with an equal to one.

214
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,780
Again, there are two versions. One is considering the last success as part of the run of Oracle.

215
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,450
The other one is not considering the last sentence.

216
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:52,340
So I run a variable that we talk about in the discrete space is the first one run of both on around available.

217
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,889
The support is from 012 all the way to infinity, all these non-active integers, but for some random variable,

218
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:09,680
the plus on distribution is commonly used to model counts of counts are zero non negative integers.

219
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:24,170
You can also consider Palsson distribution as an limit of the binomial distribution by taking them to infinity and a zero times p goes to a constant.

220
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,780
That constant is the same lambda for the limiting clause on distribution.

221
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:41,480
So there is a relation because to later all accrue this limiting behavior different ways we can prove it using the PDF or CDF or some other ways.

222
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:54,020
But at the end of the day, what we know is that the limit of binomial is poisson and goes to infinity, goes to zero and times P goes to one or so.

223
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,890
And there are a couple more distributions that we talk about.

224
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:10,680
One is the hyper geometric. One is multi nominal.

225
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:17,570
Okay. So the hyper geometry is slightly more complicated.

226
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,730
The way they are introduced, that is using this two by two table computer,

227
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:32,540
you have a urn with tantalum balls and all of them are red and the remaining are white.

228
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:42,890
If you draw a random sample, small n, so the remaining and minus capital n minus smaller is not drawn.

229
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:57,380
If you draw without replacement of a similar size small and then the rhinovirus is defined as how many red do you have in this small examples.

230
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:08,819
Then that. Number and number of recalls out of this small number, smaller than balls that are following a distribution.

231
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,580
And that distribution is called hydrogen after distribution.

232
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:23,730
And so as you can see, this distribution is defined by these three quantities and and small within three quantities.

233
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,910
That distribution for us is already fine.

234
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:39,060
This actually is useful in some hypothesis testing scenario, which is now the focus of this course of hypothesis testing.

235
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:52,410
You can use this type of geometric distribution to get the p value for this testing and multinational distribution individualization of binomial.

236
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:07,050
So you have parameter and you want to p let's take it out of the multinational distribution means

237
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:15,780
if you have Tenenbaum file each file perhaps hey possible outcome one took with probability p one.

238
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:22,080
Hey, you want some p two some p three? All the way to be okay is equal to one.

239
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,360
Then what is the distribution of that? Possible outcomes in trials?

240
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:37,470
Multivariate random variable multivariate is quite vulnerable and we provide the PDF or PR in this case for

241
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:46,290
this multivariate is free rhinovirus and that is actually used later on when we talk about our statistics.

242
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:56,230
As multinationals multinational. So all of those distributions falling into the category, all these great distributions and.

243
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:06,560
We also have a bunch of distributions that are continuous run of our continuous distributions.

244
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:16,430
Again, the first one simplest this one is a uniform distribution denotes many variables.

245
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,410
We have PDF and CDF on container front about all one of them.

246
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:31,640
One of them is is the probability. The PDA function looks like a constant on the support of this random variable.

247
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,140
So what that means is the probability of the random marvel falling into into each small intervals,

248
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,940
equal as small intervals in that region, always have the same probability.

249
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:53,629
When we talk about a container is around about a one thing to pay special attention to is the probability of the running variable.

250
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,020
Taking out a particular value is always zero, right?

251
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:03,710
If it continues, it means the right allowable taking on a particular value always have probably zero.

252
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,110
So it doesn't make sense to talk about it, right?

253
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:16,430
About about taking any particular value is that you should interpret the result in that in a different sense.

254
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:27,110
Okay. So later on we use the, the technique of multiplying our small box right to that PDA function and then we

255
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:32,120
can translate that to quantity and all that kind of thing at the proper load.

256
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:44,420
But without that, does the PDR function itself? The value of the PDR function does not imply probability that but very important to remember.

257
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:56,770
We start from a uniform and then talk about normal distribution, which is defined by two parameters MI one Sigma Square.

258
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,100
Normal distribution plays a critical role in statistics.

259
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,740
It's a leader only in Chapter five. Hopefully you already got a sense of how important normal is, right?

260
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:16,260
So all of these are some topics that we have talk about are all normal distributions and is fully defined by these two parameters,

261
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:26,550
the mean and the virus. The moment is being statement squared and the normal is connected to many distributions and is connected to the distribution,

262
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,570
to the AFT distribution and to the Chi Square distribution.

263
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:40,860
And our t about Chi Square, we all have degrees of freedom and think about how these actions really are.

264
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,950
Okay. We provided the PDF idea of this different distributions, but more importantly,

265
00:38:47,340 --> 00:39:01,080
what I want you to to know is that how a now run a marvel or how a hit and run a marvel can be expressed equivalently using our run variables.

266
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:10,980
Particular, we know to say one is a cold chain distribution.

267
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:21,040
All right. So T one that's already x one over square root of two square.

268
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:35,180
In this case, the virus is one. So. You are.

269
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:46,460
It's a clever distribution to have someone over to absorb and respond to our independent standard distributions and top distribution.

270
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,150
There is also such equivalency, right?

271
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,020
And for the Chi Square.

272
00:39:52,070 --> 00:40:01,340
Essentially, Chi Square wants to grow its freedom and is the summation of an independent standing of all running Marvel squared.

273
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,920
That's not relation between this available empathy and the Chi Square.

274
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:20,460
And now we talk about the exponential distribution. This prime column that.

275
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,480
So the mean and the Barrons, the pdf cds of this distribution.

276
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:35,060
Remind yourself what those are and from exponential distribution.

277
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:46,570
Analyze it to gamma distribution with two parameters Alpha, beta and exponential distribution is a special gamma distribution.

278
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,200
Very particular. They are alpha beta to be to be sometimes.

279
00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:03,720
Okay. So you got this a generalization and both have the support from the candidates and also another distribution.

280
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,350
It's called the beta distribution. Also have this two parameters.

281
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:16,160
B and beta is defined on 0 to 1 generalization, not be uniform.

282
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,090
And it also has a connection with the common distribution. The uniform is a special way to distribution.

283
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:38,090
And there were some additional distributions like logging normal or double exponential, but those are sort of out of second order.

284
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,230
I mean, second rate. Importance.

285
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,879
So these are the most important distributions we're getting.

286
00:41:47,880 --> 00:42:02,760
If any of this is unfamiliar or you can get about some details of this of these distributions, make sure that I go back to check our next four notes.

287
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,010
Okay. So that's chapter three and not no new materials.

288
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,620
Mostly that's a review of what we learned in the first two chapters.

289
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:20,550
But it was very specific forms for this different distributions.

290
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:29,889
So we call that a we derive that a pdf CD PM PMO means the balance over and over again,

291
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:37,860
but it's different distributions in those derivations that are one particular technique

292
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:45,540
that we have for practice or use over and over again is how to simplify that summation,

293
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:56,280
an infinite summation or integration. One common trick or one common technique that can be very helpful in simplifying

294
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,690
the calculation is by noticing the kernel of a particular distribution,
