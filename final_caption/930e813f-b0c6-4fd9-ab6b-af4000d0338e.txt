1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,360
Exactly. She was in mental.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,530
Okay. So good morning, everyone. Sorry about the delay.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,660
Trying to get the Panopto to record.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,850
So I think you'll have at least an audio made. Hopefully the video would kind of be captured with the audio, but you will have the slides.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:34,319
I didn't post them on canvas. So if you want to download them and kind of follow with Dr. Wendy, so you'll know, I'm sure we have Dr. Wendy Allman.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,070
We're excited to have her. She's going to be talking to us today and next Tuesday.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,510
She's a clinical professor of internal medicine and human genetics.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,300
She's a genetic counselor to a clinical coordinator and a former president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,510
So this is one of our first LC issues and we're so excited to have them through it.

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,190
And good morning to you. And actually, I will clarify, I am not a physician.

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:17,760
I am actually a genetic counselor and and proudly got my master's degree here at the University of Michigan back in the 1980s.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,449
So I'll let you do the math there. So can you hear me?

13
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay, everyone? Great. So today's focus is going to be on genetic counseling.

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,060
We'll talk a little bit about the importance of family history.

15
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,910
And mainly what we're going to do is talk about different types of genetic tests and their uses,

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,500
and we'll focus some on newer technology of genomic sequencing,

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:53,070
which is not so new now because we're almost at a decade and we'll talk about the complexities of genetic testing and direct to consumer genetic test.

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,130
And then next week is going to be really focused on the LC issues.

19
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:07,559
But in order to set the stage for that, I need to kind of make sure you understand different types of genetic tests and their uses.

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,070
But this gives you an idea of what this week is and next week is.

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:22,310
And so really the goals today are that you will learn about different types of genetic tests in their uses and then also have

22
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,900
an understanding of the complexities of genetic testing and some of their challenges with implementation into health care.

23
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:43,190
And I'm very proud of Michigan's roots here as the really you know, back in 1941, we had the first genetics clinic in the country.

24
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,280
And I think actually in the world it does depend what institution you're at because University of Minnesota,

25
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,840
another U of M, also had a clinic that opened up at that time.

26
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,070
But since you're here in Ann Arbor, I think it's fair to say that we were the first.

27
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,610
And I think there is some debate about that.

28
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:11,930
And you can actually if you look on the on the left there, you can see the words heredity clinic on the on the on the doorway there.

29
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:20,719
And it used to be a place where medical students lived, but it was deemed unsafe for their living situation.

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:30,960
And so it got converted into the clinic there. And so genetics clinics see patients of all ages,

31
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:41,290
as you can see from kind of prenatal pediatric adult and patients may be may have symptoms or may be completely healthy without any symptoms.

32
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,810
And so on the on the left there, I'm just showing an ultrasound of a pregnancy.

33
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,200
In the middle, I'm showing a child with Down's syndrome.

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,130
And on the right, I'm showing an individual with Huntington's disease, which is a neurological condition.

35
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,090
And so just to introduce you to some of the patients that may be seen in the genetics clinic, I say this is Jan.

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,130
She's 36 years old and pregnant. And she wants to know her risk to have a child with Down's syndrome and find out about prenatal testing options.

37
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,849
And so, as you can see there on the right,

38
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm just showing how the risk of having a child with a chromosome abnormality like Down's syndrome increases with the age of the mother.

39
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:33,710
And on the bottom left, I'm showing you a tube of blood, because we can now do prenatal screening with with the blood sample.

40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,180
And then in the middle, there is Chorionic Villous sampling, which is a test that can be done at ten weeks gestation.

41
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,620
And over on the right is amniocentesis.

42
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:53,240
So the with Chorionic Phillips sampling, you're taking a sample of placenta which has the same makeup as the genetic, has a developing pregnancy.

43
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,880
And then over on the right is amniocentesis, where you take a sample of the fluid that surrounds the baby.

44
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:06,860
And there's a lot of skin cells that are growing soft off some skin cells that can be used.

45
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,300
So here you go. We also see patients with a genetic condition.

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,260
And so what do you notice as you look here, the three individuals in this in this slide?

47
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:33,019
What do you see? They're really tall and have long limbs and long limbs.

48
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,860
Tall and long limbs. And so that is associated with the condition called Marfan syndrome.

49
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:48,259
And it's as you can see here, it's a genetic condition that affects the connective tissue in the body, including the heart, eyes and skeletal system.

50
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,879
So it can lead to kind of detached retinas.

51
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:02,870
It can lead to aortic ruptures. And so that's why, for example, Isaiah Austin, who was a promising basketball player,

52
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,960
had to stop playing basketball because he could not risk the potential rupture to his heart.

53
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,080
And what I want to show you there on the left where it says positive exposure.

54
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,960
I'll show you in a moment a website where you can see other photos of individuals with genetic conditions.

55
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,080
And what the cool thing was about positive exposure was that the whole idea of capturing people,

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,430
living their lives as opposed to in black and white photos, kind of scared and in doctor's offices.

57
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,490
So early onset Alzheimer's disease is another condition that we see.

58
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,120
So as people age, it's, you know, that people have a risk for developing dementia.

59
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,390
And the most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.

60
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,190
But usually people that develop Alzheimer's disease, it's going to be in their seventies or eighties.

61
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:07,130
But it turns out there's an early onset from individuals to develop Alzheimer's disease, even in their thirties and forties and fifties.

62
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:14,180
And that happens about 3 to 5% of the time. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, actually.

63
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,210
So does Marfan syndrome, where if a parent has the gene change, it's going to be a 5050 chance of passing it on.

64
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,160
And so there actually was a movie. I don't know. Did anyone see Still Alice?

65
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,100
You can get it on Netflix, but it actually you did. What did you think of it?

66
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,299
It was really nice to see how Alzheimer's can happen.

67
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,500
I was really young age like was the 65 year old and.

68
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,590
How the family were buried scares Alzheimer patients.

69
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,250
And because the notion is now awake once you get old, like about 70 years old, like.

70
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
Alzheimer almost inevitable, but happened as a very young age.

71
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,950
It was interesting to witness how someone I think I think and I think it also kind of certainly portrays some of the

72
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,859
family dynamics and in times watching your your parent have a condition and then realize that you're potentially at risk.

73
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,280
And do you want to know or not know? Yeah. As well.

74
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,240
I think it had some famous actresses like Kristen Stewart.

75
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,440
Okay. What do you notice here as you look at this pedigree?

76
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,670
So squares are males and circles are females.

77
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:42,240
And what are you picking up there as you look at it? Start with the condition.

78
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,280
What condition do you see? Breast cancer.

79
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,160
For me, breast cancer. Any other cancers that you see.

80
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,110
Ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer. And do you see it in one generation or multiple generations?

81
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,149
Multiple. So it's looking like an on a civil dominant condition.

82
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,340
Again, 5050 chance of passing it on.

83
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:19,110
And so this was actually a history that I reconstructed by getting on the Internet and and looking up the individuals.

84
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,340
And so, as you can see here, this was actually Angelina Jolie's history.

85
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,100
Which makes sense about why she decided to have prophylactic surgery, given that she had a mother, maternal aunt,

86
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,390
maternal grandmother, maternal great grandmother and maternal uncle, all with cancer and all with cancer at young ages.

87
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,140
So kind of are these ages of onset younger than is typical?

88
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:54,530
And the answer is yes. So here is about positive exposure,

89
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:04,490
where I got the photo of the child in the water and I got a good daddy who was actually a fashion photographer, kind of.

90
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,710
He was photographing, like, top models in the world, and he decided to turn his lens on individuals with genetic conditions.

91
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,740
And you can see kind of the philosophy behind his work is change how you see and see how you change.

92
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,019
And you can go there. There's wonderful photographs. He's got blog posts.

93
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,400
He's got ambassadors. And he also has a studio in New York.

94
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,310
So turning to genetic counseling, which is the field that I work in,

95
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,980
the short definition is it's the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical,

96
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,270
psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease.

97
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,010
The longer definition kind of talks about the process of genetic counseling,

98
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,390
which is what we do is that we collect and interpret family and medical histories to assess the chance of disease, occurrence or recurrence.

99
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,060
We provide education about inheritance testing, management prevention, resources and research.

100
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:15,280
And then really what it is, is it's shared decision making. So what we do is we present patients like here are the different options that you have.

101
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,290
And it's really up to the patient then to make an informed choice consistent with

102
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,590
their values and culture and to also help in terms of adapting to the condition.

103
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:37,710
And probably no surprise that genetic information can result in all sorts of kind of psycho psychosocial responses.

104
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,530
And that's part of the goal of our field as well, is to help link people up to supportive resources.

105
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,670
And I think it's really important to recognize and this is where like the quote by Lori Andrews is that

106
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:57,120
the existence of genetic information within a family may create or destroy bonds between relatives.

107
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,530
And there's a documentary that I'm showing up there at the top called In the Family,

108
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,570
which talks about a family's journey, for example, with hereditary breast cancer.

109
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,600
And so when people come to be seen in a genetics clinic, often the questions they have or,

110
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,719
you know, do I have or am I at risk for a genetic condition?

111
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,810
And what is my risk? What is known about the condition?

112
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,240
What health problems can be expected? Are there options for care and testing, and what is the risk to other family members?

113
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,080
These are just some of the typical questions.

114
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:37,070
Obviously there are many others in terms of people available with the expertise to answer their questions.

115
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,120
There's not that many, especially when you think about genetics.

116
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,090
It's going to be about all of us. If you take a look here and I just looked yesterday, it was last updated, though,

117
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,140
a year ago that in terms of physicians that have the training in clinical genetics,

118
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:05,540
it's less than 2000 of the PhD pathway was discontinued several years ago and genetic counselors, I said over 5000.

119
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:14,930
I'm pretty sure it's now over 7000, but I couldn't I know that verbally from from from talking to people in my field.

120
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,209
But it's not I didn't find that figure in in writing.

121
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,880
So that's why I kept it with the greater than 5000.

122
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,070
The issues are, though, is that the genetics providers are not evenly distributed throughout the country.

123
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,070
They're concentrated more in some of the larger cities and in academic medical centers.

124
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,799
And, you know, so there's also, like I said, a limited number and then they're not even distributed throughout the medical specialties.

125
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:54,020
So when you look at the physicians that are boarded in in in genetics, most of them are pediatricians.

126
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,170
So question. I, I've seen that as far as like being a specialist in genetics.

127
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,950
They were a pediatrician. But if they're also listed under like neurology or gastroenterology,

128
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,540
does that mean that they're only specializing in those fields for genetics, or are they doing that overall?

129
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,459
That means generally that's the specialty, you know. So in other words, they may or may not be board it.

130
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,120
It double boarded there because there are very few people that have gone on to get double boards.

131
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,029
So, for example, Elena Stoffel here directs the cancer genetics program.

132
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,879
She's a gastroenterologist. She's definitely has expertise in genetics, but she's not bought it in genetics.

133
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,420
She's bought it in GI. Actually, we have a couple of people like that and also in endocrinology, same thing.

134
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,850
So because people over the years in cardiology too, I mean, we just have different, you know, practitioners that are I'm sorry,

135
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,940
health care providers, physicians that have because of the nature of their clinical work and potentially their research as well.

136
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:02,820
I've just gained a lot of expertise in genetics and are still viewed as the genetics expert, but are not necessarily for double boarded in the field.

137
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,800
So. I should have probably given a heads up to.

138
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:18,410
I am doing this talk on less than 4 hours of sleep because my body is somewhere between California and the Midwest.

139
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:28,580
I actually was last week at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting that was held in L.A. It was our first in-person conference in three years,

140
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,290
and there were 7005 attendees from 84 different countries.

141
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,550
But needless to say, I did not sleep much, and my body is still adjusting to the three hour time change back here.

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,990
So next week I'll definitely be more awake. So I think I'm doing okay.

143
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:54,020
So genetic counselors, we are masters degree level trained health care professionals with expertise in medical genetics and counseling.

144
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,410
And actually, Michigan had one of the earlier programs.

145
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,170
The first program was launched at Sarah Lawrence College in 1969, and University of Michigan launched their program in 1979.

146
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:19,880
And so we actually, as a society, we celebrated our 40th anniversary back in 19 I'm sorry, back in 2019.

147
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,340
And so the National Society of Genetic Counselors was established in 1979.

148
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:33,530
And I am not of the wave that the first wave of counselors that established the field of the kind of what I consider the second wave,

149
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,360
because I entered the field back in 1986. And so actually what you'll see here, I'm up there at the top.

150
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,590
I was given the honor of presenting on the past.

151
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,600
We had a TED like talks at our national meeting.

152
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,790
It was the scariest presentation I've ever given because it was two over 2600 genetic counselors.

153
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,020
And we were allowed in the Ted, Ted, Ted talk format.

154
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,529
We could not have notes and we could not have slides. So I gave a ten minute talk, and that's the most I've ever memorized, I think.

155
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm pretty sure. So. I do want to point out, too, that genetic counseling has spread internationally.

156
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,930
Certainly the majority is here in genetic counselor practitioners are here in North America.

157
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,650
But as you can see, Europe, Asia, Australia.

158
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,370
That's my dream. One day is to visit Australia, Africa.

159
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,890
The counselors are, like I say, all over the world.

160
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:46,020
And if you want to kind of learn more, I've just kind of included some sites here which have both resources and also some short video clips.

161
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,720
And in fact, you can actually watch some genetic counseling sessions.

162
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:00,150
These are kind of, you know, mock sessions, but they are done for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.

163
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:07,680
A prenatal session for abnormal screening and pediatric section of session for long UTI syndrome.

164
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,580
So you can you can you can actually watch videos of these. And I've included the link below, which I checked yesterday.

165
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:22,200
So it does work. And so I just want to note, too, that patients are seeking to discuss genetic tests and concerns in genetic testing,

166
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,990
not just in genetics clinics, but also in specialty clinics and also in primary care.

167
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,380
And it's certainly expanding as we continue to make advances.

168
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:40,950
So turning to genetic testing, I mean, we talk about genetic testing at really one of the most informative tests is your family history.

169
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,610
And so what is typical to get in genetics is what we call a three generation pedigree,

170
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,170
which means that we obtain information on your first, second and third degree relatives.

171
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,540
And so your first degree relatives are going to share 50% of your genetic makeup.

172
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,150
That's going to be your parents, your siblings and your children.

173
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,760
Second degree relatives are going to be aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandparents, grandchildren.

174
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,370
And third degree relatives are your first cousins.

175
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,140
And why do we care about family history is because genetic conditions have different patterns of inheritance.

176
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,320
We talked about some of the autosomal dominant conditions where there's a 5050 chance of passing it on.

177
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,299
Some conditions are autosomal recessive, meaning that both parents have to be carriers.

178
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,020
And when both are carriers, there's a 25% chance to have an effective child.

179
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,940
There's X-linked conditions where females are carriers and males can be affected.

180
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:44,890
Mitochondrial conditions and just complex inheritance, which is a combination of genetic and environmental.

181
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,280
So many different patterns. Oh, X-linked dominant.

182
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,820
So I could go on and on about the different patterns of emergence and just point out how important family history is.

183
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:03,970
The Surgeon General launched a family history Family Health History initiative, and this has been around for a while now.

184
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,720
But the idea is that that you would collect kind of copies of your collect kind

185
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,420
of family history from your family and generate what they call a pedigree.

186
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,610
And so there's literally an online tool to help you do that called My Family Health Portrait.

187
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,150
It's been translated into different languages as well.

188
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,520
And the other reason we care about health, family health history is this is a good month to think about it.

189
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,950
And you can see that Thanksgiving was established as National Family History Day back in 2004.

190
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:47,950
So the idea being that, hey, as you're gathered with family over the holidays, it's a good time to ask people what their health history is.

191
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,729
A couple of years ago, I put together a talk where I had, okay,

192
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,560
here are questions you can ask during appetizers for ones you can ask during the main meal.

193
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,530
And here are ones probably shouldn't ask until you've had a couple of drinks.

194
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,460
But knowing again, you know, what what conditions run in the family, given the fact that our genetics is shared,

195
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,960
can be helpful in terms of figuring out what screening may be important for you to do.

196
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,530
So I keep adding images to the slide on genetic testing options.

197
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,540
As you can see there, you know, blood samples, the middle is skin sample.

198
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,380
And over in the right is the chorionic sampling, the middle row.

199
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,660
You see someone with the cheek swab. On the right, you see amniocentesis.

200
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:41,520
On the bottom, you see pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. And then on the far right, on the bottom, there, you see spitting into a tube,

201
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,060
which we've all become more familiar with, with Copen, but is also a way that you can do DNA testing.

202
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,470
So genetic tests are different from other medical test.

203
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,430
So medical tests are going to be done usually to detect a current medical condition.

204
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,940
And whereas genetic tests can be done on a healthy individual to determine a risk for a future condition.

205
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,610
And we'll come back to predictive test in a little bit here.

206
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,000
Genetic tests made first need to be formed be performed on an infected individual before you can test the patient seated in front of you.

207
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:35,860
Genetic test results can have implications beyond the patient and can have an impact for the health care and life decisions of other family members.

208
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:48,340
And certainly there is a psychosocial impact of receiving genetic test results and the potential for stigmatization and discrimination as a result.

209
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,280
So there are several reasons, though, that we know that genetic testing is considered in patient care.

210
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:06,730
And certainly to establish, confirm or rule out a diagnosis to determine carrier status for a genetic condition which could impact reproductive

211
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:15,040
planning to enable cascade screening of at risk family members after a familial pathogenic variant has been identified.

212
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,900
And then, as I mentioned, it can certainly inform health care and life decisions.

213
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,540
And I think this is something that was put together by the National Human Genome Research Institute.

214
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,940
As you can see there, they're just showing, again some of the different, different uses,

215
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,259
which is what we're going to talk about in the next several slides that the genetic test,

216
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,930
the same genetic tests can be used for multiple reasons,

217
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:52,300
including diagnosing a condition in terms of predicting the future, predicting how severe the disease might be.

218
00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:00,670
We can only do that for some conditions where genotype and type correlations are known or the specific gene is known, known to be severe.

219
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:10,990
And we're seeing more and more information, too, about medications and looking into genetic markers for those.

220
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,299
And so helping maybe to say, well,

221
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:20,740
if you have if you're rapid metabolize or you need a lesser dose of this medication or you need more of a dose of your slow metabolism,

222
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,170
for example, and then.

223
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:34,280
Right. Newborn screening and other things. So when I started my career, I was all the way over on the far left.

224
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,980
So all that we could do is a lot of yep, we know the condition is genetic in your family.

225
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,110
We know your, for example, at 50% risk. There's no genetic testing available.

226
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:56,390
And now, as you can see, just look at the growth in genetic tests over all these years and also the growth in the number of labs as well.

227
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:09,160
So broadly, when we talk about genetic testing, it's the analysis of chromosomes, genes or gene products,

228
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:18,040
proteins to determine whether there is an abnormality present that is causing or will cause a genetic condition or disorder.

229
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:27,720
That's kind of the broad definition. And so what I'm showing you in those photos is I'm showing you chromosomes on the left.

230
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,930
And I actually started my career here at Michigan, working in the cytogenetics lab,

231
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,790
analyzing chromosomes, and then in the middle there showing you DNA.

232
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,140
And then on the right, I'm showing you kind of protein, like a biochemical test.

233
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,860
And not to get too deep into biology, especially at 9:00 on a post Halloween morning.

234
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,100
But you could think of our genetic information is packaged in structures called chromosomes.

235
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,050
Chromosomes are made up of smaller units called genes.

236
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,680
And it is our genes that code for proteins in our body.

237
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:11,040
So that's where you see the chromosome to the gene. To the proteins.

238
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,170
And that's another what I'm showing again on this slide here as well.

239
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:31,430
So I'm not going to say too, too much about biochemical tests, except these are what's kind of used with newborn screening as well.

240
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,650
But what they are is analysis of of proteins and enzymes, as you can see.

241
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:45,000
And a key one that may be better known to you is Phenylketonuria, also known as PKU.

242
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,980
And what you can see there is that there's someone that has this condition.

243
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,419
They don't have phenelzine hydroxylase. And so what you know, what happens is,

244
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:00,810
is that you get the buildup of the phenylalanine and the buildup of the phenylalanine is what causes the intellectual disability.

245
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,510
And this is just showing you, you know, when we think of looking at at chromosomes and looking at,

246
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,339
you know, all the way down to kind of single genes and a sequence change,

247
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:21,180
this kind of gives you that the different levels of of scale of variation that we're actually able to look at.

248
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,899
And so when we're looking at the DNA, the different changes that we're looking at is,

249
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,290
you know, if you have the normal gene sequence, is is there a change in that sequence?

250
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,490
And what can happen is there can be a change by adding in a letter.

251
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,329
So our DNA alphabet just has four letters, a cheese and T's, and so there can be insertions where something gets added,

252
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,620
there can be deletion, which sounds like it is, is that you delete a letter in the sequence.

253
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:58,040
Sometimes you can get a duplication, sometimes you can get an inversion, and sometimes you can get a substitution.

254
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,390
So those are some of the changes in the DNA sequence that they're looking at when they analyze a patient's sample.

255
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:16,580
And then chromosome analysis is what you're doing is you're looking at the chromosomes to see are there 46 chromosomes?

256
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:24,080
Are chromosomes come in pairs, 23 pairs, one is inherited from our mother and one from our father of each chromosome pair.

257
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:33,500
And what you see up there is that we can have we can have with the chromosomes, we can have more than 46, we can have less than 46.

258
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:42,350
We can have structural changes. We can have, you know, so there can be deletions, duplications, there can also be translocations and inversions.

259
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,379
And that's what you're going to see here on the slides and so doing.

260
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:54,470
Chromosome analysis, you know, back in the seventies, eighties, nineties, I mean, this used to be the first tier test.

261
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,790
This is what we had. But now a lot of the tests are being done.

262
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:05,809
rDNA based, this is just showing you that they're in addition to looking at the chromosomes,

263
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:13,520
we can do special staining and do something called fluorescent in situ hybridization to look for deletions and duplications.

264
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,750
And then microarrays also is a newer test.

265
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,550
It's been around longer than genomic sequencing, but it's one where we can look for micro deletions and micro duplications in the chromosomes,

266
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:38,430
so ones that you can't see by looking at the chromosome itself. And so with DNA based tests, we're looking at, again, changes in that DNA sequence.

267
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:47,920
And when I again started the career and going back again 20, 30 years, all that we had were single gene tests.

268
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,530
You could just look at one gene at a time and you couldn't do it for that many conditions.

269
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,210
And now we have multi gene panels. That's pretty much what we do.

270
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,560
Order in clinic each week. And then genomic sequencing is also being ordered more regularly as well.

271
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:13,250
That's the newest technology. And so, for example, coming back to someone with Marfan syndrome,

272
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:20,630
you could do just a single gene test where you look just for the fit religion, which is the most common gene change in Marfan syndrome.

273
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:29,330
Or you could do this is mostly what is done is often is a multiple gene multi gene panel that would look for Marfan syndrome,

274
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,180
but also related conditions that can cause aortic rupture.

275
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:41,220
Do geneticists or genetic counselors, do they also do gene therapy as well, or is that completely different?

276
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,000
That's completely different. Yeah. Then that's more in the research realm.

277
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,809
But yes. Do they still was that under the responsibility of the genetic counseling DHT or was is that also different?

278
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:00,600
Is that I would say the gene therapy. Right. Is more in the in the, you know, with researchers.

279
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,460
So probably, you know, probably kind of PhDs or M.D. PhDs.

280
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,769
But what you're raising is something that will potentially hold some promise one day.

281
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,670
And then there's all sorts of technologies and, you know, work that's trying to be done to see,

282
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,290
you know, I you know, I've talked about the different changes that we see in the DNA.

283
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,030
You know, so is there a way to use gene therapy to try to correct that change?

284
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:38,120
And so if you want to learn more about genetic testing methods, I just kind of put a reference here from Jackson Labs.

285
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:46,400
But turning to the different uses, so as you can see here, the same genetic tests can be done but can have multiple different uses.

286
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,410
And depending on which you use, it could raise different ethical issues.

287
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:04,000
So here are the tests that are currently offered on a public and on a on a population level, maybe of more interest here in public health.

288
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:12,490
But newborn screening, carrier screening, pregnancy screening, and then prenatal testing is offered to women 35 and older.

289
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:20,620
It also could be offered to women younger than that, dependent on their their on their family history.

290
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:31,740
So generally when we say when you're doing testing on someone that has symptoms, that would be consistent with diagnostic testing.

291
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,660
And then if you're doing testing of someone that's completely healthy, that would be considered predictive testing.

292
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:47,330
And so with diagnostic testing, it's being used to establish or confirm a diagnosis in a patient who has symptoms suggestive of a genetic condition.

293
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,050
Versus predictive testing is going to be offered to someone that's without symptoms that has a family history of a genetic disorder.

294
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,830
So, for example, the early onset Alzheimer's disease or hereditary breast cancer or I've been seen,

295
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,690
for example, individuals that have a family history of A.L.S.

296
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:15,760
And you can imagine just what it's like to learn that you have a family history of a neurological condition for which there currently is no cure.

297
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,480
But we'll talk about some of that next week and next week about why someone might consider that doing that type of testing.

298
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,270
And then carrier screening, as I mentioned, is offered pre-conception preferably,

299
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,150
but sometimes it's during pregnancy and we now have the ability to do expanded carrier screening.

300
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,410
So for over 300 genetic conditions. And why would someone might consider it is just that these are conditions that have

301
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,569
increased morbidity and mortality and so increased risk for intellectual disability,

302
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:56,460
birth defects and may be life limiting. And if both parents are carriers, then a pregnancy would be at 25% risk.

303
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:05,450
And so the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics issued the following guidance, as you can see,

304
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:13,910
just in July of 2021, that all pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy should be offered Tier three testing.

305
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:23,390
And so Tier three testing is, is for any conditions that have a carrier frequency of one or 200 or higher.

306
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,370
So noninvasive prenatal testing and IPT is analysis.

307
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:42,060
You can do an analysis of a blood sample of a pregnant individual and determine whether or not there's a chromosome abnormality present.

308
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,809
So in the maternal fetal,

309
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:53,830
in the maternal circulation are fetal cells and those can be amplified and and it can be terminated for some genetic conditions like Down's syndrome.

310
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,250
If it's if the fetus is infected with this.

311
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,910
So prenatal testing means you already have the you know, certainly have a pregnancy that's established that can be done.

312
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:15,390
As I mentioned, ten weeks gestation would be chorionic Billy's sampling, which is showing the left amniocentesis is in the middle there.

313
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,830
And then I have a blood sample because there's something called percutaneous umbilical

314
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:28,379
sampling where the sample of blood from the umbilical cord can be obtained to do a analysis.

315
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,080
But that's usually only done if it's there's concerns kind of later in pregnancy

316
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,680
when you can no longer do Chorionic Villous sampling or amniocentesis.

317
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:51,450
And then preimplantation genetic diagnosis is used with in vitro fertilization and involves genetic testing of early embryos prior to implantation.

318
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,220
It is a more costly procedure, and it's it's not not available at all centers.

319
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,320
And then probably everyone in this room has had a genetic test when you were born.

320
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,700
It's mandated by law. It was initiated back in the 1960s.

321
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:18,719
And as I mentioned, this kind of screams for like conditions like penalty to urea and other conditions

322
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,190
that can give rise to intellectual disability and multiple birth defects and can be,

323
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:36,340
you know, increased morbidity and mortality. And so I just put up here some resources so that you can see kind of the screen,

324
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:41,679
the conditions that are offered here in the state of Michigan on the bottom and then on the left there.

325
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,150
I have, you know, conditions that can be tested for that. You know what it shows in different states.

326
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:54,140
I will say this is one thing that I do find problematic is the variance in newborn screening that is offered.

327
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,989
I mean, it seems to me if one is born that the same testing should be available,

328
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:05,050
whether you were born in Michigan, California, Indiana, but that's not the case.

329
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:14,960
Turning to pharmaco genomic testing, this is one that's going to be certainly increasing in your lifetimes,

330
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:24,110
is that ability to be able to determine through genetic testing what medication should be prescribed for someone so that they get,

331
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:30,050
as you see there at the bottom, the quote is kind of like the right drug at the right dose for the right patient at the right time.

332
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,989
And you probably have had relatives or maybe even yourself, where you've been prescribed a medication that didn't work or there were side effects.

333
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,170
And so you tried another medication and maybe a third medication.

334
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,780
And so if you know here, you know, some of your genetic markers,

335
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:55,640
it might be helpful in terms of avoiding having to go through all that and being able to deliver the right medication first.

336
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,020
And so I just kind of came up with this drawing, like just kind of I was envisioning, well, someone with hypertension,

337
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:08,900
if there could be the hypertension DNA chip and then be able to, you know, based on the markers, be able to prescribe the right medication.

338
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,590
And so, as I mentioned,

339
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:22,410
it's kind of exciting times in genetics that we've gone really from testing for single genes to being able to test for multi-chain panels.

340
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,100
And what's coming around the corner is genomic sequencing.

341
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:35,040
And we already are ordering whole exome sequencing in the clinic and have also just started ordering up genome sequencing in the past year.

342
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,970
And I'll talk about what the differences are between those terminologies.

343
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:54,340
So here we go. So as I mentioned, you know, doing genomic sequencing, which we consider as a newer test, has now already been around almost ten years.

344
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,030
Next October. And so here you go.

345
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,140
This is actually just some drawings to try to get at the concept of what do we mean by exome sequencing versus genome sequencing.

346
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,450
And so exome is is really all the kind of coding parts of our genome.

347
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,889
And so it turns out that makes up just a small fraction of our genome.

348
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,220
It's only about 1%, but that's where the genes are.

349
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,490
So but it turns out you can have changes sometimes in the introns,

350
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,759
which can also result in genetic conditions so that you can think of the exons as being the

351
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,130
coding parts of the gene and then the introns as being the non-coding parts of the gene.

352
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:47,310
And so usually what happens I mean, what happens, I should say, is that introns are spliced out in making the protein.

353
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,430
That's what you see there at the you know, at the bottom when you're doing exome versus genome.

354
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,349
So genome is is excellent exome sequencing.

355
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,690
You're just looking at the exons genome sequencing, you're looking at the exons and the introns.

356
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:08,170
And so over on the right, what it's showing is that you can think of the exons as being just one slice of that orange,

357
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:20,020
whereas the genome is being that whole orange. And so I included here links to two stories where you can see this.

358
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,280
The first one here was filmed here, you know,

359
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:31,250
kind of at the University of Michigan and talks about a family where whole exome sequencing was used to figure out the child's diagnosis.

360
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,430
And then over here on the right, on the next slide, I have it's one in a million.

361
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,720
And this was a put together at Utah. This is about a ten minute video.

362
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:51,950
And it's very cool because as you can see here, the whole exome sequencing is actually a cover benefit now in Utah.

363
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:03,560
And so and actually it's covered here in Michigan as well by Medicaid for we can do here in Michigan in terms of access and equity to health care.

364
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:14,120
Infants that qualify can have rapid genomic genome sequencing done and is covered by Medicaid and it's covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield.

365
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,450
The only problem is, is that not all infants qualify. And I use the term in infants.

366
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:30,280
So not all not all patients qualify, but it is a start and I actually got to participate in September.

367
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:39,980
There was actually the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy had a webinar or had a webinar event on clinical genomic sequencing.

368
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,830
And and so in the first hour, they talked about the technology and then in the second hour,

369
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:55,220
they talked about the state of Michigan as a model because like I say, we offer coverage by Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

370
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:03,380
And so I had the honor of moderating a panel of people I had never met before on a topic I knew nothing about.

371
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:12,559
So I said, So what kind of criteria do you like look for to decide like an infant, like who qualifies?

372
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:21,350
And I think it's kind of in general, I think that the that the qualifications kind of depend on the child's features.

373
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,649
And, you know, whether it's considered, you know,

374
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:31,280
the urgency and trying to figure out a diagnosis and whether you're not able to do it by standard testing, for example.

375
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:38,540
And then obviously for Medicaid, it's insurance. It's going to be disqualified based under your insurance plan there.

376
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,310
But it's a huge step forward. The fact that Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield will cover it.

377
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:54,239
And the one in a million, the. I think what you appreciate about it is it turns out that the treatment for

378
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,770
the condition that the child had was literally over-the-counter medication.

379
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,710
So a vitamin. I think it was a take that you might want to look at that, but it was enough to help change some of the legislation.

380
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:15,350
So in terms of using genomic sequencing, it's really used more for diagnostic odyssey patients.

381
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:22,130
So trying to get to your question to again, it's more like if something is completely unknown.

382
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,260
And so with many possible differential diagnoses,

383
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:33,860
it's going to be more cost effective to do genomic sequencing than it is to do all the different tests that need to be done.

384
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,380
And also something is just, like I say, atypical as well.

385
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:49,070
And so as you can see here, exome sequencing became, quote, a first tier test in 2021.

386
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,950
And that's when when that's done that, when a professional organization says, hey,

387
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,790
this is a first tier test and that's going to help with insurance reimbursement.

388
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,050
And you might think, well, why is it not available to everyone?

389
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:12,640
And why is it so costly? And so it's really, you know, just as you can see, you're kind of a labor and time intensive process.

390
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:19,600
And especially, you know, in terms of doing the genomic analysis, that part's becoming a lot less expensive.

391
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,060
But the part that still takes a long time is how do you interpret those gene changes?

392
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:33,550
How do you interpret those single letter changes? And so that takes a lot of bioinformatics work and kind of going through the literature.

393
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:39,430
And the literature, of course, can be conflicting. And so making those determinations.

394
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,200
So if you're going to do kind of whole genome sequencing, everyone's going to have variants identified.

395
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,139
And so there are going to be variants of known significance.

396
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:54,220
And they're also going to be variants of unknown significance and variants of unknown significance known as V uses.

397
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,549
That's what where our profession deals with a lot these days. So you can imagine the challenges of telling a parent, you know, or a patient that,

398
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,810
hey, we found a change in a gene that is associated with your condition.

399
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,640
However, there's not enough evidence to determine yet whether it's pathogenic, meaning,

400
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,810
disease causing or benign, and therefore no medical decisions should be made to be made on that variant.

401
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,820
We shouldn't test other family members unless we're doing it to determine whether it's inherited or new.

402
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:32,090
But it's, you know, like I say, that it's not something that is can be used to influence our impact medical care.

403
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,750
And when I was at the ACG meetings last week,

404
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,870
there are studies that were showing that 75% and maybe even as high as 90% of

405
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:46,460
these variants of unknown significance are later class of reclassified as benign.

406
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,550
So you really don't want to be making decisions based on that.

407
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:57,380
And so that's why I said it's kind of the thousand dollar genome, which is what we're getting close to,

408
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:03,330
but it's really the million dollar interpretation, not quite $1,000,000, but that's just within the quotas.

409
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:12,080
And so the promises and challenges of genomic sequencing are not only are you looking for a, you know,

410
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:21,800
the suspected condition or trying to diagnose a condition, but at the same time, you could also pick up gene changes for cancers or for heart disease.

411
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:28,520
And so that's one of the things I want you to think about next week or in preparation for next week, is would you want to know?

412
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,220
And if you would want to know, you know,

413
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:38,360
what types of conditions would you want to know your your genetic status for and when would you want to know it?

414
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,610
And so, for example, this was an article that appeared in The New York Times.

415
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:53,620
And so here you go. This was someone that was 39 and perfectly healthy, but her grandmother had died young for breast cancer.

416
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,850
She decided to be tested for the BRCA one, BRCA two genes.

417
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:07,420
But, you know, she saw a counselor and she said, well, look, you know, you know, breast cancer is not just associated with BRCA one and BRCA two.

418
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,280
There are other hereditary genetic conditions that have breast cancer is a feature.

419
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,650
And so if you'd like, you could be tested using one of these multi-chain panels.

420
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,720
And so, as you could see here, she was thinking up, the more information, the better.

421
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,690
And so the results were surreal.

422
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:33,550
She did not have a mutation in one of the breast cancer genes, but she did have one that was linked to a high risk of stomach cancer.

423
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,089
And in people that have a family history of stomach cancer,

424
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:44,530
the mutation is considered so risky that patients who are not even sick are often advised to have their stomachs removed.

425
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:52,130
But what does it mean for someone like Jennifer, who has no family history of the condition?

426
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,780
And so and as you can see, it was a troubling result that her doctors have no idea how to interpret.

427
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,910
And so that's the point, is that a lot of the gene discoveries have been made in high risk families.

428
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:16,090
So what do you do when you're sequencing someone for one reason, but you find a gene change that could impact the risk for another condition.

429
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:24,890
And any thoughts there? No easy answers, but any thoughts?

430
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,729
Maybe before you test them, ask them how much they would want to know.

431
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:41,160
Like give them the potential things you could find and say even if there's no treatment, like how much would you want to?

432
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,460
And actually, you've nicely summarized what we do in genetic counseling, you know, usually.

433
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,580
But something like this is just totally out of love, you know, is it expected because you're doing a panel?

434
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:58,050
But it was completely unexpected because there was zero history of this in the family.

435
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:09,130
And that's why I kind of like this quote, that we are drowning in information, but we're starved for knowledge.

436
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:18,230
You know, it's that gap between we can figure out what, you know, that there is a change in the DNA sequence, but we cannot figure out.

437
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:26,390
Necessarily what it all means. And so you might want to play around with this.

438
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,980
You know, in the in the next week, I just put the link to one of these decision aids.

439
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,270
And when it gets out is kind of what what would be some of your preferences?

440
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:46,630
Would you want to know your chance of developing high cholesterol or high blood pressure or developing diabetes or developing Alzheimer's disease?

441
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,809
So you might want to just take a look at it and just think about it for yourself.

442
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,260
And like I say, next week we'll come back and talk about some of the A.L.S. issues.

443
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:05,680
So turning to some of the complexities, it was back in 2000 that they announced the draft of the human genome.

444
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,360
And I actually had the honor of being in the White House that day.

445
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:16,930
I am over there next to the person in purple, a slightly younger version of myself 20 years ago.

446
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:22,600
And I was president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors at the time.

447
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:31,690
And having grown up in Washington, D.C., it was kind of, as you can imagine there, it was pretty cool to be inside the White House.

448
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,019
And that's Francis Collins at the microphone,

449
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:44,169
who was actually a faculty member here at the University of Michigan and went on to direct the National Human Genome Research Institute,

450
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,290
which was the director of the Human Genome Project.

451
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,290
And then he went on to develop direct NIH.

452
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:59,920
And then over the past year, he was serving in President Biden's cabinet as the science advisor there.

453
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,540
But he has strong ties to the University of Michigan.

454
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,380
And actually he was also at ACG last week.

455
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,880
So. And then obviously behind him is President Clinton.

456
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,040
And next to him was Craig Venter.

457
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:25,450
And so there was kind of this race on the kind of the publicly funded nature genome sequencing, which Francis Collins represented.

458
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:35,460
And Craig Venter, who is on the private side. But they both kind of crossed the finish line after some negotiations in a more collaborative way.

459
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:44,590
So certainly with genetic testing kind of raises the issue of when is a test ready to be a test?

460
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,680
You know, kind of moving from research to kind of clinical testing here.

461
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:56,050
And certainly there are, as you can see here, different agencies with governmental oversight of genetic testing,

462
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,500
including the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

463
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:05,260
the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Trade Commission.

464
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,680
Or, in other words, the CMS, FDA, CDC and FTC.

465
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,209
And as you know, over here from school, public health, you know,

466
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,450
just that that's very important kind of the concepts of analytical politically validity and clinical validity.

467
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,410
And so just because you find a gene change doesn't necessarily mean that will result in disease.

468
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:36,540
And we also, as you know, have limitations in terms of being able to, you know, no test is 100% right.

469
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,660
There always are going to be false positives or false negatives.

470
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,460
And there could be a low positive predictive value or high positive predictive value.

471
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:50,820
But just being able to, you know, kind of like assess how good is that test.

472
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,770
And so, as I noted here, a change in the DNA sequence may or may not cause disease.

473
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:09,899
And that, as you can see here, there's this spectrum of gene changes ranging from benign and well-tolerated to pathogenic, meaning causing disease.

474
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,810
And then, as I put there in the middle, the variance of uncertain significance.

475
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,560
And when you see these variance of uncertain significance, often it's novel.

476
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,390
But the lab, as I noted, cannot determine yet its significance.

477
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,570
And then here are the limitations of a negative result, as you can see over on the left.

478
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,630
This would be considered a true negative, and so a true negative result is actually highly informative.

479
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,390
You know that your parent has a gene change for her entry Alzheimer's disease.

480
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,440
In this case, I'm seeing an increase in it. When one you test a child, they do not have it.

481
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:49,620
That child is in the clear, doesn't have to worry about hereditary early onset Alzheimer's disease.

482
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:57,570
But over on the right, if you haven't tested an affected individual and the person at risk tests negative,

483
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,249
you're not going to know if they're negative because they did not inherit the gene change from

484
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,050
an infected parent or they're negative because even if you were to test the affected parent,

485
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,530
you would not be able to find a gene change with today's technology.

486
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:21,800
In addition, we know that even if someone has a gene change, there's a concept called reduced penetrance,

487
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,300
meaning not everyone that has a gene change will go on to develop the disease.

488
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:34,250
And so, for example, someone with a BRCA mutation has up to an 85% chance of having breast cancer.

489
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:41,930
That means that 15% of individuals, even though they have a BRCA one gene mutation, will not have breast cancer.

490
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,980
And that's actually, you know, here I'm just kind of showing a pedigree where if you look at the male there,

491
00:54:51,250 --> 00:55:00,160
we know that he has to have whatever gene change it is there in the family because because his sister had it and sisters had it and his mother had it.

492
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,120
But clearly, he does not have symptoms. But his daughter does.

493
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,470
And so over on the right is just different genetic terminology,

494
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,230
to say that there are many different genetic factors that can influence whether a gene is expressed or not.

495
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,770
In general, too.

496
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:27,210
When we see patients in the genetic clinic, one of the things we have to think about is risk assessment and who is going to be best to test.

497
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,239
And so as you can see here, I'm just kind of giving that this was actually a headline of a paper several years

498
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,740
ago where you can see three of the sisters have been diagnosed with cancer.

499
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,910
A test may soon tell the fourth whether she carries a cancer causing gene.

500
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,000
Who will tell her? And does she really want to know?

501
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:55,180
And so if I were looking at this, you know, would it be best to test the 34 year old patient that's completely asymptomatic?

502
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:03,070
The answer is going to be no. You would want to test one of the sisters that has breast cancer to see if you could find the gene change in her.

503
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,350
Because if you can't find it, then you would know that that if you can't find it in someone that's,

504
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,710
you know, affected, you're not going to be able to find it in someone that's at risk.

505
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,740
In addition, we have to think about to what test to order and which lab to order it from.

506
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,860
If you get a a CBC, a complete blood count, that's going to be the same test.

507
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:32,460
Whether you do it here at Michigan St Joe's over in California, Utah doesn't matter.

508
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,759
CBC is going to be the same with genetic test.

509
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,530
It turns out that different labs offer different testing for the same genetic condition.

510
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:50,090
So testing for many genetic conditions, these are some of our challenges is not yet standard of care.

511
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,170
There are few practice guidelines that exist. Many genetic tests are costly.

512
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,460
Insurance pre-authorization may be needed. There can be just kind of low detection rates, low sensitivity.

513
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,570
And so sometimes delay in testing until advances are made.

514
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,530
Advances are made may be beneficial. It's a moving target.

515
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:14,780
There can be rapid evolution of the information. And genetic testing may not yield a yes or no answer.

516
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,480
And the significance of a result may be unknown.

517
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,370
And so, as I mentioned, you know, sometimes you know that the given some of the cost of some of these tests,

518
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:34,750
one of the biggest problems in terms of implementation and integration to our health care can be whether,

519
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,050
you know, whether the test will be covered by someone's insurance.

520
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,370
And so there are broader issues, insurance issues with genetic testing.

521
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:50,810
And certainly if there's a neurological condition, this could potentially you know,

522
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,950
if you think about it, that may not manifest for for years or decades.

523
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:02,360
Knowing the test results, it could potentially impact health insurance, life insurance, disability and long term care.

524
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,040
And so what we would advise someone is to make sure they have desired insurance

525
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,199
coverage prior to undergoing genetic testing so that they have the ability to get,

526
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,470
you know, the types of insurance that they may eventually move down the road, particularly if it's for neuro genetic condition.

527
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:25,540
So you may ask, well, what legislation is there to protect people from genetic discrimination?

528
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:32,170
And there is something called genome, which is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which was passed in 2008.

529
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,400
And as you can see here, it prohibits health insurers from requesting,

530
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:43,720
requesting or requiring genetic testing or using genetic information to determine eligibility or established premiums.

531
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:52,390
And it prohibits employers from using genetic information in employment decisions as well.

532
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:58,159
But as you will note there, I said health insurers and I said employers.

533
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,080
It doesn't protect from every health insurer or every employer.

534
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:10,220
So, for example, if there are less than 15 employees, there's not the same protections there, for example.

535
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,660
And as you noticed here, I said health and employers.

536
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:19,160
I didn't say anything about life insurance, disability or long term care.

537
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:29,670
Though I will note that Florida does have a law that you should not use information to turn genetic information to determine life insurance policies.

538
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:40,400
But that's one state. Sure. And so if you want to get more information about Gina, it's actually a very easy website to remember.

539
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:51,470
Just Gina helped talk. So I hope I've convinced you that ordering a genetic test is not as simple as checking off a box on the form.

540
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,060
It requires a kind of accurate pedigree, analysis and risk assessment.

541
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:01,520
Knowing the different testing methodologies and their limitations, figuring out who's most informative for testing,

542
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:08,390
selecting the lab, figuring out kind of shipping and billing arrangements, and then interpreting the results accurately.

543
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:16,730
And so that's where the risk assessment, pretest counseling, informed consent and post-test counseling is so important.

544
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:28,420
And this is just kind of an acronym I put together, because when you're in D.C. and at different policy meetings, everyone likes acronyms.

545
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,090
And so I was just trying to emphasize here that really what genetic counseling is all about

546
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:39,310
and meeting with people kind of before they have testing done is to have a discussion.

547
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,990
And just to think about, you know, just because a test exists does not obligate excuse.

548
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:49,150
Is the results are they going to impact how health care and life decisions will be made?

549
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,880
Are there insurance implications? Will recommendations change for surveillance and treat treatment?

550
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:57,940
What about the cost uses and limitations of results?

551
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,140
What about other family members at risk and what supportive resources are available?

552
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,670
Luke, as I mentioned, having just doing just because you have a test doesn't mean you should do it.

553
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:18,220
And I do want to point out, kind of close out just with the fact that there are some tests that you can order on the Internet.

554
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:23,050
However, many of these tests are not offered in clinics and are not considered standard of care.

555
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:30,520
Infidelity testing. Let's see.

556
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:37,660
This is athletic performance. I'm pretty sure that no matter what my genes show for athletic performance,

557
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:43,000
that being in my sixties, I am not going to be going to the Olympics anytime soon.

558
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,440
But if you go to Burns Park, I will play horse with you.

559
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,980
And I'm generally good for two games out of three. Just going to point that out.

560
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:57,550
My five foot three status. But D.C., D.C. schools taught us how to shoot baskets and I still love doing it.

561
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:05,870
Guess what? There's neutron genomic testing where you can look and find out what nutrients that you might be deficient in based on your DNA.

562
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:11,570
And then guess what? They will sell you the actual supplements and vitamins you might need.

563
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,400
There is certainly DTC direct to consumer genetic testing.

564
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,089
And you can see here it's offered of either, you know,

565
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:31,670
where there's no health care involvement that you just go and you order yourself or there could actually be involvement of a health care provider.

566
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,690
And so certainly this is from one company 23 and me,

567
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:43,750
which is the probably the most most well-known out there and was the one that the FDA weighed in on.

568
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,140
As you could see, all involves a spitting into a tube.

569
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:55,780
I won't embarrass anyone by asking if you've done this type of testing because it is considered somewhat recreational,

570
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,520
but it also can yield information that can be helpful to health care.

571
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:06,370
And I still remember when it was first introduced and people thought, oh, it's going to go away.

572
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,860
And I would say with millions of users now, it's certainly here to stay.

573
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:22,000
And so but what I'd like to point out is that doing a 2380 type test, it's not the same grade test that you would do in a clinic.

574
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:30,520
And so what it's doing is it's doing what we call single nucleotide polymorphisms testing or snip based.

575
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:35,740
And so what they're doing is looking at, as you can see, single differences there.

576
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,960
It's not looking at all the letters on both sides of that single difference.

577
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:53,830
And so you get kind of reports that look something like this. So as you can see, maybe your risk was 13% for breast cancer and now it's 20%.

578
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,470
So it's not going to give you a yes no answer for a lot of things.

579
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,330
It's usually going to be more risk modifying. There's some exceptions, but that's in general what you're going to get.

580
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,510
And then what you're going to get is what next?

581
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:14,020
Well, as you can see here, if you're overweight, try to shed a few pounds, get more movement in your life.

582
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:18,670
Lighten your diet. Talk to your doctor about how often your blood sugar should be tested.

583
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:25,410
In other words, you get a lot of recommendations that I think could be given regardless of the genetic test.

584
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:38,370
And so as you can see here in terms of FDA and this is what happened is that FDA technically has oversight of genetic tests,

585
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:46,020
but it hasn't really used it fully because the number of tests exceeds their current review review capacity.

586
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:55,560
And so as you can see here, though, back in 2014, it told 23 and me that it had to halt offering its tests.

587
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:04,110
But then a couple of years later, it allowed testing for some conditions.

588
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:08,310
And so I put on it on the slide. The conditions that it's offered.

589
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:15,610
And what I want you to appreciate is that some of the conditions that it's offered are really you know,

590
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:19,890
it's not offering the full spectrum of gene changes associated with the condition.

591
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,070
And particularly if you want to look down there at Parkinson's disease,

592
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:34,220
where the testing that they're offering is really going to apply to individuals that are of Ashkenazi Jewish or North African Berber heritage.

593
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,090
And then, as you could see there, chronic kidney disease. It's only looking at one gene.

594
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,870
Many different genes that can give rise to chronic kidney disease.

595
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,209
And so the concerns are like false assurance where someone could get a negative result

596
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:55,570
from one of these tests and think they're in the clear when in fact they're not.

597
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:00,629
The other concerns are that someone could find out that they have a condition and

598
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:04,440
don't have the support or expertise of a genetics provider to explain it to them.

599
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:12,450
But on the recreational side, you can see that you can do ancestry and carrier status, or you can do traits and other things.

600
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,300
Wellness. Here's a partial list of traits.

601
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:25,139
So if you do that, you could actually figure out, as you can see, freckles, I'm pretty sure to look in the mirror, let's say cheek dimples.

602
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:29,890
Dimples. I also think you could probably look in the mirror. But I was actually curious.

603
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:36,680
You know, mosquito bite frequency. So I just looked this up last night.

604
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,820
I was like, you know, stretch marks, whether you like sweet versus salty.

605
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:45,410
So that's where again, this is where this gets somewhat into the recreational realm.

606
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:53,070
I also do want to point out that there's also genomic sequencing that's being done research.

607
01:06:53,070 --> 01:07:00,780
And there's a whole a national research study being done called all of us.

608
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:09,030
And where they are trying to get samples on a million individuals in the United States and they are beginning

609
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:15,030
to return results to those individuals that have that have volunteered to participate in the study.

610
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:24,360
And the reason, as you can see here and there you see on the slide is what a lot of the studies that have been done have been done on white men.

611
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:34,980
And so the whole goal behind all of us, which is funded by the government, is to increase the diversity and to be able to, you know,

612
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:41,880
have genetics, be about all of us and to be able to know, you know, you know, again, as you can see, the future of health begins with you.

613
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,680
And so as we look at the future,

614
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:52,860
I think we're going to see increased use and less costs for genomic sequencing and IPT and expanded carrier frequency.

615
01:07:53,310 --> 01:08:00,630
I think we're going to see more what they call personalized medicine kind of mapping, matching your care to your genetics.

616
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:06,120
I think we're going to see more predictive tests for common complex conditions like cancer and diabetes.

617
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:13,140
We're going to see more pharmacogenomics and we're going to see, I think, more direct to consumer and consumer initiated tests.

618
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,410
And so I hope that you've appreciated over the last hour or 20 minutes just how the

619
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:26,490
clinical genetics specialists have diverse roles or multiple roles with genetic testing,

620
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:35,710
which I've included here on this slide. And just the key points are that there are different types of genetic tests and there are different uses,

621
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:42,819
that the many genetic tests are new and evolving, that reviewing family history information is important for risk assessment

622
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:48,639
and genetic testing decisions that genetic test results can yield pathogenic,

623
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:56,950
benign or variants of unknown significance, and that for all these reasons, that having pre and post test counseling and informed consent is critical.

624
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:07,459
And so as I demonstrated today, I eat sleep, genetics, not much sleep here, but just in general.

625
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,610
I would say that genetics is both my job, but it's also my passion.

626
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:18,380
It's been amazing. I've had an amazing career and just and just to see all the advances and changes in over three and a half decades.

627
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:24,230
And I've really enjoyed, like I say, being involved on the policy side of things as well.

628
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:31,249
And there you go, my final slide and literally right at 950.

629
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:41,450
So I think that is pretty on time. So. So what questions do you have?

630
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:47,210
I know is that it's a bit dry. Next week will be a little bit more interesting because we're literally going to look at some of the ethical issues.

631
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:53,330
And I will also divide you into some smaller groups that you consider some some individual pieces.

632
01:09:54,620 --> 01:10:01,639
But are there any questions on that on the technical side or what I went over today that you have any questions about?

633
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:10,459
And I'll I'll also stay up here to see what additional training is required for an employee to have,

634
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,860
like the board certifications and things in addition to their specialties.

635
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:21,980
You have to be an M.D. Ph.D. to do that. You just have to be an M.D. to be become a geneticist.

636
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,839
So typically it's someone that has like internal medicine background, not too many of those.

637
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,280
We need a lot more pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology.

638
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,079
So they've done it. They do a residency in that area and then they add on top.

639
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,470
So it's 18 months more of training.

640
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:44,329
So there's actually combined likes. In other words, if someone just does genetics, it might be two years.

641
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:49,070
But if they do it combined with, let's say, pediatrics and genetics, that is three years.

642
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:56,040
Is there one specialty that you think is extremely lacking in geneticists?

643
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:01,139
Like they need the internal medicine turn in internists because a lot of the advances are

644
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,320
going to be made with cancer and diabetes and heart disease and neurological conditions.

645
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:14,550
And we need we need it you know, we need adults. I think that the I actually do work in clinic with some wonderful pediatric geneticists.

646
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,999
And, of course, their their attitude is that, well, you know, adults are just bigger bodies than children.

647
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,520
But as you know, there's a lot that, you know that in terms there's still a knowledge base of being an internist that I think is highly valuable,

648
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,590
especially as we get into more conditions like that that are going to be impacted.

649
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,430
So it is a field that you're constantly learning.

650
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:47,590
I think my children were confused as they were growing up because my husband's an oncologist and they were like, How come Dad's the doctor?

651
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:55,090
But Mom's the one who played reading. And and I explained is that because we had over at the clinic I direct here at Michigan,

652
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:58,750
we have over 150 different genetic conditions we see in a typical year.

653
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,290
And a lot of them are one offs and a lot of it is.

654
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:07,240
So it means reading up on the condition, then trying to figure out is there genetic testing available,

655
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,930
then trying to figure out our the support of resources for the patient.

656
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,890
So I could spend several hours just from one patient.

657
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,440
But I also say diversity is the spice of life. And so I really enjoy that.

658
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:24,290
So as you know what, we're here in the School of Public Health.

659
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:29,570
There are dual degree students, are getting a master's in genetic counseling and a master's in public health.

660
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:36,350
Because a lot of what we're doing here on an individual level is going to need to be provided on a population level.

661
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:44,620
And so that's also exciting as well. So, okay, I'll stay up here in case you have any other questions.

662
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,350
So I think this is a peculiar.
