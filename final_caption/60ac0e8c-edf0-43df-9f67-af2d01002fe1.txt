1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,480
Happy Thursday. Happy last couple of days.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,900
Morning, all three. Hopefully you're in favor of compliance.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:23,909
So any announcements before we get started on the rule is on balance, there's a lot more bodies in this area than they're usually are.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,670
So and again, I just, you know, notice we're just like that.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:35,489
Yeah yeah I we're existence kind of is hosting a concert on the Diag on Thursday, October 14th from 5 to 8 p.m.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,850
We'll be doing voter registration there and there will also be free pizza.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,710
Okay, cool. And again, if you any announcements, if you want to send to a killer, we'll post them on Amazon.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,600
Any other announcements? Yeah, it's been great.

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,790
I just feel like you're all get left with because if I stand right here,

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,550
I'm blinded by this live and can't see anything, so I think I'll just take it from here to the other.

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:14,330
So you probably get a lot more direct attention. So your journals are due today.

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,600
So we have a tournament. Tournament. So Kyle and I were just talking originally.

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,400
You were going to we were going to have you start up your journals again next week on Thursday.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,110
But since we extended the deadline, you don't have to do any next week.

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
So you end up only having 19 instead of 20 at the end of this month or so.

16
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,559
And if any of you really get upset by that, you can write an extra one.

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Just, you know, how happy you are that you can project on whatever it is that floats your boat.

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,959
No more announcement from the group absolutely will jump right in.

19
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,270
And we do have a pretty good reflection circle today.

20
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,350
Which Akila sent out your groups?

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,390
Okay. So I'm talking about culture, humility.

22
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:28,730
And so just from now, of course, I'm going to do this like I always do.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,750
So what do you remember about culture in relation to anything?

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,380
So right now, to throw write another piece of paper. A couple of things I remember from today's Brian Stelter.

25
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,260
This part of the movie is that, yes, the idea that we're not really showing concern about other people's culture.

26
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:52,489
So we're always learning that as I wrote this down, I think it's a good line is competency is an end product.

27
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,490
Humility is a lifelong process. Cool. I like that.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:03,020
I probably said that right in there. I think for me on that competency says I'm the expert.

29
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,810
Humility says one thing you all learn very quickly.

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:19,880
Lots of pearls of wisdom that you want to share, whether they be recycled pearls or new pearls.

31
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,560
Any new pearls? I know. I got it.

32
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:39,260
Yeah. So, yeah, we had it kind of talking about this is the definition of basic definition by term, a lot of Murray Garcia.

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,330
And then these are just different dimensions and things that people have talked about.

34
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,420
So lifelong learning and critical self-reflection and you really can't have cultural humility

35
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,880
without critical self-reflection because it's really about you and how you approach the world,

36
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,190
how you approach the people you work with, recognizing challenge, power imbalances.

37
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,290
Because and again, cultural humility, the concept really came out of the medical field.

38
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:18,380
So the two women that wrote the original article that I'm sure you all read were one was then a nurse, the other one a physician.

39
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,940
And it really came out of their experiences with providing health care to patients.

40
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,340
And if you think about that, that's a that's a huge power differential, right?

41
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,170
I mean, when you're going in, you typically go in because you don't feel well, right?

42
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,709
I mean, you might have a moment where you feel okay, but most of time you feel like [INAUDIBLE] or you feel pretty crappy and you're relying on

43
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,160
this person or these people to help make you feel better and then to distance society.

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:57,560
I think we're often taught that the health care providers have some kind of knowledge that that other people don't have.

45
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,209
I think there's a real socioeconomic differences, too.

46
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,860
I noticed for myself growing up, we rarely went to the doctor because we couldn't afford it.

47
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:14,450
And if you did, I remember we had I had to dress up to go to the doctor and I was not allowed to speak and

48
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:22,880
was explicitly told that I wasn't allowed to speak because doctors were better than we were.

49
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:30,680
And so we had to show them that respect. So there's a lot of stuff that goes into that relationship.

50
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:38,329
So when we engage in culture, humility, we really do have to examine what power differentials exist.

51
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,989
And that's why I think culture humility is so important in public health as well,

52
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,860
because we do have power differentials and we're working with the community to improve some aspect of health and wellbeing.

53
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,999
You are seen as an expert. Even though you may not feel like an expert, you still are seen as an expert.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,930
So the power imbalances I think sometimes gets lost in discussions.

55
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,650
Around 30 million people just really talk about being aware of and learning about culture, things like that.

56
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:16,190
But the power part is really very critical because again, people who have power often are not the ones that are feeling the effects of the power.

57
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,439
And I think especially in kind of health professions or caring support professions,

58
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:32,500
all kinds of people go into it because they do care about people and may not realize the power that they have just by virtue of their position.

59
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,820
Then the last one, and this often gets down to is institutional accountability.

60
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:53,520
What do you think is meant by that? If you ever listen to that line being like that, what do you think institutional accountability mean?

61
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Adler systems and other institutions either holding themselves,

62
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,910
are holding each other accountable by regulating and like collaboration and other things that.

63
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,750
Allow people to keep these institutions accountable, even though.

64
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,779
Keeping these institutions accountable isn't necessarily making a lot of change today,

65
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:30,630
but it's still a way to kind of like constructively criticize these institutions and you can hold them accountable for change, right?

66
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:38,820
Right. I mean, it's one thing to kind of call people out for them. It's another to constantly make sure that there's a change in the system as well.

67
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,140
What else do you think is meant by institutional accountability?

68
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:48,850
Yeah, I, I think also like putting systems in place that kind of keep people's power in check.

69
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,400
And, yeah, like, so that you can, like, call them out, but then actually do something, right?

70
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,970
Yeah. And that's why these two. Yeah.

71
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:05,140
Are related because if you notice the power differentials, but then you don't really change the institutional or the structures,

72
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,140
those power differentials are going to be perpetuated and the next person or people that come in are going to be in the same position.

73
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,860
So, you know, you can have institutions that will never change.

74
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,610
Individuals may change, but the institutions won't change. You know, so if you look at the work, I mean, this is like 98.

75
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,850
So it's been a while. We all born in 98.

76
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,080
Wow. Shoes kind of blows my mind. Most people born by the.

77
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
Oh, sorry. Only one moment.

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Anyways, so I want to tell you what I to do.

79
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,270
Well, I was born in 63. It's like I thought, oh, me.

80
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,650
But yeah, but I mean, so they were talking about this in 98, which is, you know,

81
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:15,400
when we think about some of the other kind of writings and topics and stuff about like anti-racism and other more modern movements, you know,

82
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:26,320
these are what we're talking about this, you know, a long time ago, you know, and I think the fact that it was to women of color probably is not,

83
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:33,460
you know, it shouldn't be ignored because I think a lot of times the voices of women of color have been ignored.

84
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:44,200
But they really were really talking about a lot of issues that were later recycled or picked up by other people as well.

85
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,790
This is a YouTube video. Does that have the right anyway?

86
00:09:49,690 --> 00:10:02,290
If you're ever like, you know, have some time to just hang out and and watch a video, it's actually the two folks who really developed this concept.

87
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,830
It's a video where they're talking with other people about cultural humility.

88
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,229
And it's just an interesting kind of video.

89
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:22,540
So and now I'll do my little fanboy I guess is that the term when you're like deep down of people have actually gotten

90
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:32,740
to meet both of the authors and that's they write a book chapter and a book they were doing on culture humility.

91
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,050
And I never got it finished because I was dealing with some other crap during that time,

92
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,890
but they're just like really cool humans and you know, I mean,

93
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:50,319
it's nice when you meet people who, you know, you really respect and they actually do a lot of larger scale culture,

94
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,300
humility, trainings and workshops and things like that. Now, which is cool because I think they're both.

95
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,629
Retired at this point. Other people in public health specifically talk about culture, humility.

96
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,480
So McLaren Wallenstein wrote about this back in oh eight.

97
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,880
They were faculty at UC Berkeley in the School of Public Health.

98
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,950
So they also were. We're writing about this concept to so it's, you know, it's something, again,

99
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,700
that was really started in medicine, but then other fields have kind of taken it off and and put it into action.

100
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:39,080
And you see their comments are very much similar to to what, several on Emory Garcia talk about.

101
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,140
I think that, you know, and I don't want let me throw this back at you.

102
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,580
Have you heard much about culture, humility and in your other public health courses?

103
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,560
Is this a concept that that is becoming more widespread now?

104
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,500
I see some yeses and some no. So it's a yes from me.

105
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:07,900
What courses have you? Of course. Our forces have been talking about this and you just talked about it yesterday.

106
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,970
My eating disorders prevention treatment class. Okay.

107
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,730
It wasn't like a whole list. Right. But, yeah, at least addressed.

108
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:23,540
Okay. Yeah. We don't, like, talk about it like specifically in 381, but they have in public upper 81.

109
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:31,069
But they do bring it up a little bit. And something interesting that I thought they said was like the professor was talking

110
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,160
to us at the beginning of class and said that if you took this class ten years ago,

111
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,020
some of the topics that we talk about would be completely different. And like, it was really interesting.

112
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,140
And I think that cultural humility is probably something that they started to incorporate more within the class.

113
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, yeah, let's remember, it's one of our adding principles for this program.

114
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,640
Did you go back and read all ten of them and make sure that you're adhering to them all and really embracing them?

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,920
Yeah, that's what I'm asking, but I wouldn't have them know.

116
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,430
But I think it's something that I think for people who really do cultural humility work and really are embrace it.

117
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,310
It's something we just like live and breathe. And so sometimes we just assume others are doing it.

118
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,910
And I think it really does need to be something that's just embedded in everything that you do.

119
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:30,020
You know, it needs to be less of a process and more of an orientation.

120
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,770
And so what I mean by that is like not just taking the steps like, oh,

121
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm going to examine the power that I have over Sara and now I'm going to talk about it,

122
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:47,060
you know, but it needs to be incorporated in the way that I look at the world, the way I look at public health and the things that I do.

123
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,390
So this is from.

124
00:13:51,290 --> 00:14:05,800
So a couple of years ago, they did a piece in the what is it, the findings, the publication that puts out based on some of the work we were doing.

125
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:13,100
So I showed you the gluten free intervention that we had done in Chicago, working with young black gay men.

126
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:21,049
And so they interviewed some of the young men that were part of that project and really wanted to hear from them,

127
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,790
not from academics, but people on the front line about what they thought about cultural humility.

128
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,250
So these are just some of the comments.

129
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,810
Young people can really tell when someone is that culturally competent, they can tell when somebody is that relatable.

130
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,590
I'll read it on here. And then if they feel it's fake, they're not going to go for it.

131
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,389
So my advice is to do your research on whatever you're trying to accomplish.

132
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,730
If it's a certain race or type of people that you're not part of,

133
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,780
it doesn't mean you can't do the work, but do your research or make sure you know your facts.

134
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,840
Reach out to the appropriate people. Give credit where credit is due.

135
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,370
If your heart's really in it and you really mean to help, then you can make a difference.

136
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,270
And then for me, culture, humility is about meeting people where they are.

137
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,750
What is their background, what neighborhood, what region did they come from?

138
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,950
Get a sense of their current understanding of the issues that we're going to talk about.

139
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,720
And remember that I'm separate from this specific community, and these folks really are the experts of their own lives.

140
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,990
So that's like the show now, because I think, again, we all often just focus on like academic writings.

141
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,860
And these were just guys that were part of our intervention to work in community based

142
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:32,870
organizations and are part of these communities their understandings and conceptualizations.

143
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,370
Clubs, like million in action.

144
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:47,979
So I'm going to talk a little bit about an intervention that a group of us here at ESP have worked on for a number of years.

145
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:55,360
And this came out of a CDC funded grant, which Jose Baumeister,

146
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,019
who was a faculty member who was here several years ago, originally was the pi of this grant.

147
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,360
And then when he left, I took over and we kind of took it in different directions.

148
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:22,630
But the grant was really focused on trying to decrease rates of STIs, sexually transmitted infections among gay by trans youth in southeast Michigan.

149
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:34,150
And so the cool thing about the way that they structured this grant was that it was you didn't have to say ahead of time what your intervention was.

150
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:42,969
So it was truly a CPR community based person, battery research project, where the first 1 to 2 years,

151
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:51,990
we're really just getting the community on board, learning from the community and developing the intervention with the community.

152
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,140
So it was really a cool opportunity. You rarely, rarely get these opportunities.

153
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,859
So we had three different entities that work together.

154
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,970
So we had a group from the university, but then we had a group of young people who were part of our Youth Action Committee,

155
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:18,780
and then we had a group of service providers. So they were service providers and we had people from HIV and SGI community based organizations.

156
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:26,530
We had providers from clinics who provide services like the Corner Health Center in Ypsi.

157
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,690
So it was all people who were on the front line working with these populations.

158
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:42,070
And so, again, it's one of those things where when you do true community based budgetary research, you really never know what the outcome is.

159
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:50,470
And you have to let your own kind of desires or opinions sometimes just fall by the wayside.

160
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:58,360
So we did this process. We did all these like listening sessions in the community, and we took all that information.

161
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,500
And then across those three groups, we created teams that were made up of representatives of the three constituent groups.

162
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:16,180
And then each of these groups looked at the data and then created a proposal for the intervention based on what the community had said.

163
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:23,260
And this was one of the three projects was not the one I wanted to do at all.

164
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:33,520
I wanted to do economic empowerment through like economic literacy and financial independence.

165
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,430
And we didn't. So we we wrote it again as a group.

166
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:47,290
And, and this is what what came out. So what was developed was something called the Health Access Initiative.

167
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,009
And so what we were really trying to do is to, you know, we were really thinking kind of upstream.

168
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,350
So one way to lower rates of SSI is to make sure that people are getting tested

169
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,790
and treated for these so that they're not passing them on to other folks.

170
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,350
One thing we heard over and over again is for a lot of sexual and gender minority youth,

171
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,770
they didn't feel comfortable getting tested for this because of different forms of discrimination.

172
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:25,300
Also, if you're under your parent's insurance and you're in high school and there's no place to go except for your primary care provider,

173
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:36,310
they're not going to go. Also, there's a few youth focused clinics like Corner Health Center, and Mrs. is a great place,

174
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,980
but not a whole lot like here in Ann Arbor where young people could go.

175
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:49,300
So what we wanted to do is really to provide training and technical assistance for health care

176
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,740
providers and staff in order to make their environments more sexual and gender minority youth friendly.

177
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,709
So what we did is we decided to work with the whole system.

178
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:09,430
So not just like the person doing the HIV test or diagnostic tests are not just the nurse or the doctor.

179
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,330
Everyone in the clinic or the health facility were part of it.

180
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,990
So all the way from the receptionist, when you walk in the front door to the lab tech to to everyone.

181
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,510
Now, why do you think that's important when you're thinking about, you know, trying to use cultural humility to create a more friendly environment?

182
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,240
Why do you think it's important for someone to say who you know is the receptionist?

183
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,010
To be trained in cultural humility and to be more culturally humble for this population.

184
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,299
Yeah, really. I think like some procedural doctor you actually spend more time with like the

185
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,280
tech nurses actually getting you prepped to see the doctor than you actually do.

186
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,640
And so I think sometimes it's like that actual face to face interaction.

187
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,219
Like the receptionist is probably talking to every single person who walks in

188
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,370
or out of that building and the doctors only seeing their specific patients.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Exactly. Yeah. And that's the face right when you walk in.

190
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,160
And if you have a bad experience, when you walk in the door, you're going to turn and walk away.

191
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:15,089
I mean, a lot of our trans youth for this project would talk about being misgendered as soon as they walked in and they just turn around,

192
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,700
walk out, and then they never come back in for a test. Yeah, yeah.

193
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,790
And I know there's like there have been like academic studies that show that patients are both more comfortable

194
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:32,280
and have better health outcomes when the provider they're seeing is the same ethnic group as them.

195
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,600
So I think like having everyone going to health care feels like culturally

196
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,639
competent is pretty important for both like the patient and provider interaction,

197
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,750
but also for their health outcomes that.

198
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:55,459
Why? Well, yeah said they literally hear every single one of the patients that picks up the

199
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,660
phone if you're calling and you have to tell them first like what's going on?

200
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:07,620
Right. You want to come in if you're met with either just like some sort of attitude or something that doesn't make you feel comfortable.

201
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,370
Of course you're not going to want to go see, because if the reception is just like this, the culture of the office must also be like.

202
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:20,419
Right? Yeah. The person who. You know, whether it be the receptionist or, you know, a medical assistant,

203
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,909
whoever is your first point of contact really has a ton of power because they will set the tone.

204
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,860
And like you said, a lot of times that person and well, sometimes that's reflective of the whole organization.

205
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,210
Institution sometimes is not.

206
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:44,629
But, you know, one example, when I was in Chicago, there was a place called the Core Center, which is HIV services, wraparound services.

207
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,750
So you could get dental work done there.

208
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:55,580
You could see a social worker. I mean, it was like a one stop, one stop shop for everything related to your health.

209
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,330
Now, the problem is they had this really mean person who is the receptionist,

210
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,510
and you would walk in and she would like yell patients names out really loud.

211
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,870
So total HIPA violations. I mean, there's like all kinds of crazy stuff.

212
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:24,739
And, uh, they, they noticed that there their youth participants were not coming in for services and they were having a lot of missed appointments,

213
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,270
and they're just like, they couldn't figure out why, because they have all these, like, great adolescent medicine specialists.

214
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,220
But I remember sitting down with the medical director. I'm like, Have you sat in your waiting room?

215
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,399
And he was like, No, I haven't sat in the waiting room.

216
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,660
Like, don't spend like 15 minutes in the waiting room and you'll see why young people don't come here.

217
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:54,500
Because she was this loud and really crabby, too, you know, and had some, like, pretty homophobic transphobic interactions with people.

218
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,549
And so they they switched her out.

219
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:07,520
And then the rates of adherence went up dramatically. You know, it was like one person, you know, could have that, that type of impact.

220
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:16,100
So, so, yeah, based on all these things that we decided to work with the whole clinic.

221
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,840
So it was based in the information motivation behavioral skills model,

222
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,979
which is a health behavior change model that looks at how people in order to bring about behavior change,

223
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,959
first, people have to have basic information.

224
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,330
So when it comes to like code for humility, people need to know what it is, the tenets, things like that.

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,150
You also have to have motivation to change your behavior.

226
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:44,870
You know, if there's no motivation, if there's no reason why you would want to change, you're not going to be able to do that.

227
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,510
And then the behavioral skills are having the actual skills.

228
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:53,600
So teaching people about reflection skills, teaching people about power analysis and things like that.

229
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:10,099
And then so with this we did we work with ten clinics who received this training and we did see really significant effects in terms of attitudes,

230
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,489
practices. The other thing we did is we did technical assistance too.

231
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,130
And so what that means is, well, the training, first of all,

232
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:28,760
first you watched a one hour online thing training that we created about some of the basics because we wanted everyone

233
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,910
coming into the workshop with some basic knowledge and shared meaning and things like that that we all developed.

234
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:42,140
And then they had an interactive workshop where they address these different issues and scenarios.

235
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:50,780
The workshops, too were led by a physician, a young sexual, gender minority person who was part of the team and a health educator.

236
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,820
So it was run by those three people.

237
00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:02,840
And that was really important because there's some things that some of the medical providers would listen to the other medical provider more.

238
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,540
And she often shared stories, too, about, well, this is what I've done in this situation, things like that.

239
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,700
The health educator was good because they had all the health, education, background, knowledge,

240
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,410
things like that, and then have a young person just talk about their experience was really powerful too.

241
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,120
So they were all led by those three people.

242
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:32,689
And then with the technical assistance, we would go in and help them to change their forms, to be more gender neutral,

243
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:46,130
or to allow people to change their gender marker in their documents, or to have the flexibility to find different forms and documents.

244
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,430
To report gender is beyond the binary.

245
00:26:51,090 --> 00:27:00,150
Also, we worked on things like having coasters, materials that reflect sexual and gender minority people,

246
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,230
and we also looked at intersectional intersection that we also looked at, you know, race, ethnicity, ability, other things like that.

247
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:19,770
So helping people to create posters and and materials and really just kind of anything that we also work with them on, on changing policies.

248
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,820
So we would work with them on like if it was a clinic or hospital,

249
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:29,610
look at their specific policies and we work with them to be able to change the actual policies.

250
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:38,549
So this is just this is the kind of our evaluation model.

251
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:46,990
So we we took some data before the training and they did the online training and we went to see how satisfied they were that

252
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:54,030
the in-person then we looked at satisfaction there and then technical assistance and then we did a follow up with that.

253
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,760
These are some of the articles that we wrote that really talked about the process.

254
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,120
And, you know, one thing that was, I think kind of cool about this was the first part.

255
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:13,260
Like I said, we had I think we took almost the full two years to really develop it from a true community voice.

256
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:22,020
And so it's something that often doesn't happen and that's just, you know,

257
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,930
so these this was the manual that we came up with Health Health Access Initiative.

258
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,620
Here's an article where we looked at the outcomes of that.

259
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:42,389
These I think that hopefully you do so. But this was the online training and then Amphoras was the the group that came out of it.

260
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,900
It was Michigan. I can't remember.

261
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,490
We have too many acronyms. Forward, forward.

262
00:28:50,490 --> 00:29:00,450
And yeah, I can't. And something had to run with Michigan and and community based research and then from

263
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:06,269
that actually evolved the second project called Chai Community Health Access Initiative,

264
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,500
which I'll talk a little bit about.

265
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:18,870
But these were some of the the posters that were produced from that first project, and these were mostly members of our our youth group.

266
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,559
But the cool thing too is that we were able to partner with people in the school of Information,

267
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:36,720
but then also people who do art and design work and they donated time and resources to create different materials that people could see,

268
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:47,040
you know, and when you go into a place that you see, you know, in areas like this and you see two men in a,

269
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,659
you know, kind of loving embrace, you're like, oh, okay, well, they're going to be more open to that.

270
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,650
Or, you know, people who are identifying in different ways.

271
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,020
These are some of the documents that were created.

272
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,880
So, you know, not things you see all the time, sex toys and strapped on sex,

273
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:12,450
but these were things that young people wanted to know about and in order to maintain their health.

274
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,260
And so these were materials that were then in the clinic.

275
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,849
So people could actually see those also things around estrogen.

276
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:28,620
For some of our trans youth, they had a really hard time getting the materials that broke down,

277
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,940
what hormones did and how you would react to them, things like that.

278
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,310
And these again were all developed. They were all co-developed with young people.

279
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:44,969
So nothing got distributed unless we got sign off from the young people.

280
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:52,950
But young people were part of the initial process. So we had a graphic designer, health educator and young people that created all these together.

281
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:09,200
So that that led to the Community Health Access Initiative, where, again, one thing with this is we then wanted to this was a second part of funding.

282
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,880
We wanted to continue on with the culture humility training,

283
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:23,030
but our focus was more on primary health care providers detecting mental health and substance use issues in LGBT youth.

284
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:30,379
And again, we found that if the youth if the providers were not culturally sensitive,

285
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,980
there's no way a young person's going to talk about their mental health issues.

286
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:40,190
And so we we developed a lot of materials and training for that.

287
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:50,360
What we found, unfortunately, is that when we started detecting more mental health issues among LGBT youth,

288
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,089
we didn't have enough mental health providers to refer them to because they just weren't

289
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,530
enough mental health providers that had the level of cultural humility that was needed.

290
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:11,270
And so then we developed a whole set of trainings focused on training mental health providers with culture, humility, training.

291
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,129
Now, one thing I forgot to tell you before, you know,

292
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:23,210
when we think about again like the the AB model we talk about motivation is part of, you know, what's in there.

293
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,990
We would hope that providers would just be intrinsically motivated.

294
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,530
Like, I want to do this because it's good, but we realize that, you know, we all live on Fantasy Island, then not everyone is.

295
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,530
So with all these trainings we were able to get continuing education units.

296
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:49,760
So for all health care providers, no matter what area you're in, you have to take so many continuing education units in order to keep your license.

297
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:56,780
And so we were able to work with some of the National Association of Social Workers,

298
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,760
American Psychological Association, American Medical Association with Nursing.

299
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,530
And so we were able to provide continuing education units for all of our trainings.

300
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:15,889
So any time anyone came, they would get that kind of certification from us that would count toward their units.

301
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,070
Yeah. How did you end up recruiting mental health professionals?

302
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,629
Because you didn't have them and it's like, Yeah, yeah, no, that's a really great question.

303
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:31,580
So yeah, because to when we, when we originally wrote the grant, we were focused on primary care folks, so we weren't really quite ready for that.

304
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,640
So what we did is actually we had a small coalition of mental health providers who

305
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:43,340
were working as consultants on the ground because since it was mental health focus.

306
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:49,099
And so what we did is we we relied on them to create well,

307
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,809
first to find out what are the different ways in which mental health providers are communicating with each other.

308
00:33:53,810 --> 00:34:02,240
Because we're looking at master's level counselors, master's non social workers, LLP Limited licensed psychologists,

309
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,120
which are masters level Ph.D. psychologists, nurse practitioners and psychiatrists.

310
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,920
And so we tried to kind of get into the different networks of all these groups and then just did like mass media,

311
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:25,070
you know, emails about different programs. And I think the, the continuing ED units really pulled some people in.

312
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,749
And then what we found is after we did the first couple of trainings, then people started hearing about us and then we would get contacted by folks.

313
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:41,270
But at first it was really hard, you know, because not a whole lot of people were out there seeking this type of work.

314
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:47,600
Sad thing is this second grant ran out. I wrote two or three grants to continue it.

315
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,010
We didn't get any funding, but when we were talking to providers, because the last grant that I wrote for,

316
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,010
we were trying to look at expanding it throughout all of Michigan,

317
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,520
especially into regions like in the U.P. and other areas where they have low rates of mental health providers.

318
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,379
And people really wanted this, especially community mental health centers.

319
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:16,310
But unfortunately the funders didn't see it as an important service.

320
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:23,510
So we didn't we didn't get to continue it. The good thing is that these are Web links.

321
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:30,979
So the the mental health training one is still active. So one of our consultants is now in private practice.

322
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,850
So she's taken it over. So they still are offering the training.

323
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:41,630
Also, all the trainings were put online so that people could use those as well.

324
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:52,370
So we wanted to keep it continuing. And then, you know, we created a lot of really, I think, cool educational materials.

325
00:35:52,370 --> 00:36:02,090
So here's one coping with loneliness. And then this one was like bullying and in this one combat combating anti-blackness and medicine.

326
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:10,160
And this was a guide for practitioners because again, the whole intersectionality aspect was a big part of what we talked about.

327
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,810
And so this was coming out in some of our trainings as people talking about kind of anti-blackness that they were seeing in medicine.

328
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:28,640
And so this was for people in primary care, but then also in mental health work that we're experiencing that more of our materials,

329
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,640
there is a big call to have the materials in multiple languages.

330
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:43,280
So we worked with folks to translate them into Arabic and then to Spanish.

331
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,290
We even have some of our materials that the American Psychological Association adopted and put them in Swahili.

332
00:36:52,220 --> 00:37:00,050
And so we've been able to really make sure that the materials were accessible to multiple people,

333
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,440
which again, was a big, big goal, especially because it's called Health Access Initiative.

334
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:14,060
Any questions about that? Any questions about anything life in general?

335
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,529
So we're going to talk a little bit about cultural conceptualizations of health and then we're

336
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:28,490
going to jump into the CRC and quote from Audre Lorde Caring for myself is not self-indulgence,

337
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,810
it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.

338
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,850
And that's something I have to often tell myself.

339
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:46,720
So I thought right before fall break you quoted about taking liberty ourselves and giving how many people know who other Lorde is or was.

340
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,330
I mean, she passed, but yeah, cool as human.

341
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,040
And I think her you know, we talk a lot about like black feminist writers.

342
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:03,319
She was definitely, I think, identified often as a radical feminist, as a black lesbian feminist.

343
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,160
And just really her writings again were like, really, I think kind of ahead of her time in many ways.

344
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,780
So if you haven't read any of her work, I'd recommend you, Michel.

345
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,650
All right. So we're going to we're going to do an activity where I want you, again, to not think too much.

346
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,430
All right. So we've done this before. I showed you pictures before.

347
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,710
I told you not to think. What did you do? You all thought right.

348
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,880
So I want you to just declutter your mind. All right? Let's just take to set.

349
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:46,290
You know, I think it's like 7 seconds to declutter, take your, you know, your academic mind and let it rest for you.

350
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,740
Take a deep breath if you need distraction. All right.

351
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:57,489
So, well, if you fall asleep, that's what I would do for me. So I'm going to email.

352
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:10,690
That was pretty quiet. So I'm going to put up some questions and I want you to just react to those questions in writing.

353
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,580
You don't have to say anything. So, you know, no yelling or things like that.

354
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:22,000
If you want to yell out your responses, that would be a little unusual. But, you know, I support different forms of expression.

355
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:30,250
If you'd like to relate your response in the form of an interpretive dance, that is fine as well.

356
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,960
You know, Sheila was asking me earlier if she could, but then she chose not to.

357
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,360
I think I built it up enough. All right.

358
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,630
So those are the first six questions or that questions. I'm sorry.

359
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:59,140
The statements that I want you to finish. Now there are psychological tests that are just called study completion tasks.

360
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:27,000
This is not one of them. I'm not analyzing. Sure.

361
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:41,440
I don't know. I didn't want to go through, she told me.

362
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:53,890
I think. Know.

363
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:15,310
So when you. Never really.

364
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,600
When I was in high. Relations with the speaker.

365
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:50,900
Just hope to His Excellency listen to some of the things, because I'm not going to say how much we should give my first thought.

366
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,569
I want to go to the second column. Is that okay? It's not really.

367
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:02,740
It's I know sometimes of Israel. I'll just go there as long as you're being brainless of something else.

368
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,350
Yeah, I have with second because I do think I have to be like I don't want to say I'm getting my wrong reaction.

369
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:19,580
Yeah, I think I've been given permission to change.

370
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:34,590
So now the next couple of days of commuting, Miller, your way of sleeping pretty much already.

371
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,030
Instead. They so painful.

372
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:08,970
They are this morning. She's actually on.

373
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:20,390
Very news for.

374
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,830
Great. She probably freaked out. Exactly.

375
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:44,870
So in addition to the threat. See all our people do.

376
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:57,150
I'm not going to call anyone out. I know we.

377
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,850
I hear the words. I just disagree.

378
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:13,970
You know what you are saying for that. And so after you are finished, I want you to look at your responses.

379
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:23,030
And I want you to know any, like, themes or major words, topics,

380
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:30,140
concepts that are coming up a lot in what you wrote to do your own qualitative analysis of your responses.

381
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,720
Just look at any again, any words or concepts that seem to be pretty predominant in what your what you wrote.

382
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:46,360
And then when you're ready, who's willing to share?

383
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,980
You have to share your responses about any of the themes that you see coming up in your work.

384
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,980
It's a lot of cognitive processing today. Yeah. Emotions.

385
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,500
Okay. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

386
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,450
I'm healthy and happy. I'm sick.

387
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,870
I'm sad. Okay, good. Yeah.

388
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,540
Strength is like impairment for when you're like, please.

389
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay. I think overall themes for us was that sick is equated with like bad, tired,

390
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,350
negative stuff and hope is equated with, like, active and good and happy things.

391
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,760
Great. Excellent. Yeah. You said to sleep.

392
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:41,840
Sleep. And even like the healthy and sick ones, I mentioned some form of being, like, tired or like sleeping or just something related.

393
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:49,580
And that's probably contextually driven too. But it'd be like a lot of money to do with food.

394
00:45:49,610 --> 00:46:00,589
Okay, sure. Yeah. So I just associate health with freedom and the ability to do whatever I wanted to.

395
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,310
And I associated sickness with feeling trapped. Okay. Oh, that's really cool.

396
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:13,290
Yeah. Sometimes we like solutions kinds of behaviors like you find interesting.

397
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:18,340
If I when I hear the word healthy I think is like exercise eating.

398
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,380
So you're in the right field, then. Want to take action?

399
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,770
Yeah. I like the second column.

400
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:34,700
The more like informal words, like sick and healthy. I think of myself, but like the more formal, like ill in health.

401
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,760
I think of like general, like other people. Mhm.

402
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:50,090
Yeah. I like realistic social realism because I felt like a lot of my answers had to do with like what I'm actually like physically to avoid doing.

403
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:59,210
I had that idea.

404
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,800
Why? But why do you think that is?

405
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,910
They thought so. I think it's because I have had, like, a lot of, like, cool situations within my family,

406
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,050
like myself, where I've had to come to terms with the whole situation.

407
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:19,330
So I think looking back and kind of looking at my experiences, like I kind of evaluated like what?

408
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,990
Possible possibilities are possible with who I am and what I.

409
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,190
Myself and my own autonomy. Right. So.

410
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,120
Okay. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah, I think autonomy is a huge issue.

411
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,959
You know, when we're talking about a variety of, like, health related issues, you know, we can say that that's one way.

412
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,530
And it's kind of to the whole concept of like you're talking about being trapped, I mean, not having your autonomy taken away.

413
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:52,640
There is a certain sense of not having freedom, whereas with health you do others things that came out.

414
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,839
Rather people sleeping as well.

415
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:05,530
And there's a lot of my mind has to do with, like, routine and, like, structure.

416
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:15,150
Oh, good. Right. In order to stay healthy, I need to have a good routine because I like from previous experience, it's like I.

417
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,130
I know that when I don't have, like, a routine, I feel. Energized.

418
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:25,900
Right. Whether that be like eating, you know, or exercising or whatever it is.

419
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,250
Okay. But that can also be based off of, like, the capitalist approach.

420
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,170
Right. That's true. Well, I think we do.

421
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,339
I think that health promotion routine is a big part of brain.

422
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:47,420
So we're talking about like eating so much every day or going to the gym so many times a day.

423
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,750
I mean, there's all these guidelines that are about routine and what you're supposed to do.

424
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:59,600
So I think that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I was just saying that a lot of the things that I associate with healthy or being

425
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:07,880
like body versus things like just not being able bodied or nothing in the world.

426
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:16,800
Right. Yeah. So I think that also ties into the themes of like freedom or autonomy.

427
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:25,730
I mean, a lot of those I think the aspects we connect with not being healthy, you know, the more restrictive anyone else.

428
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,560
So why do you think I did this? And then I wanted you to think.

429
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:41,430
Well, shall we? Since we all have different interpretations of what health needs was or what

430
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:46,150
we would do in a situation of health or like sickness that we can't reach,

431
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:55,910
like solutions to health in one way has to be multifaceted and tailored to different individual acts, or do you want to teach us that?

432
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,350
And so that's an excellent part of it. Why else? It's a few other things.

433
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:10,200
Thanks. Good. Yeah. Yeah, I can tell it is thinking critically about, like, why we as a society value health as kind of like a moral virtue and how,

434
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,950
like, sometimes being unhealthy is not the person's fault.

435
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,410
Right. Because I think a lot of it is a condition of like, if you're not being healthy, it's because, like, your behavior is wrong.

436
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:24,380
Exactly. It's like there's other factors at play, too. Like, don't just like behavioral choices.

437
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,009
Yeah. And I would even take that to the next level.

438
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:35,610
And then there are certain health conditions that are seen as your fault and other health conditions that are not.

439
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:47,370
Or people will talk about people being the innocent victims of certain health issues, whereas others they may deserve it because they did something.

440
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:53,430
Yeah. It's just I don't know how many other people like everything with small physical.

441
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,549
Like at least my responses were everything.

442
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:07,180
I thought it was all physical health, which I think is so interesting because like it does have its operations and it's also its own separate entity.

443
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,549
But yeah, I just thought it's interesting that health that leads to sickness that to

444
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:18,720
me was like that was actually my next question from your or like in my head.

445
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,130
So the question is like when, when people read this,

446
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:30,210
were you only talking about physical health or were you also thinking and writing about mental health?

447
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,980
Yeah, like physical health.

448
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:42,420
But I think that's because that's the easiest part for me to control my physical health.

449
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:48,330
So like, but when I speak of like mental health, things like that, that's like kind of sometimes I'm like, it's like.

450
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,930
Like it's out of my hand if I'm, like, stressed about school.

451
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:57,430
Like, I was like, but like, physically, like, yeah, I can change, like, my diet and write healthier.

452
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,500
Or I can, you know. I mean, again, it's subjective.

453
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,790
So like, like because somebody else who might not be able to, you know.

454
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,140
Like a fourth coach or whatever it is, like, you know what I'm saying?

455
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:18,620
So it can be like different based off of like different circumstances or just like the,

456
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,740
the simple fact of like, you don't know what is healthy and what it's.

457
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,070
So yeah, interesting about that. I agree with that.

458
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,510
I think the one thing that's interesting in this is, you know, my psychologist brain is a you know,

459
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,350
if we talk about mental health, the mental health interventions were part of mainstream.

460
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:40,890
We would know that it's actually easier to change your conceptualizations of stress than it is to eat healthy vegetables.

461
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,420
You know, when it comes with like cognitive restructuring and there's a lot of really

462
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,309
quick and easy strategies that can be mainstreamed into your life that are much,

463
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,430
much easier than trying to find where fruits and vegetables are.

464
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,460
Because if you think about it, mental health is it's up here, right?

465
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:02,759
And so you don't necessarily need to get a product to to change the way you're thinking.

466
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,890
You may need assistance and support, but you could get that through so many modalities.

467
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:23,210
If we just valued mental health and we talk about, yeah, I think for me it's like how help makes me feel great.

468
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,050
But again, like you mentioned, it is subjective because I think the.

469
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:37,860
Recently I have been trying to focus more on what that is like, right?

470
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:50,129
Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I think the reason I didn't write responses in mental health was because I don't tend to use words like sick with mental health,

471
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:55,620
even though I guess, I mean, it could be applied. But like when I'm feeling very anxious, I don't say, Oh, I'm sick today, right?

472
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,329
It's something else. Or, I don't know.

473
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:04,170
I don't think we as a society refer to people with long term depression as people that are chronically ill, even though that is a chronic illness.

474
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:09,840
So I think it's just the terminology that also led a lot of us to write physical health indicators.

475
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,150
Exactly. Yeah. And we do you know, it's like if if you were.

476
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:21,390
So if you have a cold and you have the physical symptoms, the physiological symptoms, you know, it's okay for people to say,

477
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:31,680
I'm feeling sick today, but if you're really depressed because you lost a loved one, you know, we look at that very differently.

478
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,200
You know, we don't I mean, I think thank God we don't use the term sick because I don't really like that term anyway,

479
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,080
especially I think, you know, when we're talking about mental health issues as well.

480
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:47,280
But but yeah, we don't recognize and look at those issues in the same way.

481
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:54,060
Any other thoughts about mental health and how what you were thinking about mental or physical?

482
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:03,970
All right. So another thing, though, is your brain.

483
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:15,640
Here's three different people. Tell me something about one or all of their health status.

484
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,530
That's all I'm going to say is health status. So keep it nice and ambiguous.

485
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:28,360
Well, let's start with this. I'll. I'll be systematic and routine. What about this person health status?

486
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:32,600
What about their health status? Obviously falling ill.

487
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:44,760
Okay. How do you know that? It's like he's with the kitchen sink conditioning.

488
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,220
Okay. Okay.

489
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,640
What else? I would have people agree to disagree.

490
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:59,290
What are their indicators of our health status? Just the facial detachment.

491
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,620
Like she just looks. I mean, she just looks. Elsewhere.

492
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,100
Like it's not below. Yeah. Okay.

493
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:19,100
So some other words we don't know. Yeah. I mean, I figure it definitely looks like she has symptoms, but it also could be like allergies.

494
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,820
Or maybe she's just like, maybe she's allergic to someone's cat or something like that.

495
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,280
Tell you. Not necessarily. Like it's just symptoms.

496
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:32,720
Okay. Now, why couldn't it be that her dog just died and she's really upset?

497
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:41,570
Right. I mean, you would have the same thing. She's, you know, maybe drinking something, some warm tea to calm herself down.

498
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:47,180
She's crying. So she's been there. But no one really went to the mental health again.

499
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:54,480
I mean, we went to the physical health, right? So we looked at those indicators and we just jumped to the assumption that she has a cold or flu.

500
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,000
Mean no one mentioned the scarves. But that's another thing, too, is that, you know, we agree with that.

501
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,570
But it could also be that it's January in Michigan.

502
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,150
And, you know, she's she's really cold. What about the dude in the middle?

503
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:17,610
What's going on with him? And he went on to say, Now you're all afraid to say something.

504
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:25,360
Thank you for being. The first thing I thought of with him is that he has like a temporary sickness, you know, as he's looking at the bottle.

505
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,840
I feel like if someone has something that's routine for them, they automatically know which pills I have to take.

506
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,069
Like, what time? So he's, like, more so checking out, like, should I have this?

507
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:39,180
Should I have to ask what's going to heal my illness that's happening?

508
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:43,110
Temporary, right? Okay. Yeah. Good observation. Amelia.

509
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:51,690
Abigail, I think my first observation for some reason was like he didn't jump out to me as sick because he doesn't look, like, distressed in any way.

510
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:58,620
He doesn't look upset about. Maybe my eyes are just that for some reason it didn't register on my brain as sick.

511
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,709
Even though he has the bones. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,970
Something that I think me. It's like if I saw him, I would guess that he's buying it for someone else.

513
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,260
Maybe. And maybe it's because he's right next to the small girl who's great, but like, I imagine it him.

514
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,510
Him buying it for, like, a kid or a friend or a partner or someone who like if he's something with him again,

515
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,839
it goes back to like something out of the bottle, like, okay, this, they ask me to buy this one thing.

516
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:25,620
Is this the right thing? Maybe that he thought would be sick. Maybe he's caretaking for someone when he's actually in a medicine cabinet.

517
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,479
So but that's okay. So you saw a drugstore or something like that.

518
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,620
So we all see different things that I was thinking of.

519
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:39,750
Like maybe he's trying to, I don't know, maybe he's taking like a supplement to prevent something.

520
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,550
So it could be preventive practices. Yeah. All right. I'm going to actually stop right there because we do need to do this.

521
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,820
Actually, we'll continue this. So remember all these pictures after fall break?

522
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:58,320
I showed them the bed and there's this picture we'll look at those pictures connected to later on.

523
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,190
But I think we have to draw them ourselves.

524
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:09,400
I want you to go run. But I just you know, again, we're going to continue to talk about, again,

525
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:18,090
a lot of assumptions we make about health and what kinds of health, how people display health, instructions of health, stuff like that.

526
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:26,580
And wait, you see what it's connected to. It's going to be an exciting time anyway.

527
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:31,020
So the next this.

528
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:42,000
Oh, that's just so.

529
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,550
No, that's actually. I hear that. I mean, we do.

530
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,200
Before we move on, I. A lot of great.

531
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:01,390
I mean, I just.

532
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:11,130
Oh. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine, 11.

533
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:22,400
You know, like, as it you're 13 and 14 in the middle here and then 15 in the back like back there.

534
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:28,220
Yeah. It'll be kind of like in the middle, like all the way in the last three days.

535
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:34,080
No, but I mean, I guess they're not.

536
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:40,020
You don't say that from somewhere close to your cell.

537
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:47,940
I don't know, I. I do not know what you're working.

538
01:00:48,780 --> 01:01:04,590
Yeah, I don't want to hear that, because, you know, right now it's just took me a while.

539
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:14,760
Oh, I'm not one in mind.

540
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:20,640
Oh, you're all by yourself.

541
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:33,670
You know, the threes or the three or the four or five of your group.

542
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,590
I tried it. Six over there.

543
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:56,640
Seven in the front or on the inside. Yeah, I have it on nine over 1109 13 back there, class main.

544
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:05,580
I never heard of it.

545
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:12,480
I can't help you have anything for you.

546
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,320
Oh, yeah. Oh, really?

547
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:34,250
Oh. Oh. Like the energy shop on right up there when our.

548
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,300
In some ways, you couldn't help but eventually convert the values embedded.

549
01:02:49,400 --> 01:03:00,760
Yeah, I'm going to write my next history in the context of I'm having my thoughts and I'm going to make sure that you're attending

550
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,920
to different cultures and some of these ideas of health and wellness when developing interventions for different populations.

551
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,960
So three really easy, you know, lofty questions.

552
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,170
One can be a lot better.

553
01:03:42,000 --> 01:04:06,360
Is a group of men like yourself, a little like a participant like yourself and the science.

554
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:24,120
What are the things that make up the difference between those two things that like is that fair?

555
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:38,790
You didn't tell me that I did. Yeah, but I was it was like something like 97 Tour de France.

556
01:04:39,720 --> 01:05:01,580
And it's something that they want that the resources to educate people about certain interventions like getting the getting that everybody said,

557
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:27,370
I'm not don't really like having topics, which is I guess it provides an excellent.

558
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:36,100
Yes. It's not like it's like Ronald Reagan.

559
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:49,200
It's like, oh, he's going to go to sleep.

560
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,700
We always go to sleep. So I guess that's what takes an intervention.

561
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,600
Yes, I could be about making sure.

562
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:13,680
Okay. If you know what are you going I think we're going to answer your question your first time.

563
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:30,899
And it's important to understand the system and it's going to be adequate.

564
01:06:30,900 --> 01:07:03,840
So that was a really interesting part about, you know, sometimes it's really sort of six or 800, oh, my gosh, here we are the same.

565
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:13,500
Yeah, I don't know what I've been thinking about.

566
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:23,010
I know a lot of questions about how serious they are.

567
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:36,850
So I like this.

568
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:48,160
I just it's not really talk radio, things like that.

569
01:07:48,220 --> 01:08:01,930
It's just like the researchers who are trying to get involved in thinking about culture specially.

570
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:15,200
Like you didn't like when I was in, I was an undergrad ten years ago, so maybe I'll go, Oh, that's like, yeah, I don't know.

571
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:22,380
But they can really like you think that you were more like 22.

572
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:25,920
All right. Well, but.

573
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:34,020
You never talk about it in my classes, like you, my husband would always hold your taxes like this.

574
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,980
Yeah. It's like, I don't know about culture.

575
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,939
I remember it being, like, cheesy, probably, like, you know, like you look at, like,

576
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:51,239
your defense delivery and stuff and a lot of some professors make sure to insert that in there and like,

577
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:59,270
make sure that like a lot of their courses include like in some form or fashion, you know,

578
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:15,240
like at least be kind of like being honest, ever being able to think like, you know, that kind of like it was not right at all.

579
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:28,190
And maybe that was a reflection of how I feel, but I don't think that I don't feel has changed just from me being in it, you know what I mean?

580
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:36,090
Like, I feel it's different. Like, it's really being like and it should be like, but I think that's like a sign of like,

581
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,430
not necessarily like they mentioned it and they talk about it,

582
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:50,570
but it's not like about, like, you know, like it's not just something that we did was not something that we talked about.

583
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:57,300
It's like, you know, I have no idea.

584
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:03,360
And I just spilled the beans on. I am like. Yeah.

585
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,850
I mean, anything you say.

586
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:13,350
Like, you guys go all your best. Oh, yeah.

587
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,940
Yeah. And I think breaks in between that, you know, God.

588
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:23,820
And like, I'm here, I'm asking where my real name is.

589
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:28,860
We're all just like, Oh, yeah, I started college in 2010.

590
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:36,540
Yeah, I hear what you say.

591
01:10:37,580 --> 01:11:11,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, not necessarily because I mean, we have got to be able to incorporate like, like sex disordered eating right now.

592
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:30,490
And I think I recognize that there are things going on right now.

593
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:47,010
It's like I know, you know, like really, really go through how this has to be, you know, it's all true.

594
01:11:48,480 --> 01:12:34,410
I guess, guys, just like I said, I'd be like, Oh yeah, you can kind of see what I said.

595
01:12:34,630 --> 01:13:08,810
I actually think I'm losing weight because I am not, but I'm not like so I don't like I know,

596
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:35,290
like, yeah, I like it because I already I feel like I have to get up like last gasp.

597
01:13:35,400 --> 01:14:34,860
So I like, I think I got something to with this class Friday, but it's not like I don't it's hard for me to get up at night.

598
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:51,490
I'm like, you know, I sound like I'm white.

599
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:28,680
I don't. Also, I would like to ask you how you're doing by now.

600
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:42,320
I don't know if someone is like making you.

601
01:15:43,090 --> 01:16:01,420
It's like. That's much more than just where I am.

602
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,540
But I honestly, I. I don't know what that's like.

603
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:34,280
It has to be double spaced because my daughter I was born on August 25.

604
01:16:43,770 --> 01:17:36,489
So it's just something like it's high time that I was lucky that I have talk to me, that I was funny and I was like, I don't know.

605
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:40,700
I was on top of the line. I was like, I just.

606
01:17:42,410 --> 01:18:11,200
You're right not to get out and you go home.

607
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:16,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:21,290
You know, presentation, dirty money.

609
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:42,790
You know, he can't even say something because I'm not sure it was 3.000.

610
01:18:43,190 --> 01:19:03,950
That's how difficult the first time was down there in person or online.

611
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:14,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

612
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,006
Yeah. You got the high caliber.
