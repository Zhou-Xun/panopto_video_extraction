1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:25,030
So. Yeah.

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:41,000
Right. Better.

3
00:00:49,340 --> 00:01:02,900
Look at. Is that right, everyone?

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:49,160
I mean, I. The idea is just that there is a Puerto Rican state like riding in San Francisco before we signed up for the class this time.

5
00:01:49,580 --> 00:02:01,190
And then yeah, just watching it because I'm not the one who is usually.

6
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:29,950
Yeah, I. So how?

7
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,850
Yeah. There's a form to get behind. So just like for you to feel that you feel good about election.

8
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,900
Yeah. So there's some make up for last.

9
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,220
But yeah. I mean, I think for.

10
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:35,040
John. I think he's just like his mother.

11
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,730
Yeah. I wonder if I lost interest in you.

12
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,770
Yeah, maybe I got cut off or something, but. Yeah, as long as you wrote down, I think.

13
00:04:06,870 --> 00:05:15,170
So. I.

14
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:42,850
I. Hi, guys.

15
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:46,950
Oh, that's nice. I.

16
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:11,530
Yeah. I.

17
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,390
Nice.
