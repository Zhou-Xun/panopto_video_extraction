1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,446
Hi everyone, this is the quick review video for

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:08,119
a lipid transport which is the last lecture in the lipid unit.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,841
So we'll be talking about how chylomycrons have triglycerides.

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,025
And then when they empty their triglycerides content and

5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:19,040
to other cells they become chylomycrons remnants.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,966
And VLDL also has high triglyceride content, and

7
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:29,134
then when it empties its contents it becomes an LDL.

8
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,545
And so VLDL is formed in the liver and

9
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:38,366
as opposed there's some synthesis also an adipose tissue.

10
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:42,161
For those particles in the blood and

11
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:47,240
basically the contents of those are over here.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,350
So a kind of mycron would have high triglyceride content, whereas VLDL.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,280
Over here has also a high triglyceride content but

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,930
not the highest because it's still less than chylomycrons.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,253
It also has some phospholipids and cholesterol and LDL has even less,

16
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:11,990
the yellow part over here even less triglycerides.

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,262
And it has more cholesterol, so far LDL is the highest in cholesterol and

18
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:20,740
chylomycron is the highest in triglycerides.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,007
And finally you have an HDL which has a protein and phospholipids and

20
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:31,240
very minimal triglyceride and cholesterol over here.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,611
[COUGH] So this is a summary for the particle, so

22
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:39,631
think of the apolipoproteins as being like an identification code.

23
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,996
So it's just a protein that tags the lipid particle so

24
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:47,700
that you know where it's been synthesized.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,801
So everything that has a B-48 is coming from the interior side.

26
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:54,509
So from the small intestine and diet and

27
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,140
everything will be 100 is coming from the liver.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,630
So VLDL, IDL, LDL those all related to the liver,

29
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,651
whereas chylomychrons are coming from the dietary fat.

30
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:14,440
So this is why they have B-48, keep in mind that C2 activates lipoprotein lipase.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,431
So C2 would make lipoprotein lipase activity higher.

32
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:25,215
By which life of protein lipase would be able to empty

33
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:28,663
the triglyceride content from that particle.

34
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:32,481
And absorb the triglycerides into whichever cell that is expressing

35
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:33,090
that LPL.

36
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,953
So let's say I have a VLDL that just

37
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:42,985
got bound into into the LPL receptor

38
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:47,200
of a muscle cell for example.

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,003
Then that muscle will now absorb all of the triglycerides content

40
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:59,240
from VLDL because C2 activate LPL activity.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,627
So production of VLDL by the liver as we mentioned, so

42
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:05,504
VLDL will be recognized by the LPL receptor.

43
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:11,520
And it will empty its triglycerides content into a cell and

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,990
then it becomes an LDL.

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,740
And then the LDL itself can either go back to the liver or

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,258
it can be engulfed entirely by a tissue.

47
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:26,643
And if VLDL gets engulfed then you can imagine that since VLDL has very high

48
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,065
cholesterol content.

49
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,390
Then that tissue will now have high cholesterol content and

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,200
this is especially important.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,845
If tissues are running low on cholesterol then they would want to engulf more LDL

52
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:41,540
which is high in cholesterol.

53
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,070
So as we just mentioned fatty acids is due to the activity of lipoprotein lipase.

54
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,645
The triglycerides will be released from VLDL or the chylomycron and

55
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:58,081
they will enter a cell, and this is due to LPL activity.

56
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:02,313
And LPL is highly expressed in the heart and muscle and fat,

57
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:07,141
you can imagine that the heart really uses fat as a source of energy.

58
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:11,832
So it's important that the heart can get as much triglycerides as possible, so

59
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,300
this is why LPL would be high in the heart.

60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,560
The muscle also needs energy and the fat as well to be able to store it.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,725
And by default keep in mind that those the VLDL and

62
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:26,200
chylomycron there in the circulation.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,065
So it's really important that we have mechanisms that can remove

64
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,391
the triglycerides content from them.

65
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:36,933
Or else if we did not have LPL activity then we would end up having very high

66
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:40,000
triglycerides in the blood which is unhealthy.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,491
So you always need the LPL activity to be functional and

68
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:50,944
a healthy manner to allow for removal of triglycerides from the bloodstream.

69
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:55,769
And storing it into cells or taking it up into cells and using it for

70
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,040
energy production.

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,240
So control of LPL activity, so

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,156
we did mention that PPARa over here promotes oxidation.

73
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:12,368
And inhibits triglycerides synthesis and

74
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:18,580
that was in the metabolism lecture, so just keep that in mind.

75
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,403
And another thing that PPARa also does is that it inhibits LPL activity.

76
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:29,267
So it inhibits the ability of a cell to remove triglycerides

77
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:33,940
from the VLDL or the chylomycron and use it itself.

78
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,299
And that happens through ANGPTL4, so

79
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:43,322
if ANGPTL4 is active then that means that your LPL would be inactive.

80
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:51,307
Indicating that you are less efficient at absorbing triglycerides from the VLDL or

81
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:57,040
chylomycron and the circulation into SL or a tissue.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,381
So insulin activate LPL activity in the fat, so

83
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,901
this makes sense because insulin means that you just had a meal.

84
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:08,137
You have some excess energy lying around and

85
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:12,079
you would want LPL to absorb that energy and store it.

86
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,640
Especially in the fat and it will inactivate it in the muscle.

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,251
Fasting would inactivate LPL in the fat because you do not want

88
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:24,098
whatever remaining triglycerides.

89
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:28,659
In your bloodstream to go to the fat because the fat doesn't really

90
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,140
require the energy.

91
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,987
But instead you'd want the muscle to be able to

92
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:36,861
utilize their remaining triglycerides in your circulation.

93
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:42,085
So fasting would activate LPL in the muscle, so think of LPL as trying

94
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:47,231
to feed the muscles, so LPL would try to feed a cell triglycerides.

95
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:52,262
So you can imagine that if you're fasting it's more crucial that your

96
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:57,310
muscle is being fed those triglycerides but not your fat for example.

97
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,969
If you are over fed and your insulin is high, then it would make sense that.

98
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:06,521
That excess triglyceride goes into the fat to be stored and

99
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:09,040
not into the muscle to be stored.

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,276
And also intracellular lipids they can suppress LPL activity,

101
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:20,251
so if your cells senses high levels of fatty acids.

102
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:24,593
So over here the excess fatty acids can be sensed, and

103
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:30,881
then PPARa would up regulate NGPTL4 which will inhibit the activity of LPL.

104
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:35,575
So the cell if it knows that it has excess fatty acids it will not be taking in

105
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:39,040
any more triglycerides.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,181
So mutations in the system, so if you have an LPL deficiency then

107
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:47,261
you cannot uptake triglycerides from VLDL and chylomycrons.

108
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:52,250
Which means that you will have more triglycerides in your blood more VLDL

109
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,660
molecules as well.

110
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,399
So if your LPL system isn't working then you can

111
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,280
increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.

112
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,771
So I'm just gonna walk through this very slowly, so

113
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:13,400
lost a function over here of ANGPTL4 would reduce your CVD risk.

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,312
Because if you don't have ANGPTL4,

115
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:21,870
then you're LPL system is always active because you can't inhibit it.

116
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,534
If your LPL system is always active and that means you're

117
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:31,212
always clearing triglycerides from your bloodstream.

118
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:35,140
Which is good and reduces your cardiovascular disease risk.

119
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,133
On the other hand if apo AS is the function is lost then your

120
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:44,000
lipoprotein lipase is not active anymore.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,343
And this causes more triglycerides to remain in the blood

122
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:52,512
leading to having more cardiovascular disease risk.

123
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:58,681
So cholesterol synthesis, so HDL it soaks up any cholesterol from other tissues.

124
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:02,304
So think of it as a sponge and it does the cleaning for

125
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,530
you in the body and absorbs all cholesterol.

126
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,670
And then it's taken up by the liver through SR-B1 but

127
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,840
that's not too efficient.

128
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:19,340
And then HDL can also transfer part of its lipids to the LDL through CETP.

129
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,421
Regulation of LDL uptake, so we said that LDL comes from depleted VLDL.

130
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:29,985
So after VLDL has emptied its triglycerides content through

131
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:34,910
LPL activity like a protein lipase it becomes an LDL.

132
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,535
And also HDL if it transfers some of its cholesterol to an LDL and

133
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:44,640
that's how you get an LDL molecule that is rich in cholesterol.

134
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,191
If you have high hypotensive cholesterol, so

135
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:53,301
we have some mechanisms to down regulate cholesterol synthesis.

136
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:58,394
So if you remember from the synthesis lecture we were saying that

137
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:04,735
if your cell senses that it has low cholesterol then it would activate SREBP2.

138
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:09,529
Because SREBP2 is transcription factor that would enhance

139
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,490
cholesterol uptake and cholesterol synthesis.

140
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,450
But if the cell which is what this is saying senses that there is

141
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,111
high cholesterol inside it, especially in the hypothesize over here.

142
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,990
Then you would have inactivation of SREBP2 because you do not want

143
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,650
to synthesize more cholesterol and you do not want to uptake more cholesterol.

144
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,230
So what would happen is that you would have less LDL receptors.

145
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,138
So you are less able to engulf an LDL molecule which is high in cholesterol

146
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,410
into your liver because you already have a lot of cholesterol.

147
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,740
So you are better off not engulfing the LDL through the LDL receptor.

148
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,612
And also you will have less HMGCR reductase activity which is as we said

149
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,270
the rate limiting step to synthesize cholesterol.

150
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,036
So if your liver is sensing that there's high cholesterol it will not want to

151
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,307
make cholesterol.

152
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:10,740
And it will also not want to engulf LDL molecules that are high in cholesterol.

153
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,679
So this is a study over here that has shown that the more

154
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,990
saturated fat you eat then the more cholesterol you have.

155
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,991
And coronary like heart disease events are proportional to how

156
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:30,140
much cholesterol you have, so more cholesterol more CVD risk and so on.

157
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,280
And further studies have linked cardiac risk to having high LDL and low HDL.

158
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,875
So we can't really say that only HDL is good and LDL is bad, so

159
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,506
I'm not going to use those terms.

160
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:48,770
I'm just going to use that higher LDL is considered to be less healthy.

161
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,819
But having a lower HDL is also considered to be less healthy and

162
00:11:53,819 --> 00:12:01,040
having a higher HDL is considered to be more healthy, if that makes sense.

163
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,352
So some LDL differences over here, so this is looking

164
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:12,383
at people who have some genetically lower LDL cholesterol.

165
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:17,590
Versus people who have lower LDL cholesterol because they're taking a drug.

166
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,541
And so when you're taking a drug by default,

167
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:25,761
this drug is like immediately acting on reducing your LDL cholesterol levels.

168
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,779
So you would have a decrease in risk whereas if you

169
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,311
genetically have lower LDL cholesterol.

170
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:38,125
You might have risk reduction that's more

171
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:43,881
prominent just because this is a lifetime change.

172
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:51,140
So you can't really modify a genetic variation that you have over here.

173
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,906
So the risks can be different depending on whether someone is taking

174
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:58,169
a drug to reduce their CVD risk.

175
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:03,033
And whether someone by default has genetic is predisposed to having lower

176
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:07,540
LDL which is considered healthier in this case.

177
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,291
So other studies in this we've seen it before, trans fat correlate or

178
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,571
is associated with more mortality followed by saturated fat.

179
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,521
And there is reduced risk when you're consuming more mono or

180
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,040
poly unsaturated fats.

181
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,850
And then we also have the study over here that was saying that total

182
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,931
mortality is increasing with more carbohydrates intake over here.

183
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:37,745
So excess carbohydrates intake has been associated with higher mortality,

184
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:38,650
for example.

185
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,330
And then energy from fat over here I believe

186
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,410
their risk is modest, it's not increasing.

187
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,940
So saturated fat intake over here has not been shown to increase mortality risk.

188
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,683
But they only found in this pure study that excess carb intake

189
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,930
increases mortality risk.

190
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,295
So it's quite interesting how different studies are finding different things,

191
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:09,649
but keep in mind that their methods are different.

192
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,181
Their participants are different and so

193
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:15,391
it's only fair that they have different results.

194
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:21,591
For example, the first study only had Americans from a very limited populations.

195
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:26,077
So this isn't very inclusive of other people who live in America,

196
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:28,440
the pure study was very global.

197
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,845
The lifestyle socioeconomic status were different,

198
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:37,065
different adjusting for other factors was easier.

199
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:39,054
Because you had a smaller population over here,

200
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:41,246
whereas when you have a higher population is harder.

201
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:46,635
But they both said that saturated fats would increase

202
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:51,680
your LDL level, so there is consensus over here.

203
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,643
But the effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease has been

204
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,341
shown to increase cardiovascular disease.

205
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:02,789
So more saturated fat intake more cardiovascular disease,

206
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,640
and one study the Framingham MCHS, NHS and so on.

207
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,141
But the pure study has shown a decreased association which is over here.

208
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:17,413
So we are less prone to total mortality as we're eating

209
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:25,240
more saturated fatty acids, so it's quite interesting.

210
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,892
So this is another study that looked at whether we need to be measuring the LDL

211
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:32,011
particle or the LDL cholesterol.

212
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:37,701
So the difference between the two is that LDLP, it looks at the apolipoprotein.

213
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:43,840
So how many particles, so how many molecules kind of LDL do you have?

214
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,275
But the other one,

215
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:50,230
the LDLC is looking at how much cholesterol in the LDL do you have?

216
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,774
So this is looking at the content of LDL because you can have LDL that is not too

217
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,140
high in cholesterol.

218
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,813
Whereas you can have LDL that's very high in cholesterol and

219
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:03,784
this is looking at how much LDL you have in the blood to begin with.

220
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:08,430
So you can have less LDL particles or high LDL particles.

221
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,802
And so what they agreed on is that if you have high LDL particles over here.

222
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:21,341
Then your risk, your incidents over here cumulative incidence is increasing.

223
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:25,663
So you are more at risk of having disease and

224
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:29,865
maybe I'm unsure if that was mortality or

225
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:38,640
disease but I can check real quick.

226
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,607
Yes this was CVD risk, so

227
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:45,957
as long as you have high LDL particles disregarding their content.

228
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,835
Their content they can have low cholesterol or

229
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:51,279
high cholesterol it doesn't matter.

230
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,257
You will always be at an increased risk, whereas if you have low LDL particles so

231
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,840
by default you do not have a lot of LDL in your blood.

232
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,914
But whether that LDL has low cholesterol in it or high cholesterol.

233
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:09,907
Does not affect your risk over here which is still lower than when

234
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,420
you have a lot of LDL particles.

235
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,526
So this study is kind of insightful because people are thinking whether.

236
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:21,663
We need to be looking at how many LDL particles do we have in total,

237
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,720
is that indicative of CVD risk?

238
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,481
Or should we be looking at how much cholesterol is in that particle?

239
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,148
Which one is more indicative and

240
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:33,611
according to this study over here then it's the particle number.

241
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:38,671
So how much LDL you have overall is what is determining your risk.

242
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,413
So more LDL particles,

243
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:45,738
disregarding their cholesterol content would indicate a higher risk.

244
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:50,175
And then lower LDL particles in the blood are disregarding their

245
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:53,840
cholesterol content would reduce risk.

246
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,176
So another thing to keep in mind is that LDL particles, if they're small and

247
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,111
they have less cholesterol in them, for example.

248
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,427
Then they are pebble like over here, so

249
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:10,361
if they are pebble like then they can really get stuck in circulation.

250
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:17,162
So as they're traveling in blood vessels, they can get stuck and cause fat build up.

251
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:22,131
And the vessels which will eventually cause the vessels to become narrower and

252
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:22,900
narrower.

253
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,248
And eventually this can lead to blocking of the vessels so

254
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:32,694
your blood can no longer pass through the vessel and this is very risky.

255
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,480
It can lead to stroke and so on.

256
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,563
So if anything, you would rather have bigger LDL particles

257
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:46,700
that have more cholesterol in them and that have fluffyer cholesterols over here.

258
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,601
The bigger the LDL particle and the more fluffy it is and less compact it is.

259
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:58,364
Then the less likely it is to get stuck in your arteries and

260
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:03,240
cause the build up of fat in the vessels.

261
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,551
So just something to keep in mind and if you want the answer for here.

262
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:11,582
So basically saturated fats they are very

263
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:15,571
tightly packed because they don't have double bond.

264
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:22,640
So we don't have the kinks and we don't have a more fluffy particle.

265
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,990
So they're packaged more tightly and so when they become cholesterol,

266
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,571
they are very small and tightly packaged.

267
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:33,265
So if that cholesterol is forming an LDL molecules, so

268
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:38,103
if the majority of your LDL cholesterol is coming from saturated fats.

269
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:42,611
Then it's most likely that your LDL will be smaller in size and

270
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:45,750
more likely to get stuck in your arteries.

271
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,247
Whereas if the cholesterol that's in your LDL is

272
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:54,974
coming from PUFAs which are very kind of branched.

273
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:59,386
And less compact then your LDL will be bigger and

274
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:03,270
less likely to get stuck in your vessels.

275
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,189
So it really depends on the type of cholesterol that's in LDL that

276
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:11,341
would determine whether that LDL would be bigger in size or smaller.

277
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:16,333
So saturated fatty acids are more compact, causing the LDL to be smaller and

278
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,240
more likely to get stuck.

279
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,669
Whereas if you have a bigger molecule that has cholesterol comes from PUFAs.

280
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:27,616
Which are fluffy by default, then the LDL molecule will be bigger and

281
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:33,840
less likely to get stuck, leading to a better prognosis and a better outcome.

282
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,859
And that's it.
