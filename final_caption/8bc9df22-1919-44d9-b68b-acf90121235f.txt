1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,920
Hey, how's it going, everyone? My name is Malcolm Cunningham. I am the manager for the EBEID Center and the Uptown EBEID neighborhood.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,390
Promise we'll talk about that a little bit more as we get into this presentation,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,470
but I'm here today to talk to you all about food insecurity. How do you address it?

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,080
How do you understand it? How do you address and develop interventions at scale?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,970
Ok, so that's what we're going to be talking about today.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,840
So I always like to start just by talking a bit about myself as selfish and as straightforward and as that is.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,140
So I'just who am I? How is food insecurity relevant to my life and to my work?

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,600
Well first off, I have some lived experience with food insecurity so it is a very tangible real thing for me.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,270
Beyond that, I've been involved in a number of initiatives and projects. I was on the board for Food for Thought,

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,460
A nonprofit organization in Toledo that provides mobile choice food pantries throughout the city

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,630
that's based on where the highest levels of need are in the community.

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,470
I've been involved in urban agriculture, teaching youth how to grow food for a decade plus

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,570
at this point we actually had a third of an acre with an orchard and and all sorts of fresh food,

14
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,080
and the youth would buy shares essentially by participating in the program.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,510
So it was a way to increase access for those that were clearly food insecure.

16
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,440
I've been involved in the policy space with the Urban Agriculture Alliance,

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,810
which was an initiative to change some of the zoning laws around urban agriculture so

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,120
that more people could grow food with less barriers and with more support from the city.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,500
So a pretty exciting project that I worked on. So some of these pictures are just from the work that I've been doing throughout my career.

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:59,790
This little soup and sandwich thing is from an event that we hosted or we helped host with some of the youth from the gardening program that I ran.

21
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,000
The other thing is the way tha I got connected to FPHLP was through my work when I was working up

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,650
at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in the Public Health Action Support Team.

23
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:20,190
So that program basically creates experiential learning opportunities for graduate level students in the School of Public Health.

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,240
One of those projects was a partnership with the Detroit Food Policy Council,

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,260
which combined stakeholders from throughout the system, throughout the food system in Detroit in order to address issues at scale.

26
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:41,280
So that's everything from restaurant tours to urban agriculture to food and security organizations to schools,

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,470
to, you know, warehouses that supply all sorts of different food items.

28
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,260
So just attempting to address issues at scale and attempting to provide that sort of support was,

29
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,140
I would say, an introduction to a macro level work addressing food insecurity.

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,570
like much further removed from, you know, growing food alongside you,

31
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:11,160
literally soil level work so that I can really understand how folks go about addressing issues at scale.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,580
So those are some of my experiences. And now, like I said, I manage the Ebeid Center.

33
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,620
And on the first floor of this building, we have a grocery store.

34
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:32,280
So Promedica is a health system that focuses on the social determinants of health, which I'm sure you all heard at this point in your program.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,240
So basically, you know, where you work, where you live, what you eat, what you have access to helps you determine your health and well-being.

36
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:48,280
So the Promedica Ebeid Center is an attempt to basically create a place based hub for addressing social determinants of health.

37
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:56,730
And this building is the thing that I manage and that I work alongside a number of partners, including our folks in the grocery store,

38
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,770
to make sure that we provide access to all of those things that help to determine health and well-being.

39
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:09,030
So before this grocery store was brought in in 2015, this was a food desert.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,440
We lacked access to healthy and affordable food.

41
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,790
So that is my career. That is my background, my lived experience that has kind of gotten me here today.

42
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:30,060
So we're gonna start just by hoping to develop a shared understanding of what food insecurity is and honestly what it isnt.

43
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:38,230
So, you know, the very first thing that I want to start with is what is food insecurity and how many people are actually affected by this?

44
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:48,210
OK. So the what is inconsistent household access to adequate food that's needed to maintain or sustain an active and healthy life.

45
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,880
So there are lots of pieces that go into that, right? It's it's not just insecurity.

46
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,590
It's not just food. It's it's about adequacy. It's about sustaining an active life.

47
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,190
It's about sustaining a healthy life. So there are a number of pieces of parts that actually go into it.

48
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,380
And like I said, we will get much deeper into food insecurity throughout this presentation.

49
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,030
So how many people are affected before Covid?

50
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,140
About 50 million people, somewhere between 37 and 50 million people, or about one in nine Americans.

51
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:29,410
So pretty significant. Right. It ranges across all age ranges, age ranges, excuse me, from infants through elders.

52
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,060
It's all races and ethnicities. And it's actually across a number of socio economic conditions.

53
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,950
There are lots of pieces and parts that go into that. I could riff on, you know,

54
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:46,130
the issues with the way that we define poverty and how that ends up impacting

55
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,670
what folks are actually eligible for in order to address food insecurity,

56
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,530
in order to address hunger. But we'll just hold off for now. OK.

57
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,390
I will hold off for now.

58
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:05,630
So one of the things that I thought was pretty important is to help us clarify, understand the difference between food insecurity and hunger.

59
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,420
OK, so with food insecurity, we've already defined it.

60
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,870
It's a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life.

61
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,970
Whereas with hunger, it is a personal, physical sensation of discomfort.

62
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:27,920
OK. So it is an individual level thing that a person feels that they experience that's telling them they're in trouble.

63
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,970
There's something going on. Got to get this figured out. Right. So with hunger, it's that personal sensation.

64
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,800
There are potentially long term consequences that come with that.

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,730
I think we all know what happens when you're hunger hungry for a long enough time.

66
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,910
Right. It's also an individual level indicator.

67
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,950
It is not something that we typically measure at scale.

68
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:03,240
When we're thinking about like attempting to address food security or attempting to increase food security.

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,540
And the other thing is it can, of course, lead to all sorts of poor immediate health outcomes,

70
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:18,200
like consider consider the impact that lack of access to food and the physical sensation of hunger can have on the ability to concentrate in school.

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,270
Consider the impact that, you know, blood glucose excuse me,

72
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:30,410
blood glucose levels can have again on my ability to concentrate on the likelihood of

73
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,180
going to the emergency room or the ability to survive and make it through a day at work.

74
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:45,380
There are so many issues that come with acute hunger. OK. On the food insecurity side, it often includes something that is not always perceived.

75
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,670
Right? So you can be food insecure and not know it.

76
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,080
And to be honest with you. That was my earliest experience food insecurity.

77
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,100
I think I knew or I understood that there was inconsistent access at a number of points in my life,

78
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,280
but I was never saying, oh, I'm food insecure or oh, this is a wild issue.

79
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,620
It just became a part of the background of my life.

80
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:17,230
And I would go to football practice and like not understand why I couldn't do that last spring or why I couldn't,

81
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,410
you know, finish this play or why I can do this or why couldn't do that.

82
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:29,750
It's because I had inconsistent access to food and I was attempting to do something that was active and I literally did

83
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:37,230
not have enough nutrients or calories in order to actually do the things that I wanted to do or that I needed to do.

84
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,610
So that's food insecurity, folks. Right.

85
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:50,540
So it's not always perceived, but it is a thing that is real regardless. Micro nutrient deficiency is also kind of interesting piece of it.

86
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,350
Sometimes we have food, but it's junk, right?

87
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,510
So sometimes it's it's easier to think of it like a food swamp than a food desert.

88
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:07,310
If you can access a corner store and get all sorts of poor food items, if you can go to I don't know a Rally's, a McDonald's or whatever else.

89
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:16,700
No disrespect to them, then you may not be getting the nutrients that are actually needed, but you may actually be feeling satiated or satiated.

90
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,170
So you may not actually feel the hunger, but you're still having that micro nutrient deficiency.

91
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,150
So that's something else that's important to keep in mind when we're talking about food insecurity.

92
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,940
And the other thing is it's typically a household level indicator.

93
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:38,750
OK. So it it. Individuals can be food insecure the way that we define it in order to understand issues at

94
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,560
scale is by looking at households in order to understand how things are at the household level.

95
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,530
OK, so those are the differences between food insecurity and hunger.

96
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:57,660
Hopefully that provides some clarity and helps you understand when a person is describing hunger versus food insecurity.

97
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,310
So digging deep into the food security measure.

98
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,090
Right. So around 2006, there were a number of recommendations that came out at the USDA and a number

99
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,370
of partners that had been working in the space of addressing food security.

100
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,370
And what they said was, we have to really clarify what hunger versus food insecurity means.

101
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,110
And we also have to define the levels or the types that exist within food security

102
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,600
and food insecurity so that we can all operate off of the same definition.

103
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,360
And so that we can also, you know, just like figure out what the needles are that need to be moved.

104
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,620
Is it taking everyone from low food security to marginal food security?

105
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:48,090
Is it moving everyone to high food security? What is possible? What are the gaps when thinking about things with this level of complexity?

106
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:57,870
So it was done to help us all kind of clarify, arrive at the same conclusion and develop strategies all together.

107
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:06,780
Right. So that's one of the values. I guess this isn't as completely connected to this conversation about food security and insecurity,

108
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:13,170
but the value of defining and creating shared terms that everyone agrees to,

109
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,490
it's actually a really important piece of all of the work that you'll do, OK?

110
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:28,440
Defining shared terms, creating shared terms and deciding how to measure success and how to measure, you know, issues at scale.

111
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,450
OK. A really important piece. All right. I'll get off my soapbox I'll get back to the food security.

112
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,510
So food security, there are two different levels.

113
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:45,630
So high food security is when there are no reported indications of food access problems or limitations.

114
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,930
So you're good to go. There's nothing to report here. Whenever you need access to food, you can get it.

115
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,990
Nothing to say about that. So that's high food security. Marginal food security

116
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,680
typically on the scale that we use to measure food security, there are one or two indicators that they hit.

117
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,550
It's typically around anxiety over food sufficiency or an actual shortage of food in the house.

118
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,740
And there isn't necessarily indication of changes in diet or food intake as a result.

119
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,150
So it's about the fear and it's about the occasional shortages,

120
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,160
but it isn't necessarily about changes in the way that you're consuming food in order to make it last a little bit.

121
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,220
OK? Food insecurity, on the other hand, there are two different levels

122
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:40,080
once again. So low food security means that you've reduced the quality, the variety or the desirability of the diet

123
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,280
but there still isn't a clear indication of reduced food intake.

124
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,720
So.

125
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:55,720
This is actually where another teem that I'll do my best not to get off on to a tangent, but this is also where something like food sovereignty would come in,

126
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,690
where access to culturally appropriate and relevant foods is pretty important for I mean,

127
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:09,760
pretty much every group and addressing and moving the needle when it comes to sovereignty

128
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,290
would mean that you're actually providing access to safe and culturally appropriate food.

129
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:21,220
So people that are in that category would typically be experiencing low food security.

130
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,120
So low food security that's pretty much it.

131
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,260
And then with very low food security, there are a number of indications on these scales that we provide that food patterns

132
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:41,560
have been disrupted and a person or a household has had to reduce their food intake.

133
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:49,000
I mean, I'm not going to make it personal too often, but I will say that I have been at every single stage on this measure.

134
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,820
And to be honest with you, I think as I've talked it through, I'm sure that many of you all have as well.

135
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,670
So it's important to be able to kind of understand and tease out what these different levels mean,

136
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,310
not just for ourselves, but for understanding how to really address an issue.

137
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,820
Really moving the needle means really understanding what it is hyper specific that we're trying to address.

138
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:21,220
OK. So, yeah, the other thing that I think I did not include on here is that hunger, like I said,

139
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,380
is typically associated with very low food security as opposed to the other categories that exist.

140
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,220
So I have a tiny chart, tiny little table for you all to take a look at.

141
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:43,780
So this is the percentage of household again for food insecurity reporting indicators of adult food insecurity by food security standards.

142
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:51,370
OK. So what that means is what are these things in the survey that is used to measure

143
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,500
food insecurity that different groups of people are reporting they experience?

144
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:04,360
OK. So those that are food secure are rarely reporting any of these issues.

145
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,760
And then as they go up a little bit higher,

146
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:16,670
they become worried that food would not run or food would run out and that it won't last and that they can't afford to purchase a balanced meal.

147
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:25,250
And then as you continue to go up further and further, these indicators just like happen to increase to increase to increase.

148
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,270
So another way to look at it. Let's see if I can get this to come up.

149
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:35,030
Doesn't look like. There we go.

150
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:41,880
OK. So this is just another another iteration of that same chart.

151
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,350
Perhaps it's a little bit easier to read. So the green is food secure

152
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:53,670
the purple is low food security and the yellow, again, associated hunger is very low food security.

153
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,440
OK. So purples and reds, you can see purples and yellows.

154
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,470
You can see just struggling with a lot more of those indicators that we typically use.

155
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:14,100
So if you were ever going to do a community survey to understand food security in your neighborhood,

156
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:22,800
in your community, in your city, you would probably use a scale that is similar to this or this scale

157
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,510
exactly. And would be able to kind of divvy that up into different categories once you brought in some of the secondary data,

158
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,370
which I'm sure you all are going to be. Right

159
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:41,220
So if you wanted to collect, you know, age, ethnicity, you know, I don't know, sexual identity, whatever those things are.

160
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,720
And once you hit the right number,

161
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,340
you would actually be able to understand if there are any sorts of connections between those and levels of security.

162
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,960
So another important interesting. There we go.

163
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,280
OK. So we've talked a bit about what the issues are.

164
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,730
We've defined the difference between, you know, food insecurity and hunger.

165
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,840
We've dove a bit deeper into what food insecurity actually is when breaking it into,

166
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,910
you know, food security versus food insecurity and the different levels within those two.

167
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,010
So now that we've talked about those things, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the barrier.

168
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:32,680
So what are the barriers? Why is this happening? What's going on that leads to food security issues?

169
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,520
So I'll just give you all a couple of seconds to think about it.

170
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,770
I won't play the Jeopardy music.

171
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:52,990
I won't ask you to to respond in a question form, but I'm curious about what you think are the barriers for households and for individuals.

172
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,080
OK. OK. I'm pretending to hear your answers in your responses.

173
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,650
Right. So. There are a number of things that go into it, right?

174
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:14,970
There is there is consistent access, which typically when it comes to an urban environment, is considered less than a mile limited transportation.

175
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,540
I'm I'm sorry.

176
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:25,470
More than a mile limited transportation when it comes to accessing a full service grocery store, meaning a grocery store that has fruits,

177
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:34,890
vegetables, meat, dairy, grains, all the components that go on to a consistent, healthy food or healthy meal.

178
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:42,600
So access is one thing when there's lack of access and it's more than a mile, that's typically considered a food desert.

179
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,870
There are all sorts of issues with that name. There are all sorts of critiques. We won't get into that right now.

180
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,830
The other barrier, of course, is cost. This is actually pretty interesting.

181
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,420
So when we first started this grocery store,

182
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,810
one of the issues that we struggled with was the perception that because it looks like a high quality space,

183
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:12,630
because it looks nothing like the corner stores or the grocery store that they've typically been able to access in our neighborhood.

184
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:21,180
There was concern that the costs were too high. And, you know, the more we've dug into it the more we attempted to, one,

185
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:28,300
change the narrative around cost and do that by doing cost comparisons between ourselves and our other competitors,

186
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,070
be they Meijer or Kroger or wherever else. It may not be allowed to say that.

187
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,310
Right. And the other thing is we've worked to bring in things that reduce the actual costs of the food.

188
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,240
So, you know, there's there's a. Oh, wow.

189
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:50,280
I just blanked on the name of it. Produce Perks there's a produce perks program that we have where any person can come in

190
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,440
and if they spend 20 dollars on fruits and vegetables, be they frozen or fresh.

191
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:04,200
You can double those dollars up. So it's it's similar to the double up, double up food bucks program that's at a number of farmer's markets.

192
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,190
So we have that program as well. Another barrier, like I said, is transportation.

193
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,210
If you can't access it, if you have to hop on a bus and go, you know, 10 miles to get to your next grocery store,

194
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,990
it limits the amount of food that you can even bring back home. Convenience in time.

195
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,970
If you got a couple of jobs or you got a couple of kids or you got all sorts of moving parts.

196
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:41,510
The reality is the easiest thing to do is to provide access to cheap, quick, less nutrient dense, possibly poor, bad for your health foods.

197
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:49,020
Right. So that's another thing that's that's an issue. Another thing that comes to mind that's important to consider is cooking skills.

198
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:57,510
Right. So when I one of the one of the things that that I would say really just built my passion,

199
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:03,420
got my fire kind of burning when it came to the urban agriculture workers that I was doing.

200
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,540
Was that so many of the youth that I worked with didn't really know of various vegetables were.

201
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,030
Didn't know that the end products like ketchup, like barbecue sauce, like pizza,

202
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,650
like whatever those things are, came from something that was growing in the ground.

203
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,170
So there was this disconnect, like quite literally a disconnect between where their food comes from,

204
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,860
what they consume, how they feel, what their health is. OK.

205
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,770
So one of the critical pieces of the gardening program that we ran was the cooking component.

206
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,260
So every single class, we made some sort of snack or meal together.

207
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,800
And we actually would have family dinners that we brought in chefs so that they could,

208
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,030
you know, prepare a meal alongside the family using produce grown from the garden.

209
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,770
And we would also send them home with recipes for all the food that they were harvesting.

210
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:58,890
So that the food wouldn't go to waste. And also so that they could kind of build that efficacy when it comes to comfort

211
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,010
with cooking and also comfort with consuming these types of food. So limited knowledge,

212
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:14,070
personal preference and taste, Cooking skills. Those are some of the I guess I would say, the psychological aspects that come in to,

213
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:21,050
you know, really being able to address and improve upon food security.

214
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:32,890
OK. So. What are the impacts of limited access to food over time defined as food insecurity?

215
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,220
So for individuals and households, there have been so much, there've been so many, so many,

216
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,690
so many different types of research that have occurred over the last maybe 20 years,

217
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:53,070
probably longer than that, kind of attempting to really tease out and connect food insecurity at a household level to other health outcomes.

218
00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:02,470
So, OK, be they behaviors, be they chronic disease, be they ability to perform in another domain entirely.

219
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:09,040
So with individuals and household, it's been directly connected, especially for children with anemia,

220
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:17,560
with cognitive problems and with, you know, eventual prediabetes across the rest of the age range,

221
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:25,030
fair to poor self reported help, which is a pretty important indicator because it's about quality of life just as much as

222
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,510
it is a thing that typically can connect to one's ability to improve health conditions.

223
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:40,000
If you believe that your health is poor, then sometimes there's a lack of belief in your ability to improve it. Ok.

224
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,850
And honestly, depression and other mental health issues have been connected to every age range once again.

225
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:53,560
And as we get older and older, those other chronic conditions like diabetes and the hypertension, come into play.

226
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:03,010
So I have another question for you all. How do these things, these individual and household level impacts, affect communities?

227
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:10,930
And how do they affect America as a whole? Right. Thinking about a community, thinking about a neighborhood, thinking about a city

228
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,770
Thinking about a country, thinking about a state. I guess I should have done that in order right.

229
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:28,560
But, yeah, I'd love to kind of get your thoughts on how this impacts things that are broader than the household level.

230
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,150
Pretending to hear what you are saying again. So I.

231
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,640
Yes, I agree. Unless I don't agree.

232
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,110
And so the other thing that I wanted to pull up is just that social determinants of health idea.

233
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,890
Right. So, you know,

234
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:53,310
at the point where you are going to the emergency room or you are going to the doctor to manage

235
00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:01,260
those chronic disease conditions that you are living with in your mid thirties and up it honestly,

236
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,010
it actually is only about 20 percent of your health.

237
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,310
Right.

238
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:15,060
So the other 80 percent, the large the large largest percentage comes back to all these other things that go into your your health and well-being.

239
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,490
So physical environment, health behaviors, socioeconomic factors.

240
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:28,830
These are all things that, again, influence food security and also have impacts on people

241
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:35,700
when they do not have secure access to food. Right. So.

242
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,500
To wrap up this section, I think my my question for all of you is.

243
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:49,970
How could this happen? America has

244
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:57,410
so much farmland. We grow so much food, we waste about a third of it, right.

245
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,550
We've got food banks all over the place.

246
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:08,930
We're all focused on hunger, we're all focused on food security, we're all focused on addressing food insecurity.

247
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:20,390
How does this happen? OK, and so that's the end of this section, and from here,

248
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:29,840
we're going to talk a bit about what we're doing within my work at the Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in the uptown neighborhood in Toledo, Ohio

249
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,890
so that we can get a feel for how addressing these issues looks in a local context.

250
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,240
OK. I'll see all soon.
