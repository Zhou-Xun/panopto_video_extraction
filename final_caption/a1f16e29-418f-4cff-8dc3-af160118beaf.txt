1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,660
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, here we go.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,410
As we're getting more into the semester, I hope we hear.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:23,820
Oh, let me look at our syllabus. Starting to think more kind of about what you're questioning and beyond.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,980
Um, so this one is.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,350
Is my version. So you do have a perusal assignment to this weekend.

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,070
I saw some of you where you finished it. I thought it was due on Saturday.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,380
Oh, it was do. Okay, you're done. All right. Like, go in there, make comments to determine anything.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,930
No, no, no. So. Okay. So I'll need to enter your grades in on canvas, but glad the link worked.

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,790
So basically coming up, you'll have a quiz, another perusal assignment.

10
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:05,370
But your pilot work or questionnaire will be do with the write up will be due at the end of October, which it's basically almost the end of September.

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,510
So in about a month, just before you know it, how many of you have an idea of what you what you want to do?

12
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm narrowing down. Okay. But so like a nugget of an idea of, like, categories that I'm interested in.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,830
Like, um. Yeah, if anyone was most impaired, heard.

14
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:34,660
Most interesting. Okay. Okay. Well, we're again, they're going to like the week before Saturday.

15
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,339
Oh, I need to finish just the last week's lecture. I'm sorry. Uh, I swear I will get caught up.

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,940
I think I will get caught up today, actually. Are you okay?

17
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,070
Oh, I thought I heard that he did have a jump scare.

18
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,810
Oh, good. Okay. Page turner. Oh, okay.

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,280
So this is where we left off. So we were like, well, implementing surveys are not as simple as it seems.

20
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,350
So how do you think safety climate is improved?

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,670
Josh? I mean, definitely, I think a lot of workers, if they I mean, a lot of a lot of workplaces might be like, we care a lot about safety.

22
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,909
But like the actual walking the walk, as in like someone gets injured, the manager comes down is like, okay, I don't care that this happened.

23
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,390
I just want to prevent this kind of attitude. I think that kind of shows.

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,500
Um, yeah. Yeah. Kind of from a leadership standpoint.

25
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,469
Yes. Yes. So, I mean, you know, arguably, yes.

26
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:53,460
You have to have leadership modeled the importance and walk the walk, not just talk the talk in order to get people to follow through on it.

27
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:02,970
So actions that improve safety climate will frequently improve things in safety, like knowledge, motivation, contextual behaviors.

28
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:11,310
We've already looked at this. So here, if you look at some broader organizational factors, right, you know,

29
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,879
you have your broader safety culture safety program and practices that feed into safety climate.

30
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,820
We talked about how safety climate is the surface manifestation of safety culture and just like a snapshot of that point in time, right?

31
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,210
So you'll have to take into account the business environment, national culture, organizational vision and strategies,

32
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,550
organizational practices, and then what the organizational climate is looking like.

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:47,309
Yesterday I had this conversation with somebody where I feel like the more you know

34
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,600
is good but also bad because I was trained in workplace and organizational behavior.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:03,180
So I'm super aware of like the way things work and when things are not working well and like, you know,

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,120
and so when people try to have conversations about to me where they think the source of the problems are,

37
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,080
and I'm like, that's not the source of the problem.

38
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,859
It can be super frustrating, right.

39
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,499
But in terms of safety, this, like we said, they mostly focus on physical safety,

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,130
but that can also mean psychological safety as well in the workplace.

41
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,180
So this is built on a solid foundation of action and experience, policies and practices.

42
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,330
Driving perceptions of organizational support are critical to both compliance and contextual

43
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,420
behaviors and ingredients of like a collective sense of making within organizations.

44
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,170
So I would say back in the summer I was doing a training for Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority,

45
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,930
and they're responsible for like the water treatment centers for like ABC and Superior Township.

46
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,080
And I was giving them a training on infectious diseases,

47
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:10,410
and I had a really interesting conversation with this guy afterward who was really vaccine hesitant for for legitimate reasons.

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,569
But he is he's very interesting, right? Because, you know, when you think of a vaccine hesitant person,

49
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,510
I'm sure all of us have in our mind like a picture of like what that kind of stereotypical person would be.

50
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,400
But he was really like actually curious about why the way things were.

51
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,800
And he had volunteered himself to be on like the Health and Safety Committee for Ypsi Community Utilities Authority,

52
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,350
you know, so a lot of places will have voluntary safety committees.

53
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,100
I think last week I mentioned there was that factory in Indiana.

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,550
I did a walk through it that makes like basketball T stands and mats and stuff like that and cause a person had died,

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,530
you know, in that manufacturing facility, they formed their own health and safety committee to kind of prioritize what

56
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,630
they thought should be the biggest action items to bring to their supervisors.

57
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,710
But usually a safety committee is not just workers, it's not just supervisors.

58
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:17,760
It's the the frontline workers, the line supervisors, higher management CEOs, all of those people working together,

59
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:31,589
you know, at Chevron campus, which is in Texas, you know, we have a lot of I love who work at Chevron.

60
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm not a fan of big oil and gas, but you know what they need?

61
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,979
Um, they they need industrial hygienists, right?

62
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:46,940
But they have such a, a culture and climate of safety there that like, even if you're doing as, like if you,

63
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:55,350
even if you're visiting and you're trying to text and walk, somebody will stop you and be like, we don't do that here because it's unsafe.

64
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:04,650
Right? I mean, obviously, like enough explosions and like things catching on fire and bad things have happened where they're like now that vigilant.

65
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:13,830
Unfortunately, though, a lot of times it's like those incidents or like a lot of negative financial repercussions or bad press will kind of.

66
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,240
Push people to not only meet OSHA standards, but exceed them.

67
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,020
So if we think about like you've heard this me give this talk in six on one, Josh, about the OSHA standards.

68
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,770
But like when you're meeting OSHA standards, you can think about you just aiming for like an average,

69
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:41,650
which is a C, a lot of companies are just aiming for that C grade in safety, in occupational health.

70
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,020
Not a lot of people are aiming for that, A,

71
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,110
because they don't have to do right and it's going to cost them more time and money and they don't really like, see or feel a return on investment.

72
00:07:52,220 --> 00:08:00,620
So making sure that the practices and policies are aligned and it's also about changing

73
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:08,749
expectations and altering what the psychological contract is between employers and employees.

74
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,580
So it does involve, to a certain extent, winning over hearts and minds.

75
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,980
Yes. How many how many of you at a workplace have been won over by a pizza party.

76
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,159
Oh, yeah. You. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And feeds the free food and the college student.

77
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,239
Yeah, yeah. But in a workplace if they were like, we treat you horribly, but here's free pizza for like the hero health care stuff.

78
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,010
We're like, they're like, we want less hours and more safety gear and they got a pizza party.

79
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,719
Yeah. So that happened that my mom is working to help, you know, here, here's a pizza that happened at my mom's health care, at my mom's workplace.

80
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:56,660
So my mom is a nurse at a nursing home in California. So, I mean, very early on in the pandemic, we were concerned because then she was like 64.

81
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,290
Pretty healthy, right? Because she's like lifting people and doing all this stuff.

82
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:07,580
But nursing homes aren't considered health care facilities technically, so they don't have any regulations for PPE.

83
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:18,830
So they, of course, had really susceptible residents, but they were charging the nurses for PPE.

84
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,899
So they were charging my mom and her colleagues like $15 for like an N95 and a disposable gown.

85
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:33,800
And so my mom told me this and I was like, excuse me, but English is her fourth language.

86
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:44,240
So me being, of course, the person that I am and my sister being a lawyer, we filed a complaint on her like a whistleblower to Cal OSHA,

87
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,950
but also the California Department of Health, where they did like a drop in inspection.

88
00:09:51,950 --> 00:10:02,389
They found nothing wrong with the facility. And because nursing homes technically don't fall under 1910, ten, 1910, 134,

89
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:09,320
which is if you're in a hospital because your work requires respiratory protection, you must be fit tested.

90
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,560
It must be provided to you at no cost, etc., because they weren't considered that.

91
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,950
They were like, Well, we can't do anything about the fact that they're charging you because there were like supply chain issues.

92
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,120
So enough of her colleagues ended up complaining that and some of them are unionized.

93
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
This is one of the few nurses nursing homes that are unionized.

94
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:43,760
They gave T-shirts that said Hero and then they gave them a few cloth masks and think donuts.

95
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,020
So that is a very real example.

96
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:55,050
Did they not have like I know in Michigan, there was like an executive order or something.

97
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,920
They said that if you're like an essential business, you have to supply your employees with PPE.

98
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,240
They don't have that in California. No, no.

99
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:16,220
They did like really strict shut down. So actually, before the the W.H.O. declared COVID a global pandemic, starting in February,

100
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,500
certain nursing homes in California were already not letting guests come visit the residents.

101
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,309
But of course, the COVID was being brought in by the employees going home, back and forth, back and forth.

102
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,469
So then they started implementing like super strict screening measures.

103
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:40,100
And then once the vaccine came out, they were kind of along up there with the health care workers.

104
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,220
And it was nice because like I think Walgreens or something came directly to their workplace to like give them the shot.

105
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,830
But then they stopped doing the hazard pay and time off.

106
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,559
And then people, more people just started getting COVID and they were like, whatever, depending on just keep coming to work.

107
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,440
Because we're short staffed, depending on the size, scale and type of business, they might not be required to wear masks because they're going to.

108
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:11,779
One of the facilities that my company had in California was still fighting with closure of the summer regarding like COVID restrictions.

109
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:19,910
But they they have a lot of good restrictive health. But it's always like like most voters are very dependent upon very specific stuff.

110
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,890
So yeah, Carwash is the strictest OSHA out of all the schools.

111
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:33,830
Michigan, we have our own state plan as well. So if you have a state plan, you have to be strict as stricter, stricter than federal OSHA.

112
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,650
So Michigan is stricter in some areas, but not always.

113
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,970
All the areas to all states have their own options. No, no.

114
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,149
A lot of. Sorry. Oh, go ahead. No. Yeah. I was going to say a lot.

115
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:54,740
A lot a lot of states like I believe like Tennessee or like I mean, typically you rent or companies that don't have as much government regulations,

116
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,010
they'll just have the main OSHA because they don't want to make it more regulated, strict.

117
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,800
So I mean, it's something like, I don't know, like 15 or 20 states don't have their commercials.

118
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,590
Yeah, like Indiana doesn't and Nebraska doesn't.

119
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,070
There's Cal OSHA might miosha.

120
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,470
Oh, Washington has their own. It's generally states that want to be stricter.

121
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,350
Yeah, this is a here's a weird film. I'm just sanitizing my professors and I didn't want to touch it.

122
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,220
Dirty hands. Is that the one I like? Makes it feel like your hands are. Yes.

123
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,240
The worst I hear about the middle epidemic. The ones that smelt like vodka.

124
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,270
I think those were from distilleries. Yeah. Oh, great. Yeah.

125
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,120
It was even like you'd buy, like, germ X and it would smell like tequila and be like.

126
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,310
I actually buy that. Yeah, I mean, good for that as distilleries, but to try to, like, help society but make a dime.

127
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,110
Yeah. Yeah. So, senior leadership support.

128
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,350
Financial equipment, people, resources. Action versus what is espoused.

129
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,280
It's funny because action versus what is espoused, it happens like almost everywhere, basically.

130
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,090
So yesterday that conversation I was having, I'm considered a low a lower level employee.

131
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,110
Like in the academia world, I don't know, tenure, I'm really junior, etc., etc.

132
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,800
And so like repeatedly I keep getting told like there is morale issues and I'm like, Why are you telling me this?

133
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:38,219
Because like literally this is like not my problem, but these are like inside thoughts and it's like this.

134
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:46,080
The supervisor was telling me this and I'm like, Who's the common denominator in all of this?

135
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,499
People are very, you know, like there's a joke where it's like, if you can't if you're not competent to do your job,

136
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,479
they just keep moving you higher up into a leadership position because you don't have to like interface with the public as much technically.

137
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,660
But that's kind of how you get some, some characters.

138
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,750
You know, in our workplaces in government, government and academia are very similar in that way.

139
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:17,850
I think industry is less tolerable of those things because they fire people, you know, that's questionable.

140
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:25,739
Just so if you're doing a C, D climate assessment, you'll first of all, you want to look at jobs and tasks, right?

141
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,660
Because you want to figure out who works there, what word groups are you going to split people up into survey?

142
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,550
What's your physical and technical environment? The organizational characteristics.

143
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,510
And you actually have to do some digging about what the current status is.

144
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:44,969
So you'd have to look at at risk employees, what controls or protocols are currently in place.

145
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:53,310
You might need to like pull up some injury and illness record logs and you'll have to put tracking and monitoring protocols in place.

146
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:01,290
This doesn't necessarily have to be air sampling or anything like that, but keeping in mind their pre and post assessment is,

147
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:09,330
especially if you're rolling out an intervention like capacity also needs to be built.

148
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,380
A lot of times people have to do these like mandatory trainings and they just go because they're told to,

149
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,930
but they don't understand necessarily the principles behind it or like why it actually matters.

150
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,320
And then, you know, lowering barriers or disincentives for safety.

151
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,340
So. Like at an Amazon warehouse, for example.

152
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:43,769
Anecdotally, I've just heard, you know, if you're the person in the warehouse where you have to pull people's orders, you know,

153
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:51,420
you're walking around or like, you know, driving a little like go cart or golf cart if you're lucky, but mostly like walking.

154
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:58,230
So they have these quotas they have to meet of how many like items they're pulling at any given time.

155
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:08,370
And so, like, just say, for example, like I cut my hand on a box cutter or like something sharp and it would take me like it

156
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,409
would take time away to stop and actually go through the appropriate procedures of,

157
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,150
like reporting that to my safety supervisor, which I should do if I have a laceration.

158
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,610
And it was like potentially like I'm concerned about it, like a bloodborne pathogen or something.

159
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:34,700
But that takes away time from me, like packing, getting this order together and that 15 minutes that I like got back.

160
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,830
I really just want to, like, pee or set.

161
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,870
So that's something that's like a super hybrid or just incentivizing particular safety behaviors just

162
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:53,850
because people are having to sacrifice what they consider to be like higher priorities at work over safety.

163
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,380
So people usually have to sacrifice something. Safety is is usually unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window first.

164
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,160
So increasing participation at all levels is generally good for safety performance.

165
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,220
You can try to foster organizational citizenship behaviors where people kind of feel

166
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:23,640
like this altruism or a sense of duty to their colleagues or their peers and then,

167
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:32,040
you know, foster learning, etc., communication not to worry too much about the horizontal and vertical.

168
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:41,100
So the take away point is communication is the glue that holds safety, climate and safety culture together.

169
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,960
Information, exchange or not to get too much of that. Okay.

170
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:56,540
And that was it. That was Todd's lecture. Hopefully he can give it to future classes.

171
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,140
He gave it to the last two classes,

172
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:07,230
but then he got tenure and got very busy and then they put him on a bunch of committees so he can't attend any questions about safety,

173
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,490
climate or safety culture before we move on.

174
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:21,270
Okay. So today we're going to discuss frameworks related to the built environment and the community environment.

175
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:35,310
It's really hard to ascribe psychosocial factors to the natural environment, like water or trees or like the air and stuff like that.

176
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,630
I mean, inherently we can we have psychosocial factors that relate to how we interact with nature.

177
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,280
But we'll talk about that more in the context of like the built in community environment rather than the natural environment.

178
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:03,830
I'll be curious to hear what you all think. So we know from tons and tons of research, right, that psychosocial factors affect our health outcomes,

179
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,250
but physical environments also affect our health outcomes.

180
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:15,520
But how we perceive our environmental factors also affects our health outcomes.

181
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,500
So how do all of these things relate to each other?

182
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:31,380
Is the big question or if at all? So first for the built environment, this is a framework by Burke.

183
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,610
Inverness moved on in 2014 and they had a study called Built Environment Change,

184
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,340
a framework to support health Enhancing Behavior through environmental policy and Health Research.

185
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,370
So they proposed a framework called the Built Environment Change RBC.

186
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,980
So their argument is that people not only interact with their built environment functionally, but also perceptually.

187
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,500
So they had three domains of their framework.

188
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,450
First is, number one, constructing the built environment.

189
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,740
Does it exist? Number two, identifying dynamics of how people perceive and use the environment.

190
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:25,770
And then three, structuring the legal and regulatory mechanisms governing the change in the built environment.

191
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,969
And this can be even from like the local level,

192
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:39,120
we're talking building codes and regulations up until like the state level in terms of like the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

193
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,630
So they defined the built environment as a habitat constructed by humans.

194
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,870
So these are structures building ancillary or discrete open spaces like gardens,

195
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,690
parks, roads, urban design, landscape, nothing that existed there naturally before.

196
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:05,370
And we're taking into consideration with the B.C. framework land use and regulations affecting this behavior.

197
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:15,930
So here, if you see in their BSE framework and the regulatory mechanism and they show what the built environment is and its impact on health.

198
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:27,180
So they said public health practitioners may choose to lead the table right to left, while urban planners may choose to read the table left to right.

199
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:36,090
So we're in public health. So if we want to look at which ones do, are you all interested in mental health, depression,

200
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:43,530
cancer, infectious diseases, respiratory disease, trauma, or CBDs and obesity is pretty.

201
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:53,190
Okay, so if we look at respiratory disease that they the exposure to residuary disease is primarily due to privacy,

202
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,420
a lack of privacy and crowding in urban spaces.

203
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:06,450
So you can look at the building level in terms of the build environment and take a look at building codes and zoning and land use codes.

204
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:14,430
Now, if I was interested in mental health and depression, I'm more concerned with material toxicity, right?

205
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,649
Like the volatile organic compounds in new buildings, in particular with a lot of building materials.

206
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:33,320
There's a lot of off gassing of formaldehyde in carpets and wall products which were known a human a known human carcinogen led,

207
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:41,260
for example, and paints are pipes, indoor environmental quality, lighting, ventilation, noise in particular.

208
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,360
I'm not a big fan of these bright white lights.

209
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,400
I prefer like a a yellow glow that looks more like natural lighting.

210
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,120
So then.

211
00:23:51,150 --> 00:24:00,960
I would look at the room level of the physical built environment and again like going towards building codes and zoning and land use and zoning code.

212
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:08,459
But it's important to take into consideration, like all of these things, when you're thinking about interventions,

213
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:16,320
whether or not you're coming from upstream or downstream, because building and zoning codes are like very complicated.

214
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,350
So as an example, back when I was living in Indiana,

215
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:29,310
I was kind of living in this townhouse community and there was a big empty lot behind us full of trees.

216
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,300
And then they just started like clearing the trees all of a sudden.

217
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,260
And we were told nothing else was being built there except for like the houses.

218
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:46,710
And they were like, Jake, we're putting in student apartments, which is like a freaking nightmare because I purposely live like,

219
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,290
you know, on the south side of Bloomington to not be around college students.

220
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,360
Right. And so I you know, I got into it.

221
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,410
I was attending like city hall zoning meetings, etc., etc.

222
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,950
Kind of the same problem in Bloomington that they had here in Ann Arbor,

223
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:11,010
where they just didn't have mixed income, affordable houses for people who actually lived there.

224
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,389
And they just kept building more luxurious student apartments.

225
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,620
Like who? Who is this for? Who is living here?

226
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,000
Who was paying 1500 dollars a month for this studio apartment?

227
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,440
But we found out that those apartments had actually been approved to be built there since the nineties.

228
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:41,040
But finally, a company that wasn't even in Indiana, they were based in like Florida or something was building up this thing.

229
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,710
Right. And obviously, because they're not based in the community, they don't they don't care about the implications.

230
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:56,430
They just want the profits for it. And now it's like it was a huge eyesore because I would look out my kitchen window and you would see the granite,

231
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:04,290
which is what the apartments were called. And for some reason their logo was a giant banana, like a giant banana.

232
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:09,809
So I would just look out my kitchen window and see like the granite and it was this giant banana.

233
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,870
And I was like, why? Because at first, you know, I was like, Is each building like a fruit?

234
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,860
Like, is one an apple? Nope, just the banana.

235
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,809
And so we, you know, because originally people at the town hall meeting were like, why can't you put something else there?

236
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:37,350
Like a like a bit a restaurant or something? Or they were demolishing the old hospital because they were building a new academic medical center.

237
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:44,879
So they had to get the old hospital rezone for residential to turn that into like mixed income housing.

238
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,260
Or like sometimes you want to put a restaurant or like a Trader Joe's where there's a parking lot, but there's like zoning issues.

239
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:01,200
So it's it's all very complicated. I was reading the, you know, all that like gobbledygook going on on State Street right now.

240
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,970
Supposedly, they'll be done by the end of this month. But I heard now is October.

241
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,730
You know, construction is never on time,

242
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:18,510
but State Street is supposed to be like one of the few it's supposed to be when it's done like an urban designer's dream,

243
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:28,589
because it's going to be the curb list sidewalks and it's going to like allow for more pedestrian walking,

244
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,460
of course, like deliveries and stuff will have to happen, but less traffic.

245
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm concerned. I'm not concerned. I'm curious how that will turn out.

246
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:45,310
For a city like Ann Arbor where so many people bike that the Batman the terrible here.

247
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,050
Like truly terrible growing up in California like since like the nineties like biplanes

248
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,690
were like default on every street and it wasn't in like the middle between two lanes.

249
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,219
It was always closest to the sidewalk and it would just exist.

250
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,680
It wouldn't like ended after a certain point.

251
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,470
And then some of these streets downtown here where I get confused, where it's like technically a two way street,

252
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,020
but the lines are dotted and there's like cars parked on each side and there's also like bike

253
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,730
lanes patterns pretty like I think people are just happy to have it all anywhere in Michigan.

254
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,840
Residents like that's me. If I see like a biking symbol when I'm commuting to work and stuff, I'm like, Oh, cool, this is a bike.

255
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,220
Cause I used to not any of it is often on the highway and practically yeah.

256
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,560
So like I'm happy with it. To me, I was like, It's better than Chicago.

257
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:47,260
Oh, really? Like, I feel like there's a lot more bike traffic just because, like, has to be laid out for, like, absolutely no bike lanes.

258
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:53,530
Like, if you ride a bike everywhere, you have to be pretty brave because you're also, like, just in there with cars.

259
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah. Just, you know, with college towns. Yeah. Michigan. I mean, they're not really norm anywhere else.

260
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,810
Mean maybe Grand Rapids or something. But that's a college.

261
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,290
College kind of I don't think it's that good in Grand Rapids either, but they just got the light lime bikes.

262
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,410
So I don't know if they're going to least there's just frickin scooters out everywhere.

263
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,400
Scooters one go. We had the scooters. And when they were really popping boom towns like Ford companies and who.

264
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,500
So where did the psychosocial factors come into?

265
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,200
This BEC framework is under the individual responses or behaviors.

266
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,420
So for example, if you are if the exposure is safety,

267
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:43,120
the psychosocial factors are social stress or like your level of risk taking behaviors which in turn can affect your mental health and depression,

268
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,809
trauma, injury, cardio, cardio, metabolic disease or obesity, or like walkable environments.

269
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:58,120
Choices for active transportation relates to physical activity, but this the psychosocial construct of social connection to others,

270
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,220
and then mental health, depression, cardio about metabolic disease, obesity and cancer.

271
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,500
I really dream about walkable cities. That's why it's so nice when you go visit Europe.

272
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:16,870
In terms of health though change, they these authors say that change occurring at different levels of the built environment

273
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:23,830
doesn't necessarily correspond to the continuum from the individual to population health level.

274
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,870
So what does that actually mean? So just say you make a positive change on the built environment.

275
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:37,459
Yes, it can affect the individual positively, but it may not necessarily correspond to the entire population.

276
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,250
Is health changing in that same way?

277
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:47,740
But inherently, if you change the built environment, you will change the behaviors of the people using it in interacting with the space.

278
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:55,749
So a lot of the psychosocial factors come in the changes of perception and experiences of the same physical environment.

279
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:04,840
So these are again, all subjective measures. This here is Midtown Crossing, Omaha, Nebraska.

280
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,300
I used to live here. I used to live right here around here.

281
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,620
So this is considered a built environment.

282
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:25,960
Before this was a park, it used to be a hotel where there was illegal prostitution and drugs being sold.

283
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,329
And then they knocked down that hotel boom and then they built up all this.

284
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:40,299
And it's literally called Midtown Housing. So like below, here are a bunch of stores and above here are apartments.

285
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,440
Same thing with here. And then this is a park in the summer time.

286
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,800
So in the summertime they would have every day like yo like kind of like what do they call it here, top of the hill,

287
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:58,299
whatever they do like in front of rock them in the summer are you guys are probably here in the summer they do something called like top of the Hill

288
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:06,879
or something where it's like every night they have something going on where it's like jazz music or like yoga or like concerts or like salsa dancing.

289
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,030
They would show movies. There is a firework show on the 4th of July.

290
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,569
It is obvious fireworks. So it's kind of like a mixed use space.

291
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,990
And it was super walkable, as you can see, because there are sidewalks.

292
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,559
I'd go to the gym, which was literally across the street here.

293
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,290
I could also go to, you know, a boba tea shop over here.

294
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,310
There was a call to stone, which was great because I used to be able to like process dairy.

295
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,870
And then, you know, if you walk down here to midtown, like the Nebraska Med Center is over there.

296
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,670
So this was a really great built in. Mean, just because there was a lot of green space, mixed use stores.

297
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,620
There was a movie theater right across from my window.

298
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,779
And then there was like this little like French cafe right here where you could get slices of cake.

299
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,840
And I would just look out my window and be like, Oh, those people have a date.

300
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,809
You know, like this type of thing. But then you go to the movies for like $5 on, like, a random Tuesday.

301
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,550
It was great. It's like going back, huh? Sound like you want to, but not to Nebraska.

302
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,049
I like to. I like this built environment. But it's the people that made it.

303
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,820
Ain't nothing in Nebraska except a lot of snow and corn.

304
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,090
Corn, actually, Iowa has more corn than Nebraska.

305
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,800
I love the corner of the Corn Museum.

306
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,350
Built the Corn Palace. I think it's cool. Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,440
Is this gentrification? I think it depends on who was there.

308
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah. History of the land and the culture, I guess, is that it was like people could have lived in that hotel, like on a permanent basis.

309
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,990
Yeah. So that could have been like they could have been displaced from that.

310
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,000
It feels like a neighborhood and I mean like definitely people could live in a hotel for a time.

311
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,400
We to be more diplomatic to films like a low to middle income neighborhood that got displaced.

312
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,330
I mean, it was like hotel and decrepit businesses. Maybe not.

313
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,960
Obviously, it is good. Yeah.

314
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:11,769
So if you just go a block up. So Omaha, I forget which class I talked about this.

315
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,290
If I'm telling you, if I repeat myself. Omaha is one of the most segregated cities in the United States.

316
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:26,649
Still like looking at the like if you look at apply the apartheid scale, it's like higher than apartheid South Africa.

317
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:32,920
So North Omaha is considered where the black people live.

318
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,370
South Omaha's consider where the Hispanic Latino community lives and the whites fled east and west.

319
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,740
It is also one of the biggest. What do they call those cities?

320
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:59,229
The term is escaping sanctuary cities where they have one of the largest concentration of accepting refugees in the country.

321
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,480
Just because Catholic health initiatives and charities are super big in Omaha.

322
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,719
So they settle a ton of they have resettled a ton of refugees from Bhutan,

323
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,140
Somalia, Nepal, a lot of places with like ongoing conflict and stuff like that.

324
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:27,999
So when I first moved to Omaha, people were like telling me, don't live above 40th and Dodge Street, so this is 37th and Farnham, it's all on a grid.

325
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,100
I lived a block above Dodge Street. I was like, Oh my gosh, what's wrong with Dodge Street?

326
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:40,090
And that was basically all just coded language for like that's where the minorities and I'm like from South Sacramento.

327
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:49,299
So I'm like, I honestly don't care. But when this came out, like, I can only afford to live here because I had a roommate.

328
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:59,500
So like 2015, two bedroom, two bath apartment, really nice apartment was like 700 bucks a person.

329
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,930
So like 1400 dollars was awesome. That's considered cheap now.

330
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,710
Okay.

331
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:17,500
But it's also kind of in comparison, when I was living four blocks up in one street over in a studio, in a basement, I was paying like $400 a month.

332
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,540
It's Nebraska. But who was living in these apartments?

333
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,740
Some. Some med students. Some students, but mostly like more affluent people.

334
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:38,500
And then this whole strip down here changed completely, where a lot of businesses that were empty or vacated have.

335
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,970
Now, this is called the Blackstone District. So it's very like hipster now.

336
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,719
Like there's a pizza place that, like, makes pizza with water sauce from Brooklyn for the crust.

337
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,350
And there's like some, like a hipster ice cream place.

338
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:58,210
I don't have to go to a wedding there in November, so I'll kind of be curious to see what it is.

339
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,620
So I guess, you know, in a way, it's it's always a tough conversation.

340
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,449
Obviously, you don't see a lot of people of color living in the space.

341
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,970
You do see them using the built environment, though, because when the parks have these events in the summer, it's all free.

342
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,150
And the parking structures in the shopping areas, if you buy anything from like the shops, you get your parking validated.

343
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,630
So it's the first 2 hours are free, but if you get it validated, it's like totally free.

344
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,920
So they're trying to incentivize people from coming to this area, but it's it's all complicated.

345
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,420
I don't know Ann Arbor well enough to speak to it.

346
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,210
And also, I've lived here long enough to know what the deal is.

347
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:50,169
Not good. I feel like Ann Arbor is probably for a while has been a pretty like ritzy college town.

348
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,670
But then I guess L.A. is the conversation of more gentrification where Ann Arbor is kind of moving outwards?

349
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,220
Yeah, I live in Ypsi. Technically, I think it's cool.

350
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,410
Pretty. I think it's pretty safe. But people, again, have feelings about it.

351
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,489
Like I was told not to live there, live in Dexter and stuff like that.

352
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,920
So. Mm hmm. Okay.

353
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:15,210
Just some thoughts about built environment. Have any of you lived in as an awesome built environment space?

354
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,700
In Chicago, I lived in, like a high rise building.

355
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,640
I got a cargo. I'm like some people would say it's a rough area.

356
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:36,560
Okay, but it was like walkable. There wasn't a lot of green space, but it was not far from the league, which was nice.

357
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:42,830
Okay. But even at the lake, it's like a patch of grass, maybe a couple of trees.

358
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,540
So. So not a lot of people like jogging in your neighborhood.

359
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,990
Not like through the neighborhood, but along the lake. Yeah. Okay.

360
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,150
Dogs and all. Kind of. Okay. Okay. So, neighborhood environment now.

361
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:08,509
So these great researchers there, they have a study called Neighborhood Environment, Physical Activity,

362
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,880
Quality of Life in Adults Looking at intermediary and personal psychosocial factors.

363
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:22,610
So lots of research shows us how there is a positive but indirect relationship between physical activity and quality of life.

364
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:29,150
Right. Just because somebody works out does not mean they have immediately good quality of life,

365
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,930
like people are at the gym for all different kinds of reasons.

366
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:39,920
A lot of times trying to get that post-breakup glow up, you know, or the sad or they're trying to, like, deal with their depression.

367
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,450
But they have connected the fact that the physical activity helps, you know,

368
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:50,960
stimulate adrenaline and some endorphins that helps them combat mental health issues.

369
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:57,800
So the neighborhood environment is also potentially affects physical and mental health positively.

370
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:09,590
So this study used the social cognitive model among 648 physically active adults in Greece, with the mean age being about 40 years old.

371
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,700
So here's some ideas for you.

372
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,340
If you think about skills you potentially want to use for your questionnaire, what conflicts do they look at?

373
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,639
They looked at physical activity using the International Physical Activity questionnaire, quality of life,

374
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,860
using the satisfaction with life scale, exercise, self-efficacy, using the self efficacy scale, physical and mental health.

375
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:41,719
People usually use the short form 36, which is 36 questions, but there's shorter versions if you want to assess physical and mental health.

376
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,110
In 36 questions for the neighborhood environment,

377
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:51,530
they used a Greek version of the neighborhood environment scale and then for family support of physical activity,

378
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:59,090
for support of physical activity, they use this respect diversions as support for exercise behaviors, skills.

379
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:08,060
So for this entire study, they only used validated constructs and they smashed them all together in one survey,

380
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,630
which is perfectly acceptable for you to do honestly. So here are the results.

381
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,609
This is a structural equation model, essentially.

382
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:25,520
So when we're kind of getting into the number of constructs that we're using, we're moving beyond the point.

383
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,000
You can do something like a linear or logistic regression.

384
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:36,920
Okay. The reason we're doing structural equation modeling is you want to see how the constructs relate to one another.

385
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:48,860
Now, if you were making up your own new constructs, like your questions weren't validated, you don't know what the Cronenberg's Alpha is, right?

386
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,180
You don't know if it actually, like, is measuring what you think it should measure.

387
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:01,280
You're going to want it like a precursor to that. This is exploratory factor analysis.

388
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,490
How many of you heard of that before? Kind of draft?

389
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:13,360
Okay, now just say that your you've made a framework and you're, you know, your you validated your questionnaire,

390
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,480
your questions, like through your study, but no one has widely adopted it.

391
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,770
Okay. Then maybe you go to the next step of like confirmatory factor analysis.

392
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,890
We're done exploring or now confirming.

393
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:34,970
But when you're using validated questionnaires like this study has where it's proven that it measures what you're intending to measure abstractly,

394
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,180
that's when you go to structural equation modeling.

395
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:47,060
And structural equation modeling not only takes a look at what the relationship between the dependent variable is with the independent variables,

396
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:55,430
it looks at what the relationship among the independent variables are with each other as well with what we call factor loading,

397
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:04,160
which controls for other demographics and other things in a way that a core, a simple correlation wouldn't.

398
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,870
Does that kind of make sense, or is that just a bunch of gobbledygook?

399
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,700
I was lost. Okay. So. Okay.

400
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,770
I honestly. I appreciate that. Thank you. I got.

401
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,240
I got the worst parts of the math behind the worst parts of them.

402
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,050
Okay, let's see. Let's see if this pen works.

403
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,910
So just say, you know, our our variable of interest is Y, right?

404
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,790
And then we have A, B, C and D.

405
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:50,230
Okay, so these are our constructs. So with like a regression Z.

406
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,210
Okay. What's the effect of a on wine and beer and wine and C and then that.

407
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:07,820
Right. Okay. But when you're doing structural equation modeling and it these these constructs are all validated.

408
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,109
Yes. You're interested in this, but you're also interested in this.

409
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,860
You're also interested in this. You're also interested in this. Also this.

410
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:27,560
You're also interested in this sort of similarity that basically like how these all are interconnected.

411
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,270
But you can do that simultaneously in an SCA.

412
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:44,730
Is it easy? No. I've attempted to do a couple of scams before, and you have to just like, let your code run.

413
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:55,300
And sometimes it will be like three or 4 hours because it tries a couple hundred thousand combinations and then you just come back and it crashes.

414
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,480
But mostly you see this used in like the social sciences.

415
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,250
So very seldom will you see this used in epidemiology and biostatistics.

416
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,000
You're most likely see it in like health, behavioral health, education,

417
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:16,060
occupational health, psychology, safe use, research, like those kinds of things.

418
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,130
So if you recall, through all these letters correspond to the respective scale that it means, right?

419
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,140
So that the variable of interest is physical activity.

420
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,700
This is quality of life. This is physical component of health.

421
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:41,620
This is the mental component of health, family support of physical activity, frightening support of physical activity.

422
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,210
This one is neighborhood environment, and then this one is exercise self-efficacy.

423
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,800
Okay. I told you kind of a little bit, what does it mean?

424
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:59,210
But I was so pumped that this this gift works anyway.

425
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:10,030
So what the implications are is that physical activity positively affects quality of life through the mediating effects of self-efficacy,

426
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:18,400
physical health and mental health. So physical activity affects quality of life.

427
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:29,500
If there is self-efficacy there and mental health and physical health are acknowledged to be contributing factors of quality of life.

428
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,979
Neighborhood environment in particular was positively influenced by quality of

429
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,620
life through the intermediary effects of family support for physical activity,

430
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,010
exercise, self-efficacy, physical activity, physical health and mental health.

431
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:58,840
So you'll notice that between the two neighborhood environment, you have more constructs that relate to it than physical activity.

432
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:06,610
So don't look ahead in the slides. But does this make sense to you inherently?

433
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:23,650
Yeah. Kind of. I mean, how many of you have been on like a have ever been on a fitness journey and you felt more motivated because of family support?

434
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,740
No. I think of it more like friends. Go to the gym.

435
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,780
You're more likely to go. I mean, I've been at the mob.

436
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:37,900
The time I used to go the most was during undergraduate, before the pandemic, when my entire household went to the gym together.

437
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,370
So, yeah, I mean, family can be like chosen family, right?

438
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,980
So I would say, like going back to the picture where I was living in Midtown Crossing,

439
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,989
there was literally a gym right across the street and as part of our rent we got a free gym membership to Prairie Life,

440
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,010
which was great, but my roommate was a huge gym person.

441
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:09,040
Like, I'm usually not a gym person. I like just go and like bop around lot to go for half an hour while listening to my music,

442
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,320
while she'll like, lift weights and like do sets and all that kind of stuff.

443
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:19,750
So that year I was like the most in shape that I've ever been in, probably, except for when I was seven.

444
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:25,990
5 to 7. But like when she would go to the gym, she'd be like, Let's go to the gym.

445
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,910
I'd be like, Okay, I guess we're going in the gym, right? But that feels much more more motivating to me.

446
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:38,490
So. Right. Whereas, I mean, family and family support can go can go either way.

447
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:44,640
But just say, like your spouse, for example, if she's like, Oh, I'm going to work out like I'm going to do a couch to five.

448
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,780
Katie You want to do a couch to five K with me? Josh, what would you say?

449
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,229
Absolutely not. Oh. And I get the point.

450
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,760
I'd be more likely to do it. Yeah. Okay, so you're not about that.

451
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,759
All right. So for your neighborhood environment assessment,

452
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:08,430
like what kind of things in your neighborhood environment would you look for that you would think would affect some psychosocial factors?

453
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,110
Don't look ahead like walkability. Walkability, yeah.

454
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:19,350
Green space, green space, public transit, public transit, access to resources and stuff.

455
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:29,830
To what kind of resources in me and mental health and just health in general and then quality food.

456
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:37,499
Yeah, laudable food. Okay. Other things, I mean, like reasons to go out.

457
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,319
So like, I don't know, we had like cool events going on top of the hill or whatever top of the hill.

458
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:51,900
That's what I meant. Yeah. And like, like poetry stuff for like free music, like, like reasons to go out, to walk, move and stuff.

459
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:59,070
Yeah, there's Shakespeare in the ARB in the summer. Yeah, I wouldn't go, but I like to know I have the opposite.

460
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:06,270
Well, now that I've lived in Michigan, what I've learned about Michiganders is that they don't care what the weather is like in Ann Arbor.

461
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,169
They'll be outside, like regardless of what time of year it is.

462
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,540
I always feel like Gallup Park is like the parking lot is full and people like to like

463
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:22,169
go walking like a put on their yak tracks or like Professor Julia in our department,

464
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:29,370
who's now this is last semester. He used to like he loved winter because he would cross-country ski to work.

465
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:37,800
Uh huh, yeah. We're like a couple of our other faculty, like they put out there, like big fat snow tires on the bike, and there's no bike here.

466
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:45,360
I be, like, driving a bus because I don't live I don't live in a in a neighborhood where they have a a continuous bus.

467
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:52,530
Unfortunately, because I used to take the bus to work when I lived in Indiana, which is great because I hate driving.

468
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:59,310
So some factors you might want to look at. Yeah. Are there sidewalks in the neighborhood actually?

469
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:07,500
Is there heavy traffic in the neighborhood? Like do you live off of a really busy corridor, for example, or Major Street?

470
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,870
Are there hills in the neighborhood? Are there street lights in the neighborhood?

471
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:20,490
I noticed here in Michigan or at least in Ann Arbor, there's not that many street lights outside of the downtown area.

472
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:29,600
I'm not a fan. Ah, they're not. I guess I've never I must've never lived in an area with that many streetlights because I haven't really noticed that.

473
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:34,760
No, I don't, I don't, I don't think there's there's so dark here it is.

474
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:40,439
Sucks. I lived in like just like a straight up neighborhood near and it's all residential.

475
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,250
And like when I'm driving through the night, it it's pitch black and it's pitch black.

476
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:49,380
Yeah. You got to turn on your high beams. It's how I hit a deer on Tuesday.

477
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:55,530
Cracked my bumper that. Yeah. Eight years in the Midwest and it finally happened so it could have been worse.

478
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,230
It is so dark here. And talking from other people who are Michiganders,

479
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:06,990
they say that the reasoning for that is they don't want to create a lot of light pollution, which I am.

480
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:13,950
Well, so that's actually a reason I know that the ordinance is new and I think people might be blaming on a lack of streetlights for that reason.

481
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,750
I mean, there is I mean, it can design I mean, new streetlights.

482
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,559
You can have it pointed down and have very minimal impact on light pollution because I'm one.

483
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,720
Yeah. So I mean, it's not like a public safety or a light pollution thing.

484
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:35,760
Yeah. It's just, um. Yeah. And like, you know, as a woman, I'm not trying to walk anywhere after dark and, you know, winter.

485
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,820
The sun sets for 430 at pepper spray on my keys.

486
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,950
I've never been attacked but I really dare someone to try to internal rage.

487
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:50,220
Yeah, I'm ready but. But you know, have your practice too, though, because I know a lot of people end up getting.

488
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:58,620
I did. I took a self-defense training class and like I went home with my ex-partner and I was like, I need to keep up my skills.

489
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:03,839
And I was like, okay, put me in a chokehold. And then I like, break free. And he was like, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

490
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,450
And I was like, okay, you just want me to get attacked. And so I never like was able to practice my skills.

491
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,200
But maybe it's because, you know, my talk for you, Paige.

492
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,460
But I've seen so many things lately about, like, just women getting kidnaped.

493
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:21,090
Yeah. So it was a high profile one, and. For shearing?

494
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,500
Yeah. The runner, the kindergarten teacher. Isn't there like a billionaire or something?

495
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:36,700
Which. Yes, that is horrible. No, I mean, obviously, I'm not like, you know, somebody like an heiress and I'm not like 20 and like a model.

496
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,459
But these are just like regular women just getting picked up.

497
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:48,580
Like, one woman I saw was, like, kind of stopped at like a like a, like a lonely gas station and noticed the cashier was kind of like,

498
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:56,559
delaying, and then, like, the credit card readers were taking off, so she had to, like, go inside and pay cash and stuff and stuff.

499
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,250
And then like two vans came and blocked her car in and yeah.

500
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,419
And she was like, my age. It's not like, you know, just teenagers.

501
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:10,060
I'm just like, what is going on? But streetlights, not many here.

502
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:16,780
So like, what if you have a dog? Do you just reflective vest, flashlight?

503
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:24,100
I haven't seen as many like reflective fast as I would like, cause like when when it's dark,

504
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,909
I'm driving back to my house from, like, Maya or something. Like, you can see, like if they have like a light on their bike.

505
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,390
Like you can see that, but not much else. Yeah.

506
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:44,630
The rising crazy here they are crazy across pass walks, but they don't have in black, in black and black and middle class like, you know, stuff.

507
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,090
It's like, yeah, you'll probably see them and no one's going that, that's like they can break.

508
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:54,669
Like, you never know what's going to be important to people about death.

509
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,940
Yeah, that's crazy. One of our faculty members on her bike.

510
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,750
Got it. Broad daylight, though. It's just people drive crazy here.

511
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:09,760
Dogs in the neighborhood. Do we see this as a pro or con of of why they like dogs?

512
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,989
It's a pro. Yeah. You don't like dogs. It's a crime. I was like, was it sorry to be, like, really scary dogs?

513
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:21,069
I know, like, kids and stuff. And like, my little brother had to walk home from school and stuff.

514
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,130
He hated walking by some houses with dogs in it.

515
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,810
So just that fact that even kids of our time think they're mean dogs.

516
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,720
Yeah, it depends. Also like it, they're like more outdoor versus indoor dogs and like the level they're trained at, right?

517
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:39,490
So they confer benefit definitely to the person who owns the dog would potentially not the people

518
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,360
in live and breathe like your kids like you going to see the dogs and like do you get to see them?

519
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:52,030
That brings you joy. In fact, I know and I volunteer at the Humane Society, but is a it's a no it's a no kill shelter technically.

520
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,349
So they have like the normal adoptable dogs because I've upgraded to dog

521
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:02,950
walking level now possible to thank you but there are a lot of dogs in holding

522
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:13,840
from legal cases either like custody battles worthy pets they beat someone and need to like go through behavioral assessment and stuff like that.

523
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,249
Foul air and air pollution. This is a huge one in Detroit.

524
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,210
So I'm sure.

525
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:27,459
Dr. Shields and you know, if you were to the class of Doctor Batman, you know, about like the air pollution disparities in Detroit in particular,

526
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:35,260
they'll generally put large manufacturing industries and lower science neighborhoods, um, where more minorities live, right?

527
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:44,530
Because they inherently care less about their air quality in their life, life, health outcomes, enjoyable scenery.

528
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:51,459
Is there any enjoyable scenery? I was driving the other day in.

529
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:57,940
I live also on the border of Clayton, so on the border of Canton on like East Michigan Avenue.

530
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,969
I don't know how familiar with that area. There's another like big coffee down there and like a Taco Bell and stuff.

531
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,440
It's like kind of parallel to Ford Boulevard where like all the IKEA stuff is.

532
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:17,230
And I was driving and I was like, Is that like a hill or am I imagining the traffic?

533
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,559
It's the traffic. It's the it's the it. It's the trash heap.

534
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:27,459
Former trash. Yeah. Yeah. So I was like because I was like, oh, kind of looks like parts of California because California is very hilly.

535
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,030
But it was just the former dump site. Yes.

536
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,850
What do you all consider enjoyable scenery? I just started like running again.

537
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:42,310
I was seeing people's legal guardian, the neighborhood like through the summer.

538
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:48,020
There's like trees. Yeah, I like trees. Yeah.

539
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,210
Actual stuff. Not strip malls. Yeah. Gardens are nice if you run it.

540
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,600
If you run along. Jerry's here in the arboretum. You know that?

541
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:02,160
You know the cemetery. There's a nice house that has, like, a kind of like a brown fence.

542
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,790
They have a lot of great foliage of walking and jogging trails accessible.

543
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:14,970
Definitely is here in Michigan. Yeah. That is something that they definitely invest in.

544
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:21,070
And if you see a lot of people exercising in the neighborhood, you might be more incentivized to do it.

545
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,879
Not only because it's like, Oh, I kind of should do it too,

546
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,820
but you that's an indication to you that it's safe enough to partake in in my particular neighborhood.

547
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:35,580
You see a lot of people walking their dogs and then like some people running and stuff like that.

548
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:42,570
But definitely like when you go down the block into Ypsi Township, like you don't see that anymore.

549
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,450
So these are some contributing neighborhoods factors. And then is there high crime rates?

550
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:56,080
I mean, you know, petty theft is one thing, but like homicide is the mean streets of Ann Arbor.

551
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,900
That's a joke. Oh. I mean, there's, like, a lot of petty burglaries, right?

552
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,450
And, like, groupers. I don't know, like perceived crime.

553
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,010
Yeah. Do you feel like there's a lot of crime around you?

554
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

555
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,250
This is a neighborhood in North Omaha.

556
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:32,550
So you can see here, like, sidewalks kind of exist, but it's super, like, dilapidated, though the streets aren't super well-maintained.

557
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,840
This, like, stop sign is kind of leaning over. This is the summertime.

558
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:45,389
But I did an internship in North Omaha in the wintertime where I would take a bus one hour to go like six miles because it made so many stops.

559
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:48,980
And then, like the bus stop was literally like not labeled at all.

560
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:56,219
There was no beds, there was no overhang. It was just literally like a mound of snow in front of someone's house.

561
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,610
And then they didn't have tracking apps or anything like that.

562
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:03,180
So if the bus didn't come, you'd have to wait another half hour.

563
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:10,560
Yeah. So but they don't, you know, they, they, they don't come as frequently to these kinds of neighborhoods,

564
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,040
which again makes it difficult for like accessibility.

565
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:22,229
Growing up, I did grow up in a neighborhood that did have sidewalks, but the crime rate was a lot higher.

566
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:29,820
So I think I mentioned like I was only allowed to like do a lap and then my mom would stand outside and watch me the whole time.

567
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,340
So I wasn't allowed to just like do whatever I want.

568
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:42,420
This last one we'll talk about is called the reserve capacity model or the RC, and this one, the origins of RC.

569
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:52,410
Um, so W.E.B. Dubois described was one of the first people to describe differences in the how between African-Americans and Caucasians.

570
01:00:52,740 --> 01:01:00,240
So he said that these are not due to disparate physical vulnerabilities, but rather social forces.

571
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:13,080
So Gallo and MATTHEWS in 2000 1323, excuse me, developed the AACM as a framework to examine psychosocial factors in ACA driven health disparities.

572
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:18,480
So they basically use concepts from aging in stress literature,

573
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:29,280
and they posit that stressful versus positive experiences and environments are unequally distributed according to socioeconomic status.

574
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:39,720
So the disadvantage, they obviously have different perceptions of like what level of risk they have in their daily life threats,

575
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,150
conflicts, ambiguity, daily hassles and major life events.

576
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:54,210
But also, according to the AACM, what they propose is that your social status shapes the way that you appraise

577
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,999
what your stress burden actually what you perceive your stress burden to be.

578
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,370
Right. And then those who are in a low X and experience racial discrimination in general tend to

579
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:16,079
have more negative interpretations of ambiguous social interactions and their social worlds.

580
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:26,970
They're more likely to perceive them as hostile and unfriendly just based on previous experiences, life experiences, historical experiences,

581
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:38,129
and in turn, the wear and tear from repeated psychological stress and unhealthy behavioral coping strategies kind of manifest themselves.

582
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:42,200
So repeated psychological stress, obviously depression,

583
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,920
chronic elevated blood pressure and then unhealthy behavioral coping strategies might be like emotional eating,

584
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:57,720
binge eating, drinking, smoking, you know, risky practices with like drugs and sex.

585
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:05,760
And neuro neurological studies have shown that the more repeated stress that you have,

586
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,839
it actually changes the confirmation of your brain and the proportion of white white to gray

587
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:20,069
matter in terms of like the richness of how your neurons are communicating with one another,

588
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:26,879
how you process memories, how your body essentially, like your immune system, heals itself.

589
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,000
So it's very interconnected.

590
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:39,090
Does anybody want to potentially share an anecdote about social status shaping appraisal?

591
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:44,760
I can start with one. I always have lots of stories.

592
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:55,020
So, for example, my roommate and I who live together in Midtown Crossing, we are both, you know, children of divorce who grew up low.

593
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:59,040
Yes, but I grew up low. Kids in California. She grew up low.

594
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:10,500
Yes. In Nebraska was p was was homeless with her mother for a period of time because her second step dad was like physically abusing her mom and like,

595
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,390
you know, doing drugs and things like that. And then her mom eventually moved on to another house.

596
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:25,889
And, you know, I had a lot of like dysfunctional parents with untreated war trauma and like mental health issues they won't acknowledge.

597
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,900
So there's like a short ten questions scale of like childhood trauma.

598
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:37,320
And if you score like either higher than like a seven, you're more likely to be a dysfunctional human being.

599
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:45,660
And both of us like had like a seven or eight and we were like, Yeah, isn't it amazing that we are getting our master's degrees and aren't like,

600
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,360
you know, I don't know, we're more well-adjusted than like you would think it would be.

601
01:04:51,360 --> 01:05:02,100
But we have friends who were super affluent in our master's program and they would talk about their problems and it would just be like.

602
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,140
But these aren't really problems.

603
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:16,080
And she she would just get so frustrated because she's a, you know, like big group with a silver spoon in their mouth and etc., etc.

604
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:24,150
So like our appraisals of like what we consider a stressful situation is different than what they consider a stressful situation.

605
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:28,379
I mean, now that I'm older, right, and my brain is like fully developed,

606
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:37,140
I've tried to be less resentful about people who have grown up with privilege because I guess they can't help that in a way.

607
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,549
But, you know, it changes how people appraise stress.

608
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,900
But I would definitely say, like compared to some of my colleagues,

609
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:52,170
I do I definitely do have more negative interpretations of ambiguous social interactions.

610
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,120
And sometimes I have to check myself like,

611
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:04,430
am I being overly sensitive or am I like gaslighting myself to think that wasn't as big of a deal as it was or it was a big deal.

612
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:12,000
Like, it's all very, very confusing. I mean, do any of you have any anecdotes or instances you like to share?

613
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,210
I think I can kind of relate to that, too, with my family and my history and stuff too.

614
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:24,150
But my roommate, he had just so protective of put that way, very privileged,

615
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:32,160
but just didn't understand the real world and the way it will and never understand because he, you know, he's just so privileged in that sense.

616
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:40,139
So and again, the littlest things of not having more of food to eat because I just don't know what to cook.

617
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,590
And like I grew up not having food in my fridge. Sometimes it was like,

618
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:53,069
you don't understand that the what goes into like running that actually like a functioning family and just like kind of the business of it and stuff.

619
01:06:53,070 --> 01:07:03,420
So yeah, I can definitely relate to like seeing this rest, um, from both privileged and like, you know, all right, bringing stuff.

620
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,200
Yeah, yeah. Stress appraisal from different UX backgrounds for sure.

621
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:12,510
I mean we laugh when we I don't yeah, I don't watch the Kardashians because I don't want to support them.

622
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,420
But like you see on their show, like what they consider like stressful situations versus like,

623
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:22,830
I don't know, like the average person below poverty line.

624
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,160
So the RCMP posits again that this enhanced vulnerability reflects inadequate resource

625
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:36,540
reserves that could otherwise attenuate negative appraisals or facilitate adaptive coping.

626
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:45,059
Okay. So because, you know, you have this vulnerability, your resources that you would have spent otherwise are being spent in this way.

627
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,720
So this is just a figure of. Yes.

628
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,830
And daily experiences and emotions where the darkest bar is lowest.

629
01:07:52,840 --> 01:08:02,639
Yes. The solid gray is me, mid like mid income and then ISIS, in terms of their daily experiences,

630
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:09,510
looking at these scores of like a control or autonomy, positive affect and then social strain.

631
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:18,479
So this is another structural equation modeling, but this one is a lot easier to understand, I think, just looking at the flow of it.

632
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,629
So if you look at socioeconomic status and metabolic syndrome,

633
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:30,630
there is a negative association there between socio like socioeconomic status

634
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:36,960
level and metabolic syndrome and then it's relationship with reserve capacity,

635
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:43,560
negative emotions and then also negative emotions filtering to metabolic syndrome.

636
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:49,830
And this is across a 12 year follow up. So this isn't cross-sectional, it's actually longitudinal.

637
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:56,640
Oh, okay. That's why I've seen that that this study, though.

638
01:08:56,650 --> 01:09:04,740
Ho, ho, ho. Water and Bennet used this RCN in their study.

639
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:13,170
They applied the Irish RC to their study to look at perceived discrimination and health related quality of life among Hispanic Americans.

640
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:22,260
So this was a cross-sectional study that they did with 236 Hispanic participants from Kansas City metro area.

641
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:29,700
And they again used these validated scales perceived discrimination, optimism, social support,

642
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:35,550
symptoms of trait anxiety, and then physical and mental health related quality of life.

643
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:41,730
So you see here they only use like eight questions versus the previous study were these 36 items.

644
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:52,259
So this one here is another complex looking as it kind of surprises me due to the they preferred language.

645
01:09:52,260 --> 01:10:02,400
Okay. But basically this is a path analysis which is a form of SVM which shows that direct negative associations between poor script.

646
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:09,560
Discrimination and both forms of health related quality of life, mental health and physical health,

647
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:18,980
and that these relationships were partially mediated by the reserve capacity variable of optimism and symptoms of anxiety.

648
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:29,600
So if you had more optimism, you're boosting your reserve capacity to essentially mediate this negative association or decrease its impact.

649
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:37,640
And then symptoms, anxiety. If you have more symptoms, not have symptoms of anxiety, it's going to exacerbate the negative association.

650
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,799
But based on their study,

651
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:49,430
it shows that perceived discrimination depletes essentially your interpersonal reserves that you have leading to negative emotions.

652
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:58,550
So this study concluded essentially that you need to basically have interventions to increase social capital.

653
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,780
What does that like even mean in the context of this community?

654
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,169
That's a little bit complicated. In the discussion.

655
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:14,059
In particular, they use the black community as an example, talking about how like they leverage social community,

656
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:20,030
particularly, if you like, the faith community, the church community, their neighborhood community.

657
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:28,430
Whereas with Hispanic and Latino populations, you have many different ethnicities within that group.

658
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:39,260
So I personally don't have any great ideas on interventions to increase social capital among this population.

659
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:48,229
And the authors didn't either because they just said increase or you have interventions to increase social capital,

660
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:53,150
which I feel like whenever you submit a journal article and I kind of do like a throwaway line like that,

661
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:56,360
the reviewers are like, this is trash because the whole thing.

662
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,310
But 2013 was a different time. Thank you.

663
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:13,910
So that was a very like overview sampler of a couple of frameworks related to psychosocial factors and the community and builds environment for you.

664
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:22,850
And also some, some, some questionnaires that you can start maybe looking at and drawing from potentially for your assignment.

665
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:32,780
Any thoughts or questions I always find funny with this paper in particular about like environmental healthcare that impacts people.

666
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:38,630
And it's like researchers write a big long paper about how it's horrible and then they do it in one line of like,

667
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,360
we need further interventions to improve this.

668
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,880
And it's like just kind of a very interesting dynamic where active policy researchers siloing their that they were like,

669
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:52,340
I'm just doing the research and I'm not here to give recommendations. I'm also person.

670
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:56,790
But oftentimes the positive or the people who read the research are like, Well,

671
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,830
if you don't have an idea, then I have absolutely no idea that kind of thing.

672
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,690
And that's something I hate to do some research,

673
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:11,180
but I come from the research that in me to I do know that I need to have an action or it's pointless for me.

674
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:14,660
I'm very much, yes. I'm also in that translational research line.

675
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:18,650
So like if you work in like epi or bio stats, mostly in that world,

676
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:23,779
when you write a manuscript like the methods and the results are the most important part,

677
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:29,570
the introduction can be like one or two paragraphs and the discussion can be like, and that's all.

678
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:35,510
But for the journals that I target, my research for the discussion is the most important part.

679
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:45,740
And the hardest part. And the way that I've always was trying to write my research was for the public health practitioner, not for the academic.

680
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:53,450
So, you know, you you want to be able for me, everybody has like what you talked about in this class.

681
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,180
Everybody has a different lens to research, right?

682
01:13:56,180 --> 01:14:02,299
So some people really have that lens where they call it a pragmatist lens, which is like truth finding.

683
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:06,080
I'm just here to find the facts. Here are the facts. You're welcome.

684
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:14,989
And then for me, it's more I'm definitely like that, like, positive this like a translational lens where to me,

685
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:20,840
my research, I don't care if it's in the nature, I don't care if it's like in environment or high impact journal.

686
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:27,650
It's most important to me if the people who are reading it are the people who are going to implement the change.

687
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,059
And so they need to understand, like, what does this study actually mean?

688
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:41,120
And then what am I recommending for you to do? But then I don't get big grants and no one cares about my work.

689
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,130
So, you know, trying to.
