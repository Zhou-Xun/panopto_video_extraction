1
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,540
Do you ever feel stressed out?

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,910
How do you feel?

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,440
How does it make you feel?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,810
Well, what is stress?

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,260
Biologically speaking, stress is
a response to an environmental threat or

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,840
challenge.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,030
Let's think about an example
you might be familiar with.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,350
If you experience a fearful stimulus,
you might sense and

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,380
increase in your heart beat.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,890
Your body does this to provide
more oxygenation to your tissues,

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,320
should you need to react quickly.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Your body might also
feel like more focused or

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,090
more hyper focused on what's going on.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,530
And it does this in response to being able
to think quickly about the situation.

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,930
Just like your body as a whole
response physiologically distress,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,390
the cells in our body
themselves respond to stress.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,190
This module will overview the ways in
which our cells respond to stress, and

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,540
highlight how this stress
may impact disease outcomes.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,700
To overview the ways in which
cells respond to stress,

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,600
let's take a look at these
drawings shown here,

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,350
which include both normal cells shown
in the upper left-hand corner, and

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,460
compare them to the other sets of
cells which are stressed cells.

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,390
We see that the normal cells have
a uniform shape and appearance, and

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,520
they each look quite
similar to one another.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,716
This is the normal way that cells look.

26
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:33,080
Our cells can respond to
stress in multiple ways.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,330
Either by changing the size,

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,820
the shape, the number of cells or
the organization of cells.

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,440
We see this in examples of
the stressed cells shown here, and

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,670
they include hypertrophy, atrophy,
hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,896
Let's take a look at each of
these examples more closely.

32
00:01:56,896 --> 00:02:02,520
Atrophy is when a cell size becomes
smaller in response to a stressor.

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,420
There are many types of stressors
that can cause atrophy.

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,490
For example lack of movement
can be a stressor, and

35
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,520
lack of movement can cause atrophy.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,370
You might have seen something like this
when in extremity, either an arm or

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,600
leg might become fractured and
has a cast put on.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,485
And when that cast is put on,

39
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:24,582
it then limits the movement that
that extremity can undergo.

40
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:29,452
And so when the cast is removed, the size
of that extremity appears to be smaller

41
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:32,630
as compared to the uncasted counterpart.

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,520
This difference in size, is because
the cells in the injured limb shrink

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,040
in size due to the lack of movement,
and this is called atrophy.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,680
Atrophy can also be due to lack of oxygen
due to cellular deprivation of nutrients,

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,160
or due to the removal of hormone
signals that maintain cell size.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,170
Atrophy of cells can cause many
important changes to tissues,

47
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,110
that can impact their structure and
their function.

48
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,340
Sometimes, these changes
become clinically relevant.

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,930
For example, diseases caused by atrophy of
nervous tissues include poliomyelitis and

50
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,560
ALS, which is also called
Lou Gehrig's Disease.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,280
Muscular dystrophy, is a disease caused
by the atrophy of muscle tissues.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,390
Hypertrophy and hyperplasia are both
cellular responses distress that result

53
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,920
in an overall increase in a size of
the tissue, albeit for different reasons.

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,780
Hypertrophy is when the cell size becomes
larger in response to a stressor.

55
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,910
Whereas hyperplasia is when the cell
size actually remains the same but

56
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,740
the actual number of cells increases, so

57
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,610
there is more cells in response
to a stressor with hyperplasia.

58
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,330
Both hormone signalling and

59
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,740
an increased workload, can cause
hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,790
So although these are cellular
responses to a stressor,

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,290
it's important to remember that
they're not necessarily bad things.

62
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,900
For example, our muscles may
actually experience hypertrophy

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,190
in response to a good stressor
like resistance exercise.

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,450
So if you've been going to the gym and
you've been lifting a lot of weights or

65
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,290
doing other resistance exercise,
your cells are becoming hypertrophic,

66
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,500
they're increasing in size which
causes increase in your muscle size.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,940
And this is actually a good thing because,
perhaps it makes your muscles stronger and

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,370
you're able to be more healthy.

69
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,470
An example of hyperplasia that you
might have heard about is when during

70
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,010
the menstrual cycle,
the cells line in the endometrium

71
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,400
become hyperplasiac in
response to hormone signaling.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,040
So during the menstrual cycle, there's
a normal set of hormones that trigger our

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,160
body to understand where we might
be in terms of reproduction.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,070
And to prepare for
a possible pregnancy, our body will

75
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,440
build up the lining of the endometrium,
and that is due to hyperplasia.

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,150
However, there's a lot of
examples in which Hypertrophy &

77
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,910
Hyperplasia might have negative
outcomes related to disease.

78
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,340
One example is Cushing's disease.

79
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,920
Cushing's disease has a lot of symptoms,
including weight gain, high blood

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,360
pressure, moon faced appearance,
and imperitamunologic function.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,050
And so it can impact an individual's
quality of life in many ways.

82
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,930
And, this disease is actually related
to hyperplasia of the adrenal gland,

83
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,100
and that Hyperplasia is due to increased
levels of a hormone called ACTH,

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,220
or adrenocorticotropic hormone.

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,540
Metaplasia & Dysplasia are cellular
responses to stress that we often

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,640
discuss together, because they often
occur sequentially in response

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,320
to a stressor that is carcinogenic.

88
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
However, metaplasia and

89
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,200
dysplasia don't always happen in
response to a carcinogenic stressor.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,130
And they are fundamentally different
cellular responses to stress.

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,560
Metaplasia is a change in a cell
type in response to a stressor.

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,540
So the cell type itself actually changes.

93
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,450
The sound's crazy, I know.

94
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,080
But it happens because that new cell
type might be better adapted to

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,410
the environment,
that includes that stressor.

96
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,060
So with metaplasia, the size, the shape,

97
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,660
the organization of the cells,
all appear to be normal.

98
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,080
If it was that cell type, but it's not.

99
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,470
The cell type is actually different
compared to what it originally was.

100
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,990
So a classic example of
metaplasia that we see,

101
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,010
is in a condition called
Barrett's esophagus.

102
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,120
With Barrett's esophagus,
the cells lining the esophageal tract.

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,750
Change from a squamous epithelial cell
type, to a columbus epithelial cell type.

104
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,700
And they change in response to chronic
exposure to stomach acid, and that stomach

105
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,970
acid is due to a condition called
gastroesophageal reflux disorder, or GERD.

106
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,910
So these columnar epithelial cells,

107
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,680
are better able to withstand that acidic
environment associated with GERD.

108
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,373
And so
the body adapts to protect the esophagus,

109
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:08,500
by changing the cell type
which lines the esophagus.

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,400
Dysplasia is a change in the cell size,

111
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,920
shape, uniformity or
organization in response to a stressor.

112
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,160
Unlike metaplasia where the cell
type changes, with dysplasia,

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,860
the cell type remains the same but the
physical structure and the organization of

114
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,980
those cells look different under
a microscope, as compared to normal cells.

115
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,200
One example of dysplasia
you may have heard of,

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,480
is epithelia dysplasia of cervical
cells or cervical dysplasia.

117
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,370
This condition is something we look for
when we screen for

118
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,120
cervical cancer,
because it's known that cervical dysplasia

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,740
is something that is
a precursor to cervical cancer.

120
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,570
Waller cells are amazingly
adaptive in response to stress.

121
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,300
We've learned about all the ways in which
our cells can respond to that stress.

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,570
Sometimes, the cell ultimately
responds through Cell Death.

123
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,810
Cell death can actually occur through two
processes called apoptosis and necrosis.

124
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,250
Apoptosis is programmed cell death,
and it occurs continually and

125
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,200
normally in our body.

126
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,790
Cell growth and repair is only
possible because of apoptosis.

127
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,500
As our body replaces old
cells with new ones,

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,660
those old cells are removed
through a process of apoptosis.

129
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,810
Necrosis however, is a type of cell death
that results in a response to cellular

130
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,510
injury, or toxins, or
in response to infections or inflammation.

131
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,400
So unlike apoptosis which is actually
very beneficial to our body.

132
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,248
And is required for normal growth,
development and repair.

133
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:50,051
Necrosis is a destructive process to our
body, and is associated with inflammation,

134
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:55,480
and extracellular debris, and
waste at the site of cell death.

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,354
Stress is a normal part of life, and

136
00:08:57,354 --> 00:09:00,380
is a normal experience
encountered by our cells.

137
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,782
Our cells are amazing in their
ability to deal with that stress,

138
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,998
and adapt in ways to maintain our health.

139
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:12,420
But sometimes, those responses can cause
other damage to our tissues and disease.

140
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,220
And so as we learn about our body,
understanding the ways in which cells cope

141
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,450
with stress, will help us understand
how our body remains healthy or

142
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,028
moves toward a disease outcome.
