1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:08,903
Hello, everybody. Welcome. And nice to see you all.

2
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:14,183
Thanks to the waves. So I'm delighted.

3
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,833
This is a good test of the technology. Thanks, everybody, for your help.

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:25,523
I want to just do some quick introductions and then I'm going to ask all of you in the class to do quick introductions,

5
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:30,472
Angie and Wilma and hopefully Zachary will be joining us soon.

6
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:40,263
We'll know who they're speaking with. But it is my real pleasure, first and foremost, to introduce Angie Reyes and Wilma Rachel Caldwell.

7
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,892
I will let them say more about themselves in a few minutes.

8
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:50,243
But Angie is the executive director of Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, has been a founding member of the Detroit Yahtzee Board.

9
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:56,543
You've seen her name in many publications, as have you, with Wilma Bradford Caldwell,

10
00:00:56,543 --> 00:01:04,043
who's the former deputy director of the Detroit Health Department and was a member of the U.S. board for a number of years and was

11
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:11,903
on the Community Action Against Asthma Steering Committee for a number of years and has stayed involved since her retirement.

12
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:16,582
You know, both of them. I've had the good fortune to travel with CO-PRESENT,

13
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:22,613
with coauthor WIB and just very near and dear to my heart in the work that we do in Detroit

14
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:26,873
that you all have had a chance to read a lot about over the course of the semester.

15
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:30,293
So we're in for a real treat and hopefully soon.

16
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:38,093
Zachary Rowe, who is the executive director of Friends of Parkside on the east side of Detroit, will be joining us.

17
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,852
He, too, is a founding member of the Detroit Yahtzee board.

18
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:47,603
And pretty much all the things I said about Angie and well, I could share, say with Zachary as well.

19
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:56,363
When I again, you know, I'll give them a chance to say more about themselves to the extent they want to later.

20
00:01:56,663 --> 00:02:01,433
What I wanted to do to start us off with, well, I'll back up one more minute.

21
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:06,543
I also want to introduce Mary Beth Dam. Mary Beth, who's maybe waving.

22
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,213
I can't see her at this point.

23
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:19,403
Mary Beth is the center manager of the Detroit you see and really appreciate her being there today to console and take this conversation.

24
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:23,813
And thanks so much for our incredible I.T. support.

25
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:31,912
Delighted to see you and appreciate your help. And so just to we'll start with introductions again.

26
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:39,203
I would just like and we'll see how the owl does on this for each of you to briefly introduce yourself,

27
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:46,283
say what program you're in so they can get a chance, an opportunity to see who's in the room, so to speak.

28
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:52,972
And if you want to say one or two brief comments about your interest in CPR, again, we're a large group,

29
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:58,823
and so we need to kind of keep it moving because I really want to hear from Angie and Wilma as well.

30
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:05,843
So I probably will be quickest just to go down the rows and the least confusing for the owl.

31
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:10,163
So I don't know who wants to get us started on this, but again,

32
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:17,753
name and affiliation within the university and you know, a brief comment about your interest in Cdpr.

33
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:22,763
So who wants to get it started? I will go first.

34
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:26,203
Hopefully the owl can see me over here. My name's Amy.

35
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:33,893
I'm a second year student. I am doing a degree in health behavior, health education and genetic counseling.

36
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:41,803
I don't have any prior experience directly doing CPR, but have really heard about it a lot recently.

37
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:45,233
I was just kind of intrigued to know more. That's why I joined.

38
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,493
It's great. I'm yes, I'm Erin and I am.

39
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:57,113
And this is environment and sustainability. I think that would be interesting.

40
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:03,363
I would say my work is mostly around working with schools in Ypsilanti and Detroit,

41
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:10,023
having young people identify and address environmental issues and environmental justice

42
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:15,512
issues that I feel like I sort of practice PR with teachers and community partners,

43
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:22,263
but I have no formal training and it's really exciting to know the academic side of this.

44
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,843
Hi, everybody. Mask down, so hopefully it can kick me out.

45
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:34,453
My name is Carol. I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Health Behavioral Health Education Program.

46
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:41,232
I'm really interested in working with communities and how they engage with primary care and

47
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,103
how physicians could be better trained to work in the communities that they're serving.

48
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:49,002
And so that right there is kind of why I'm interested in CPR.

49
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:55,033
I think it's important not just to be community informed, but to be ingrained in the community.

50
00:04:55,043 --> 00:05:03,743
My name is from Detroit, so I'm really excited to do work that impacts the community and also my own community as well as to media.

51
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:12,513
So my name is Clara and I'm a first year health, education, health behavior student.

52
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:17,822
I was really excited to join this class because I have not had formal training

53
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:23,583
in CPR and I'm hoping to be able to use it in working with black communities,

54
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:30,553
especially those impacted by forced migration. Hi.

55
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:35,043
My name is Peter Russo. I'm a Ph.D. student in the School of Environmental Sustainability.

56
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:40,443
I do a lot of research looking at complex environmental challenges,

57
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:50,102
and particularly the different ways that communities understand the challenge can be addressed and not just their interests and their values,

58
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:53,313
but actually the underlying way they understand the problem.

59
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:59,192
And I've been interested in typical for a long time, and especially my last class ever as a Ph.D. student.

60
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,143
But actually, one, make sure I take those things.

61
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:10,353
My name is Maggie. I am a second year student in the School for Environment and Sustainability as a master's student.

62
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:20,912
I'm studying environmental psychology and I'm very interested in the overlap between that and public health and the potential

63
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:29,853
for programing that addresses sustainability and environmental justice and public health concerns at the same time.

64
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:43,143
And so very excited about how the CB PR approach can become more present in the sustainability and justice, research and program design.

65
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:54,593
Hello, everyone. I'm Zoey. Which way? The zero 0:08 a.m. a first year social work student.

66
00:06:54,603 --> 00:07:03,543
Hopefully will be a public health soon. I'm interested in Indigenous communities and substance use and understanding that in the context of

67
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:09,603
grief and trauma and then a kind of comparative study for mainland China and the one child policy.

68
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:17,683
Everyone. My name's Noah Kellogg. I'm a seven year master's student in health behavior and health education.

69
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:21,552
And I'm really interested in CDP because I believe it's an approach that can

70
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:27,223
help us really identify equitable and actionable way towards health equity.

71
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:29,683
So I'm really pleased that you all are here today.

72
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:38,623
Hello, I'm Devin Jill and I'm a second year PhD student in the School for Environment and Sustainability.

73
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:42,972
And for my research, I'm interested in community engaged research,

74
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:51,883
but looking at climate change and how Great Lakes cities can prepare for climate migration and other related climate risks.

75
00:07:54,883 --> 00:08:00,103
My name's Amy. I'm also a second year pastry student in school for environment stability.

76
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:04,933
My research looks at human tiger interactions in Nepal.

77
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:14,263
I'm interested in CPR as an approach for helping communities to live in shared landscapes with large carnivores.

78
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:18,643
Adapt to living with those wild animals.

79
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:26,113
Hi. My name is Catherine. I hope you can hear me. Very excited to have you here today.

80
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:31,443
I'm a second year master's student with the School for Environment and Sustainability.

81
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:36,493
I'm studying environmental justice and I'm also working on getting a certificate in a school of public health.

82
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:45,853
I'm interested in CPR and using different community science projects, particularly surrounding water quality, water accessibility and health.

83
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:56,113
Hi. My name is Sarah McNally. I'm a second year student and the Health Behavior and Health Education Master's program.

84
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:01,063
I'm interested in working with the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population in the US.

85
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:05,713
My particular focus has mostly been on risk behaviors and mental health outcomes,

86
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:11,143
but I'm interested in their general health disparities and I think CPR could be a wonderful way to work within my community.

87
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:20,083
I am Sabina Sala. I'm a second year student in Environmental Health Sciences.

88
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:30,223
I have a little bit of prior experience working with Latino youth around air pollution and asthma and using a Weipa approach.

89
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:35,533
But currently I work a little bit more on biomarkers of environmental exposures,

90
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:44,413
but I'm interested in using mixed methods to work with our community engagement corps and integrate some more qualitative information in my work.

91
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:52,353
Hello. Hi. Gerald Reavis, second year student in the Health Behavior and Health Education Department.

92
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:59,253
I was cast as I wanted to learn more about CPR and I am a part of a project here

93
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:06,482
at the department where it is a CPR approach for mental health integration,

94
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:10,053
for HIV services in western Kenya.

95
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:16,383
So I wanted to learn more about the actual foundations of CPR applied to the actual CPR work.

96
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,683
I do. Hello.

97
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:23,143
I'm Sarah. She. Her pronouns are my second year.

98
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:32,893
She's student here, master's student. And I'm interested in Cdpr because I've been doing a lot of clinical research and I think that the

99
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:38,413
principles that we can learn here would really benefit me and the research that I'm doing with individuals.

100
00:10:41,883 --> 00:10:44,012
Hi, everyone. My name is Tabitha Reynolds.

101
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:51,123
I'm a second year master's student in the School of Social Work in the School of Public Health, studying HIV and community change.

102
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:57,123
I took this class because I'm really passionate about an asset based approach to working with communities,

103
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,992
and I last summer worked with youth in Washtenaw County,

104
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:06,572
so I'm really hoping to incorporate what I'm learning in this class back into that program that I'm still working with.

105
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:11,173
So thank you for coming and talking to us. Hi.

106
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:15,823
I'm Cindy. I'm a second year master's student in health behavior and health education.

107
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:21,493
I was excited to take this class because I've done some work with community engaged research in Detroit,

108
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:28,483
and so I was really excited to learn more about specifically CPR principles and how they could be adapted to or fit into different research space.

109
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:36,503
Hi. My name is Meghan. I'm also a second year master's student in education.

110
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:40,853
My interests centered around security and public benefits.

111
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:46,373
And I was really interested in learning about how CPR can be used in health policy.

112
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:52,492
I'm Katie. I'm also a second year master's student.

113
00:11:52,493 --> 00:12:00,113
And helping with your health education. I never heard of CPR until I came into the Energy Department and was really excited to learn more about it.

114
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:06,803
And so my passions involve health equity and raising voices of people's individual medical journeys.

115
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:12,533
I am Jane Berry. I'm also a second year master's student in the department.

116
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:17,183
I've had the pleasure and privilege of my career to work alongside community health workers a lot,

117
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:23,843
and I think a really tie in CPR principles in a really natural and grassroots kind of way that I've been so fortunate to learn.

118
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:29,123
It's that really piqued my interest. And then I've continued that work here a little bit from there at U of M so.

119
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:34,783
My name is Sam. I am also a second year HBCU student.

120
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:38,473
I do a lot of work with CPR in general and my own work.

121
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:44,363
But I came here to understand more about how CPR really uplifts and empowers communities and us,

122
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:49,513
as well as kind of building trust between researchers and community residents and stuff.

123
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:53,453
So yeah. Hi.

124
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:58,492
I'm Mary Beth. Nice to see you, Andrea Marla, the center manager for the city.

125
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:02,873
And I will pass them along. I guess you're being with us today.

126
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:09,592
I'm Claire McKenna. I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the school environment and sustainability study energy

127
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:15,593
equity around climate change policy and how low household energy costs burn in our area.

128
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:21,562
So between in Detroit, I'm doing research with 50 households and person field research,

129
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:30,053
and I want to make sure that mixed methods of approaches that I use actually have just outcomes and that embody the community needs.

130
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:34,432
Thanks. Hi, my name is Trish Fisher.

131
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:41,053
I'm a fourth year dual degree master's student in public policy and health management policy.

132
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:50,992
I'm particularly interested in food and agricultural policy, and particularly working with communities impacted by industrial livestock,

133
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:55,193
agriculture and on climate and environmental health issues.

134
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:04,292
Hi. I am Sara meyer and I'm a faculty member in the School of Nursing and Research on Gender

135
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:08,402
Based Violence Prevention and have always done kind of community engaged research,

136
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:12,843
but really wanted to learn more methods and models for deepening the practice

137
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:16,172
and moving toward community co-ownership and community leadership of research,

138
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:19,293
especially being a person working on trans health research a lot.

139
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,553
So I've been really excited to learn from you guys today.

140
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:31,733
Hi. I'm Natalie Wagner. I'm a dual public health and public policy student, and this is my second class with Dr. Israel.

141
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:38,273
I really enjoyed the first and was just excited to take another and learn the basics of CPR.

142
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,652
I think the last person, I think.

143
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:48,763
Yvonne, do you want to jump in? Yes, my name is Yvonne.

144
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:53,773
I'm a second year in social work. I'm doing global social work at the moment.

145
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,993
My biggest interest is talking about social sciences,

146
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:08,323
so specifically with mental health cross-culturally and using CPR hopefully to bring that into practice.

147
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:13,093
So research practitioner specifically in Latino and Chicano and Indigenous studies.

148
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,392
Thank you. So thank you all so much.

149
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:21,843
And I learned some more about you than since the beginning of the class.

150
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:26,733
So I really appreciate it. And I'm sure it was very helpful for Wilma and energy.

151
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:30,523
And you just see what an incredible group of students this is in this room.

152
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:35,343
So, again, it's been my pleasure working with you throughout the semester.

153
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:42,003
Still no word from Zachary so we're just going to plug ahead is doing everything's okay.

154
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:48,392
I'm going to turn it over to Mary Beth and just and Mary Beth is going to ask them the questions.

155
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:50,673
I thought it would be easier to have somebody there locally.

156
00:15:51,663 --> 00:16:04,053
But just as an overview, you know, I've asked Angie and Wilma to share both their perspectives on the benefits of CPR, some of the challenges of CPR,

157
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:10,472
and then some of their sort of what do they think are the most important factors for maintaining effective

158
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:20,703
partnerships and and any specific advice they have for you all as students and potential users and of a CPR approach?

159
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:28,022
So again, you're in for a real treat. I'm going to put my the only way you can get rid of me is to take my video off,

160
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:33,333
which unfortunately is going to going to have a big read be because I haven't figured out how to change that.

161
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:40,293
But other than that, I am here and I will turn it over to Mary Beth.

162
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:46,103
Hi. Can you hear me from back here? Yeah.

163
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:50,482
So we have a little extra time.

164
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:59,873
So without having a third person. So please take all the time you need and we'll also have an opportunity for questions as they go along.

165
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:05,242
So the first question is what are the benefits of using a community based

166
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:10,463
participatory research approach in the Detroit CRC and affiliated Partnerships?

167
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:15,893
Community Action Against Asthma, the Healthy Environment Partnership Café.

168
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:27,003
Whichever example you'd like to use. So personal benefits, benefits to your organization and benefits to the communities involved.

169
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:38,033
Give preference for who goes first. Mine said that she would tell us who would go first.

170
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:48,923
So go on, Grant. Marybeth, you choose who you really want to hear first.

171
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:56,003
She looks like she put you on, though. Oh, yeah.

172
00:17:56,013 --> 00:18:03,143
She took her camera off. Okay, so I guess I'll go first. So who's on first?

173
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:12,893
From a personal perspective, over the years, as Barbara mentioned, been involved together for it's been like 27 years or so.

174
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:17,903
So we both we all started when we were quite young and.

175
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:25,343
You develop some pretty close relationships with folks and friendships over time,

176
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,703
or else you wouldn't want to continue to work with people for that long.

177
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:38,613
My my standing joke is that the U.S. is my longstanding relationship, that it's outlasted both my marriage has put together.

178
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:48,533
So it is it is pretty good relationships with folks that I have become very good friends, especially when you travel together.

179
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:53,123
So being able to travel to different places all over the country,

180
00:18:53,123 --> 00:19:00,293
I've also had an opportunity to go to both Colombia and Canada and Puerto Rico as well to do presentations.

181
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:04,432
So having that opportunity to travel to those places, especially like Colombia,

182
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:10,313
I'd probably never would have gone had it not been as part of a U.S. project.

183
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:21,713
Being able to do all that traveling, I occasionally get called Dr. Reyes, which I am not, but I'll it's nice to be called that every once in a while.

184
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:34,613
And just the the professional development over the years, the things that I've learned about research has been really gratifying.

185
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:41,423
And then being able to use a lot of the information and the knowledge that I've gained to help my community in my organization.

186
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:50,393
So in as most of you probably are aware of it, we live in a very competitive society and it's not any different in the nonprofit world.

187
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,973
We're always put in positions where we have to compete for limited resources,

188
00:19:56,993 --> 00:20:09,322
but having access to quality research that has a very strong community voice is always helps in the development of our organization,

189
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:15,143
both in developing programs and then being able to generate resources and funding.

190
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:24,743
So kind of puts you head and shoulders above some of the other organizations and it has definitely benefited the community that I live in.

191
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:30,833
I'm a lifelong Detroiter, I live in southwest Detroit, which is for those of you who are not familiar with Detroit,

192
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:40,133
where the predominantly the Latino community lives and also has historically had a lot of environmental issues

193
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:48,683
because we are one smack dab on the busiest northern border crossing in the country with the ambassador,

194
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:57,023
the privately owned Ambassador Bridge that goes to Canada. And then now the second bridge, the Gordie Howe Bridge that's being built going to Canada.

195
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:01,673
So along with that comes a tremendous amount of truck traffic through our community.

196
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:05,393
And Detroit has up to this point not had truck routes.

197
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:15,113
So trucks go through our community all the time and we get thousands of trucks that go on a daily basis through our community.

198
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:16,072
Plus,

199
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:27,443
we have a lot of industrial facilities that are in extremely close proximity to residential communities because the zoning is a little bit screwy.

200
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:35,013
So you may have an area that has both residential and industrial zoned within a couple of houses of each other.

201
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:49,912
So so there's a lot of the industrial pollution and then we live upwind, I think it is from several coal burning plants that are out of state.

202
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:53,783
Even so, they come in. We also have the freeways that go through our neighborhoods.

203
00:21:53,783 --> 00:22:00,713
So it's kind of a perfect storm in our community with all of the poor air quality.

204
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:07,763
We have some of the worst air quality in the country, but with various of our CVP partnerships,

205
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:14,603
just one example of how it's benefited the community is through a cafe.

206
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:21,503
We were working on a community health action plan to addressing air quality in our community.

207
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:30,472
At the same time, I also sit on a committee advisory group that negotiated had been negotiating community benefits

208
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:35,093
for the community immediately impacted by the building of the Second International Bridge.

209
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:46,793
And this was like a ten year process of trying to make a case with officials at the federal level, the state level, the city level.

210
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:53,753
And it and it actually also includes Windsor because it's an international bridge for community benefits.

211
00:22:53,753 --> 00:23:00,593
And if you look at the conditions in the community on the other side of the river where the other end of the bridge will land,

212
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:09,743
because Canada has very different laws about environmental justice and and how it impacts communities.

213
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:14,273
Plus, that side of the bridge is more rural.

214
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:19,492
And wealthier community on our side of the bridge.

215
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:31,553
It's a very poor, predominately community of color, mostly Latino and African-American, with very little political power and a lot of children.

216
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:39,793
So as I said, we we knew the bridge was coming into our community simply because we did not have the same political

217
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:45,553
power that other communities might have had with they had supposedly been looking at building the bridge.

218
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:52,933
So there's really uneven impact on our community, on the health of our community,

219
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:57,043
because we knew was going to increase the number of trucks coming through our community.

220
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:01,092
I think one estimate is that an additional 10,000 trucks a day would come through

221
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:06,613
our community with all of that and the PM 2.5 that comes along with that.

222
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:12,073
With the data that we had been gathering through CAFE,

223
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:18,522
we were able to make a much stronger case along with all the community organizing

224
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:23,443
and community efforts for four community benefits coming into our community,

225
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:31,183
because we had some officials who were saying how well, how do we know the increase in asthma is not just because people are smoking in their houses,

226
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:39,733
which is usually where people default to individual blame rather than looking at the environmental concerns.

227
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:49,602
So with the research and the modeling, we were able to show that no, this is a direct result of the additional truck traffic.

228
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:52,773
And we also had some folks saying, well, what does it matter?

229
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:57,703
You already have a lot of trucks and pollution in the areas of what the, for instance, a little bit more pollution make anyway.

230
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:03,522
And we were able to actually monetize and quantify what the impact would be on the

231
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:08,383
number of lives lost of the number of school days and workdays that would be lost.

232
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:16,213
So as a result, we were able to to win about almost $50 million in community benefits,

233
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:22,213
which included a number of things from housing swap for people who were left behind.

234
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:27,733
We're going to be very much impacted by the development of this new bridge, as well as.

235
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:35,193
Improved HVAC systems and windows and things on some of the other houses.

236
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:42,682
Job development of doing a health impact assessment, and it would include recommendations for things like buffers.

237
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:49,353
So it's a whole number of things that would help mitigate some of the impacts of additional pollution.

238
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:56,793
So it was literally the difference between life and death for some folks that we were able to win these community benefits.

239
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:01,092
And because of the combination of having the CBP,

240
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:06,933
our research along with the community that have been fighting and organizing for so long for the community.

241
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:12,013
Yeah, I know. That was pretty long, but I'm not sure. Over to Wilma.

242
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:18,273
Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, bubba.

243
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:27,633
Okay. So when I came into the U.S., it was back when they first started back in 1995.

244
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:34,442
And at the time, I was working for the City of Detroit Health Department when I decided to retire.

245
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:38,253
You remember Wilma. Do you want. Sorry, Wilma. Do you want to put your video back on?

246
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:45,433
When did it go off? Oh, okay.

247
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:52,283
So why did it go off? There it is. Perfect. Perfect.

248
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:55,613
Okay. Sorry for interrupting. That's okay.

249
00:26:57,223 --> 00:27:04,963
So I started off as a member of the Detroit Health Department, and then when I decided to retire, Robin then decided I'd have enough to do.

250
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:11,983
So they asked me what I jump in with CPR, and that was 24 years ago.

251
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:17,593
I come to the this morning. So I've been pretty much a part of that.

252
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:30,733
And the benefits to myself is I got a chance to serve on a board that was doing putting together some guidelines for a children's study.

253
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:34,752
And I worked on that for five years.

254
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:41,023
When the man asked me to do this, I was retired by then and I told him, You think I'm going to be alive in five years?

255
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:46,182
Well, I'm still here. And that was back in 060708.

256
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:53,983
So I guess I'm doing well. I got put on a committee for city match as part of my.

257
00:27:54,853 --> 00:28:02,963
Oh, being my thing of working with the C.P.R., which they were working with children and problems with children.

258
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:05,453
And I stayed on that board for a couple of years to.

259
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:16,523
It has it really opened up my eyes because when I was working for the Detroit Health Department, we never we never sat on national boards.

260
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:23,062
And I got a chance to meet people from other states, counties, whatever.

261
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:31,073
It was really interesting. The friendships, like Ray says, we've been friends for years and years and years ago.

262
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,642
So many friendships over the years.

263
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:42,323
Of course, when we first started we weren't friends because we were a little leery about who it was that we were working with.

264
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:43,343
And then, you know,

265
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:52,672
your whole thing is why does University of Michigan want to come all the way to Detroit to get residents to participate in the study?

266
00:28:52,673 --> 00:29:00,253
So you always have that going for it. I love that.

267
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:03,553
You know, that was, to me, personal. That was personal.

268
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:09,403
Now benefits to the organization the city of Detroit Health Department has never had.

269
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:15,113
People in place that could do any kind of research.

270
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:19,103
I mean, all we did was sort of follow the money.

271
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:24,203
So if you give me money for it, then I do the lab.

272
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:30,403
If you give me money for infant mortality, not to the infant mortality.

273
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:34,433
So we really never had a research arm.

274
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:38,423
Although some other health departments do. So do you. I didn't have that.

275
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:45,803
So this gave us a chance to get some of our questions answered because we didn't have any numbers about certain things.

276
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:54,533
And U of M was willing to listen to us about things that we wanted to do and come up with some answers.

277
00:29:54,533 --> 00:30:00,293
And then they gave us also the ability to interact with other community based

278
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:07,553
organizations that some of them won't even know they existed until we got into u r c.

279
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:17,242
So u r c have been good for the organization as a whole because it has helped us to maybe develop

280
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:24,533
some of the programs that we wanted to do with some with some research that back this up.

281
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:36,953
I personally worked a lot with Community Action Against Asthma, so I was there from the initial beginning when we started and.

282
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,163
We had the chance, thanks to David Satcher.

283
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:51,523
Taking a whole year and working with this community and finding what it was they wanted to do.

284
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:59,392
That was a little stressful because sometimes what happens is the CDOs change,

285
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:05,463
you know, small organizations or they changed a man three months into a thing.

286
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:09,893
And so you got to you have to always discuss what's going on.

287
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:15,093
Then we always had that issue with how the community didn't trust them anyway.

288
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:24,662
So, you know, the organization had to help them as well as they helping us to try to not only get our trust,

289
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:37,563
but get the trust of the community to the benefits to the community meant that we could develop programs that were about the community.

290
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:46,143
Because you went out there and you asked the community and they would tell you, because I know one time we were doing this one year approach.

291
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:52,203
One of the community members says We don't want to do any more prenatal care.

292
00:31:54,843 --> 00:32:02,073
We want to do something different. So that's how we got the community action against AZ because they didn't want to do it either.

293
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:09,393
They wanted their community to find out why they killed this coffin and carried on, why they can't get rid of it.

294
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:16,923
So that was a good thing for them because they helped to define what they want is community.

295
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:22,383
Sometime I tell researchers, if you go out in a community and they're not interested in what you are interested in,

296
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:27,963
you need to find another community because then that participation will be really low.

297
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:35,793
And it doesn't. It hurts your research because these people don't want to do what you want them to do.

298
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:41,673
So but we will only allow that one. Most research projects, they don't give you any time.

299
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:46,323
You have to maybe do focus groups and stuff like that, but not me.

300
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:50,163
With the community on honor for a whole year, that that does just doesn't happen.

301
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:55,193
So that was that was their approach to that.

302
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:58,023
You know, that was what was good for the community.

303
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:09,963
We as people who worked in the Detroit Health Department learned a lot about research because we were not that, you know, competent about research.

304
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:20,793
We knew it existed because we all had that in college. But it was a matter of, do we have time to do this?

305
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:26,193
Do we have the body parts to do this? Like, who would we assign it to know?

306
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:35,403
Because we like we would like to know what the community needs in terms of help or help or whatever.

307
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:42,333
But a lot of things that weren't health wise became came under our jurisdiction.

308
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:46,593
You know, they keep and stuff every time something breaks out in terms of health people.

309
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:56,343
And, you know, Health Department's real goal is to maintain healthy environments and healthy communities.

310
00:33:56,913 --> 00:34:04,923
And then they pile on to all this illness, you know, which I never thought that was part of our goal or mission.

311
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:10,833
So that's it. Thank you all.

312
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,733
Okay. The questions.

313
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:20,903
We have about 15 to 20 minutes for questions after each of the major questions they're answering.

314
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:24,563
So do I have you have. Questions.

315
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:27,283
Well, a lot more, Angie. Yes.

316
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:37,513
I was wondering for Wilma as well as maybe Angie, you mentioned being leery at first about, um, researchers coming to Detroit, so I was curious,

317
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:43,012
what made you stick around long enough to actually become friends in, you know,

318
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:55,793
bothering them a real nice people and they can really rub you the right way as what I call it, but they're real nice people.

319
00:34:55,793 --> 00:35:04,073
And so they just kept step saying in and if anybody had a problem,

320
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:11,363
they really tried real hard to resolve one on one agency, the agency, stuff like that.

321
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:16,253
So that was one of the reasons why I think we stuck.

322
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:20,333
And then as we went along and saw how the research was,

323
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:30,533
we were being able to utilize that research and all the different things that was happening down in southwest Detroit and southeast Detroit.

324
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:35,093
We built trust, but you got you have to build trust.

325
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:39,293
You know, they had a Christmas party every year, you know, and stuff like that.

326
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:46,222
So this was really nice, very nice. People go ahead and yeah, you know, respond.

327
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:52,583
And then I just want to acknowledge that Zachary just joined us, too, so we we can have him chime in, too.

328
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:59,003
But the reality is, at the very beginning, one of the reasons that I stayed around and I know a few other folks,

329
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:02,963
too, was because we didn't yet know Barbara was a nice person.

330
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:09,742
This was because we knew if we knew, knew about was going to be mucking around in our neighborhood.

331
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:11,663
We wanted to be there to protect our community.

332
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:19,433
So it was because we didn't trust them and we wanted to make sure we we felt like we had to keep and keep them from

333
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:26,602
causing any damage because we've had a lot of really bad experiences in the past with researchers coming into the city.

334
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:34,493
And a lot of times research would not only not benefit our communities, but would be could damage our communities and cause real harm.

335
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:41,902
So they weren't going away. So we figured we had to stay there and we didn't think they were going to stick around at the beginning either.

336
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:46,673
So I figured if we stayed around long enough and and gave them a hard enough time,

337
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:52,423
which we did a little bit at the beginning too, that they would eventually go away, but they didn't.

338
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:56,153
And 27 years later, we're they're still coming around.

339
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:05,663
So they kind of as well. And so they grew on us. After a while, we realized that they were people that we could trust that walk their talk.

340
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:13,583
But but, you know, not everybody is like that from UVM or any university.

341
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:21,923
So we, we still are very picky about who we allow into our communities to do any kind of research.

342
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:26,123
And I turned over to Zach, I don't know Zach.

343
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:35,423
We were just answering the first question about benefits to ourselves, our organization and community.

344
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:42,803
Yeah. Hi. Zachary Roe, Executive Director for Principal I and I have to apologize for running late.

345
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:52,103
The Detroit House Friends of Parks, I located on Detroit's East Side and public housing development called the Village Parkside.

346
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:59,213
And so the Retrials and commission scheduled a site visit today for developers

347
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:05,903
to walk through in order to be able to submit a bid to redevelop Parkside.

348
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:11,032
And so, you know, since they're going to be here in this neighborhood,

349
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:15,112
I definitely wanted to sort of be there because what what was being proposed and

350
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:18,923
what's going to be done is going to definitely affect the plaza and residents here.

351
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:27,083
And so, unfortunately, you know, we got preempt and it was one of those things that I just found out about, of course.

352
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:32,453
Right. So the question was benefits to the community.

353
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:41,003
And I would probably ditto everything that Angie and and Wilmer said, to be honest.

354
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:44,453
You know, first, I didn't really think there would be no benefit.

355
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:48,742
I really thought that the cost would would exceed the benefit.

356
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:58,823
And I was I was right. The but for the first for the first, I don't know, five, six years, you know, my boy kept asking me, where are you?

357
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:03,623
Why are you still there? Why are you still involved?

358
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:12,183
You know? But I can honestly say, though, the last ten years, I think we're about even now, maybe like the last.

359
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:18,103
Last five years got even, but now we're probably a little bit ahead.

360
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:23,623
Right now, the benefits definitely exceed the cost of being a war with the Detroit you see.

361
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:31,183
And I would sort of say it was probably me and not them because, you know, as time went on,

362
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:42,733
I got a lot smarter in terms of how to really leverage the work with the researchers at the University of Michigan and in those kinds of things.

363
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:50,683
And so I got a lot better at actually being proactive in reaching out to the university and sort of saying, hey, this is what we need here.

364
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:55,633
This is the kind of system that we need are this kind of student resources we need.

365
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:04,453
And this is kind of indirect rate we need now. So just got sort of get get better at leveraging those resources.

366
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:13,303
Also understanding that our involvement with the university, depending on who we talk to, it enhances our credibility.

367
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:21,933
Right. Then also just got a lot smarter with the fact that, you know, with business project there are jobs is going to be created.

368
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:31,883
And, you know, and we can we can advocate for those jobs to go to community residents,

369
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:36,303
you know, with, you know, with the with appropriate training kinds of things.

370
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:43,443
And then in addition to advocating for community residents to get those those jobs training opportunity,

371
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:54,663
we can also advocate for businesses, local businesses to also, you know, receive some benefit from our being involved in research.

372
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,163
You know, so, you know, instead of buying food from.

373
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:03,853
Up in Dara Ann Arbor or an Ann Arbor restaurant.

374
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:08,963
We can just wait till we get to Detroit in a contract with a local business in Detroit for those things.

375
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:12,083
So over time, we just, you know, over time I got a lot smarter.

376
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:21,263
And so those perceived those early costs became less important because I could be I could be

377
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:26,603
in leveraged all these other things that the university had to offer to offset those costs.

378
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:33,862
But the early years, I was clueless. And so everything seemed like a cost, you know?

379
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:45,933
But I'm happy to say that now. Now I get it. Anyone else have any questions for Angie?

380
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:49,403
Well, Laura. Zachary. Oh, I can't.

381
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:59,073
I'm right up there, Aaron. And I'm just wondering if any of you could speak a little bit to more specifically what some of those early costs were.

382
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:02,783
Was it about a lot of your time and capacity in this partnership,

383
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:09,173
or what are the kinds of things that we should be looking at, especially when starting these partnerships to be mindful?

384
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:20,402
I was going to say we usually talk about them as opportunity costs because the time that you're spending in these meetings could have been

385
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:29,253
time that you were writing a grant or meeting with critical people where it directly impacts your organizations and communities survival.

386
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:32,793
So you have to weigh costs and benefits all the time.

387
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:41,863
So in especially when you're in an organization that has really limited resources and staff, those can be really critical times.

388
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:46,023
So that's probably the biggest cost.

389
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:51,883
I think, especially at the beginning we weren't asked to pay for anything, but it was our time is really precious.

390
00:42:51,963 --> 00:43:01,893
So one of the things that I appreciate about the USC is that they do compensate us for our time as much as possible.

391
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:10,983
I mean, we end up spending a lot of times way more time than then the actual stipend covers, but at least it's built in as much as possible.

392
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:19,052
So pretty much every single steering committee or board that we're a part of where there is some compensation for for our time,

393
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:22,303
recognizing that our time is very valuable as well, too.

394
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:25,083
You know, one of the other. Okay.

395
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:34,683
I'll just say one of the other costs that you have is that we try to compensate the residents who participate in the research.

396
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:40,262
So when you're putting together a budget, you have to remember whatever the compensation is.

397
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:53,433
Well, one time we gave them a gift card to a shoe store, and then one time we gave out food baskets and one time we gave them $25.

398
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:56,613
And, you know, we had to have a discussion about how that was going to be done.

399
00:43:57,003 --> 00:44:02,312
But those costs have to be built into your grant if you are really going and you need to be

400
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:09,302
rewarding people for their time to not just the people who are participating in the U.S.,

401
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:13,863
but also the people who are participating in a research that's very important.

402
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:20,833
Clay, that you and I would, you know, in addition to those points that Wilma and Andy said.

403
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:27,963
I would also I would also say, you know, your your true cost for participating.

404
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:33,722
And for me, that includes those opportunity cost that Angie is sort of talking about,

405
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:41,613
but also, you know, the cost of our other staff member participating and the fact that,

406
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:46,983
you know, sometimes the you know, the projects do not cover, you know,

407
00:44:47,193 --> 00:44:53,253
indirect costs because usually, you know, there's a subcontract to the to the community partner.

408
00:44:53,493 --> 00:45:00,513
We don't necessarily build in sort of the indirect cost of, you know, utility and copying and those kinds of things.

409
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:07,293
And so, you know, we don't really well, at first we really didn't do a good job of recovering those kinds of costs.

410
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:15,033
Yeah. So yeah, hopefully that helps. Thank you.

411
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:19,293
Any other questions? Okay.

412
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:27,573
We'll move on to the next question for the panel. What have been the challenges or barriers to doing this work?

413
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:31,653
Personal challenges. Challenges to your organization?

414
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:44,703
Challenges to the communities involved. And let's see, Angie went first last time on Zachary.

415
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:49,023
How do you feel about starting off? Okay. Which one do you want me to tackle first?

416
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:53,463
All three of you want to start?

417
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:57,333
Okay. All righty. And. Okay, so I'm gonna start with the last one.

418
00:45:57,453 --> 00:46:01,022
First, the community. And this is something that.

419
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:04,193
That, you know, that I've learned over time, of course, your Angie.

420
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:13,863
And maybe you can also speak to it. But, you know, even though we may be ready for the community to do our participating in a research project,

421
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:18,963
the community may not be ready to participate in a research project.

422
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:27,003
So one of those challenges that we sometimes run into is the community readiness for a research project.

423
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:39,123
Right. Because for me, if most times a for most time a research project is something that sometimes is

424
00:46:39,123 --> 00:46:42,783
something that the community is not necessarily dealing with at the moment.

425
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:51,153
And so trying to get them to sort of shift gears are are be willing to.

426
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:59,602
Commit to the project is a challenge because sometimes you're dealing with sort of the day to day struggle of trying to survive.

427
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:04,453
And here we are talking about the you know, I mean, maybe cancer research,

428
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:10,223
maybe some of these other projects that we working on that they really don't have the bandwidth to sort of deal with.

429
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:15,953
And so there's this mismatch sometimes, right?

430
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:25,793
The smart the smart project is able to try to connect with what's going on in the community with the research project,

431
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:32,903
where we're getting a lot better at that. But you know, there have been times where, you know, the research project was something that the community,

432
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:36,803
you know, they knew was an issue but really didn't have the bandwidth. So to deal with.

433
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:45,413
And those guys, those those challenges, those times are really challenging because you really have to put in a lot more time,

434
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:50,573
a lot more effort, a lot more resources to to move that project forward.

435
00:47:51,023 --> 00:47:55,433
All right. So in terms of organizational challenge, now, one,

436
00:47:55,623 --> 00:48:00,362
one of the things I forgot to mention early on is that in the past that is a small organization

437
00:48:00,363 --> 00:48:06,152
compared to Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation and a University of Michigan.

438
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:16,683
Right. So we're way smaller. And so we run into capacity issues, whether or not we have the capacity to do one more project.

439
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:20,403
Right. Whether we have the bandwidth.

440
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:26,243
So so those are real constraints that, you know, we we have to deal with.

441
00:48:26,543 --> 00:48:31,013
And then also, you know, I talked about the community readiness to do a research project.

442
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:36,293
Also how to deal with whether or not the organization is ready for another project.

443
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:40,763
Are you know, are my staff and board willing to sort of do this right.

444
00:48:41,723 --> 00:48:45,533
And then and then do I have the energy to oversee the project?

445
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:51,653
Because at the end of the day, you know, even though I may sign a project to another staff person, it's still going to come across my desk.

446
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:55,763
So, you know, and then the third challenge and the third,

447
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:05,212
third challenge and I think I got a lot better but personally is still with the capacity issue because so many that seem like,

448
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:11,333
you know, any email we get from the university is like three pages long, you know?

449
00:49:12,293 --> 00:49:18,022
And so just being able to find the time to to read through because it would be really detailed,

450
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:22,853
very thorough is just, you know, it just yeah, takes some time getting there.

451
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:26,992
And then also I just had to give them my own personal bias with research.

452
00:49:26,993 --> 00:49:30,322
I think I did that. And so I'm happy to report that, you know,

453
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:38,152
I'm no longer biased towards research because at the very beginning I thought research was, you know, I thought was a waste of time.

454
00:49:38,153 --> 00:49:44,722
I just thought focuses the reports and it goes on to show, you know, but that again,

455
00:49:44,723 --> 00:49:52,673
it had a lot to do with my experience with research and understanding that research could be a valuable tool for communities,

456
00:49:52,913 --> 00:50:01,523
but also not just a valuable tool, but also a valuable funding mechanism for the organization, for the community.

457
00:50:02,153 --> 00:50:08,123
So, yeah, so let me let me pause and maybe pivot in and off to Wilma or to Angie.

458
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:21,443
Well, what would you like to go next? Okay. I'll talk about the challenges in conducting CV VR.

459
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:25,763
Well, one I was working the challenge was to be able to get to the meetings.

460
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:29,423
So they always, always, usually had a meeting once a month.

461
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:39,683
And if we were in the throes of writing something, then you had to take the time to read what the University of Michigan wrote.

462
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:46,133
One reason why we read most of their reports, or when they were writing a grant,

463
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:52,543
was that sometimes they wanted to do certain studies added on to the study.

464
00:50:52,553 --> 00:51:04,833
You know how researches are they? They get a group of people and then while we just research everything and so then the, the, the, the,

465
00:51:05,053 --> 00:51:11,303
the things that the questionnaires that they develop, they become longer and longer and longer.

466
00:51:11,963 --> 00:51:23,393
Well, you know, people got things to do in their house and they don't have two or 3 hours to entertain somebody who's asking all these questions.

467
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:29,003
So, you know, we had to review that kind of stuff and say, well, that's too long.

468
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:34,093
Well, what is this got to do with the research we're doing? Or Why are you asking these questions?

469
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:41,663
Stuff like that. And that that would be a challenge for us, really.

470
00:51:42,573 --> 00:51:51,783
A challenge to the organization also was you being you're being gone way when you traveled with the University of Michigan.

471
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:58,293
But I only had to do that for a couple of years. Once I retired, the my time was my own time.

472
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:05,373
So I did a lot, lot of stuff just on my own to help you around conducting research.

473
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:16,863
The organization sometimes didn't understand why you were involved with certain areas and stuff like that, although it was benefiting them.

474
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:20,972
But they didn't. They didn't. They weren't used to research.

475
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:30,753
I remember the deputy director of the Detroit Health Department, he got a research thing in the mail and she said, Oh, this thing will get funded.

476
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:38,852
They should do it in a wastebasket. And of course, a couple of weeks later, it did get funded and Judy was upset.

477
00:52:38,853 --> 00:52:44,943
But that's what happened. It got funded because we wrote a good grant.

478
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:51,423
So a lot of people that's working with you don't understand what you're going through.

479
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:55,203
That's why you need to take time and educate people.

480
00:52:55,363 --> 00:53:04,713
You need to educate them in their language. Sometimes researchers have a tendency to talk that masters and language do.

481
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:12,182
People don't know what you're talking about, so you have to bring it down to a level where they can understand exactly what are you doing?

482
00:53:12,183 --> 00:53:22,322
Why are you doing this? What this just show what the end result may or may not be that some of that is the challenge.

483
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:30,633
And I know the other thing, too, is when you go to do a presentation,

484
00:53:30,633 --> 00:53:38,552
they always took a community member and I went to a one thing I think it was a public

485
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:43,233
health convention and this group had not brought in not one community member.

486
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:46,953
They were all up there talking about what they were doing as far as services.

487
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:52,653
I went up to the doctor and asked him, Well, why don't you have a community member?

488
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:59,103
He said, Well, they don't want to send what we doing? Well, you know, you can't take you can't put community members down like that.

489
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:06,062
My other thing is you saying that they don't have the wherewithal to even tell

490
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:11,363
you how they feel about the research or what do they think about the research.

491
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:21,783
And that's about all they do. If you if you tell it to them and they're like, Oh, let me see that, that's it.

492
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:27,573
But and yeah, I'd just say ditto.

493
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:37,563
Oh, a lot of what both said I would call saying to time.

494
00:54:37,623 --> 00:54:46,032
Time is really a challenge as folks had said it's it's not just for one steering committee or one research project.

495
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:51,272
And a lot of times there are multiple subcommittees and work groups that are

496
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:55,863
involved in presentations and publications and spinoff projects from that.

497
00:54:56,763 --> 00:55:05,853
And when you've had more experience doing this stuff, you tend to be asked more often to be involved in the next one.

498
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:10,953
So so it does take quite a bit of time, time commitments,

499
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:18,483
some there are some weeks that are just U.S. weeks because that's where most of my time is for that week.

500
00:55:20,403 --> 00:55:28,623
So and then it's also again, that opportunity costs because while you're doing that work,

501
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:34,383
especially if you're running an organization, it's taking time away from time.

502
00:55:34,383 --> 00:55:49,102
I need to be. Dealing with an issue or fund or issue or budgeting all of those kind of things that come with running an organization that's different

503
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:58,133
for somebody who's running a nonprofit or a community based organization than somebody who's a researcher or in an academic institution.

504
00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:03,023
We have different types of responsibilities. So trying to balance all of those things.

505
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:09,302
In a challenge for the organization is that a lot of times some of the research

506
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:15,963
projects are not always aligned with the core mission of the organization either.

507
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,473
So you may be spending time on something that is kind of peripheral,

508
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:24,543
and none of your other staff are really focused on those kind of things because it's not something you're working on.

509
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:29,343
And then trying to translate that information to your staff.

510
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:37,473
Because if you're the only one attending the meetings, you know, then you start talking alphabet soup with CPR and UAC and café.

511
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:46,112
People are wondering, what the heck are you talking about? And having the time to to bring your staff up to speed can be challenging as well too,

512
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:49,323
if they don't know and haven't been president some of those meetings.

513
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:57,513
So one of the challenges is trying to, as we look across across the board at kind of succession planning is how do we bring other

514
00:56:57,513 --> 00:57:05,523
staff up to speed and have an understanding of what's going on and even what CPR is,

515
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:15,063
so that they also have an opportunity to incorporate some of the some of the research approaches and partnerships into the work that they're doing.

516
00:57:16,053 --> 00:57:26,913
And then for the community, I think folks have kind of mentioned this, too, is that I mean, he doesn't always know or care about some of the research.

517
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:32,873
Right. And particularly because a lot of times it can take years before you can actually get the research,

518
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:36,603
the results that can be used in any particular way.

519
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:43,443
So and then there's also research fatigue both for the staff and for the community.

520
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:48,002
And when when there's a lot of different institutions coming in trying to do research.

521
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:56,393
This isn't the only place where we where research comes from the U.S. There's multiple institutions.

522
00:57:56,703 --> 00:58:01,713
Everybody wants to do research now in bipoc communities around a whole lot of different things.

523
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:05,013
And they all want access to your population.

524
00:58:06,603 --> 00:58:14,013
And so we're trying to recruit people to participate in various research projects, and it can be exhausting for some people.

525
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:20,372
And then there's the because because we do pay people for their time and the research.

526
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:25,073
And also it becomes an expectation that anything you're going to ask people to participate in,

527
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,203
you're going to have money to pay them to do that, which isn't always the case.

528
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:35,642
Right. And the other thing, too, is that when you have a bad actor, not that there has been in the U.S.,

529
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:41,973
but researchers in general or there's been a bad actor and you're the one who brings them into the community.

530
00:58:42,243 --> 00:58:48,183
It's your name and reputation that's on the line, not the academic, individual or the institution.

531
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:53,733
It's your organization's that then people look to that there's been a break in trust.

532
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:59,613
So which is another reason why we're really particular about who we are, who we work with,

533
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:08,373
and any kind of research because we get asked every all of us get asked a lot, participate in various research projects.

534
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:15,753
So it can be pretty challenging sometimes. You know, if I can if I can jump back in for a second.

535
00:59:15,993 --> 00:59:21,093
Mary Beth. Yeah. And the, the, the other channels are going to say is.

536
00:59:24,463 --> 00:59:29,423
Sometimes the research design is problematic for the community, you know,

537
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:36,463
because the community don't really think about, you know, recruitment period, intervention kind of thing.

538
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:41,533
And so, you know, I know a lot of times when we're recruiting folks for research projects.

539
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:49,133
You know, folks don't want to vote, don't want to participate into after we started the recruitment because they

540
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:52,673
started to see things happening and that's when they want to want to join.

541
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:57,563
I remember when we did the walking group, we were we spent a lot of time trying to group folks,

542
00:59:57,713 --> 01:00:01,583
walk walking group, but folks really wasn't that interested.

543
01:00:02,243 --> 01:00:06,403
But the moment they saw people walking the neighborhood, they wanted to join.

544
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:08,863
Right? So but that's the point lesson.

545
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:15,743
So if I do another walking group, I would probably have people just get out and walk first and then do recruit people because folks need to see me.

546
01:00:16,883 --> 01:00:24,593
The other thing the other thing that that's sometimes hard to explain to the community is that if the research project is this, this, this.

547
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:33,203
Why? Is it over? So let me let me let me repeat that.

548
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:38,663
If the research project is a success because it had positive outcomes.

549
01:00:38,873 --> 01:00:48,323
Right. That showed improvement in health in all these kinds of things, then why doesn't the project or the program continue?

550
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:54,363
And that's kind of a hard. Thing to explain, right?

551
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:59,563
It's about money. But it's a sense.

552
01:00:59,563 --> 01:01:02,833
But if the president just says, you know what?

553
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:07,003
Why can't you find the money if it's a success? So you get what? You find the money.

554
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:12,933
Yeah. Like what they want to do. Because I think that's the problem with sustainability.

555
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:17,893
The federal government, they see that as successful, but they don't want to give you another penny.

556
01:01:18,363 --> 01:01:27,303
So, yeah, the things that Zachary was describing actually are the opposite of how community based programs usually operate.

557
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:34,573
Right? You start recruiting and then word of mouth brings more people in and somebody who really likes the program brings somebody else in.

558
01:01:34,573 --> 01:01:37,993
And that's usually how we do a lot of our program recruiting.

559
01:01:38,593 --> 01:01:44,593
But that's not how it works in research, right? You have to be in there at the beginning or not at all.

560
01:01:44,593 --> 01:01:51,222
And then, you know, you have to stagger design and you can't be with somebody else that you may want to be with.

561
01:01:51,223 --> 01:01:54,613
So, you know, or whatever, control group, all those kind of things.

562
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:59,232
And then, you know, we usually try to we're not always successful.

563
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:05,323
We try to get continued funding in in regular programs to continue them if they're successful.

564
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:07,983
Whereas in research, that's not always the case.

565
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:14,803
So then again, because it's those community based organizations who's the frontline face out in the community,

566
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:22,062
people assume that it's it's, you know, it's a result of something that our organization is or is not doing, not understanding.

567
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:30,463
Its the basic to the research design and how research works so that it is sometimes really difficult to explain to folks.

568
01:02:31,613 --> 01:02:39,323
The other thing I would like to say is about the challenge of using residents who live in the community.

569
01:02:39,773 --> 01:02:47,842
Now, when we first started our way back when we first started of U of M wanted to use students because,

570
01:02:47,843 --> 01:02:53,332
you know, students can make money by doing all of this research and whatever.

571
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:57,113
And we said to them, well, they don't know anything about Detroit.

572
01:02:57,803 --> 01:03:03,863
I mean, you know, they don't live in Detroit. I don't know where they live at, but we think you ought to hire Detroiters.

573
01:03:05,003 --> 01:03:11,062
Okay. So they went along with that. They said, okay, so we hired people to go out.

574
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:17,573
They were trained in how to do the research and how to ask questions and that kind of stuff.

575
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:18,383
A big train.

576
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:30,253
And then one day, Robert McGranahan calls me and he says, We just found out that two of these people who we hired, they're not doing that.

577
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:37,623
They're not doing the interviews. They're just writing them down and saying that they are that they interviewed.

578
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:46,613
And he said, Well, what would you do? I said, Fire them. I said, We don't keep all people that don't do no work.

579
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:52,513
You know, we don't want you to pay them, get rid of them, and we'll get some more community members.

580
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:59,502
So, you know, it's really hard to run a research project 45 minutes away from the city of

581
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:06,043
Detroit because they're not here every day to supervise some of the people.

582
01:04:06,053 --> 01:04:12,523
So, you know, we have to pray a lot. But people that are not doing their job if they weren't interested in doing it in the first place.

583
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:17,443
So they don't need to be with us. You know, they need to be somewhere else where they're interested in doing that job.

584
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:26,523
Okay. All right. Return it to the class now.

585
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:30,663
Do you have any questions for these three?

586
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:35,343
Well, their answers about their work. What?

587
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:42,923
Yeah. So Wilma, you mentioned some the bridging the disparities in knowledge between the

588
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:47,033
community members and the researcher and bringing everyone up to the same page.

589
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:50,423
What would you think are the best practices for doing that?

590
01:04:50,423 --> 01:04:54,323
As someone who had to do it and was a little apprehensive about the staff.

591
01:04:55,713 --> 01:05:01,713
Who's apprehensive? The community member, the research, the community members.

592
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:08,743
Well, not bad. Good, good. Kate. It tastes real well.

593
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:14,322
See that you got. You got you got a game you trust.

594
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:18,823
So you just talk to them.

595
01:05:18,823 --> 01:05:25,303
Because if you're in the community and you're talking to people, then they'll get used to who you are.

596
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:34,363
A lot of times that's what happens. But you have to be in there with them and you got to find when you're looking at CBOs and stuff like that,

597
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:41,023
I think sometimes you have to find somebody with a positive attitude, you know, because a lot of these people,

598
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:48,253
I don't care what you said anything or do anything anyway, but just like you develop your regular friendships,

599
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:53,293
you do stuff for them, you know, go somewhere, maybe take them out to lunch or something like that.

600
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:58,393
Oh, that's that's very helpful. People like to be be seen.

601
01:06:00,663 --> 01:06:03,723
They like to be you know, they like to be coddled. Coddled.

602
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:07,283
But go on. Excuse me.

603
01:06:07,293 --> 01:06:19,153
You know something? I got to think about what words I need to say. If y'all know it, I'm gonna be 80 on my birthday, January 14th.

604
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:26,613
You know, if I could add to I was going to mention that we often talk about learning.

605
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:31,682
So it's not just the community trying to learn. It's also academic.

606
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:37,083
And research is learning so that we we know that there is expertise on both sides.

607
01:06:37,983 --> 01:06:45,833
So, you know, we have been not at the very beginning, but some years ago we developed CPR one on one course.

608
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:51,363
Well, we have some we had been doing them for quite a while for researchers and research partnerships,

609
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:58,453
but then we developed one specifically for community based organizations and residents so that they had an understanding, too,

610
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:07,203
of what CPR was, but also what their rights were during a research and what kind of questions to ask and why would you want

611
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:13,083
to do research and when to say when to say yes and what questions to consider and when you can say no.

612
01:07:14,193 --> 01:07:21,723
So that was something that we had developed over time through all of our experience of seeing what some of our fellow,

613
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:24,993
what our peers in the community felt that they needed.

614
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:34,722
But then there's also, again, things for the other side, too, because there's things that people who live in a community,

615
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:40,863
that live and work in the community every day know about the community that academics have,

616
01:07:40,863 --> 01:07:46,353
would have no clue, especially when you're 45 minutes away, is what was said to so.

617
01:07:47,253 --> 01:07:55,623
And also things there's certain things that we have to deal with, like managing H.R. and things like that.

618
01:07:55,623 --> 01:08:02,692
That, that. You don't you don't necessarily have to do when you're in an academic setting.

619
01:08:02,693 --> 01:08:06,173
So like, should you fire somebody?

620
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:16,233
So things that you know that that peop that people draw on their experience from being in the community and people have of

621
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:25,043
a you know shouldn't assume that people like me don't have any knowledge about research because that's also a stereotype.

622
01:08:25,073 --> 01:08:34,553
I remember for one grant that we had written, I had written a letter of support that was required for the grant.

623
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:42,343
And one of the reviewers response was, this doesn't sound like language that a community member would use.

624
01:08:42,353 --> 01:08:42,863
And I said, Well,

625
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:50,152
should I have used broken English and slang and not really sure what they considered appropriate language that a community member would use?

626
01:08:50,153 --> 01:08:56,843
Because just because I'm from Detroit and I've lived here my whole life doesn't mean that

627
01:08:56,843 --> 01:09:00,833
I don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] I'm talking about or that I don't have an education.

628
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:06,983
So there's a lot of assumptions and prejudice that comes along with that too.

629
01:09:07,403 --> 01:09:11,903
So, you know, cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity, whichever term you want to use,

630
01:09:11,903 --> 01:09:17,423
that's also a really critical piece that we work through all the time.

631
01:09:17,423 --> 01:09:22,972
So some of those things we learn through experience and kind of talking things through.

632
01:09:22,973 --> 01:09:26,903
So the learning process takes place through that through.

633
01:09:27,323 --> 01:09:33,863
So the process of working together and and being really honest with each other and sharing information,

634
01:09:33,863 --> 01:09:39,892
sometimes it's, you know, getting a call offline saying, you know, what do you think about this?

635
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:43,623
How would you handle this? What's going on with this? So, you know,

636
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:52,162
some of it is very informal that way and some of it is more formal in in actually doing workshops and things to

637
01:09:52,163 --> 01:09:58,643
make sure that that we're intentionally looking at how do we how do we educate each other about various things?

638
01:10:01,003 --> 01:10:04,453
Thank you. Is there another question I have? What I want?

639
01:10:04,753 --> 01:10:15,283
Yes. Hi. This is the way I am interested in learning a little bit about how you balance the idea of capacity development and respecting of time.

640
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:21,493
I like the idea of how a lot of the involvement of the part of the communities.

641
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:27,732
They get to do a lot of employability, skill building. Like learning how to do interviews and that kind of thing.

642
01:10:27,733 --> 01:10:34,933
Right. But I wonder, how do you balance that with like, well, I don't really want to learn how to write.

643
01:10:35,993 --> 01:10:43,343
Yeah, I just am curious about that. Can you see that last sentence?

644
01:10:44,503 --> 01:10:49,643
Yeah, I haven't. But this is something you made.

645
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:54,203
Yeah, I guess I'm just wondering about the employability a lot of the time.

646
01:10:54,313 --> 01:11:07,613
I like the process of encouraging other people to be involved in the process of interviewing, but maybe someone doesn't have enough time to.

647
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:15,463
To learn those skills or if they're doing photo voice, maybe they don't want to do the analysis of the data or something.

648
01:11:15,473 --> 01:11:17,693
Right. So how do you find the balance?

649
01:11:17,693 --> 01:11:23,453
I guess, and maybe the other part of it would be like encouraging people to change their perspective on research.

650
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:27,083
I like the idea of encouraging people to be a part of research.

651
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:38,482
So also I'm going to take a stab at this and I'm going to hopefully Angie in Wilmer with Save

652
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:50,303
Me so so I think when we when we when I when friends of Cyprus research a research project,

653
01:11:50,513 --> 01:11:54,172
we're looking at it from a multiple perspective.

654
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:59,303
Right. One is, you know, is this a you know well, you know me.

655
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:03,743
Can you know, can you help the community? Right. Or can it help the organization?

656
01:12:03,743 --> 01:12:13,883
Right. But then it's like, well, hey, is this is this going to be a job opportunity for residents to actually participate on the research team?

657
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:19,822
Right. If so, then what does that look like and what kind of skills, experience and whatnot?

658
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:26,413
What does that sort of look like? Right. So that so that's one thing I'm looking at to it.

659
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:30,143
And we talk about sort of like knowledge generation kinds of things.

660
01:12:30,773 --> 01:12:35,993
What kind of involvement will it required on behalf of the organization?

661
01:12:36,563 --> 01:12:43,643
Right. So do I have the staff time? You know, are there staff available to participate in this project?

662
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:48,113
Right. The three three.

663
01:12:49,193 --> 01:12:52,613
What does this research project require of us?

664
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:55,673
Right. Are we going to be helping with recruitment? I know.

665
01:12:55,823 --> 01:13:02,873
You know, and so for me, I'm just looking at this research project from from different lenses, trying to understand what's the requirement?

666
01:13:03,563 --> 01:13:07,313
Do we have the capacity? We we do not have the capacity internally.

667
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:14,873
Are we able to develop that capacity either through training, coaching or something else or.

668
01:13:16,093 --> 01:13:21,613
Or can we get money from the research project to go out and buy that capacity by, you know,

669
01:13:21,853 --> 01:13:29,473
hire a new staff person that will that that will bring that capacity to us, that will allow us to participate in that project.

670
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,302
So for me, it's, you know, for me,

671
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:38,623
I look at a research project from a lot of different perspectives and definitely I look at it through that capacity,

672
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:44,143
building capacity in organizational building layers, right kind of thing.

673
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:50,022
And also, I'd be wondering like, hey, is this something that we're going to want to do again in the future for ourselves?

674
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:55,713
Right. And says yes. Then if the answer is yes, then I may spend more time.

675
01:13:56,593 --> 01:14:00,733
Like, for example, the walking group, right? Well, hey, is this.

676
01:14:00,913 --> 01:14:04,573
Do we want to continue this working group after the project is right?

677
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:10,123
If the answer is yes, then I'm going to approach it differently because I want to be able to sustain it.

678
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:15,402
Right. But if it's something like, you know, we're going to research cancer kind of thing,

679
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:18,313
well, no, that's not something that we want to continue as an organization.

680
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:24,043
So I may be less interested in hiring staff are developing that kind of capacity.

681
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:30,973
So it depends on a project, actually. But I do think through those kinds of issues in my head.

682
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:35,383
So I'm going to stop talking and hand it off to Angie into a tumor.

683
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:42,813
Yes. Thank you, Zack. I was going to say, you know, in terms of the people who are developing the skills to do the survey,

684
01:14:43,573 --> 01:14:47,803
those are people that we hire that the project hires specifically.

685
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:53,203
So they're not necessarily I'm not the one who's learning to do the survey skills going out and doing that.

686
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:57,973
We we're just making sure instead of hiring people from the University of Students,

687
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:05,233
we're hiring people who are residents in our communities who are culturally competent, who know the community and can develop those skills.

688
01:15:06,073 --> 01:15:11,063
And then it's more sustainable because many of those people that then get trained are,

689
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:17,203
when their project ends, are able to go to another project or some or a similar employment.

690
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:23,442
So they've developed a lot of skills that are sustainable for themselves as well as the community,

691
01:15:23,443 --> 01:15:28,153
and they've developed careers and in some cases doing that kind of work.

692
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:30,402
So it again, it's a hiring process.

693
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:37,243
So it's only people who are interested, who are developing those skill sets and then are being paid to do that work.

694
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:46,813
And then a lot of the work that we're doing as part of the projects is really our level of involvement is really up to us.

695
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:54,763
Right. So if I don't have time to be part of a work group that's working on a specific thing, I don't volunteer for that.

696
01:15:54,763 --> 01:16:00,943
If I don't have time to review proposals, whatever, you know, you don't volunteer for those things,

697
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:05,113
although it's hard to say no sometimes to Barbara and other folks.

698
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:11,562
But and like data analysis, we don't do the data analysis.

699
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:16,393
We have statisticians that do that. We are all involved in the data interpretation.

700
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:23,863
So what is that? What are those numbers really mean after the data is provided to us and that the

701
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:26,923
numbers have been crunched and analyzed and cleaned and gone through all of that,

702
01:16:27,163 --> 01:16:32,113
then what does it really mean in terms of the work and in the context of our various communities?

703
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:39,162
So that's a very different thing and it's one of the core principles of CPR is that we are involved in

704
01:16:39,163 --> 01:16:46,633
looking at how to interpret that data and apply it to our communities and interventions and policy change.

705
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:54,643
I think what your last part of your question was. In terms of time,

706
01:16:54,883 --> 01:17:03,073
I forgot what time it was about encouraging other people to be involved in changing the perspective on research within the community.

707
01:17:03,163 --> 01:17:08,563
And a lot of people were like, I don't want to be a researcher, why would I do that? But I think that really cool employability skills and stuff.

708
01:17:08,593 --> 01:17:17,562
So I guess I find that, yeah. So I again, I think through a number of different mechanisms that we've used, again the CV,

709
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:24,913
PR one for community organizations and residents, more and more people are expressing an interest in being involved in research.

710
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:35,652
We also have our connect networking where we're able to pair community and researchers for many community organizations.

711
01:17:35,653 --> 01:17:43,213
They may not call it research, it may be program evaluation, which many of us are required to do as part of our programs,

712
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:48,312
and being able to pair somebody who has that expertise on the academic side

713
01:17:48,313 --> 01:17:52,663
with the community organization that needs that kind of program evaluation.

714
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:56,983
And then in some cases, it's a community that initiates the need for the research.

715
01:17:57,613 --> 01:18:06,133
So there's a particular issue that they're very interested in and need to research in order to be able to take action on it.

716
01:18:06,133 --> 01:18:11,383
So we'll look for a researcher that can assist with that kind of technical skills.

717
01:18:12,103 --> 01:18:15,193
So there's various levels where people may be interested in.

718
01:18:15,703 --> 01:18:24,003
So again, there are some people who may have no interest in research whatsoever at a community level and may become, you know.

719
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:28,023
I was actually another way that people become interested.

720
01:18:28,023 --> 01:18:35,473
It is through our dissemination process because we make sure that the information gets back out to the communities.

721
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:40,593
So talking about things that are really salient to people, for instance,

722
01:18:40,743 --> 01:18:47,193
the whole issue around air quality, we take residents on what we call toxic tours,

723
01:18:47,193 --> 01:18:53,913
where they are able to see in the same community that they are driving in and living in day by day, every day.

724
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:58,803
But taking them around and talking to them about, hey, this is a source of pollution.

725
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:02,733
This is the impact it has on your or your children's health.

726
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:07,323
Here are some things that we can do to try to mitigate it. Here are some policy solutions.

727
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:12,783
Here are people we need to be talking to. People become very, very interested in the research through that process,

728
01:19:12,903 --> 01:19:17,643
through their lived experience, and finding out how it's impacting them in their day to day lives,

729
01:19:17,913 --> 01:19:23,163
which is again one of the benefits of CPR as opposed to regular research,

730
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:28,733
because in CPR we are always doing some sort of intervention or policy change.

731
01:19:28,743 --> 01:19:32,303
It's never research or rarely research just for research sake.

732
01:19:32,913 --> 01:19:40,053
So it is definitely one of those benefits of doing CPR that people are able to apply it to their everyday lives.

733
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:53,323
Okay, Sarah. Thank you. I just wanted to ask quickly if you could talk further about when you run into issues of sustainability around programing.

734
01:19:53,683 --> 01:20:00,643
I know in my community we have a nickname for researchers who just come in and take things and then don't give anything back mosquito researchers.

735
01:20:01,003 --> 01:20:07,902
So when you do run into those issues where the funding does run out and you have nothing to continue the programing,

736
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:11,503
how do you reaffirm to the community that you're still committed to working with

737
01:20:11,503 --> 01:20:14,533
them in addressing their health needs and protecting that trust they've given them?

738
01:20:15,403 --> 01:20:21,753
It's interesting. We call them drive by researchers, mosquito researchers as well.

739
01:20:26,143 --> 01:20:32,383
That's that's another thing that's part of the CBP is that commitment to continuing,

740
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:36,462
even if the money has run out, but trying to figure out how you maintain those relationships.

741
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:40,783
And what I think we're constantly always looking for ways to sustain the work.

742
01:20:42,073 --> 01:20:49,482
Sometimes you can't because the funding runs out. But but I think that's one of the commitments that we've had for many of our

743
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:53,953
partners is to try to continue to work on finding other ways of funding it.

744
01:20:56,973 --> 01:21:06,113
Yeah. Sometimes sustainability is hard to do because you don't get any additional money so that you can't keep doing what you were doing,

745
01:21:06,123 --> 01:21:12,693
you know, because people have to be paid more to run programs. And if you don't have the money to do the program, you know,

746
01:21:12,983 --> 01:21:16,803
the only thing you can reassure the communities that you still committed to the community,

747
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:22,983
that that's the best thing to do, is to make sure that they know that you committed to them.

748
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:32,423
Because sometimes what I use when I go to Apache, every time I would talk, I would talk about sustainability.

749
01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:36,902
You know, people want us to do all these projects.

750
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:40,413
And once we find out it's a good success and people are enjoying them,

751
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:46,023
then they pull our money and then want to give it to somebody else for another different project.

752
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:54,213
And so a lot of good projects that that has some sustainability got lost in the in the crowd.

753
01:21:55,063 --> 01:22:03,213
And and it depends on the legislature and the president that you have, because sometimes the presidents don't want to do any research,

754
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:11,052
you know, like environmental, you know, C, triple H, we had money in about 6 to 7 years because there was a president.

755
01:22:11,053 --> 01:22:16,873
But anyway, no, you know, he's not interested in environment.

756
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:20,203
He wasn't interested in was the next president anymore.

757
01:22:20,953 --> 01:22:25,353
But we just have to we have to do the best we can.

758
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:33,313
A role with the community, not the community trusts you. Then they trust what you're telling them, you know, which is really tell them the truth.

759
01:22:33,763 --> 01:22:41,203
Those things that you can maintain and sustain or balance and keep in the community.

760
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:44,203
You try to do that because I did a lot of work, just volunteer.

761
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:51,732
I didn't ask them to pay me for anything. They were nice to me though, but a lot of a lot of times I just volunteer.

762
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:58,753
So maybe you find some nice volunteers in the community who would lead the walking group or lead something else.

763
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:05,472
You know, that would be helpful because a lot of times they do not want to stay and they want you to

764
01:23:05,473 --> 01:23:10,783
take it into your organization and sustain it with the money that you have for other things.

765
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:15,853
The money wasn't given to you to do that. The money was given to you to do something else.

766
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:21,693
And so that doesn't work. That doesn't work. You just don't have the funding, you know?

767
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:25,623
So if I can if I can jump in. Yeah. On that.

768
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:33,912
Oh, okay. Well, first of all, I believe that some projects and programs should not be sustained.

769
01:23:33,913 --> 01:23:42,103
I think they should die with death now, but not all, but all project that should be sustained.

770
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:44,983
I think it's important to look at sustainability in a couple of ways.

771
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:51,642
One is, you know, is it possible to sustain the findings of that particular project?

772
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:58,483
Right, or can you sustain the partnership and the relationships of that particular project?

773
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:10,633
And then the other and then the the the third one is can you sustain the tools or resources that was generated so and so for the most part,

774
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:12,042
when we think about sustainability,

775
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:18,313
we look at it as one one dimensional in terms of one that we would have the funding to continue the program intact as is right.

776
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:25,543
But also, if you get creative and look at know, what is it about this project that's worth sustaining,

777
01:24:26,263 --> 01:24:30,733
then we're asking a different question that may make sustainability.

778
01:24:31,973 --> 01:24:41,803
Possible. And then also don't feel like just because the project was successful or not successful, it has to be sustained because maybe not so.

779
01:24:43,023 --> 01:24:46,172
Thank you. Thank you. So we have a we have one more.

780
01:24:46,173 --> 01:24:49,543
I may take one more question. You can give short answers.

781
01:24:49,563 --> 01:24:54,683
We're going to go on to a break after this. Yes, right at the bat and.

782
01:24:55,703 --> 01:24:57,623
So this question is for Wilma.

783
01:24:57,923 --> 01:25:07,843
You mentioned that the Health Detroit Health Department had some resistance to research or participating in research, I guess.

784
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:18,173
And I was wondering if you could perhaps expand on that a bit more, why that's the case, especially as somebody who's working in health policy.

785
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:25,343
I think it's a little disheartening to hear that. But I also what curious if you have seen changes in the Detroit Health Department

786
01:25:25,343 --> 01:25:31,283
and their willingness to engage in CPR and other kinds of research over time.

787
01:25:32,983 --> 01:25:36,503
So the health department has to maintain their.

788
01:25:39,353 --> 01:25:45,953
Well, I want to say there's been a little they are looked up to as the expert on what's going on in health.

789
01:25:45,983 --> 01:25:51,823
You know, they're the ones you go to when you need vaccinations, the ones you go to if you need some other stuff.

790
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:58,193
And I remember before Vibranium came from one of the other universities had

791
01:25:58,193 --> 01:26:02,343
did this research project and their conclusion was that Detroit was a mess.

792
01:26:03,683 --> 01:26:09,502
They did that. They wrote that the paper did not share it with anybody in the Detroit Health Department.

793
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:19,523
In the health department looked like a fool. That's the reason why we insisted that before they publish anything,

794
01:26:19,913 --> 01:26:26,333
they shared it with us so that we could see what the out the end result was going to be.

795
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:33,113
We have to keep our reputation. I mean, we've been around since, what, the twenties or whatever.

796
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,953
And we have to continue our reputation.

797
01:26:36,953 --> 01:26:43,583
And we can't be going down with people who don't have a good feeling for the city of Detroit.

798
01:26:45,023 --> 01:26:54,143
So politically, it's not good for us, for people to be writing negative things about the health department and about the city of Detroit, period.

799
01:26:55,643 --> 01:27:02,693
So that's the reason why, you know, you have so many people and then a lot of the people that work there, they didn't.

800
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:12,113
They didn't have a chance to do any basic background with research, you know.

801
01:27:12,263 --> 01:27:19,043
Most of my I'm a nurse myself. So I came to nursing school, but we didn't do any research while I was there.

802
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:28,313
It's different now, but it wasn't then, so that I think that just adds to their not trusting.

803
01:27:28,613 --> 01:27:33,203
And then the thing of it is, is that you're so busy and hear these people coming up.

804
01:27:33,203 --> 01:27:36,073
He asks you all these questions and they want to do this. They want to do.

805
01:27:36,113 --> 01:27:44,483
And you see me like like I used to go in on Saturdays and Sundays, just get my work done because every day was put out on Friday.

806
01:27:45,533 --> 01:27:51,052
So Saturdays were nobody day and Sunday they allowed to get my work done, but that's the only way I could do it.

807
01:27:51,053 --> 01:27:57,173
So, you know, you're under a lot of stress, but I just think the knowledge people just need to have the knowledge.

808
01:27:57,173 --> 01:28:02,033
They need to understand what research is about. I need to understand.

809
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:08,333
Thank you. Thank you, Wilma. It is 403.

810
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:12,863
We're going to take a ten minute break and then we'll come back.

811
01:28:14,303 --> 01:28:17,483
Thank you, panel. We will see you in a few moments.

812
01:28:17,663 --> 01:28:21,023
Okay. Come to turn off your cameras or leave on you.

813
01:28:21,683 --> 01:28:23,459
Look at it. Go. Okay. Thanks to all of you.

814
01:28:26,132 --> 01:28:30,602
So let's wait one more minute for Angie.

815
01:28:31,812 --> 01:28:36,152
And then we'll get back started. I'm here.

816
01:28:36,162 --> 01:28:39,282
I was just doing emails while I was away. Sorry.

817
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:50,772
Yeah. So before I turn it back over to Mary Beth with questions about continued questions, I actually had a question following the conversation.

818
01:28:50,922 --> 01:28:54,102
And you are just been having and again, thank you so much.

819
01:28:55,452 --> 01:29:00,421
And, you know, and you've made several statements about, you know,

820
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:07,001
when you get requests for doing research all the time and having to weigh pluses and minuses and so forth and so on.

821
01:29:07,002 --> 01:29:11,202
And, you know, I've heard you speak to some of these points before and just wanted you to share,

822
01:29:11,502 --> 01:29:17,052
you know, how do you sort of make the decision of of when do you say yes, when do you say no?

823
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,082
And sort of what does that look like?

824
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:25,842
Because a lot of the students in the room are going to be researchers and might be in a situation to approach a CBO.

825
01:29:26,412 --> 01:29:30,971
Right. So I think there's there's a number of factors that I take into account.

826
01:29:30,972 --> 01:29:36,422
And I think the very first one is first. What's their approach?

827
01:29:36,842 --> 01:29:39,872
So many times I ask them specifically about it.

828
01:29:39,872 --> 01:29:43,022
They're familiar with doing community based participatory research.

829
01:29:43,652 --> 01:29:50,552
And if not, I send them to to the UIC website and ask them to read the.

830
01:29:52,412 --> 01:30:00,281
All of our principals there. And if they're in agreement with doing research in that manner, then they can come back to me.

831
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:05,542
And if not. Forget it. I don't say it exactly like that.

832
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:12,772
More or less. And a lot of times people don't get back to me, but if they do.

833
01:30:13,462 --> 01:30:22,222
So there's a couple of things. One is the research something that that is of interest or importance to our community or organization.

834
01:30:23,242 --> 01:30:27,652
Secondly, do we have capacity to be engaged in another research project right now?

835
01:30:28,852 --> 01:30:34,012
Do I have staff who may be interested or willing to participate in it?

836
01:30:36,112 --> 01:30:43,972
Are there resources for the organization for our time to be involved, or is this going to be something that will take away resources?

837
01:30:45,382 --> 01:30:50,601
Who is the person to do it? Somebody who is recommended by some?

838
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:57,952
Another person that I know that's had a good experience with them or knows them as in the academic world, or is it a random person?

839
01:30:59,422 --> 01:31:04,852
A lot of times, if they're from an institution that is not local.

840
01:31:07,622 --> 01:31:15,601
That kind of screens them out for my purposes, because that tells me that they're not going to be here locally to be able to implement an

841
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:20,742
intervention or policy recommendation because they're too far away to be able to do any of that.

842
01:31:20,762 --> 01:31:27,692
So usually I don't. Say yes to those kind of requests either.

843
01:31:27,692 --> 01:31:34,172
So it didn't. Again, it happens all the time. And if people come in using language like they want access to our population,

844
01:31:34,982 --> 01:31:40,891
that automatically tells me that's not somebody that I'm going to work with because they're using

845
01:31:40,892 --> 01:31:48,482
our popular our community as just research subjects and not as people who we want to partner with.

846
01:31:50,392 --> 01:31:55,422
Really, really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. So, Mary Beth, I'll turn it back over to you.

847
01:31:55,912 --> 01:32:04,882
Something the next question, and we can circle back to whoever wants to start this one.

848
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:10,822
What do you consider to be the most important factors for maintaining an effective partnership?

849
01:32:11,212 --> 01:32:15,202
That is, what does it take on the part of all partners for this to work over time?

850
01:32:19,342 --> 01:32:22,372
Well, trust for sure.

851
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:26,142
Got to develop the trust between.

852
01:32:28,432 --> 01:32:36,902
The academics and the partners and then between the partners and the partners, because they are to be able to trust to.

853
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,752
It's more important that you develop some kind of trust.

854
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:54,862
You also have to be flexible with each other. You know, recognize that everybody's not always right and try to accept their mistakes.

855
01:32:56,062 --> 01:33:02,572
But don't be so, you know, don't be so judgmental that you don't get anything done because sometimes people are so judgmental,

856
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:06,082
well, we wouldn't do this or we wouldn't do that. You don't know what you do.

857
01:33:09,582 --> 01:33:19,932
And you have to have for the project an effective project manager, somebody who's going to do the training correctly,

858
01:33:20,382 --> 01:33:26,042
who's going to be out there with the people who are the ones that's going to do whatever we want done.

859
01:33:26,052 --> 01:33:31,122
Like if it's just an analysis of their house or what it looks like.

860
01:33:32,862 --> 01:33:38,642
So you want the project manager to know that whoever they are working with is doing a fairly good job?

861
01:33:38,692 --> 01:33:43,952
That's what we are hoping for. Gotta have a sense of humor.

862
01:33:44,372 --> 01:33:49,832
I got that for sure, because some of that stuff, you have to laugh.

863
01:33:50,252 --> 01:33:53,762
Well, we have to laugh about it. Otherwise we take it and I'll be worrying about it.

864
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:58,662
Don't think we should worry about. I just think that. So we can't do anything about it.

865
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:03,712
We just forget about it. You know, my husband's always telling me what the news is on a daily basis.

866
01:34:04,142 --> 01:34:10,802
On a daily basis? I tell him, just tell me stuff that you think I might have an influence over.

867
01:34:12,822 --> 01:34:22,302
But you have to have a sense of humor and everybody hopefully on the board of directors or the ones who's leading the project.

868
01:34:22,332 --> 01:34:26,862
Do you have a sense of humor with each other? With other people?

869
01:34:27,312 --> 01:34:32,542
Sorry as it. So anyway, that's it.

870
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:43,672
Next. Who would like to go next?

871
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:50,242
Zachary. Sure, yeah. Well, can I. Can I.

872
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:54,562
Mary Beth, can you repeat the question? Of course. Definitely.

873
01:34:55,042 --> 01:35:04,252
So the question is, what do you consider to be the most important factors for maintaining an effective partnership?

874
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:09,652
That is, what does it take on the part of all partners to make this work over time?

875
01:35:10,532 --> 01:35:15,261
Nick Right. I think Wilmer sort of picked the number one answer, right?

876
01:35:15,262 --> 01:35:21,292
So list of top ten. Wilmer probably got the number one, which is trust at the trust.

877
01:35:21,322 --> 01:35:30,492
I would say, you know. You know, do what you say you're going to do it and not do what you say you know to.

878
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:38,112
Right. You know, because we have to be able to count on you to do those things that you say you're going to do.

879
01:35:40,462 --> 01:35:48,712
And yeah, trust and being accountable also, I think.

880
01:35:48,712 --> 01:35:55,082
And I really come to appreciate. You know, arguing.

881
01:35:55,092 --> 01:36:02,072
My partner, who I see doing nine steering committee meetings are nine.

882
01:36:02,082 --> 01:36:06,042
Detroit, you are meeting. You know, for me, it's a big deal to see, you know.

883
01:36:07,002 --> 01:36:13,122
Barbara, are Susan, are any of the other academic partners I work with when it come to our health?

884
01:36:13,122 --> 01:36:21,732
There are some of our, you know, non research related events because that begins to transcend our relationship.

885
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:30,431
So now now is now is more than just, you know, we're meeting at this meeting now you're actually showing that you care about the community,

886
01:36:30,432 --> 01:36:36,702
about the organization, because now you're starting to come to our events and participate in our projects.

887
01:36:36,912 --> 01:36:41,201
That has nothing to do with your project or our joint project, you know?

888
01:36:41,202 --> 01:36:44,622
I mean, I like those kinds of things. And those things are huge.

889
01:36:44,622 --> 01:36:54,962
Brownie points are bonus points for me. Angie.

890
01:36:59,912 --> 01:37:01,532
Carried me second to unmute.

891
01:37:02,462 --> 01:37:11,972
Yeah, I think part of the sustainability is having staff to help you sustain things because I've seen a lot of collaborations,

892
01:37:11,972 --> 01:37:16,322
different types of not just research collaborations, but other types of collaboration as well too,

893
01:37:16,712 --> 01:37:20,462
that weren't able to be sustained over time because they didn't have a core staff

894
01:37:20,462 --> 01:37:26,552
that helped keep everything together because as participants on that coalition,

895
01:37:26,552 --> 01:37:28,562
we don't have time without Mary Beth.

896
01:37:28,982 --> 01:37:35,522
It would be very difficult for us to be organized to know what the heck we're doing, to know when we're supposed to be meeting,

897
01:37:35,882 --> 01:37:44,611
keeping the notes, all of those things without having core staff just assigned to do that is really, really difficult for a group like this.

898
01:37:44,612 --> 01:37:54,032
So I think that's that is another key thing. And even without funding, funding, of course, is really important to be able to keep people at the table.

899
01:37:54,032 --> 01:37:57,032
But again, sometimes funding isn't there.

900
01:37:57,032 --> 01:38:05,072
Are there some gaps in between funding but. Keeping the interests of the community relationships going.

901
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:12,342
Making sure, as some folks are saying, involved in things that are of interest to each other as well.

902
01:38:12,692 --> 01:38:17,251
So not just the research project, but other things that may be going on and being involved in those things,

903
01:38:17,252 --> 01:38:28,592
showing that you still are there and present and have the community's interest in mind and then looking for other opportunities to continue to work.

904
01:38:29,552 --> 01:38:36,302
Brainstorming, coming up with different things. Because many times we may be working on a specific focus,

905
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:43,142
but there are other tangent and kind of research issues that are really important to that come up.

906
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:50,602
So an example is one of our current partnerships, the cafe around air quality.

907
01:38:50,612 --> 01:38:58,522
One of the conversations led to. A lot of concerns about how the city responds to emergencies and crises.

908
01:38:58,982 --> 01:39:05,272
Right. So since there were so many people who were so interested in this issue,

909
01:39:06,022 --> 01:39:13,292
we were able to get a small grant to kind of look at the issue, what's happening and make recommendations, policy recommendations.

910
01:39:13,312 --> 01:39:25,372
So we're just starting to launch that. So those kind of things also keep sustain the partnership, even if it's additional additional focus area.

911
01:39:25,672 --> 01:39:30,122
But that still may be of critical interest to the community as well.

912
01:39:30,122 --> 01:39:39,082
As you know, we also have some researchers who are very interested in things like climate change and those kind of things that lead into that.

913
01:39:39,092 --> 01:39:45,682
So equitable development. All of those things are kind of related to some of the work that we're doing.

914
01:39:45,682 --> 01:39:52,882
So in addition to the stuff that both women, Zakaria said, I think those things also help to sustain the relationship over time.

915
01:39:54,752 --> 01:40:01,312
Thank you. Any questions from the class about partnerships?

916
01:40:06,062 --> 01:40:10,622
Okay. We're going to move to the next question.

917
01:40:12,182 --> 01:40:19,412
What is your advice to prospective faculty members, researchers and practitioners, that is,

918
01:40:19,412 --> 01:40:25,082
students in this class who are interested in using a CV PR approach in their careers?

919
01:40:31,912 --> 01:40:35,542
Who do you want to go first? Mary Beth. Keep going.

920
01:40:36,142 --> 01:40:44,432
You're the first one to talk there. Okay. So one of the things we often talk about is that, you know,

921
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:50,032
you may have a particular research interest that the community may not be interested in at all.

922
01:40:50,422 --> 01:40:53,692
Or may not be important to that community.

923
01:40:54,502 --> 01:41:02,182
So it's being able to be adaptable and making sure that the community is also involved in identifying what that research is going to be about.

924
01:41:02,192 --> 01:41:13,372
So you may have to chip and first work on those kind of things that the community is more concerned about before moving to another.

925
01:41:14,522 --> 01:41:19,062
Another research topic. So that that's really important.

926
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:30,282
I think Wilmer had mentioned to making sure that you budget in money to to support the folks that are going to be involved in.

927
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:36,272
There's different levels too so there may be a stipend for people just to be on the steering committee or the board.

928
01:41:36,572 --> 01:41:42,302
Maybe there's an additional amount that people are actually doing assigned specific work or their colleagues.

929
01:41:42,932 --> 01:41:53,432
So that you can you can support people at different levels depending on where they're they are willing and able to be involved and at what level.

930
01:41:53,942 --> 01:42:02,192
Right. If they have time to review mini grants or whatever it is that you're asking people to do, that you take that extra time into consideration,

931
01:42:02,192 --> 01:42:08,732
make sure you're putting that money into the budget, making sure that that that organization,

932
01:42:08,732 --> 01:42:13,352
if you're putting that organization in the budget, that you also include their indirect costs.

933
01:42:14,452 --> 01:42:19,942
To what extent possible. Our indirect cost rates are never what the universities are.

934
01:42:20,302 --> 01:42:24,742
Universities typically add around 50% or so, sometimes more.

935
01:42:26,082 --> 01:42:31,152
Most non-profits, indirect cost rate is closer to about 20%.

936
01:42:32,142 --> 01:42:36,191
If they have one, if they have a federally negotiated cost rate, but if they don't,

937
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:44,682
even making sure you're building in some of those costs is really important for the organization in order for them to be able to continue to operate.

938
01:42:45,912 --> 01:42:56,052
Cultural sensitivity, awareness, whatever term, humility, whatever term you're using.

939
01:42:57,992 --> 01:43:01,052
Acknowledging that you come into a different culture.

940
01:43:01,082 --> 01:43:13,232
And it's not just race or ethnicity, it's also institutional culture and respecting and acknowledging those differences,

941
01:43:13,952 --> 01:43:24,781
asking questions, not making assumptions. And again, that kind of maintaining that a culture of learning, knowing that you don't know everything,

942
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:29,042
we don't know everything, that we're all always learning and learning from each other.

943
01:43:29,342 --> 01:43:33,722
Sometimes the community organizations are learning from other community organizations,

944
01:43:34,052 --> 01:43:42,121
sometimes universities learning from other researchers, and sometimes it's across institutions from community to university and vice versa.

945
01:43:42,122 --> 01:43:49,832
So. But keeping an open mind and understanding that there's different types and levels of expertise and knowledge is very valuable.

946
01:43:50,132 --> 01:43:51,572
All across the partnership,

947
01:43:51,572 --> 01:43:59,872
I think is also it's really important to come in with that level of understanding and humility in order to be able to work in the community.

948
01:43:59,882 --> 01:44:04,322
The first thing I think that will exactly one woman talked about was trust.

949
01:44:04,412 --> 01:44:13,742
If you're not acting in a trustworthy way and are being hierarchical towards people in the community,

950
01:44:13,772 --> 01:44:16,832
you'll get turned off and turned away in a heartbeat.

951
01:44:17,102 --> 01:44:22,652
People may not tell you right off that that's what they're doing, but that's that quiet quitting that people have been talking about.

952
01:44:23,072 --> 01:44:28,742
We will quit you sometimes that sometimes quietly in that it's not something that quite so quietly.

953
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:33,332
So keeping all of those things in mind, I think are really important.

954
01:44:34,082 --> 01:44:42,962
And then, you know, be patient with yourself. The longer the relationship is with the community and the more you do that learning.

955
01:44:44,622 --> 01:44:49,932
The more people in the community are going to be understanding of your institution's demands as well to you know,

956
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:56,742
we've had instances where we have had young researchers who the community said,

957
01:44:56,742 --> 01:45:02,472
you need to go back to the university and spend your time writing, because we know public publications are extremely important.

958
01:45:02,772 --> 01:45:04,572
In order for you to be able to get tenure.

959
01:45:04,812 --> 01:45:10,242
And we want you to be able to get tenure because we need somebody like you to be able to stay doing this kind of work.

960
01:45:10,752 --> 01:45:15,012
We didn't understand that, many of us, because we don't work in that kind of an environment.

961
01:45:15,012 --> 01:45:20,501
So, you know, publications are not all that important to us in working in the CBO,

962
01:45:20,502 --> 01:45:28,902
but we know that they are now and understanding even how hierarchy works within a university, you know, are very rigid over there.

963
01:45:30,302 --> 01:45:37,332
And so it's kind of like the armed forces, I think, sometimes with all the rank and what it takes to get there.

964
01:45:37,812 --> 01:45:44,951
But, you know, having that understanding and knowing we want to be able to protect those people that we know worked so hard to

965
01:45:44,952 --> 01:45:50,112
establish those relationships and sometimes have to struggle within an institution that doesn't respect that.

966
01:45:50,652 --> 01:45:58,691
So the community members really come to value those individuals and the people that are really working hard with them to improve their community.

967
01:45:58,692 --> 01:46:04,752
And we also want to be able to respect and protect and trust you all, too.

968
01:46:05,052 --> 01:46:12,462
So that's one of the reasons why that understanding and those relationships are so critical for you as well as for us.

969
01:46:13,392 --> 01:46:19,962
Then look for advice. But people who've done this before, Barbara, is just a wealth of advice and information.

970
01:46:20,382 --> 01:46:24,662
And I know she's overwhelmed a little bit, but she's been doing this, you know,

971
01:46:24,672 --> 01:46:27,492
and others, too, as part of the RC that have been doing it for a long time.

972
01:46:27,492 --> 01:46:37,031
So are really good at mentoring new academics who are trying to do this kind of work and giving you feedback on ways that

973
01:46:37,032 --> 01:46:43,392
you can get around some of the institutional demands that get around them and how to work with them while you're doing CPR.

974
01:46:44,892 --> 01:46:50,352
Excellent. Thank you, Angie. What would you like to do next?

975
01:46:51,912 --> 01:46:56,782
So. And I'm like.

976
01:46:57,052 --> 01:47:01,972
Like. And he was saying it. You got to be able to trust. You got to have some humility.

977
01:47:03,072 --> 01:47:12,212
And you got to be patient. Community groups can drive you crazy like that time when we did that one to get community action against asthma.

978
01:47:13,962 --> 01:47:19,812
Two things was driving me crazy. It was every time you come to a meeting, somebody else get a new idea.

979
01:47:20,922 --> 01:47:26,142
And then we'd have to sort of research that to see if that was going to work.

980
01:47:27,132 --> 01:47:34,751
And then what really got me was always talking about the Tuskegee Project.

981
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:39,072
Now understand what happened and just be honest and why people were upset about that.

982
01:47:39,072 --> 01:47:45,012
But I try to reassure people, hopefully, that this will never happen again.

983
01:47:45,162 --> 01:47:46,152
You know that.

984
01:47:46,872 --> 01:47:55,662
Now you sign papers saying that you're giving your permission and blah, blah, blah and on and on, but they will bring that up every time.

985
01:47:56,052 --> 01:47:59,631
You know, that's what happened in COVID 19. People don't want to take the vaccine.

986
01:47:59,632 --> 01:48:05,352
You know what they did to the old man and dusty. That's been so long ago and.

987
01:48:07,052 --> 01:48:12,902
Oh, I think we have to. I think sometimes we have to involve ourselves in research.

988
01:48:12,902 --> 01:48:20,761
Otherwise you don't really know what's going on in in in your community at all because without doing any research,

989
01:48:20,762 --> 01:48:28,892
so nobody can say, well, 50% of you go to the show and 20% don't because you're not answering the question.

990
01:48:28,912 --> 01:48:32,512
So those are the two things that will really get me about that.

991
01:48:33,952 --> 01:48:43,492
But like I said, once you develop trust, it gets a little bit better because you need to develop, develop some relationships within the community.

992
01:48:43,492 --> 01:48:48,531
So you need to come come down to the community on some off time.

993
01:48:48,532 --> 01:48:52,792
Maybe you don't have a meeting, but you like to see this one or that one is the other.

994
01:48:53,332 --> 01:48:57,352
The CBO operates, you know, that's a good thing to do.

995
01:48:57,922 --> 01:49:03,562
And it gives you more of an understanding of what the community based organization is going through

996
01:49:04,522 --> 01:49:11,152
in terms of running it and trying to take care of the problems with this within the city of Detroit.

997
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:26,101
Her. Okay. And then sometimes we get to do some subcontracting with some of the smaller CDOs that that

998
01:49:26,102 --> 01:49:30,841
is a real problem because at first when they first when University of Michigan first came,

999
01:49:30,842 --> 01:49:39,852
they were doing all of the money. And then finally somebody asked the question, well, we are not going to get any money.

1000
01:49:39,892 --> 01:49:43,692
That was our right to get that money just to say you come to the meetings.

1001
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:54,402
But the organizations also wanted to have a little bit of money to or have some say so over the staff that was out there in the field working,

1002
01:49:55,032 --> 01:49:59,982
or they wanted another contract that didn't have anything to do with University of Michigan.

1003
01:49:59,982 --> 01:50:07,272
So you got to take a look at that. You know, maybe you can find another pot of money that they can utilize to do other things with.

1004
01:50:09,672 --> 01:50:15,882
Other research project with. So, okay, let's do it right.

1005
01:50:18,192 --> 01:50:25,302
Kind of a tough act to follow, Wilma and Angie just got to moderator to repeat the question.

1006
01:50:25,302 --> 01:50:33,792
That is, what is your advice to prospective faculty members, researchers and practitioners,

1007
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:40,542
that is, students in this class or interested in using a PR approach in their career?

1008
01:50:45,732 --> 01:50:53,982
Okay. And so a sort of did a lot of the thing that Angie and Wilma said.

1009
01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:58,782
And I'm going to say definitely, you know, take this class. Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

1010
01:51:01,212 --> 01:51:09,941
Definitely by the book. Woo hoo hoo hoo. You know, and I and I, you know, I'm not you know, I'm not being too facetious.

1011
01:51:09,942 --> 01:51:17,022
But the reason I'm sort of pointing this out is because when we first get started, you know, the book didn't exist.

1012
01:51:18,042 --> 01:51:24,912
Right. And a lot of the lessons that the of the lessons that we shared with you didn't exist.

1013
01:51:25,402 --> 01:51:31,062
Right. So already you're you know, you're already ahead of the game.

1014
01:51:31,272 --> 01:51:41,832
Right. So so what took us 20 some years to get to you guys are getting it with, you know, taking Bibles class and reading a book kind of thing.

1015
01:51:41,952 --> 01:51:48,792
Right. So that probably saved up about ten years of your of your maybe learning experience right there.

1016
01:51:51,012 --> 01:51:59,262
The other thing I would say, just in terms of, you know, finding an Angie mentioned about finding a good mentor,

1017
01:51:59,292 --> 01:52:04,692
finding a good academic mentor, have you really interested in doing this work?

1018
01:52:04,702 --> 01:52:08,002
Find a good community mentor. Right.

1019
01:52:08,302 --> 01:52:14,662
And hold on tight. Right. I mean, you guys can if you guys have a chance to work with Angie, definitely.

1020
01:52:14,662 --> 01:52:17,992
She's super busy and she's going to push you off position at time.

1021
01:52:18,502 --> 01:52:25,612
But, you know. But hang in there, right. Because it's going to be worth it because she'll be able to share with you.

1022
01:52:25,642 --> 01:52:29,142
You better learn from her, you know, things that would be really helpful.

1023
01:52:29,152 --> 01:52:31,162
So I would say, hey, find a good mentor.

1024
01:52:32,482 --> 01:52:39,022
But also be prepared though, you know, when you go to India, when you come, the principles are anyone's shop to say, Hey, can you be a mentor?

1025
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:42,832
You got to come with something other than, I'm a student and I want a mentor.

1026
01:52:44,812 --> 01:52:48,352
You know, hey, you know, it would be nice if you come with some resources, right?

1027
01:52:48,502 --> 01:52:52,432
Maybe. Maybe you can get an undergrad grant or grad a graduate grant.

1028
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:56,242
Ah, or maybe, maybe, you know, you can teach the kids, you know.

1029
01:52:57,942 --> 01:53:01,092
Something. But come come with with something. Right.

1030
01:53:03,192 --> 01:53:06,282
And then I will sort of say, you know, be transparent. Right.

1031
01:53:06,412 --> 01:53:10,652
You know, be a big, deep trance parent.

1032
01:53:10,662 --> 01:53:19,152
And I'm going to say something really controversial, but be transparent would also be selfish because at the end of the day.

1033
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:26,822
You're there for a reason. Right? And so you want to make sure that whatever reason, maybe you're there because you want to.

1034
01:53:27,912 --> 01:53:30,972
Use this opportunity to write an article about whatever, right?

1035
01:53:31,362 --> 01:53:36,792
Definitely. Definitely be transparent about why you there and definitely make sure that that you keep your.

1036
01:53:37,772 --> 01:53:40,622
Keep your eyes on what you're there for. Right.

1037
01:53:41,552 --> 01:53:48,572
Because of you know, you can if you come to work with Brenda Pakzad, I'm going to definitely make sure that we get what we want from you.

1038
01:53:49,892 --> 01:53:55,832
I'm going to be very selfish in that. I'm also going to mostly want to try and make sure that you're getting your needs met as well.

1039
01:53:56,102 --> 01:54:01,742
But I have to trust that you're going to also be looking out for your best interests as well.

1040
01:54:02,692 --> 01:54:08,902
Right. And so when I say being selfish, I'm just sort of saying, hey, just make sure that you're there for a semester.

1041
01:54:08,902 --> 01:54:11,152
At the end of semester, you need to be able to write an article.

1042
01:54:11,662 --> 01:54:16,491
I'm hoping that that you're keeping out front and center in that you remind them like, hey,

1043
01:54:16,492 --> 01:54:21,321
we got to get this done by the end of the semester kind of thing because they put in a semester to come.

1044
01:54:21,322 --> 01:54:30,652
You say, Well, you know, we did all these great things together, but my article is not really going stop a misstep here.

1045
01:54:33,262 --> 01:54:38,092
Excellent. Thank you. We have a few moments.

1046
01:54:38,332 --> 01:54:47,192
And so I'm going to ask if any of you have a question of the panel before we let them go into their evening at one.

1047
01:54:47,772 --> 01:54:51,142
Sam So myself, I'm going into Detroit.

1048
01:54:51,142 --> 01:54:56,511
That's where my work's bringing me. So with goal of laying the ground, very firm,

1049
01:54:56,512 --> 01:55:01,972
foundation of civic relationships and just by leadership with researchers and community based organizations.

1050
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:09,242
Where do you see like the future of relationships going for this next generation coming in to do more of this work?

1051
01:55:09,382 --> 01:55:13,222
Where would you want us to really like focus our attention and stuff?

1052
01:55:16,522 --> 01:55:19,902
The big questions. I'm not even sure this is.

1053
01:55:20,482 --> 01:55:25,542
Oh, that's that's a that's a that's a great question because we're always thinking about what comes next.

1054
01:55:25,552 --> 01:55:30,532
You know, what comes next. Yeah, I.

1055
01:55:30,952 --> 01:55:38,422
I'll let you go first. Oh, thanks. I do want to say that, you know, even in the U.S.

1056
01:55:38,552 --> 01:55:42,232
And several of our other projects, affiliate projects, we.

1057
01:55:43,802 --> 01:55:51,812
Focus refocused our lens to really be more intentional about issues around racial equity, especially in today's day and age,

1058
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:59,492
with a lot of people's rights being rolled back and making sure that we're we're paying much more attention to.

1059
01:55:59,532 --> 01:56:05,612
I mean, it's always been a focus, but really having much more attention on that.

1060
01:56:05,972 --> 01:56:15,572
And I think a lot of the next generation of people who are doing the work in the community are much more focused on that, particularly in Detroit.

1061
01:56:16,952 --> 01:56:24,331
You know, Detroit being a majority black city is always those are issues of racial equity are really critical right now.

1062
01:56:24,332 --> 01:56:32,282
And even though some folks have said gentrification is not possible in Detroit because we have so much open land, it is in fact happening.

1063
01:56:32,522 --> 01:56:35,642
And in some communities it's pretty rampant already.

1064
01:56:35,642 --> 01:56:39,452
So there's a lot of concern about where development is happening.

1065
01:56:40,022 --> 01:56:46,262
What's the focus on the community? Are long term residents, particularly black and brown residents who've been here for a long time,

1066
01:56:46,392 --> 01:56:52,951
are going to be able to afford to still stay here, where especially in the communities where this new development is happening.

1067
01:56:52,952 --> 01:56:59,632
And people other people are moving in. You know, what are the in the.

1068
01:56:59,992 --> 01:57:05,361
And again, the issues should be driven by the community. Not by the researchers.

1069
01:57:05,362 --> 01:57:11,002
It should be the community saying this is. This is an issue that's important to us that we really need to address.

1070
01:57:11,662 --> 01:57:15,462
So it's a it's a beginning in cdpr.

1071
01:57:15,472 --> 01:57:20,751
It is a process that happens together with the researcher and in the community.

1072
01:57:20,752 --> 01:57:29,752
So making sure that that that's your approach and it may be different in each community because even though,

1073
01:57:29,932 --> 01:57:35,092
you know, we're one city, we're pretty big landmass of a city.

1074
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:44,142
So things may be completely different on the northwest side than they are on the south side of Detroit or the southwest side.

1075
01:57:44,152 --> 01:57:49,311
So being able to pay attention to all of those things is really important.

1076
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:56,572
But do know that Detroit has an extremely active e.g. movement happening?

1077
01:57:56,662 --> 01:58:05,692
There are a lot of people involved in environmental justice issues across the city connected to the state, and people in Detroit are not quiet.

1078
01:58:06,782 --> 01:58:16,032
We've. We've. We've learned to speak up when we need to, which is quite often right all across the city of Detroit.

1079
01:58:16,032 --> 01:58:22,272
So we're not shy, but we are a pretty resilient city.

1080
01:58:22,722 --> 01:58:28,302
I think all things considered. But our real suspicious type of outsiders.

1081
01:58:29,362 --> 01:58:34,582
I think overall the city of Detroit, you know, we with a lot of good reason.

1082
01:58:34,942 --> 01:58:39,292
So you got to have to prove yourself that you can be trusted.

1083
01:58:39,322 --> 01:58:45,711
And again, it goes back to that when you're coming in from the outside that you are somebody who is going to be respected,

1084
01:58:45,712 --> 01:58:51,142
respecting the community and they can be trusted to not take from the community,

1085
01:58:51,142 --> 01:59:00,112
but to really add to and and also understand that there's a lot of work being done already.

1086
01:59:00,802 --> 01:59:07,402
So you may think that you're bringing something new, but there may have been people who've been working on this stuff for a long time already.

1087
01:59:07,402 --> 01:59:13,462
So figuring out where you fit in. And don't try to lead from the front.

1088
01:59:14,392 --> 01:59:19,982
We are not opposed to having people work alongside us. But you should not be the one leading the work.

1089
01:59:20,002 --> 01:59:26,252
It should be led by people from the community. So let me let me jump in for a second.

1090
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:32,301
So two things. Well, maybe two or three things that sort of comes to mind.

1091
01:59:32,302 --> 01:59:40,252
And part of it has to do with our experience with COVID, realizing that how we view communities have sort of shifted.

1092
01:59:40,672 --> 01:59:47,922
And then the reality that there's this virtual community now that we have to also keeping in mind and also

1093
01:59:48,042 --> 01:59:53,512
it dawned on me and I think and you said something earlier that we've been doing this work for 27 years,

1094
01:59:53,992 --> 01:59:57,891
and it dawned on me that we've been doing this for 27 years.

1095
01:59:57,892 --> 02:00:06,802
We've been doing it almost the same way. So I'm thinking that the new generation of researchers and community partners are going to have to.

1096
02:00:08,402 --> 02:00:15,332
Adjust the principles and adjust how we do things because, you know, society is changing a lot.

1097
02:00:15,362 --> 02:00:15,782
Right.

1098
02:00:16,412 --> 02:00:29,602
And I think a couple of years ago and I think my girlfriend produced but she kept telling me that she's she's tired of being engaged and so and so.

1099
02:00:30,092 --> 02:00:34,682
So we call it a community, you know? I mean, so, you know, people talk about community engaged businesses, that kind of thing.

1100
02:00:34,692 --> 02:00:38,412
Right. But I'm thinking what comes out? The community engaged.

1101
02:00:38,432 --> 02:00:38,682
Right.

1102
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:51,252
So hopefully you guys can come up with what comes next out the community engage because you know, she's already been engaged when you hit the area.

1103
02:00:51,442 --> 02:00:55,232
Zachary Yeah. Did you get married exactly?

1104
02:00:55,562 --> 02:01:02,402
Well, no. She says she's no longer engaged, so I'm just.

1105
02:01:02,402 --> 02:01:07,532
I'm just saying. Just something to think about. Yeah, it's a different community is.

1106
02:01:07,572 --> 02:01:19,561
And so you have to relate differently. You still got it's got a with the with us doing is social media where you're not in a group with a group.

1107
02:01:19,562 --> 02:01:23,792
You know because I like I like being with the students I said Barbara.

1108
02:01:24,032 --> 02:01:30,962
So that means that we will get a chance to go out to dinner because a lot we go out to dinner,

1109
02:01:30,962 --> 02:01:37,472
we go down to Angie's place or something, and then we go out to dinner in southwest or southeast Detroit.

1110
02:01:38,672 --> 02:01:45,482
But that's what it takes away, because then you don't have that socialization as much socialization.

1111
02:01:45,482 --> 02:01:51,332
In fact, I'm I'm almost thinking that we will have no socialization in about 20 or 30 years.

1112
02:01:52,292 --> 02:01:56,402
Just, you know, like go on your screen, look at this person.

1113
02:01:56,402 --> 02:02:00,782
That person is is going to be a mess and called the Danielle film.

1114
02:02:02,042 --> 02:02:11,192
But anyway, yeah, the new generation does have to come up with the solutions or develop a new way.

1115
02:02:11,732 --> 02:02:15,572
But a community based business for joy research is the best way to go.

1116
02:02:15,572 --> 02:02:23,011
And what I want to say that I me having the community participate and whatever you want to go and study at their

1117
02:02:23,012 --> 02:02:29,591
place because they're not going to cooperate with you if you just bring this stuff in and want to answer questions.

1118
02:02:29,592 --> 02:02:35,082
There's going to be a lot of problems with that. So communication is important.

1119
02:02:37,432 --> 02:02:42,142
Developing relationships is important and you do that over the TV series or whatever.

1120
02:02:42,592 --> 02:02:46,042
You know, they've done it. They get married. I mean, they do all kinds of stuff.

1121
02:02:46,162 --> 02:02:49,432
I know I've got a cousin married, somebody on Facebook.

1122
02:02:49,512 --> 02:02:52,842
You know, we we thought it wasn't gonna last, but guess what?

1123
02:02:52,852 --> 02:02:56,272
They still married? I don't know.

1124
02:02:57,082 --> 02:03:00,562
I don't know. I wouldn't trust somebody who had metal and TV set.

1125
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:07,162
I remember you met. You met you meet in the studios. So you don't trust this town?

1126
02:03:08,302 --> 02:03:13,892
No, I'm just said. Well, somebody who want to dramatically indicate the studio.

1127
02:03:13,942 --> 02:03:18,232
That's not a problem, because I probably won't hear from them for a while yet.

1128
02:03:18,622 --> 02:03:23,622
But it's something about people that become romantically inclined here, you know?

1129
02:03:25,222 --> 02:03:28,222
That's what I feel like is really risky myself.

1130
02:03:30,592 --> 02:03:35,122
So I'm glad I was able to date the way normal people say that.

1131
02:03:35,582 --> 02:03:39,622
I'm saying as normal, but see it as dating over the internet is normal now.

1132
02:03:42,862 --> 02:03:46,222
So, you know, normal changes. Right, exactly.

1133
02:03:46,432 --> 02:03:50,202
Exactly. Normal changes. That's true, too.

1134
02:03:50,282 --> 02:03:55,912
So much, I think. Go back out on the set of both of you very much.

1135
02:03:55,912 --> 02:04:01,102
Appreciate you giving us your time this afternoon and sharing your wisdom.

1136
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:06,352
And we thank you for inviting us. Yes.

1137
02:04:08,732 --> 02:04:12,602
Just a couple quick words also of thanks to Wilma, Angie and Zachary.

1138
02:04:13,502 --> 02:04:20,462
I think it's been fabulous. I always learn something when I listen to y'all speak and feel inspired.

1139
02:04:21,752 --> 02:04:28,142
I hope that the students in the class, this gives you a better sense of why I do what I do and the people I do it with,

1140
02:04:28,382 --> 02:04:31,982
because this is where my passion and my energy comes from.

1141
02:04:32,432 --> 02:04:39,452
And I hope you're all fortunate enough in your careers, those of you who go on to do CPR,

1142
02:04:39,812 --> 02:04:53,102
to be able to develop similar relationships with your community partners, because it's it is just totally invaluable and and hard to put words on it.

1143
02:04:53,132 --> 02:04:57,482
So thank you all. And I hope students are all good.

1144
02:04:57,482 --> 02:05:07,852
And remember, we don't have class next week because of APHA, but we will come back on the 16th and the syllabus is still there.

1145
02:05:07,872 --> 02:05:18,332
Canvas is still there. So and I am working through the papers and they will be there as soon as I can get through them.

1146
02:05:18,782 --> 02:05:22,792
And again, just thanks, everybody. And Angie, Zachary and Wilma.

1147
02:05:22,802 --> 02:05:29,612
It's been a real pleasure. And thanks, Mary Beth. I really appreciate your facilitating and take care, everybody stay well.

1148
02:05:29,942 --> 02:05:32,672
All right. Bye bye. Bye.
