[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:10,543
In this segment we're gonna go through
four of the major study designs to help

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:17,260
epidemiologists identify risk factors for
disease, or evaluate interventions.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,234
The four main types are randomized
clinical trials, Cohort studies,

5
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:25,410
case-control studies, and
cross-sectional studies.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,403
The randomized clinical
trial answers the question,

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,597
does this intervention really
improve health outcomes?

8
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:36,106
It's generally regarded to be the most
scientifically rigorous method of

9
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:39,040
testing that hypothesis.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,210
Where do we use randomized
clinical trials?

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,860
Well, first of all, we use them in
every drug evaluation for the country.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,830
We use them to evaluate therapeutic and

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:53,330
preventative aspects of medical practice,
new approaches to healthcare delivery.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,330
As well as to evaluate whether or

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,160
not health education is actually making
a difference on health behavior.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,540
To sort of think about study designs in
the big sort of context of the question

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,680
it's trying to address, we have to first
think of what is the source population.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,660
So the source population is this
concept of the everybody who would want

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,600
to know this information or
use this information.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,855
Usually it's defined by
a geographical sort of,

21
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:26,920
for our case it would be the United
states wants to know whether or

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,960
not a particular drug is safe and
effective.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,120
In order to do the clinical trial for

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,230
the United States,
a study population has to be decided upon.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,288
That study population is usually
decided upon, based on what drug you

26
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:47,529
want to evaluate, but it should be as
representative of the US as it can.

27
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:50,490
After a study population is identified and

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,010
usually this is somewhere between
1,000 and 10,000 individuals.

29
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,368
Those individuals are then randomized and
some of them get the new treatment and

30
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:03,751
some of them for instance,
might get the current treatment or

31
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,620
they might get a placebo.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,570
But it's the randomization that
actually is the distinguishing factor

33
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,280
of this study design.

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,750
How after we do this randomization and
give the treatments to individuals do we

35
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,625
actually assess whether the treatment
improved health outcomes?

36
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:26,645
Well we have to then place the information
about who developed the disease,

37
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:30,490
so this is an incident measure of disease,
with whether or

38
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,720
not they got the drug or the placebo.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,934
And just being able to
count individuals and say,

40
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:41,295
there were a individuals that got
drug A and developed the disease,

41
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:46,519
versus B number of individuals that got
the drug who did not develop the disease.

42
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,591
And through the simple little
two by two table we can

43
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:54,454
fundamentally compare what's the risk of
getting the disease here on the drug,

44
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:58,474
versus what's the risk of getting
the disease if your on placebo.

45
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:05,910
And that is actually the core of the
concept of the randomized clinical trials.

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,190
One of the best examples that we
have of the success of this kind of

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,410
approach, is by looking at
the common chronic disease drugs.

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,396
For instance, the number one reason
an adult goes to see their doctor is,

49
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,117
probably because they
have high blood pressure.

50
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:26,707
And so there's always a set of clinical
trials out there to figure out

51
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,880
the best blood pressure treatments.

52
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,350
The arhat was one of the sort of
largest in the history of the country

53
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,220
looking at over 42,000 individuals, and

54
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,620
evaluating many different kinds
of hypertension treatments.

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,329
To do something on this scale,
the epidemiologist have to work both with

56
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,577
the and the health professionals, often
with the media then clearly in the space

57
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:58,386
of the epidemiological study,
many different kinds of investigators.

58
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:03,382
And then have a whole dissemination
team to make sure that those information

59
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:06,114
of sort of relevance goes to physicians,

60
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:11,590
as well as to insurance companies and
health care systems in general.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,360
The next study we're gonna
talk about is cohort studies,

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,280
which are a bit of a sister of
the randomized clinical trial.

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,211
The cohort studies are designed to answer
a similar question, but in this case,

64
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,487
it's what are the effects
of a particular exposure?

65
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:31,989
And that exposure often is things like
what you're eating, how much fat,

66
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:35,347
how much exercise, whether or
not you're smoking, or

67
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:40,050
even particularly could be around
things that we might be worry about.

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,880
BPA in the plastic that we
might be putting our food and

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,580
drink in, or maybe pesticides on our food.

70
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,540
So, the cohort study
starts with individuals

71
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,472
that are basically from the population
at large, getting maybe 1,000,

72
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:02,310
5,000, 10,000 individuals,
to come into the study and

73
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,980
then there to be an evaluation of
whether or not they've been exposed.

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,070
Following those individuals over time,
we then see whether or

75
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,850
not the individuals developed disease.

76
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,105
So it could be, for
instance, in a cancer study,

77
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,982
it could be some kind
of cancer evaluation.

78
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:24,921
If it's in a heart disease cohort study,
maybe whether or not their cholesterol

79
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:29,850
changed, maybe whether or not they
had more hardening of the arteries.

80
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,370
But anyway, over time we're doing this
assessment of their disease state.

81
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,550
And from that information we're
now able to answer the question,

82
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,720
what are the effects of
this particular exposure?

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,746
To sort of get your mind
a little bit more in parallel to

84
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:51,884
the epidemiological study principles.

85
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,585
What we've got in this slide are some
examples of how we might consider

86
00:05:56,585 --> 00:06:00,977
taking an exposure, like smoking,
and being precise about it.

87
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:04,642
Because unless we actually have clear,
objective and

88
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:08,067
measurable ways to go
across thousands of people,

89
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,461
the data will represent the major
heterogeneity of being human.

90
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:17,960
So for instance, with smoking we're not
just asking somebody have you ever smoked?

91
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,730
Cuz that could be somebody who maybe
tried one cigarette or two cigarettes as

92
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,670
a teenager, versus somebody who
actually is a lifelong smoker.

93
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,370
We'll ask them things like have you smoked
at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime,

94
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,720
and if somebody says yes to that,

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,130
then either they're a current smoker or
a former smoker.

96
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,470
And we would need to ask a follow
up question do you smoke now?

97
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,650
If they say yes I smoke now,
then they're a current smoker.

98
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,810
But it's that kind of detail that
allows us to precisely measure

99
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,440
the impact of a health behavior
like smoking on health outcomes.

100
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,144
Where do we get that kind of information?

101
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:01,562
It can be from many different things,
it can be from an interview,

102
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,550
it can be from medical records.

103
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,210
Sometimes even laboratory records,

104
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,660
one of the ways we can get it from
the laboratory around smoking is that

105
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,370
there's a by-product called cotinine
that shows up in the bloodstream.

106
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,981
So we can know whether or
not somebody is actually smoking or

107
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,653
using nicotine products.

108
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:23,643
But there're a lots of different sources
of this information and often we'll use

109
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:29,090
it together to make a single read on
whether or not somebody has been exposed.

110
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,020
We want the same precision in
our assessment of outcomes.

111
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,820
So rather than just asking somebody,

112
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,640
have you ever been told that
you have high blood pressure?

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,357
We might ask that question and
actually then be specific and say,

114
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:48,007
has your doctor ever told you that
you have high blood pressure?

115
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:51,103
Then within the medical records,
we might look for

116
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,830
the actual codes that
represent that diagnosis.

117
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,560
Or, if the person died of a disease
we would look for that from a medical

118
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,230
examiner's assessment as to whether or
not they actually had that outcome.

119
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,164
Again there's many different
ways to access this and

120
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:12,477
epidemiologically we often are doing
our best to get many different sources.

121
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:15,672
So we can look at the overlap to make
the best assessment of whether or

122
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,450
not somebody had this disease outcome.

123
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,576
One of the largest cohort studies in
the United States that's been running for

124
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:26,921
a couple decades now,
is the Nurses Health Study.

125
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:31,879
This started in 1976 and
enrolled over 200, 000 nurses,

126
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,237
that are given questionnaires
on a regular basis around what

127
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:41,121
they've been exposed to, and
what diseases they've developed.

128
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,678
And it's formed basically one
of the cornerstones of our

129
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:50,565
understanding of the risk factors that
are associated with women's health.

130
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:54,700
There're lots of different disadvantages
and advantages of a cohort study.

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,320
Starting with the advantages, it gives us
a sense of what is predicting the future

132
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,900
disease, so we call this
the temporality aspect of study design.

133
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,065
It also is one of the best
ways to study rare or

134
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:13,870
unusual exposures, so
you could do a cohorts study for instance.

135
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,461
Of people that are working in airplane
construction that might be having

136
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:23,354
disease associated with a particular
product in the airplane materials that

137
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,490
they are working with.

138
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,962
That would be something not
everybody is exposed to, but

139
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,721
you could do a cohort study to see
whether or not it gives rise to

140
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:36,870
problems in respiratory, or
cancer risks or something like that.

141
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,023
It also is a great way to look
at many exposures at a time,

142
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:46,860
so that aspect is possible
as well as many outcomes.

143
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,588
So if you have all this information on
people why not look at many different

144
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:55,488
health outcomes at once,
rather than just focusing on one?

145
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,606
Probably the biggest thing
that a cohort study gives,

146
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:03,283
that the other studies designs I'm gonna
talk about, basically case control and

147
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:07,370
cross-sectional don't have,
is the estimate of incidence.

148
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,160
So that's the probability of
developing disease in the future and

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,540
only the cohort study
really can get that for us.

150
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,270
The disadvantages are pretty
sort of straightforward,

151
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,505
they're expensive studies to do costing
millions and millions of dollars.

152
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:27,425
They're also not good at all for
studying rare diseases,

153
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:32,225
because you would need to have millions
and millions of people to pick up

154
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:35,833
something that maybe a one
in a million disease risk.

155
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:41,040
They're also not good for diseases that
take a really long time to develop.

156
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,820
So if something has
an exposure sort of now, and

157
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,910
then you expect that disease
to manifest in two or

158
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,370
three decades, that's not a great
way to do a cohort study.

159
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,200
We don't have the resources, the time or
the capacity to study people for

160
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
that long.

161
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,088
The third study of design we're gonna
talk about is case control studies.

162
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,930
Case control studies are one of
the most frequently used designs.

163
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,770
It starts with participants being selected
on whether or not they have disease.

164
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,030
So for instance, cases
are individuals who have the disease,

165
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,080
controls are individuals who
do not have the disease.

166
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,880
After the individuals have
been identified, we ask cases,

167
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,370
did you have exposure or
did not have this exposure?

168
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,830
And we ask the same
exact thing of controls,

169
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,900
did you have have an exposure like this or
not?

170
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,660
We go with that data back to that
fundamental two by two table that we

171
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,485
showed earlier, but
now we're looking at whether or

172
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:47,822
not a case had the exposure
versus did not have the exposure.

173
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:53,060
And then whether the control had
the exposure or did not have the exposure.

174
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,413
And that gives rise to a new
measure of association for

175
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:05,679
this type of design called the odds ratio,
it's really the ratio of two odds.

176
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,484
The advantages of the case control study
are straightforward, it's good for

177
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:12,100
studying rare diseases.

178
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,840
Cuz you can get this new, I'll call
it view, of a disease by going into

179
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,060
clinics and actually recruiting from the
clinics themselves if it's a rare disease.

180
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,086
It doesn't have to have
these large sample sizes, so

181
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:30,315
it can be done in samples of 500 easily.

182
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,248
It's cost and time effective, and

183
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:38,039
the collected exposures actually
can be done on a survey or

184
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,649
through a laboratory and so
that is also quick and easy.

185
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,326
There are some disadvantages as well,
so for

186
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:50,500
instance there's no way to calculate
incidence in a case control study.

187
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,533
And finding good controls that may
have had the same chance to develop

188
00:12:55,533 --> 00:13:00,584
the disease, but just didn't have
the same for instance exposure.

189
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:05,726
Is often difficult to do, how do you
find basically somebody who is like

190
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:11,590
the case in all of the same ways
except they didn't get the disease?

191
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,811
The other part of the case control,
I'll call it disadvantage,

192
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:18,431
is that it's also susceptible to bias.

193
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:23,870
And there's two kinds of bias that it's
susceptible to, one is selection bias.

194
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,380
We know that's human nature that if
we have a disease, we're much more

195
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,990
willing to actually be a part of a study
cuz we wanna figure out, what's going on.

196
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,150
And so
we will get cases showing up who are not

197
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,840
the same in terms of their sort
of risk profile as controls.

198
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,320
They don't have the disease,
they don't have the same self motivation.

199
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,670
The other problem with the case
control is recall bias.

200
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,370
We've got good evidence
that suggests that when

201
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,170
asked a question if you have a disease.

202
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,730
Whether or not an exposure caused it
we're much more likely just to say yes.

203
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,582
We might have been exposed to that
even though we don't know and

204
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,481
can't make that connection.

205
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:14,297
Whereas a control they don't
have that same recall basis, and

206
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:17,393
they probably would not
say they had been exposed,

207
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:21,429
cuz they had no reason to actually
be worried about that exposure.

208
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,500
The last study design to talk about
is the cross-sectional study.

209
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,402
This is a very nice, straight forward
study design that gives rise to

210
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:36,230
many of the prevalence estimates
that we see within public health.

211
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,508
It simultaneously, at the same point
in time, asking about whether or

212
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:43,516
not somebody's been exposed or
has the disease.

213
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,960
It only is really measuring
prevalent disease,

214
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,950
it's happening at a single point
in time and there's no follow-up.

215
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,447
So the key measures of association
are gonna be somewhat like the case

216
00:14:57,447 --> 00:15:03,633
control it's an odds ratio, but now it
actually is a prevalence odds ratio.

217
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,194
There are many advantages of cross
sectional studies, they're faster and

218
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,150
less expensive than a cohort.

219
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,678
Often they're done to get information that
can apply to the population at large, so

220
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:17,469
the source population, because they
can be done quickly and easily.

221
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:21,995
And then the last is that they provide
really good estimates of prevalence of

222
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:25,824
many different exposures and
health outcomes at the same time.

223
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,502
The disadvantages of cross
sectional studies is that,

224
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:34,041
you have no idea whether or
not the exposure came before the disease,

225
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,550
cuz we're only looking at it
in one sort of slice of time.

226
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,737
We can't capture information on change and
risk or change in risk factors.

227
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:50,095
It's also not particularly good for
rare diseases or rare exposures.

228
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:54,853
So here we see the two measures of
association used in cross-sectional

229
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,978
studies using that same two by two table,
that has disease and

230
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:02,169
no disease relative to exposed and
unexposed.

231
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,430
First is the prevalence ratio, it's
really just the ratio of two prevalences.

232
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,532
The prevalence in the exposed relative
to the prevalence in the unexposed gives

233
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:17,727
us one measure, of how the prevalence may
be higher in one group versus another.

234
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,125
The second measure of
association is the odds ratio,

235
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,740
it's the same calculation
as in the case control.

236
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,950
It's a ratio of the odds, that tells us
whether or not people with the exposure

237
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,951
would have an increased
probability of having the disease.
