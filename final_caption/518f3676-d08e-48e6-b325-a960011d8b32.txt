00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,610
Preparing for qualitative research.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,450
In this section I want to introduce you
to a few things to consider in preparing

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,642
yourself to undertake qualitative
research, or even things to

4
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:18,682
consider when evaluating the qualitative
research that you read or hear about.

5
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:22,824
So qualitative research, you need to
keep in mind from the very beginning,

6
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,840
is that it's an iterative process.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,367
So we start with things like
generating research questions, and

8
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,892
then undertake data collection,
and then analyze the data, and

9
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:35,501
then start to draw conclusions,
and present research findings.

10
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,750
But then this can lead to more
research questions being generated,

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,834
more data collected.

12
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,109
Data analysis happening again and
drawing new conclusions.

13
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,643
And we can think about the cycle in this
iterative process as a whole line of

14
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:47,216
research.

15
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:51,643
But in qualitative research it's gonna
also happen throughout ones study, right?

16
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:54,510
So you can generate research questions,
start data collection,

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,594
do preliminary data analysis and
draw some preliminary conclusions.

18
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:00,154
And then maybe you'll shift
to a research questions, or

19
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,927
shift your data collection approach.

20
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:05,371
So we're constantly thinking about all of

21
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:09,580
these different steps in
the research process, and

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,569
think of it as an iterative
process in qualitative research.

23
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:16,690
So qualitative research
requires flexibility.

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,320
Two common phrases you'll probably hear
me say throughout this course are, one,

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,900
that there are commonly accepted methods
that provide guidelines and tool kits,

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,230
but there's not really a recipe or formula
for conducting qualitative research.

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,971
So you really need to learn about
all of the different ideas or

28
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:34,868
approaches that kind of proven rigorous
research methods in qualitative research.

29
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:38,924
But then you as a researcher have to
decide which methods or what to pull

30
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:43,670
from the tool kit rather than saying we're
going to follow this specific recipe or

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,525
formula for
conducting qualitative research.

32
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:50,845
And second common phrase is that I often
say is when people ask me a question about

33
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,279
which method to use or
what sample size is, is that it depends.

34
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:58,575
There are really no simple answers in
qualitative research methods, and so

35
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:02,615
we have to make the considerations
of various aspects of our research.

36
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:06,380
Think of it as an iterative process and
then decide the best steps for

37
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,380
moving forward.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,208
Qualitative methods are often much
more flexible than what we're used

39
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,408
to when designing and
conducting quantitative research.

40
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:17,480
So this doesn't mean that you
don't have to plan ahead or

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,896
that you don't need to learn rigorous
research techniques, but it does mean that

42
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:25,992
you should also allow the research
process to unfold, be open to new ideas,

43
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:30,557
new questions, new directions as you start
and move through the research process.

44
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:33,918
Qualitative research, so
it requires flexibility and

45
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,853
it also requires reflexivity.

46
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:40,531
Qualitative researchers must be open
to new ideas and new perspectives.

47
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:45,731
However, most, if not all of us,
are influenced by our past experiences,

48
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:49,078
world views, training, and education, etc.

49
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:52,519
And as qualitative researchers
we must be aware of these, and

50
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,770
reflect on our own roles as researchers
throughout the course of the study.

51
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,400
And this requires the researcherâ€™s
critical self awareness.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,816
And to do this we go through
an exercise called reflexivity.

53
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,881
And reflexivity is really a process,
so it influences our past experience,

54
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:12,070
our world views, influence us as in how
we choose what to study, what to study,

55
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,965
how to study it.

56
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:16,981
Influences our study design,
the data collection methods we use,

57
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:21,419
the data analysis approach we use, and
can influence how we disseminate or

58
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,680
write up our research results.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,842
So I would encourage you to take
some time in this course, and

60
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:31,120
throughout your NPH studies to reflect on
who you are as a public health researcher

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,540
or practitioner, and what really drives
you to engage in the work that you do.

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,180
And then to step back and
think about how this and your world views,

63
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,405
past experiences, etc., influence
what you study, how you study it, and

64
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:49,769
how it shapes your results and
dissemination of these results.

65
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,300
So in summary, qualitative
research is an iterative process.

66
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,557
It requires flexibility that some health
science researchers may not be used to,

67
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:01,013
and then thinking about the use of
reflexivity as being crucial and

68
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:06,246
an on-going process throughout
a qualitative research study.
