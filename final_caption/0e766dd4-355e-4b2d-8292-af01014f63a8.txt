1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,040
So let's get started.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,540
First of all, I want to say that homework one will be assigned today to you on Thursday,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,940
5 p.m. So I'll make sure that I go to canvas, which should be able to sit across.

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:34,330
Either find it in the file folder or send it to your assignment position on the appropriate account about the file.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,820
So as I mentioned before, you cannot do electronically.

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,350
So you either type your solutions or right and then scan it uploaded on Amazon.

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,140
So to well create it on canvas and then return it to your electronic plans.

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,590
So it's due next Thursday?

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,280
Yes. You speak a little louder. It's hard to hear you. Sure.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,270
Yeah. So I'm just saying that the homework going to be due next Thursday at the front of the file.

11
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,710
All right. So let's get started on today's material.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,100
So last time we talked about some introduce some definitions, such as the sample space,

13
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,660
the event record, that the sample space is essentially a collection of all possible outcomes.

14
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:36,040
An event is just a subset of that. And we say an event occurs if the actual outcome is investment.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,050
And so those are a few things that we're going to use to define probability.

16
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:53,670
And we also talk about SAT operations. Recall that we start to take relationships or assess what is and what is a complement.

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
And then we we define the union,

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,410
the intersection and the difference and all kinds of side operations and also introduce a couple of laws on the set of operations.

19
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,090
And towards the end, we also talk about the counting process.

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,050
And the reason why we want to introduce counting is ready or many probability, probability problems.

21
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,830
It all boils down to calculate the relative frequency. And one more way we want to calculate the right frequency.

22
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:32,320
It all boils down to a concept person you want to count how many cases are there and how many cases in total.

23
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:40,090
So if you do that, the ratio you got the probability even that each outcome has equal probability.

24
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:49,540
So that's why we need counting. And specifically, we talk about order sampling with replacement.

25
00:02:51,700 --> 00:03:02,500
Now remember the formula for that, assuming that we have an items and do the ordered replacement are times.

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,040
How many different ways that I can do it?

27
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,820
All right. I got until the time and to the power bar. Right.

28
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,460
So that's the order of sampling with a replacement.

29
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:23,920
So today we're going to move on and talk about the remaining scenarios or sampling with our replacement or sampling with with our equipment.

30
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,020
And also, we're going to spend some time talking about the probability axioms and countless.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,490
All right. First order sampling without replacement.

32
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,219
So this is. So in this scenario, what we want to do is,

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:50,800
do we want to count how many cases or how many different combinations we could get if we do order sampling without replacement?

34
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,610
In other words, you do it in sequential procedure. You first if you have items in total first,

35
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:06,580
you take one and then without replacement you take another one and then you do it until you reach that number of jobs that I want to draw.

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,360
Again, let's assume in total we have items and we do our jobs.

37
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,229
Okay. So say so. Sequential procedure.

38
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,760
You can you can calculate how many cases or how many different combinations you have by doing it also in a sequential way.

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:34,630
The very first step, we have options that's just denoted by a one to A and then apparently we have

40
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,940
different options if either the first one or the second one or the last one.

41
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,770
All right. So that's why we have different options in the first step.

42
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,510
And once we take one, we move on to the next step.

43
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,940
Now, we do not have the options instead, and we have a minus one.

44
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,350
So that's the second step. So here are the notation I use.

45
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,679
Be one to be a minus, one just to represent. So.

46
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,830
So we don't really know which one we pick in the first step. Right.

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,510
But whichever we take, we end up with a minus one options in the second step.

48
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,180
That's just a consultation. And now you can go on all.

49
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:30,140
And in the end, in our draw, essentially, we only have a minus our minus one and minus R plus one options and.

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,440
And if you if you if you consider this sequential procedure and you want to calculate

51
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,530
the number of water samples that you can possibly get using this sequential procedure.

52
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,910
This is the multiplication of these different options at each step that you gave us,

53
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:03,420
the number of order samples to be this number, and then minus one times that minus two all the way to a minus plus one.

54
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:16,570
All right. So any question about how we got this this number by doing this ordered sampling without replacement.

55
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,340
It's a very conceptual or intuitive process.

56
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,070
I do it sequentially, so you end up with a total number of order samples.

57
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:40,750
That is this number. So if you look at this number, I tell you, has a very, very specific way of representing this number.

58
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,060
It's a product of some consecutive numbers that's active in others.

59
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,820
Right. So we are to to make it simpler.

60
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,020
We actually give it a we define a new operation called Factorial in order to know this.

61
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:05,290
So factorial is defined as the product of consecutive numbers from one to that particular editor, for example.

62
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,360
And factorial is the product of integers from 1 to 3 all the way to mean.

63
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,330
And as a convention we define zero factorial to be equal to one.

64
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:25,250
Just for comedians, it doesn't really mean any particular offense, it's just for comedians for subsequent acceleration.

65
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,790
So one factorial is also a 4 to 1 2502234, six and eight.

66
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,390
Do the math. So factorial is just the product from one to that particular engineer.

67
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,700
And if you think about the formula that we have talked about before, all right.

68
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,490
If you want to do not say, consider a special case.

69
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,700
You want to draw and draw out of this items.

70
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:04,060
Now the words you want to drop everything right towards the and then how many different ordered segments as you come down

71
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:14,290
just plug are equal to and I think got that right if you plug are equal to and that's essentially an factorial that

72
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:23,620
actually is called permutation of this set the find that is called a permutation for a reason is so partitioned because

73
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:32,620
at the end of the day we actually draw all of the items and the number of combinations are the number of arrangements.

74
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,130
It's essentially all possible orders sequences for this instance.

75
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,300
So that's why it's called permutation and four and items.

76
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,130
The number of permutations is exactly right.

77
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:59,620
And for any order, any. Ask A.R. that's the number of tools that you can also represent,

78
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:08,320
the number of this order of samples to be using this formula and factorial divided by factorial.

79
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,520
So mathematically,

80
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:21,070
it's easier to show that this the formula that we've done before is exactly equivalent to this to this format or using the factorial.

81
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,820
Right. Mathematically, it's pretty straightforward to say that. And conceptually, we can also think about why that's the case,

82
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:37,090
why if you have an item you want to do our draws, the number of arrangements is this number okay.

83
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:48,580
Think about it. You have this say. These items, right?

84
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:59,120
You have the spaces and what you need to do is to draw from items to fill in the first our spaces.

85
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,030
All right. That's what we want to we care about.

86
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:15,450
And once you draw that our sequences, once you draw them our items to place it in the first hour boxes, what you have left is a minus our items.

87
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,520
Right. So what do we know already is that if you care about the order of all items in total,

88
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,110
we have factorial different ways to to to arrange this and items which,

89
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,150
by the way, we don't care about, given that we only care about the first, are what are we don't care about as the remaining mines are.

90
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:51,930
Right. So for each arrangement with our items in front, we got minus our factorial redundant arrangements.

91
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,990
So that's why you can also gap this number by just conceptually think about this process.

92
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,150
Okay. So it's essentially the ratio between those two permutations.

93
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,530
First, you promote the entire items and we don't care about the remaining and minus R.

94
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:18,670
So we remove the remaining and minus R and divide the original permutation and factorial by that number.

95
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:30,670
So you got exactly the same number. So that's a conceptual way of thinking about why having to draw our items from the samples.

96
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,410
You have these number of this number of different arrangements.

97
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,420
And any question.

98
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:56,780
So I say when we do accounting, we need to think about how this county is actually performed so that it's that it's easier to get the final number.

99
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:05,750
So this is just an example showing you for this particular example, they ordered sampling without replacement.

100
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,280
How we can conceptually think about the process and come up with this final number.

101
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,380
There are many other scenarios. Later on, we will show a couple of examples.

102
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,930
You won't need this kind of a reasoning to come up with the number and.

103
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,040
Three questions before we move on to examples. All right.

104
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,190
So a couple of examples. Just to test.

105
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,810
Always have had all this. So first example, assume that you want to take a photo of six of your friends.

106
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,280
And so the question is how many ways to arrange them in a row?

107
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,350
Exaggerated. Six factorial, six factorial.

108
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,460
Very good. All right. It's essentially a permutation problem.

109
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,280
You know where to start. You know where to enter. And I want to arrange the six people in the row.

110
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,130
So in total, six factorial. That's just a presentation.

111
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:21,070
Have six factorial. And the second question, you are inviting those six friends to dinner.

112
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,200
Now, how many ways you can arrange them at your round dining table?

113
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,130
By round I mean you don't really care where they start.

114
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:37,750
You don't care about the direction or whatsoever, just so we only care about who is not too old.

115
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,090
So how many ways are there? Through five factorial.

116
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,750
You all agree and a different answer. And why is five, five, five?

117
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,030
Because you can think of it as like fixing the first person because they can rotate all six seats and that doesn't change.

118
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,560
Very good. So because. So let me repeat what's on name.

119
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,220
Yeah, let me repeat Robert's answer. So basically, you can start with anyone.

120
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,900
All right. Fix them at the starting point. Let's say you started with your favorite friend.

121
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:29,290
Okay, but it's put him or her somewhere, and then all we care about is how the remaining five individuals are arranged in the table.

122
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,860
It doesn't matter where you are. Favorite forensic, any one of these six locations, it's the same.

123
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,100
It's a round table. So that's why essentially this problem boils down to a permutation of the remaining five individuals.

124
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,270
And that's why you have five factorial.

125
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:59,110
An alternative way to think about is you can also think about it's a six factorial divided by six.

126
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,160
The other words you still commute to, you are six friends.

127
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:11,200
Put them in the table and then you divide the result that the cases in total there are six redundant cases for each arrangement.

128
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,190
Anyone can start from anywhere. Right. So there are six and redundant for each arrangement.

129
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:25,360
So you divide six and that give you the same number five factorial questions.

130
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,010
Okay. The last one.

131
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,490
What if you put four apples, three bananas, five oranges in a row on a table?

132
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,470
How many arrangements are possible? So here, let's assume the apples are identical.

133
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,120
They are. They cannot be distinguished from one another. Bananas, oranges.

134
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,450
They're all identical. How many ways you can arrange them in a row?

135
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,469
Yes, 12 by three divided by four factorial times.

136
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,580
Three factorial times for our country. Okay, very good.

137
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:14,010
So 12 divided by four divided by three divided by five factorial.

138
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,570
And you think about why that's the case. That's actually correct.

139
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,980
Why is that the case anyway? Fun? Yes. Groups are interchangeable within.

140
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,360
Speak louder. The fruits are all interchangeable within their own groups.

141
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,220
So you need to avoid or attempting that the same thing.

142
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,040
Exactly. Very good. So let's take a look at how this number is constructed.

143
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,770
First numerator, 12 factorial. That's the permutation of all items.

144
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,900
In total, we have 12 items. Right. So we just have them.

145
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,370
That's the total number of permutations we can get from factorial.

146
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,070
But we know that the apples are the same, the bananas are the same, the oranges are the same.

147
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,460
So even if you you have for example, the first one is Apple 1/2 one, Apple two.

148
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,420
You can do it in the reverse way. And that's exactly the same arrangement, cause the apples are identical.

149
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:27,380
So then we need to divide the redundancy, right. And the number of redundant arrangements from this 12 factorial.

150
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:38,450
So the redundant, redundant cases can be calculated as you can compute the apples within each arrangement.

151
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,970
Now, I gave you the redundant arrangements for commuting the apples and that's for factorial.

152
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,090
Similarly, you can commute bananas. That does not change each arrangement either.

153
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:59,470
Right. And that's sorry about Taro. And finally, also oranges as firefighters.

154
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,400
That's how many ways you can commute each arrangement.

155
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,510
How many are redundant? Each agreement. Each arrangement has two.

156
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,860
Once you divide this three factorial.

157
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,490
You've got the final number. Okay.

158
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:27,600
So again, this kind of counting questions can be tricky sometimes, but think about the reasoning behind how you actually count a number.

159
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:40,320
And if there are any cases and you may see any cases of those without you end up with the actual number and any questions so far.

160
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,940
All right, so that's us. Think about our daughters playing without replacements.

161
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,150
Okay, so the resampling is sort of the easier to taste,

162
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:07,220
and the order standpoint is slightly more challenging, but it's more frequently encountered in practice.

163
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,740
Think about the lottery, right? When we buy lottery tickets, it's essentially I'll order a sample.

164
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,470
You don't care about the order, at least for Miami Lance or a Powerball.

165
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,040
You don't care about the order as long as you got the numbers correctly you want.

166
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,990
So I'll order someplace that is very frequently in Congress, in practice.

167
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,800
And also, if you play poker, Texas Hold'em I we don't care about order we care about the actual cards.

168
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,450
Next. Our sampling is is very common.

169
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,930
So let's first take a look at the big cases without replacement.

170
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,080
In other words, you take a bunch of, let's say, playing cards and take a bunch of cards from the deck without putting it back.

171
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:08,070
How many different ways you can if you can get for a certain number of a certain number of cards that you draw from to more specifically,

172
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:16,000
we care about how many ways can we select small objects from capital n without paying attention to what they are?

173
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,210
And for now, let's just assume the capital and the items are distinct.

174
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,230
That's very important. Later on, we will consider all the scenarios.

175
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,180
But for now, let's first assume all items are distinct.

176
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,160
Well, consider this example.

177
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Assume that you have four items this thing items ABC Andy and you want to draw two items from the group without replacement.

178
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:55,800
And so all possible combinations or all possible alternate combinations are listed as follows How many are those?

179
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,000
Consider his order with without replacement.

180
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,330
Then, as we said, it's going to be four times three vehicles.

181
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:14,680
So those are the 12 scenarios. But now, as we said, we don't care about the order.

182
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,499
So we can A, B and VA, they are exactly the same.

183
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,600
A, C, NCAA, they are the same. So basically the second row is exactly the same as the first of all.

184
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,810
So in total, we only have six different combinations.

185
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:45,560
All right. So 12 number is in the number of ordered pairs and six is the number of order pairs chosen from this four objects.

186
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,690
And if you think about that again, think about the reasoning behind this is the sampling.

187
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,770
You can actually gather the following relation between the number of all of our samples and the number of order samples.

188
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,000
The only difference between the two is whether you do the permutation.

189
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,270
Right. So that's exactly what is written here.

190
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:19,500
The number of honor examples is always equal to the number of combinations.

191
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,530
Or I'll order samples, multiply the number of ways of premiering each order sample.

192
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,370
Think about the relation between the two. Not exactly how these two numbers.

193
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,320
A number of other samples and the number of our samples are related.

194
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,290
The only differ by a by a multiplier. That is how many ways you can compute.

195
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:52,560
These are samples. In this case, as we have since we draw two objects.

196
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:59,010
So the permutation of two is two factorial. So that's why one is six.

197
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,900
Why is it just different by this multiplier two?

198
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,330
If you let's say you draw three, then the difference would be three times.

199
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,320
Sorry. The three factorial times. Six times.

200
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:22,800
All right. So that's and we can make it even make it more rigorous by using this.

201
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:38,760
These letters, the mathematical annotations to actually calculate what is the number of water samples without replacement.

202
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,560
In particular, we know that the number of ordered samples without replacement is this.

203
00:23:51,660 --> 00:24:05,200
So let's say you have an items. And you want to draw small items from this and items.

204
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:13,240
So if they want to do a order sample, this is the number of ways that we can do.

205
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,920
Right. Let's talk about this. So that's denoted by this parentheses, smaller.

206
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,709
Okay. And using the relation that we just talked about on the previous slide, we know is equal to this C,

207
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:34,300
which is what do we really want the number of ordered samples with our replacement times?

208
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,100
The permutation of this small in samples, which is an factorial.

209
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,180
So that's how we can get the number we want to see.

210
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,360
If you divide in the left hand side by this factorial,

211
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:55,660
that's what you get say will be equal to this factorial divided by capital, minus small n factorial times, smaller factorial.

212
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:05,830
That's the number. And the way we got it is exactly from the previous relation between this two numbers.

213
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:14,350
And since it's so commonly used, if I actually give it a name, so it's denoted as this, this notation,

214
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:22,330
if you put a big parentheses and put the total number on top, the number of chosen items on the bottom.

215
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,800
So this is rate as a capital and choose that.

216
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:34,690
And the formula for this is divided by small and factorial times, smaller factorial.

217
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:53,730
This is capitalism. Choose smaller. That is the number of ways to choose small and high items among this capital and items without replacement.

218
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:04,230
And the name is also pretty intuitive. So and she was adding so that's the number of ways that they can do this with our sports.

219
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:15,750
So my immediate note is that if you look at the denominator of this of of that,

220
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:25,620
you can see that actually it's symmetric in the way that the two items in the bottom the at the add up to the new numerator.

221
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,020
Right. So capital minus small and plus minus one.

222
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:40,050
So that naturally tells you that this anxious small end is also always equal to capital and choose capital and minus smaller.

223
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,560
And conceptually, that also makes sense if you want to choose small items from this capital items.

224
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,440
It's the same as choosing the remaining right.

225
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,550
You should have exactly the same number of ways to do that,

226
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:02,340
because once you choose small items to some extent, you also choose the remaining complement minus items.

227
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,529
So there is a 1 to 1 correspondence about exponents. Why is that couple into small?

228
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,970
It is always equal to choose capital the minus one.

229
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:29,840
So that's how we define this quantity. And again, this quantity is the number of ways to do our sampling without replacement.

230
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,900
And in particular, if a small is equal to capital, and then we know from lunch was capital.

231
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,550
And if you're plugging it in the formula, you can tell it is equal to one.

232
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:47,810
And conceptually, that also makes sense. If you choose items from all items, you only have one option.

233
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,000
That's why I'm chosen as one and as a convention.

234
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:06,350
Zero. I'm Toro is equal to one, so can also calculate and choose zero as one that there's only one way to not do the action and choose small and zero.

235
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:15,140
If this small end is out of the reasonable bound, either smaller than zero or is greater than Capital One,

236
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,870
also, you cannot choose most of what you have, right?

237
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,080
This is a sampling without replacement.

238
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,290
So you can now choose a negative number. You can choose a number that's greater than I'll set them to be zero.

239
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:51,350
Any questions so far? So a couple of questions now since we have talk about this, this, this a smaller sampling without replacement.

240
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:58,340
The most famous example is that Texas Texas Hold'em, I don't know how many of you played,

241
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:06,390
but the basic rule is that at end of the game, you're going to have five cards, right?

242
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,270
You're going to have five. You're going to have three. And you're going to have two cars.

243
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,190
But you've got to have a license plate.

244
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,290
So there are going to be five cards on the table and you're going to have two cards.

245
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:31,010
All right. All right. You're going to have two cars on a you need to make combinations of five cards that is, you know, at the highest order.

246
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
So there are a particular order that you have to refer to.

247
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:43,670
For example, there are four of a kind throughout of a kind of large trade, all kinds of different.

248
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,920
So by a poker hand, I mean, five is a collection of five cards.

249
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:55,160
Depending on their their their suit and their their numbers.

250
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,110
You can decide what that particular program is.

251
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:08,270
Okay. So here are a few examples of calculating the probability or the number of cases for each.

252
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:17,590
Okay. So the first question, how many different programs as again, as I said, in total you have 52 cards in that.

253
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:27,830
Right. Forget about the jokers. You have 52 cards in total with four suits and 13 numbers for each suit.

254
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,860
Right. And a poker hand is essentially a combination of five cards.

255
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,020
You draw five cards without requirement. That's a poker.

256
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,180
Okay. So the first question, how many different programs can possibly help?

257
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,549
That's not exactly a ultrasound plane without replacement.

258
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,540
A problem right from the that it draws five cars.

259
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:05,530
We don't care about the order in Texas Hold'em. You just draw five cards and look at what you have.

260
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,850
That's a program.

261
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:18,850
And that's exactly what our sampling because we don't care about the order with our environment and using the formula that we just learned.

262
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,500
50 to choose five. Right.

263
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:38,380
Does everyone go with that number? And again, recall that base is equal to 52 factorial, divided by five factorial and 47 factorial.

264
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:46,060
That's how this number is defined. Right. And then you can do it, the mass and that number is over 2 million.

265
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,170
So you can get over 2 million different programs from a deck of cards.

266
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,260
Each one of them is different. Question number one.

267
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,760
So number two, what is the probability of four, a six in a program?

268
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,790
So in order to answer that question, we need to get two things straight.

269
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,620
First, are each poker hand have equal probability.

270
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,450
Are the polka dots have equal probability. Yes.

271
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,940
Yes. Right. Absolutely.

272
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:36,020
That's true. Right. You just randomly draw from the die, whichever faction.

273
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,610
They should have equal probability. So says they have equal probability.

274
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:48,530
You already can calculate that probability. All I need to do is to count how many poker hands contend for aces.

275
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,860
And we divide the number by the total number of poker hands.

276
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,690
Now give us the probability. All right. So all we need to do in this case.

277
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,830
So calculate how my opponent has had four aces in it.

278
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:13,310
So how do we calculate that? You got it.

279
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,030
You got the answer. Here is 48. But how does that number come?

280
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,950
What? My 48.

281
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,460
It's the Ukraine versus the jaws of war.

282
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,750
And then the 48 remains the wild card.

283
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Very good. Very good. That's exactly how we got this.

284
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,910
48. All right. We know we need to have four aces in the program.

285
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,630
And so that's already, you know, a done deal, right?

286
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:51,140
We need to have those four aces. All we can do are all we can mess around with is the last card out of this four aces.

287
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,280
We have 52 minus four remaining, 48 remaining.

288
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:05,840
So there are 48 different ways to choose. The last one I gave us the number of poker hands with four cases, and that's 48.

289
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,790
So again, as we as we said, since each pronoun has equal probability,

290
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:21,740
the probability of having four aces in a broken hand is 48 divided by the total number of hands and a very small probability, as you can imagine.

291
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,370
So the next question is what is the probability of having a fourth of a shot,

292
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:39,620
which means you have five cars, four of them are of the same suit, and the last one is not.

293
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:48,940
Of course, it's not going to be a. Sorry for has the same number and the last one have a different number.

294
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,730
So what is the probability of having poker hands in that?

295
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:04,960
In that fashion. You have the solution here?

296
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,860
48 times 13. How do we get that number?

297
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,420
Yes, we said just taking from the aces there.

298
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,440
There are 48 remaining. 48.

299
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,710
Our final part with now.

300
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,440
Okay. So it's probably easier to think about this number first.

301
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,150
Think about a Y 13, right. And then think about the 48.

302
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,420
So Y 13. Yes, there are 13.

303
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,620
Right. And so we have 30 kinds of choices.

304
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:55,300
And then after we choose or for cars that are at the same rank, we can choose from the remaining 48 cards.

305
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:03,129
All good. So the 13 is the number of it is that number of different numbers, right?

306
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:14,740
From A's to 2 to 8. So what we need to do in order to decide the number of columns is first we decide what is the time, right?

307
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,180
Whether it's four A's or for twos or for threes.

308
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,790
Or what is that for time? And that we have 13 different options.

309
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,840
That's where 13 this that's actually the first stuff.

310
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:39,160
Once we decide which third, which number we want, we draw the fall suits for that number.

311
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,350
And what do we end up with? It's just a one additional correlation to base.

312
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,700
Then similar to the reasoning before, we have 48 different options.

313
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,010
Right. So that's where this foreign aid is. So really, it's a sequential procedure.

314
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,980
First up, you need to decide what is the number and are going to form this four of a kind and then you decide what is the remaining part.

315
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:13,180
So multiply the two numbers using the fundamental theorem that we introduced last time.

316
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:19,610
This is a sequential procedure. The number of ways to get the final number is just a number of ways to get the first step.

317
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:27,440
Multiply the number of ways to get the second step. Support 48 times 30 are 13 times 48, right?

318
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,100
Yes. If you go back over again, how we got to 48.

319
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,560
Sure. So let's look at the question number two.

320
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,470
So once you face the four aces, all you have left is the remaining card, right?

321
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:51,770
That's what you can choose. And now in the original bag, you don't have the original 52 cards because you already take the four aces out.

322
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,400
What you have is 52 minus four objects, and that's 48.

323
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,650
So that's what you can choose from. And does that make sense?

324
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,379
And now the questions. All right.

325
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:15,160
So that's the number. And you do the math. You can divide it by the total number that gave you the the probability.

326
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,540
Okay. All right. This is the most challenging one.

327
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,990
So some of you may have the solution. So we my going to knows our solution.

328
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,340
But for those who don't, why don't we just do splitting groups?

329
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:36,249
And how about sure. Discussion of this one so we can discuss with our neighbors maybe three or four of you

330
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:42,490
and is positive and think about how to calculate the probability of three outcome.

331
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,250
First of all, let me define what is the three over time.

332
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:53,650
The wrong time is you'll have three cars with the same number and then the remaining two have different numbers.

333
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:04,690
For example, you're going to have a, for example, A's, A's and I don't know, ten and the three, this is called a three of a kind.

334
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,990
So. This is not a three time.

335
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:28,840
This is also not a three time and the three time must be three with the same number and two is different numbers, right?

336
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:36,100
So that's why what it's called a three. So how many cases, how many someone and how you.

337
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,550
Because you're not a patient. I'll give you 2 minutes.

338
00:39:43,120 --> 00:40:22,100
So much more discussion. This is just due to the .1100113 because you start somewhere and you just get your first three people.

339
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:30,690
That's still a 52 to 1.

340
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:42,730
That argument has not produced Make Your Challenge Since 2018.

341
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:52,149
This is Michel Martin.

342
00:40:52,150 --> 00:41:08,030
And this is a real one. Yes, it's 13 or just 15 stock for 48, 15 seconds.

343
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,010
Next step.

344
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,580
So how are you going to account for all of this?

345
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,190
Because it's the same words for an average.

346
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:42,770
This one person's performance is equal to anything except space.

347
00:41:45,700 --> 00:42:02,960
To use this word that you're trying to construct right now.

348
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:11,360
And you want to give us one.

349
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:20,730
Okay. You can try it. Yes. It's £13 for three times.

350
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,100
13 times four, which was three or two or three times 48.

351
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,880
48 times 44 and 24 divided by two divided by two.

352
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,860
That's the numerator. And yeah.

353
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,290
So the denominator that's part of 52 is fine.

354
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,850
So anyone small or a same answer or a different answer?

355
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:04,740
Choose a different answer, yes or no.

356
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,730
Okay. So let's take a look at this answer and say whether that's correct.

357
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,420
So does anyone care to explain why 13.

358
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,680
Because this can't be excused. Yes, that's just the number would be very good.

359
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,690
That's the number of times we can possible it. Right. So that's the first step.

360
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,030
Again, the order to calculate this number, you break it down into different steps.

361
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,920
Always make it a sequential procedure so you can do the multiplication.

362
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:41,100
Not always make that easier. So the very first step, you need to decide what is the time.

363
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,880
You have 13 different options. Okay.

364
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,309
Okay. So that's where 13 this. And what about 4 to 3?

365
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:54,630
Where does that number come from? Three positions can be the same number.

366
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,220
Very good. So you have four sweets for six.

367
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:05,970
Right. You only need three out of them to make this three all the time.

368
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,590
To which three? There are 4 to 3 different options.

369
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:18,360
That's exactly that small sop. Problem is order sampling without replacement problem.

370
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,990
Right. You need to choose three from this four different series.

371
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,370
So that's why you have this four, two, three of five.

372
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,670
One. Good. What about this? 48 inches.

373
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,339
Why not 49? Why not 52?

374
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,600
Minus three out of 48? Yes.

375
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,800
Because you're not allowed to pick up the fourth of those.

376
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:55,340
Exactly. Very good ones. You you decide you are a con.

377
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,420
You cannot choose from any of that content anymore.

378
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,980
So that's why you need to take four out of that, not just three.

379
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,800
Otherwise, you may end up with something like this that's not called a three cut.

380
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:14,510
So that's why you have to have 52 minus four as you are not stuck.

381
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,250
Okay. And what about the 44 similarly?

382
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,440
Right. Once you you choose the first non-travel economy card,

383
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:34,880
you need to choose another one and the other one cannot be either in that three on the con or the first the non cards that you picked.

384
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:42,440
So that's another four cards out of the numbers. So 44 and finally y divided by two.

385
00:45:49,140 --> 00:46:00,270
Because Biryani two divided by two divide this whole product by taste because the last two can be in either order.

386
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:06,060
You could switch to fermentation. All right. Very good. That's a permutation we need to take into account.

387
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,969
The remaining two cards, you can first take ten and then pick out three already.

388
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,030
Come first, pick a three and then pick.

389
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,810
Okay. And if you know that if the series are the same, then they are essentially the same hand.

390
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,310
So for each combination, you have this to read on it.

391
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,060
So that's why you need to divide it by two questions.

392
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:45,300
I'm confused why you don't have to consider the permutations of like choosing, say, the King and three before the the Triple X set up again.

393
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:53,760
Like, why don't you have to consider the permutations where on the triple H, the triple A's come after the king in three?

394
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,960
So this permutation is for all four, all of the cards.

395
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,610
And since you can only permit, you can on the three the three on the card,

396
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:12,360
because there's no permutation to perform because the three of Okinawa already can wait three out of the four.

397
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:18,660
So there is no permutation. Now make sense.

398
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,500
So the other words that's making a change here.

399
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,949
So these numbers.

400
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:32,819
Right. They give you if you forget about this denominator to this 13 times far,

401
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:42,930
two or three times 48 times 44 just gave you all the components that ten, ten, three all the time and to all different kinds.

402
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:52,559
Okay. All right. And what you can actually promote is the order of the two, not in the throughout the time the other cards.

403
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,150
You cannot promote it. There's no permutation because you are right.

404
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:04,380
And taken into account. They are the exact three suits from which three suits from these forces.

405
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,670
Okay. So the only thing that can be pursued is the remaining two.

406
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,200
So that's why you divide it just by two digits.

407
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,550
I thought we were talking about an ordered sample. Yes, I'll order something.

408
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,220
Why are we talking about permutation? So recall that.

409
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,410
So let me go back to this example to explain.

410
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:35,660
So although we are talking about our sampling and a one way to calculate the number of especially if you think about the procedure,

411
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,540
right, the steps of how we got this program, the actually intrinsic order in it.

412
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,220
We need to decide the first card first and then the second card.

413
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,400
But actually, that order doesn't matter. So that's why we need to divide a permutation of those two.

414
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:00,440
So it's exactly the same assets as in this simple example article question.

415
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,570
And the other questions are, we got this number. So this is very good.

416
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,850
This is a number of three of a kind.

417
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,940
Okay. Any other questions? How we got here?

418
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,030
All right. So after class, you can think about other possibilities.

419
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,840
There are all kinds of programs like floors straight.

420
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:34,070
You can all calculate. You can calculate all of their probabilities using the same idea.

421
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,659
Just again, the assets is really the key,

422
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:50,310
is to think about the procedure and try to break it down into a sequential procedure and then decide what is the number for each step and.

423
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:03,720
So why don't we take a break now and come back to you?

424
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:42,170
So this is the people, while it's going to happen is really scary for the people who are saying it's just another room.

425
00:50:49,720 --> 00:51:06,610
It just gives us some time.

426
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:59,890
After a first 66110 defeat against the time is right.

427
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,500
Well, that puts you on your phone.

428
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,930
It's like, oh, my gosh.

429
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,550
Yeah, I know.

430
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,190
We'll see what happens here.

431
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:36,430
The nail biting, whatever. We're just trying to tell you.

432
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:44,950
Why is it not? I see what you're saying.

433
00:52:44,950 --> 00:53:09,960
Where it's important to consider this stuff.

434
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:20,080
I don't know how we're so familiar with that.

435
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,380
Yeah, I know.

436
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:32,410
No matter how many, no one wants to know all the time.

437
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,670
I come back to that.

438
00:53:36,730 --> 00:54:00,810
What I think is right to you think, you know, I remain to find a safe space.

439
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:51,940
You say you don't have to really go hard because there are a lot of you need to have people really true stories like this.

440
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:03,510
You know. Oh, come on.

441
00:55:04,510 --> 00:56:15,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

442
00:56:15,490 --> 00:57:00,580
You usually teenage boys are doing what is right along with all of this.

443
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:40,290
So this is not something that I like to do.

444
00:57:40,350 --> 00:58:05,370
It becomes the way it does counterproductive to do so, which is exactly what it was.

445
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,130
That's good. That's good. I like schools.

446
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,890
Yes, I do.

447
00:58:28,000 --> 00:59:06,940
Yes, I can tell you, it was just like teachers are no longer questions.

448
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:12,580
We actually have our problems and practice problems.

449
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:20,500
So you all need to submit a common cause of our practice problems and just do it offline.

450
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:28,890
So there are solutions you can easily find online for the school and you don't have to submit

451
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:36,550
even if you submit the here what we need to work on the homework problems that some might write.

452
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,630
And also there is no recitation session tomorrow.

453
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,139
We're going to start from next Friday of the next Friday.

454
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:52,330
Going to be the first one. And I'm thinking about talking about a very interesting paradox for the first part.

455
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:58,120
The patient is also calculating the probabilities are a very interesting problem.

456
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,380
I encourage everyone to come, if you can.

457
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:13,900
All right. So let's continue with some useful results from this order.

458
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:22,960
I'll hold our sampling with our equipment, especially these entries and choose are entries end of operation.

459
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:27,520
So suppose topline is a positive integer.

460
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,410
The first result is called the binomial theorem.

461
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:43,210
So that is. A plus B to the poverty of capital and can be expressed as the right answer.

462
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:52,370
Okay. So it's a sum of all of them plus one, all of these.

463
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,380
Each one has a on a nominal term,

464
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:10,729
the total power is capital n and with the coefficient that is capital into smaller become very, very rigorous like progress.

465
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:19,340
But conceptually, to see why this is true, you can think about it as our sampling with our replacement problem.

466
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,899
One side is a club B to the power of energy.

467
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:33,220
Essentially, it's a multiplication. It's a it's a product of capital items, each being a class B.

468
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:44,830
Right. In order to calculate it, you just need to pay for each parenthesis, whether it's A or a type B, so you can break down the this product.

469
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,120
And this polynomial is essentially what you end up with for each breakdown.

470
01:01:53,990 --> 01:02:05,720
You can choose small an A from this capital in parenthesis and the remaining take B and this small urn can be from zero all the way to a capital.

471
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:15,050
And what we need to decide is what is the coefficient of problem in particular for a fixed small head?

472
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:21,190
How many ways you can choose small in a out of this capital in parentheses?

473
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:31,190
That's interest small. Right? That's exactly a I'm at some point without a replacement problem.

474
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:44,120
So that's why you have base as coefficient and you solve over small N from zero to capital and you got the same number as the left hand side.

475
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:52,430
So these is called the binomial theorem by any polynomial, always expanded using this formula.

476
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,610
And and a couple of the special cases which make it even more interesting is the following first.

477
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:05,330
If a plus B is equal to one, then we can easily show that the left hand side is always on what right?

478
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:11,600
On the right hand side can be written as this the sum of small and goes from zero to end

479
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:17,719
and shows small n a to the power of a and one minus eight to the power of a minus small,

480
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:27,770
and is always equal to one. Later on we will say that Bayes actually is a very handy equation or equality that

481
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:34,370
we can use when we when we derive the density function or some distributions.

482
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:45,020
Right. The particular order this is this is corresponding to the beta distribution and some other discrete distributions.

483
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:54,950
These always holds for any a from 0 to 1 or any number A from 0 to 1.

484
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:59,960
If you calculate this number, it's always equivalent. Okay.

485
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,900
So that's one special case. Another special case.

486
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:09,560
If you said A and B policy for one, then the left hand side is two to the power couple and the right hand side.

487
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:16,910
You don't have to worry about this polynomial term, right? That's just going to be the sum of this and truth and calculations.

488
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:30,110
That's also a very useful equality to keep in mind the sum of this entrance and is two to the power of that.

489
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:40,760
So mathematically you say where it comes from, right? It directly comes from the special case of this binomial theorem conceptually.

490
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,630
It also has a very, very nice interpretation.

491
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:54,680
So the left hand side, if you think about it, it's a summation of and shows small capital is the number of items we have.

492
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:01,280
Right? Smaller is the number of draws that we draw from that and items without replacement.

493
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,860
So if you count the total number of drawings, there are items like item two items, three items all the way to all items.

494
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:20,030
What does that mean? That's essentially all subsets from this superset of items.

495
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:26,150
Right. The Catholic Church was zero. Is a null set.

496
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:32,330
The number of null which is one that the one true is one is the number of sad with only one out of it.

497
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:40,160
Catalan shows two is a number of subset with two elements and all the way to the end.

498
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:48,110
Kathleen chose capital n is the number of false that which again is also once if you want some them all up.

499
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:55,440
That's the number of all possible subsets from this set with a nice.

500
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:04,650
Okay. So the left hand side is exactly how we calculate the number of subsets for a set with incidence.

501
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:09,430
And now we know that is equal to this to to the power of that.

502
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:18,740
And the reason for that, again, you can think about how we can choose how we can construct a subset from this section.

503
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,080
Basically, for each item, there is only two options.

504
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:33,520
Right. She can also consider this as a as a harder sampling where the replacement problem right for each item.

505
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,280
You can choose from two options. Either you pick it, put it in your subset or not.

506
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:50,620
So there are two options, right? You do it for all and items that give you two to the power for each decision.

507
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:58,090
For each sequence, you get a unique subset. So that's why the left side is equal to the right hand side.

508
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:03,340
It's just two different ways of counting how many subsets this particular set has.

509
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,960
One way you got on the left hand side. The other way you've got the right hand side.

510
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:24,440
It makes sense. The questions. All right.

511
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:32,200
So then that's we're going to take a look at this, this example,

512
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,480
which sort of mimics the previous example that we talk about, the orange, bananas and apples.

513
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:47,260
Example, I called it a sign. I ordered a sampling because we do care about the order, but not entirely.

514
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:56,860
So assigning is like suppose we have two sets of objects, A and B, so he has small objects and B has small being objects.

515
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:03,550
And with each set the objects are identical, so they do not differentiate from one another.

516
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:09,850
So the question is how many different distinct arrangements can be made.

517
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,960
Some point all this A plus B items without replacement.

518
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:21,280
So here typically we say arrangement. Very often it means we care about the owner.

519
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,300
Right. You can think about putting them in a role. We care about the owner.

520
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:31,000
So when we well, when we say arrangement and typically it means order matters.

521
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:41,530
So the question is, if we choose, if we if we want to place all these items in a row, how many different ways can we do it?

522
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:49,900
The tricky part is that the the objects are identical and the B objects are identical.

523
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:56,620
So same as before. That can be great down into two steps.

524
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:03,280
First, we find information, right? A permutation of all the items which gave us a plus.

525
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:09,520
B, I tell you right. That we need to take out all the redundancies.

526
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:14,319
Redundancies? I mean, since it is a objects, they are identical.

527
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:23,860
So you can promote they once you have an arrangement, become commute the objects without actually change this particular arrangement.

528
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:31,960
Right. And the total number of fermentation you can do for the eight objects is eight factorial.

529
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:40,270
That's the numbers that you need to divide. And also similar to all the B objects, you need to divide the permutations as well.

530
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:51,640
So that is the redundancy. Once you divide as a factorial and p factorial, that's the total number of arrangements that you have for this problem.

531
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:58,570
So that's why I call it a sigh, my order, because we don't care about the order within each category.

532
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:02,050
What do we care about the order in total? All right.

533
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:18,680
And what is this? What is this number? As exactly.

534
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:31,970
This right is exactly A-plus. Beach was a 20 plus beaches.

535
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:45,020
Why is that? And we could just touch the lives of the homeless and then the rest of the team.

536
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:53,400
We would definitely be very good. So that's an alternative way of deciding how many arrangements coming out.

537
01:10:53,760 --> 01:11:00,740
Right. Everyone are clear about how we decided it was in the conventional way, in a traditional way.

538
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,190
And that's a, you know, to stop procedure.

539
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:12,620
Now, let's talk about the alternative way, which is motivated by this this equivalence, because think about you have this A plus B locations.

540
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:20,750
All right. So all we need to do is to pick A locations to place this items.

541
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:29,120
And once the items are placed, the remaining bounty boxes and we just put B that give us one arrangement,

542
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:37,940
then it explains why the number of arrangement is essentially eight plus.

543
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:47,120
Beach was eight or eight plus beach was B because all we need to do is to decide the number of arrangements is to decide how many different ways

544
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:58,640
to choose this allocations of items the identical so we don't care which one goes with goes where we all care about which locations are four A's,

545
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:04,400
which locations are of these. So that's why these two are equivalent.

546
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:10,280
They both gave us the number of arrangements for these eight plus B items.

547
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,740
Six. Questions.

548
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:27,800
Right. So that's what I just explained.

549
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:31,040
So now consider the example.

550
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:34,580
Assume a child is making out that close was ten, right?

551
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:39,050
These five Black B's, eight white B's and five friends.

552
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:53,860
How many different necklaces can be made? I like this.

553
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:05,370
In two ways. Anyone?

554
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:19,790
Yes. So 28 factorial over ten factorial times five factorial times eight factorial times five factorial.

555
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,550
Hey, very good. Does everyone agree?

556
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:37,350
Well, I would say it depends. Okay. So it depends on whether we care about where it starts.

557
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:45,750
And so if as a round backwards without a opponent, for example, then this is not true.

558
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:53,100
If it's a not place where a pattern with a pennant, in other words, you know, which is the first beat,

559
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,390
then this is a correct number, but let's assume it's a rather innocuous without a pennant because start anywhere.

560
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:06,300
Now, how do you modify this? Yes. 27 factorial instead of very good divided by 28.

561
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,950
Right. It has a round not close without a pennant and just divided 28.

562
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,750
That's a redundant redundancy. Very good.

563
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:21,580
So this is a one way to calculate it. Since.

564
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,240
Just assume they're a dependent. Okay. So just for simplicity.

565
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:43,450
So this is one way. What about the other way? We just talk about how to calculate the same number that you want.

566
01:14:48,620 --> 01:15:01,610
Yes we do like I guess it's not Brown 2020 age two is what and and.

567
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:08,910
Which is the next one? Like 18 inches, five inches five.

568
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,980
30 inches eight. Very good.

569
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,140
That's an alternative way to do it.

570
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:26,970
And so the reason is exactly as the before the auto to decide how many how many different arrangements and how for this round naturalist.

571
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:37,650
First you need to decide out of this 28 locations which ten when we put the rabbits that gave you 28 choose ten.

572
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:44,060
Okay. Next we need to decide which of the remaining 818 locations we want.

573
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:47,520
Put the five black beans that 18 choose five.

574
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,840
And finally, the remaining 13 locations. We need to choose which locations we want to place the white beans.

575
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:04,379
So that's the 13 to. And once this red, white and white bays are placed, there's only five locations remaining.

576
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:09,300
So we don't have to, you know, multiply any additional number if you want.

577
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:19,169
And right across five, which is one that I can place a number and you can after course you can show that this to

578
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:25,680
our assay equivalent by just plugging in the popular spot and choosing to calculate it.

579
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:33,610
Any question? All right.

580
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:48,010
Next look at this classic ensemble and problem, which is a little bit complicated, but not so much so.

581
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:57,700
Consider the case. This is a very, very common setting in a lot of experimental design.

582
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:01,479
So it's simplified as the following example.

583
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:10,840
Assume that you have an R contains capital N and capital M are white, and the remaining capital is minus capital.

584
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:19,240
All right, so suppose you draw a sample small out of this urn without replacement.

585
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:35,000
And you'll find out that there are actually a number of light bulbs in your sample is a small house and a number of radicals is small N minus house.

586
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:39,120
So that's the experiment that we do.

587
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:46,380
So if you if you think about this experiment, there are three numbers that are predefined and one number that can be random.

588
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:52,430
So the three numbers that are predefined is that the total number of balls in the arm, right?

589
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:58,110
That's predefined and the number of life balls is also predefined.

590
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,670
And so we know exactly how many how many is in.

591
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:08,640
Okay. And the number of samples that I want to draw is also predefined.

592
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,850
Before the experiment, you already know how many samples.

593
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:26,600
The only thing that's random, that's different from life out into another experiment is this the smallest burn?

594
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:34,050
If you if you come up with experiments, you may get one white ball and minus one Red Bull.

595
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:39,270
You do it again. You got five white balls and minus five radicals.

596
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:43,140
So every time it could be different. All right.

597
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:53,069
And also, you can say that once this small, as is determined in this two by two table of sampled balls,

598
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:57,330
remaining balls, white versus red, all of the other entries are going to be fixed.

599
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:04,000
So the only thing that's random in this two by two table is this smallness.

600
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,470
But that's the first memory that this small has.

601
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:15,030
It's a random meaning from one experiment to another.

602
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:18,850
And it can be different. Can be any number, of course.

603
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:23,010
No. Right. It has to be. Certain numbers.

604
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,760
So what is the bone of this small house?

605
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:34,780
And so what are the restrictions for this, Miles?

606
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:41,200
Again, the these numbers are fixed. This numbers in the circles, they are fixed.

607
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:47,739
So what is the balance for the spies? Well, let me give you 2 minutes.

608
01:19:47,740 --> 01:20:14,950
Just have a short discussion and let me know the result from this one, because they are all possibilities and consider what can be done here.

609
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:35,450
It could be everything you know now because it looks like you could just get sort of an idea of what you're saying.

610
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:50,140
So it's important. 002 precisely because it would be impossible to do this.

611
01:20:54,200 --> 01:21:04,090
Is going to be just how many of you girls want to be against us?

612
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:13,180
And if that's hard to compute, zero, because we have no idea what the distribution is because we cannot give a shot.

613
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:25,090
So we want to speak louder and a little more and little.

614
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:44,290
And another little upper body or lower but upper bound, aka bounded by the minimum of the other way around a little and a big human being.

615
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:50,080
And anything else greater than or equal to zero.

616
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:57,330
We are equal to 100. And else.

617
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:04,729
But you all agree? Yes. So that should be the maximum of zero.

618
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:11,200
And the again, plus and minus, you can break us.

619
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:27,830
All right. So again, class, smart and minus began by being asked, how did you find answers?

620
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:34,820
I can't read what you wrote there. What is that?

621
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:42,130
Maps of the center.

622
01:22:48,730 --> 01:23:04,650
The. So this is correct.

623
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,510
Okay. Very good. And now let's take a look at why that's the case.

624
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:20,459
So in order to decide the limits or these are the boundaries for this small artist, I need to consider all scenarios.

625
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:25,560
Right. First of all, we know us must be smaller than this.

626
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,640
Small and and a smaller than this cap go out.

627
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:37,410
Right. Because it's a it's a sample. So it cannot exceed the total number of samples or a total number of life.

628
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:44,670
So that is why we have as that's how you could earn plastic quota.

629
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:53,850
And of course, as should always be greater zero. But there's something that we also have to do the same.

630
01:23:54,230 --> 01:24:04,650
Well, there's an excess because in minus as is also has a restriction, a minus as is a number of red in this sample.

631
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:12,540
It has to be plus or equal to the total number of grand balls.

632
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:23,040
Right. And also, of course, minus is also has to be equal to this small N, but that is the same as same as X, greater or equal to zero.

633
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:29,250
All right. So if you put everything together, you want to know with these limits.

634
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:41,610
All right. Very good. So next the next question is what how many ways to draw as white?

635
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,630
And so assume that we do a experiment.

636
01:24:50,180 --> 01:25:02,890
So let's assume that we actually conduct the experiment and we find that we end up with wide balls in our small samples.

637
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:09,620
How many ways can we draw this as wide samples as white balls?

638
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:40,180
The question is. So like if we take a sample size for simplicity, it allows us to assume this capital and the capital M are both large.

639
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:46,210
And the other words the samples does not really cause the boundaries.

640
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:53,710
So I say it's just the sum number, some fixed number that is far away from the boundary.

641
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:58,000
You have a lot of balls. You have a lot of line, a lot of pride.

642
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:05,230
You only take a very small sample. They don't really need to worry about the boundaries.

643
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:14,560
And and repeat the question again. So, first of all, let's assume when you have a large capital and large capital out.

644
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:18,849
All right. And now you take that.

645
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:24,720
You you do this experiment. You draw this small embolus from this time.

646
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:31,180
So how many ways I would draw the balls so that you have as wide an A-minus as.

647
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:45,940
Right. Let's assume all the wide balls and roundabouts they are distinct, so each draw an equal probability.

648
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:52,510
So that's the same. All the white balls are distinct.

649
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,230
Random balls are distinct. How many ways can withdrawal?

650
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:03,730
I got a sample. Small and balls with as wide and minus as right.

651
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:25,130
The answer is. White on each red one is distinct.

652
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,050
That's exactly what want.

653
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,260
That's true. That's true.

654
01:27:43,800 --> 01:28:05,040
That's more as point and plot and times truths and violence as through experience, more as from the violence through them.

655
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:09,060
And conferences should speak and contribute.

656
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:20,670
Very good. So the way to sample this to to can ask why both from this and draws again you

657
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,870
can break it down to a sequential procedure in order to calculate that number.

658
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:36,000
So if you want to draw if you draw and both and you want to count how many how many cases, how many scenarios would that be as white balls?

659
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:40,050
Let's consider how you actually draw the balls.

660
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,340
So you have as wide as. Right.

661
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:49,290
Okay. You want to have a draw that weighs as wide and not a size.

662
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:56,100
You can do it in two steps first. You draw as wide from the total line.

663
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:07,180
Right? Because that's what you want. You want small as white to just draw it so that you can choose.

664
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:14,010
I'm sure that's different ways to do it. As I said, the White House, they are distinct.

665
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,750
The red of this thing. So this is a number of ways to draw it.

666
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,800
And then the second step is to draw the red dots.

667
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:29,440
All right. And that you choose from minus some. Choose.

668
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:35,459
Samoan finance. That's an important point.

669
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:43,020
As to the other, that gave you the number of ways to have asked my boss in Angel's account,

670
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:51,390
this number may only holds if you have a large and large so that this, as an A-minus, has to now go out of bounds.

671
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:57,330
Otherwise you may run into problems. So the boundary, you have to be a little bit careful.

672
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:06,430
I practice when I whenever we use this actually it always hose that and I am typically pretty beat, right.

673
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:13,380
So our samples are typically relatively small, so we don't really running two issues on the boundaries.

674
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:22,559
But this is what you can get. And if we want to cap the probability of drawing out of this and draws,

675
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:31,740
you have asked why you just divide this number by the total number of ways to draw in balls from this capital policy.

676
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:43,350
If you divide this number by this type of interest and essentially you got the probability of having asked like yours.

677
01:30:50,450 --> 01:31:05,829
And question. So if.

678
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:16,390
No question. Let me ask you a question. So. He honor to calculate the probability of having acquired in this end draws.

679
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,460
We made assumption that the rat balls are this thing.

680
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,150
The y two balls are this. Why do we need to make that assumption?

681
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:39,010
What is that assumption for? What if you don't have that assumption?

682
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:49,050
Some. Could you repeat the question?

683
01:31:50,010 --> 01:32:01,080
So when we calculate the probability of having housewives and draws right, we calculate the number of first divided by the total number of draws.

684
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:07,070
But we make assumption in the beginning that is all the random balls are disc.

685
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:11,100
All the white balls are this. Why do we make that assumption?

686
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:20,690
Yes. Because it allows her to nominate her just out of order.

687
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:30,920
Parts know that may sound like she was a little bit of having to multiply by another coefficient of count for double counting.

688
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,840
It's getting close. Not exactly. That's right.

689
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:45,850
Any other thoughts? Think about how we calculate the probability.

690
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:51,910
Right. If you want to use counting to calculate probability, what do you need?

691
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:03,290
You call probability right in this scenario to have the same probability.

692
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:07,760
That's really the foundation of using counting to calculate probability.

693
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:16,300
If your scenarios do not have equal probability, there is no point of doing comedy right.

694
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:22,880
If one scenario, one draw does not have the same probability with another draw, there is no point of doing counting.

695
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:28,160
You cannot use calculate the relative frequency to gather your probability.

696
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:36,050
So you are to have equal probability. You need to make the assumption that the white balls are distinct, that red balls are distinct,

697
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:48,740
so that you can calculate the number of draws or the number of ways to draw this as white balls and minus as radicals.

698
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,590
And if the rebels win both, they're identical, then the numbers are going to be different.

699
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:02,310
And those drawings would not have equal probability.

700
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,500
So that's why we need to make that assumption, so that the probability actually makes sense.

701
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:17,910
So think about it. And it may seem a little mind boggling in the in the beginning, but if you actually think about it.

702
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:22,829
All this boils down to we need to use the frequency to calculate the probability and the

703
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:28,710
order to use about a frequency and need to make sure the scenarios have equal probability.

704
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,589
That's where everything. All right.

705
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:40,550
So let's take a look at how this is used in practice. Assume there are two therapies that are tested on patients.

706
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:44,180
The outcome is either success or failure.

707
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:54,500
So 38 achieve our successes from having patients and therapy be achieved and modest successes and modest patients.

708
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:59,520
Suppose A is a new drug and B is a placebo.

709
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,900
And we want to see whether it is effective or not.

710
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:09,380
Right. So we can do this experiment by collecting patients in total.

711
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:17,370
Assigned to treatment and treatment be okay.

712
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:28,740
So these numbers are all predefined and we let them take the drug and see how many actually succeed, how many failed.

713
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,370
So the number of successes is small and this is also fixed at the end of the study.

714
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:40,580
What's random, what's now known is what is the number of successes in treatment.

715
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:45,650
Okay, so exactly the same story of the at the arm problem.

716
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:58,830
So now the question is. Let's see if this US take a particular variant, for example, to under the assumption that A is not a factor.

717
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:14,150
What is the probability as taken by a two? So this assumption, eh,

718
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:26,330
is not in fact it essentially means you have for these successes of its own success is it had for

719
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:33,090
every patient taken drug or taken drug be they have the same probability of having successes.

720
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,350
There is no difference between drug and dropping. All right.

721
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:43,990
So that's assumption. And under that assumption, essentially it boils down to that arm problem.

722
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:52,840
The kind of arm problem is time to draw a ball either to redball or a light bulb.

723
01:36:53,110 --> 01:37:00,960
They have the same probability of being drawn. There is no difference between white or red when you draw the ball.

724
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:08,790
Same here. If a does not is not effective, then A is some extent equivalent to beat.

725
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:18,510
So in terms of the success rate A, the same has been done in order to calculate the probability of as equal to two.

726
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,380
That exactly is what we did in the previous slide.

727
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:27,720
All right. We just need to count how many cases we can actually draw.

728
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:37,710
Two successes from treatment eight and minus two is excessive from treatment B out of all possible drawdowns.

729
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:43,980
So that will be. Asian.

730
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:52,760
And choose two times and choose.

731
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:58,200
Small and minus two divided by this.

732
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:04,720
And you choose that. Right.

733
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:12,670
Exactly the same as the previous arm problem. And that is under the assumption it is not effective.

734
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,170
It is effective then this is not true again.

735
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:22,600
So the same reason it is in fact, that is not going to be called probability.

736
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,470
You cannot use the context of calculate the probability anymore.

737
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:37,480
Right. And that actually is used in casting the hypothesis of whether A is active or not, because we know as a fact.

738
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:44,440
If A is not a factor, we can exactly calculate the probability of us taking antibiotic use of this procedure.

739
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:55,090
If the actual probability deviates from what we calculated, then we sort of have a strong evidence that our null hypothesis is not true.

740
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:04,030
That's how people use this type of experiment to test whether you're putting out a drug is effective or not.

741
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:10,060
We're going to talk more about it when we talk about this liquid distribution's,

742
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:16,630
in particular these as Mirabelle follows a so-called hyper geometric distribution.

743
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:26,010
So we'll talk about more about it later. Questions.

744
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:35,200
All right. So last my last cover, this ultrasound point, where's the replacement?

745
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:40,960
That's a loss scenario. We don't have our daughter and we do a replacement.

746
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,860
This is kind of a last common scenario.

747
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:50,500
It's the last freeflying car in process and much more complicated to calculate.

748
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,910
So everyone got wise.

749
01:39:55,180 --> 01:40:00,669
Last comment. Think about the experiments.

750
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:03,940
So let me give you a context. Think about it.

751
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:10,630
Toss a coin. And multiple times, let's say five times, what we want to do is to count how many?

752
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:14,500
Let's say we care about two halves and the three tails.

753
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:19,240
You want to say how many? How many times you got? Two has and three chaos.

754
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:24,650
So that's exactly this that allowed our sampling.

755
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:30,400
Whereas replacement you do five experiment right?

756
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:37,720
Each have two outcomes at our table and each time is a with replacement because we always have this two options.

757
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:48,670
You don't care about the order of this. Out of this five causes I care about is how many cases you got to has three things.

758
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:59,120
So why this is a last common scenario. Again.

759
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,740
Think about why we need counting.

760
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:12,110
The accountant because we want to calculate probability and we calculate probability using counting only if they have equal probabilities.

761
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,330
But in this case, you won't have equal probabilities.

762
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:25,979
All right. So let me give you the. Just consider a temporary sample.

763
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:29,010
Three houses. Okay. So you have three houses.

764
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:47,740
And essentially that's our sampling, whereas replacement and is equal to three R is equal to two or three out in parallel.

765
01:41:55,890 --> 01:42:03,630
So there's a number of options or items and there is a number of draws.

766
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:12,780
And so if you toss the coin three times, essentially each time you have two options at our table and you're doing it three times.

767
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:18,390
So the question is, what is the number of outcomes?

768
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:31,110
Without considering the order. All right.

769
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:44,110
So if you consider all possible outcomes, altered outcomes, your sample space going to be at occurred at how had a.

770
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:51,110
And they'll take and fill an ad.

771
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:58,010
Hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail.

772
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,500
So this is your assemble space. If you care about our right.

773
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:06,770
So previously we have talked about if you care about order.

774
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:14,480
These are all positive outcomes and each outcome have equal probability because you do the experiment.

775
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:23,390
Sequential write is how we have equal probability. So that's why for each particular outcome, you can calculate the probability being one.

776
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:39,490
But now if you think about if you don't care about the order than the unique scenarios and we had had had had tell tale and tell tale,

777
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:49,090
which is four, and that's the number of possible outcomes for this experiment without considering order.

778
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:54,260
But if you look at these four outcomes, they do not have equal probability,

779
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:01,820
apparently had had had only have one ace of a chance but had tail had until had a tail.

780
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:08,800
Both have higher probabilities and they should have a three out of it,

781
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:15,890
three out of the three A's probabilities that they do not have equal probabilities.

782
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:26,030
That also explains why this sort of why this number doesn't really is not that useful in practice because it doesn't really help us,

783
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:31,490
you know, calculating the probability. So that's why it's the last comment I use.

784
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:37,130
But anyway, we can still calculate how many possible outcomes or how many possible arrangements

785
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:45,380
coming out of choosing R from end without considering the right ways replacement.

786
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:54,520
So one naive thought is and that's how real divided and two the power of our divided are factorial.

787
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:02,970
Right. The numerator is the. Number of options.

788
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:07,680
And you do the experiment are times is and you choose from an item.

789
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:13,800
So that's the numerator divided by the permutation of our items.

790
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:18,810
But that's not correct. And why is that?

791
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:30,790
Why does not run? They say the question.

792
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:42,160
So we want to calculate how many different arrangements, how many different outcomes can we have if we do it on our sampling?

793
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:45,820
Where is the replacement from this and items?

794
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:50,500
We do all our sampling, our times. Where's the replacement?

795
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:55,810
We want to know how many different outcomes can we help? Why is not this number?

796
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,650
Why not until the power are divided by the permutation?

797
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:19,880
Any thoughts? Assets. Yeah, because I start that way because it's assuming each element is the same.

798
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:23,340
So we don't care about order. Yes.

799
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:32,240
Because we do not always need permutation or each help if the outcome.

800
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:37,620
If the item that I choose are actually the same, we do not need permutation.

801
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:46,850
Right? Think about this coin tossing example for HHS or had had had not uniformity.

802
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:53,430
There is no redundancy. You have one outcome in the order sequence.

803
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:58,050
You also have one outcome in this order segments.

804
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:05,370
That's why you can now simply just divide into the power bar by our editorial.

805
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:15,060
Right. You need to do it more in a more rigorous way.

806
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:19,610
And it turns out the answer is plus or minus one chooser.

807
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:25,020
This is a number. And for example, this and equal to two are equal to three.

808
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:33,630
That's going to be four. Choose three, which is four, which is exactly what we see in this example.

809
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:43,770
That's the number of combinations. And I'll leave it, as you know, some food for thought and think about why that's the number.

810
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:51,140
How we actually got that number. So you can you can you can think about it.

811
01:47:51,150 --> 01:48:04,020
And that actually is a very famous matter called Stars and various Hours and Bars method, also called a phallus mapper.

812
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:11,820
And so you can search online and see how they actually got this number.

813
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:22,380
So again, as a short summary, we have we have discussed four different accounting procedures.

814
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:28,010
One is order. With replacement.

815
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:35,510
I assume that we have an items. And we have our tools.

816
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:40,280
And so how many different outcomes can you possibly have?

817
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:47,560
And if we do all our sampling with replacement, that number is much.

818
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:58,690
And too they are afraid to order some point without replacement.

819
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:04,530
Factorial divided by one minus r battery.

820
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:15,410
Right. And if we do all our sampling with replacement, that's a number that we just say.

821
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:27,090
And plus our minus one shoes are. And finally, they do all or some point without replacement.

822
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:41,350
That's just. And shoes are. But in practice, the real problems may be a combination of all these different, different numbers,

823
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:48,830
but you just need to think about the actual process, the sequential procedure of how you got there.

824
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:58,690
Okay. And also, if you want to use this county to help you calculate probability, I always make sure to check whether each outcome.

825
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,472
How do you call? Probably.
