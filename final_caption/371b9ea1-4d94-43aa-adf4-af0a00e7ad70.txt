1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:19,290
Three people have inspired me and hopefully. And of course, like everything like everything updated apparently on this computer last night.

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:27,730
So everything is, you know, taking a little a little bit longer to get started up and over.

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,080
It's not working. So, you know.

4
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:50,720
Great. All right, we're ready to get going.

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:03,209
So. I believe, if I remember correctly, we just finished talking about risk versus rates, is that correct?

6
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,480
And we hadn't yet started in on prevalence. Okay.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:15,470
Thank you. I will get there in a second.

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,230
Should have done that from the other side. All right.

9
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay. So this is where we are. So we talk about basic concepts.

10
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,540
We talk about incidents, right? We talked about cumulative incidents, which is risk.

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,330
And then we we are now at prevalence. All right.

12
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:43,500
So prevalence is a measure of existing cases in a population at a given time or it can be over a time period.

13
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:54,930
So number of cases divided by the number of persons in the population, it's going to be a proportion, but it ranges from 0 to 1.

14
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,679
It's important to remember, you know, you should just understand that it is.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,440
But like you would be very surprised how, how often I get things that say like, oh, the prevalence was and then it's not number from 0 to 1, right.

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,840
You know, but it's also not a percent the way they're expressing it.

17
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,030
You're like, that really can't be right. It should be either a percent or B should be a number between zero and one.

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,059
So that's why I put this up explicitly.

19
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,290
Even though you might feel like it should be really obvious sometimes when you get caught up in the moment of like calculating these things,

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,730
the really obvious things are not what you're what you're thinking about when you're checking them.

21
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,180
So anyways, there you go. It's dimensionless, right?

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,810
Because it's persons over persons and you can also calculate a prevalence odds which is going to be P that's the proportion.

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:55,560
So surely I should put it this little V there, but the proportions divided by one minus the proportion right in the population.

24
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,579
So one, one note and I meant to check this,

25
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:07,920
this morning and I did not succeed in doing that with everything else going on slow, at least in the older versions.

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,540
And I'm not I need to check the very newest version. He calls this a rate of prevalence rate.

27
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:20,380
Right? Not a rate. Okay. So there you go.

28
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,820
So one thing about prevalence, too, is that kind of assumes constant over time, you know, steady state conditions.

29
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,500
So we've got two different types of prevalence. We've got point prevalence, we have period prevalence.

30
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:41,140
Point prevalence is the probability of an individual in the population being a case at a specific point in time or at a specific age.

31
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:53,530
So we've got point prevalence. The estimated point prevalence is equal to the number of prevalent cases get right up here

32
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,710
in the population divided by the total population at that point in time or that age.

33
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay. Defined time.

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,319
That's really what you have to remember for point prevalence. It can be at the time of survey.

35
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,350
It could be at the time of birth. Right. The entry into a study.

36
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,980
So the time could actually be slightly different in calendar time for each person.

37
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,510
So that's also important to remember also called prevalence proportion.

38
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,319
And you'll see that in papers and texts and whatnot. All right.

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,979
So let's quickly calculate the point. Prevalence. Start of kindergarten.

40
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,680
We've got 40 children out of a total of 500 children.

41
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:45,070
Should we write that? So 40 children that had asthma out of a total of 500 kids, you know, in a school, let's say.

42
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:57,209
So it is the point prevalence. I heard the answer.

43
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,350
They're right, 8%. So we're going to do 40 over 500.

44
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,930
So .08, you can express it as 0.08 or you can say 8%.

45
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,560
So can you calculate the point prevalence per thousand kindergartners then?

46
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,770
You were just going to take that .08. We're going to times it by a thousand.

47
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,390
Okay. And we get 80.0 cases of asthma per thousand kindergartners.

48
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,290
One thing that people get really tripped up on with point prevalence versus period prevalence, and we want you to be exact,

49
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,260
they'll just say the prevalence of maybe some point once or period prevalence is if what if I set this problem up.

50
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,720
You know, back here, you know, you all did it pretty quickly. Like we looked like there were a lot of questions about it.

51
00:05:51,720 --> 00:06:00,090
And I said, you know, in the state of Michigan, kindergarten starts anytime between August 1st and, you know, September six.

52
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,750
That was Tuesday as it was. It was so six, right?

53
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,960
That's when my kids started school. But some kids start school weeks before. Right.

54
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,320
You know, so then we're going to look at 500 or 500,000.

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
I don't know how many kindergartners there are, but the number of kindergartners in Michigan.

56
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,780
And look at how many had asthma. A lot of people will then start to say, well, that's a period prevalence.

57
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,640
But if we say it's on the first day of school, right, it's still going to be a point prevalence, even though it was collected over a period of time.

58
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,320
That makes sense because it's a point for each person.

59
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,040
But that is something that tends to trip people up a little bit.

60
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:48,380
So period prevalence, on the other hand, is the proportion of people who have had the disease at any point over a specified amount of time.

61
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,910
It's going to include current and past cases. All right.

62
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:02,090
So period prevalence shown here is P is going to be the number of prevalent cases at the start of the time period,

63
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:11,920
plus the incident cases that occur over that time period divided by the total population at time t.

64
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,400
All right. So calculate the period prevalence for these same kindergartners.

65
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,410
So now we've got their point prevalence, right?

66
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:39,780
Plus, what happens over that time period? All right.

67
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:48,389
So we have 45 of the prevalent cases plus ten the incident cases divided by 500 or population.

68
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,450
So we get 0.10 or 10%.

69
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:02,610
So just what we're asking in these for these different measures, one, the point prevalence is is asking, does your child currently have asthma?

70
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,229
This particular case at this at the moment, which was the first day of school in kindergarten.

71
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,389
Right. Whereas period prevalence is asking, you know, over this time period.

72
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,690
So we were just asking over the year of kindergarten.

73
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,480
But you can ask I did a different way. Like had your child had asthma during the last five years.

74
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,200
Right. Some children outgrow it. So that's a period prevalence.

75
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,500
So just thinking about what question you're asking.

76
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:38,159
Okay. So the relationship between prevalence and incidence we've got prevalence is equal to the incidence density

77
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:47,879
times the duration of disease right here divided by the incidence density times the duration of disease.

78
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,110
Plus one assumes if you think so, we're going to assume that the population is in a steady state and the prevalence,

79
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,100
incidence and mortality remain, rates remain constant.

80
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,560
And, you know, that all includes that there's no net migration. All right.

81
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,390
So can you calculate the prevalence here in this problem?

82
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,980
And I should say and know that migration and immigration.

83
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,700
All right. Okay.

84
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:40,390
So we get the incidence density rate, the rate which we've given here .005 per year, times of five year period, right over .005 times five plus one.

85
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,960
So we'll end up with 0.034 or 2.4% would be the prevalence.

86
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,620
Right. But don't forget, we've got these assumptions here, a steady state population, no net migration occurring.

87
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:02,710
So we can apply that formula to this situation. So there's a relationship between prevalence of incidence, obviously.

88
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,240
So when the disease is rare, right.

89
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:15,160
And for rare generally in this class, we're going to kind of say less than less than 0.10 is for low rate of disease.

90
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,880
Prevalence is going to be equal to approximately the incidence density times, the duration of disease.

91
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,900
So you've probably seen that formula before potentially, right?

92
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,350
Like if you took a prior EPI class, that may be the formula you've seen.

93
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,000
You're not exactly correct, but if the disease is rare, it's kind of close or not.

94
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,210
So if we did that for the prior example, what you'll see is we'd actually get 0.0 to 5 instead of 0.20 to 4.

95
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,489
So approximately the same. Same answer.

96
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,790
Of course, that was a rare disease, right? If it wasn't rare.

97
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,060
It starts to diverge substantially, which is why it's important for us to actually use the appropriate, you know,

98
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:07,660
the the real formula here for calculating it rather than just taking the incidence density terms, the duration of disease.

99
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,020
Okay. So a note about birth defects.

100
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,730
Congenital maladies at birth are a measure of prevalence.

101
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:26,680
And the reason that they're a measure of prevalence and not incidence is because it's actually a measure of both incidents that that,

102
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,180
you know, birth defect occurring. Right.

103
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,620
As well as survival to birth. And that's why it's prevalence.

104
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,060
Okay. Rate, risk and prevalence rate is the primary measure of occurrence and disease.

105
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:51,220
Risk, right, is going to be the result of the rate of disease over a specific period of time.

106
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,760
And then prevalence reflects both the rate of the disease and the duration of the disease.

107
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,799
And that's the relationship between those three. All right.

108
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,520
We're now going to go kind of fairly quickly because I think they're, for the most part,

109
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:18,720
pretty straightforward through some more mortality measures and specific measures that you should be generally aware of and know the definitions of.

110
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,940
So a case fatality rate, if you like, this is one of those ones that a lot of people hadn't seen prior to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

111
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,450
But now probably everybody's seen it, you know, in the news, people talking about it and actually mixing it up with other things.

112
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,930
So the case fatality rate is the number of deaths from a disease divided by the number of cases of a disease.

113
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,990
It's truly a proportion, not really rate. It's typically expressed as a percent.

114
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,360
It's sometimes incorrectly called a case fatality ratio.

115
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,570
So this is like the observed rates. And of course this rate means that that is a reported.

116
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,170
Yeah. So it's the observed deaths and the observed cases.

117
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,630
And so you can have reporting errors on both sides,

118
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:14,970
although that really we start to worry about the reporting on cases depending on on what the disease is and how closely observed,

119
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,250
how reporting a lot of unreported cases for those people, for IFR sort of stuff.

120
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,340
So we'll talk about the INR in a moment.

121
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:35,400
IFR, I think is always preferable to the CFR, but often you don't actually have the data to calculate an IFR, which is an infection fatality rate.

122
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,550
So yeah, so that says it down here. An infectious diseases infection fatality rate is preferable, but it's often not available.

123
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:56,190
And you know, you can kind of like talk about why that is, but it really depends on how apparent the disease is, something like smallpox.

124
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:06,390
Very easy to calculate the infection fatality rate because pretty much everybody has symptoms and the symptoms are very obvious, right?

125
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:20,209
Something like SARS-CoV-2. Not so easy to calculate the infection fatality rate because not everybody has symptoms or the symptoms aren't as obvious.

126
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,750
It's not apparent, you know, if you have some minor cold symptoms.

127
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,560
Right. Could be coping.

128
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,450
Could be a seasonal coronavirus. Could be any number of other respiratory viruses.

129
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,590
Could even be, you know, your allergies. Right. And so it's hard it's hard to tell.

130
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,880
So why is this why is it incorrect to call this a case fatality ratio?

131
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,320
Because the people who are dying are included in the case.

132
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,910
Yeah, right. Because the numerator is contained in the denominator, which it's just not really a ratio.

133
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
But that's what you often see like in the news. They call it an opt in ratio.

134
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,820
So it's sort of people got used to calling it. So here's an example of a case fatality rate.

135
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:16,560
I would note that this is old. These rates are not actually what turned out to be the truth for at least your COVID 19.

136
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:24,690
So here it shows Ebola or smallpox sars-cov-1 up there.

137
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,270
COVID 19. Today, the march is March 2020.

138
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,880
The estimate for what they were thinking COVID 19 would be at actually been lower than that.

139
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,950
Measles and the seasonal flu actually also think seasonal flu is dramatically overestimated there.

140
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,170
But there you go. So an example of the case fatality rate. So there's also the infection fatality rate, which we already mentioned.

141
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,430
Right. The number of deaths from a disease divided by the total number of infections,

142
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,140
once again, really a proportion that's going to be typically expressed as a percent.

143
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,230
So, you know, this did show up in the news as well.

144
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,080
It's something you will see out there depending on factors.

145
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,799
Right.

146
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:14,880
So this is how deadliest SARS-CoV-2 starts to talk about the infection fatality rate, because you get a very kind of skewed picture right on it.

147
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,840
Like you could say like two disease have a case fatality rate of 10%.

148
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,980
Right. Like. Disease X and disease Y.

149
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,950
Right. But if disease X, also 90% of the infections are in apparent or subclinical.

150
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,430
Right. Whereas with disease, why is there all you can tell, all the cases you're being able to kind of capture them?

151
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:47,469
Right. Like the true kind of result of if 100 people get infected is going to be very different for those two diseases,

152
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,860
in spite of the fact that the case fatality rate is the same. And that's really why the infection fatality rate is preferable.

153
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,030
So that makes sense. All right.

154
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:04,270
So here it's just showing the infection fatality rate over a number of different countries and settings.

155
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,860
I can say that a lot of these, I think, were still there were a few different things going on.

156
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,940
One was the setting in which they were looking was probably higher risk settings for transmission occurring.

157
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:24,040
And I think there's four in capturing all the infections in these studies in this data, and that's why it appeared to be so high.

158
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:32,260
So this is old 2020. So here's an example of us using it in a paper.

159
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,980
So the overall infection fatality rate, IFR and the case fatality rate were 0.2% and 0.6%.

160
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,410
And then among adults over 60 equal to or over 60, they were 2.9% and 5.1%.

161
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:56,290
And this is in a cohort where people you know, where we're getting samples and we're getting blood samples that read kind of

162
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,360
periodically and can actually fully assess the number of infections that are occurring.

163
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:12,400
All right. So mortality rate as the total number of deaths from all causes in a period divided by the total number of persons in a population period,

164
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,350
it's typically expressed per thousand population or purposes.

165
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:25,120
Our persons, the time period may vary, but you really need to express it and tell what period it's occurring over.

166
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,590
So because population changes over time, typically a midpoint of population is going to be used.

167
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,580
Right. And if you don't have an exact midpoint population, you'll take the beginning, the end.

168
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,670
Adam together divide divided by two and you call that the midpoint population.

169
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:52,100
Right. So the annual mortality rate is the total number of deaths from all causes in a one year time period,

170
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,190
because this is annual divided by the number of persons in a population at midyear,

171
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,960
typically expressed once again per thousand population or per hour persons.

172
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,220
Right. Once again, we're going to use the midpoint as the estimation of the total population.

173
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,170
So comparing mortality rates and case fatality rates will quickly kind of calculate through this.

174
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,810
So we've got a population of 100,000 people. There are 11 cases of leukemia in a year.

175
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:30,040
Three of the cases die in that year. So can you calculate the mortality rate and then calculate the case fatality rate?

176
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:27,760
He. Some.

177
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:40,930
All right. So the mortality rate, right. Is the number of deaths that occur, which were three in this case divided by the total population, 100,000.

178
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:47,470
Right. So we get 0.03 per 1000 persons.

179
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:55,710
The case fatality rate, on the other hand, is going to be three divided by 11, 0.27 or 27%.

180
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,940
Right. So these are two very different things, very different numbers there.

181
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,309
Right. I cannot tell you how many times I read articles at the very beginning of the pandemic.

182
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,300
And people would be like the mortality rate in China is, you know, 20% or something.

183
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:19,080
And you're like, all right. No, it's not like you mean the case fatality rate of, you know, among these initial cases that are getting reported.

184
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,219
And you always had this thing at the beginning of epidemics, which is, you know, pandemic still you saw with SARS-CoV-2.

185
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,500
But maybe you don't remember so much that 2009 an influenza pandemic.

186
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,470
Does anybody remember that? Anybody remember what the initial case fatality rate reported out of Mexico was?

187
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,300
40%. The initial reports were 40%.

188
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,730
Right. You know, and there was this whole thing of like, oh, you know, you really overreacted.

189
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,530
Right. SARS-CoV-2 is in the end kind of under 1%.

190
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,390
Can you imagine a disease where you've got 40% case fatality rates?

191
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:06,760
Of course it is dramatically inflated. Why? Because they were only getting really the tip of the pyramid for the cases that were occurring.

192
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,160
So they were only capturing those really severe cases.

193
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,940
Turned out there were many people who had kind of typical influenza like illness that weren't coming in for medical

194
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,630
care or weren't being identified as this novel flu virus and not showing up with a really high case fatality rate.

195
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,580
Right. Specific rates. So the definition is a rate in a restricted population.

196
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,910
You can make kind of any kind of specific rate depending on what you're interested in.

197
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,900
So we've got age specific mortality rates we're going to restrict by age, and then you'll see a lot of disease specific mortality rates.

198
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,850
So we're restricting by the disease.

199
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:54,050
So an age specific mortality rate, the infant mortality rate, the number of infant deaths, that is children under wind your age.

200
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,000
It's the formal definition for 40 infant per 1000 live births per year.

201
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,770
We already kind of covered this before. It's not really a rate, right.

202
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,170
And because that's because you're including children who died in that year that weren't actually born in that year.

203
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,680
The most common cause of infant mortality still is pneumonia.

204
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:26,340
A little known fact, actually, is that in most countries during the surge, Kobe, not all during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,

205
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,100
at least at first, before RSV and other diseases pick back up, infant mortality actually dropped.

206
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,830
Right. Mortality from other causes for other age groups, of course, increased.

207
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,880
But because we saw this dramatic decrease in the number of respiratory viruses circulating and people were kind of staying at home.

208
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,600
Right. The children, like very young children, actually had a higher probability of surviving.

209
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,250
So the current rate U.S., this is old. It's always old because we're never quite current.

210
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,920
Our public health reporting systems are kind of a little bit old and need to be updated for sure across the states and even at the CDC.

211
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,850
So posted 5.6 per 1000 live births.

212
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:21,510
So here we have just looking at infant mortality, comparing it's a bunch of developed, you know, higher income countries.

213
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,530
Here we've got the United States, Canada, Sweden.

214
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:38,370
We're getting closer, closer together here. But obviously, the U.S. is not doing quite as well as other countries for infant mortality.

215
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,940
So OECD. I have in my notes here, it stands for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

216
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,110
I guess you would raise kids, mostly high income countries, but I think there are also some middle income countries,

217
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:58,680
typically higher middle income countries that are part of that, like Brazil is part of it.

218
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:08,130
Other mortality rates in infants. The perinatal mortality rate is the rate between 22 weeks of gestation and seven days.

219
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:18,660
Post-Delivery. The neonatal mortality rate is in the first 28 days of life, and then the post neonatal mortality rate is after 28 days.

220
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,290
But before one year of age. Right, because they still need to be an infant.

221
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,740
The child mortality rate is deaths in children under five years of age.

222
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,969
People can debate why we picked five years,

223
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:40,770
but it's really has to do with that's the that's the highest risk time period for for young children or children.

224
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,820
The rate in high income countries, this is all they say also going to be a little bit over kind of six per thousand,

225
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,290
but the rate in the low income country is 76 per thousand.

226
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,050
So there's huge inequities between high income settings and low income settings.

227
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,800
Most child mortality results from a combination of one of five causes.

228
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,330
I, by the way, just because I've got a few questions now, I'm never going to ask a question like this on your exam.

229
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:21,030
You don't have to memorize this for 601. However, I feel like it would be a huge disservice to you if you don't get some of these,

230
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:27,929
like basic AP, public health facts, kind of descriptive epidemiology at somewhere.

231
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:37,380
And, and ideally you get it kind of throughout your experience here at U of M, you know, if you're doing the Masters like Health or Ph.D. in AP.

232
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:46,890
So that's why I bring that stuff in. But no, I'm not going to ask you to list the five leading causes of child mortality.

233
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:57,140
So we got preterm birth complications, pneumonia, intra partum related complications, diarrhea, and then congenital anomalies.

234
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,520
Anomalies or temporalities are the leading cause anomalies.

235
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:10,170
And she said, All right, the child mortality rate on this is just falling child mortality rates over 1970 to 2003.

236
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:20,160
And really to show you that, you know, we had big gains kind of in decreasing that child mortality rate.

237
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:30,630
But, you know, particularly in Africa, there's still huge inequity and that's where we're really seeing the highest child mortality rates.

238
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,070
But within individual countries, you'll also see a lot of inequity, right?

239
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,680
There will be some populations that will have extremely high child mortality rates.

240
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:48,990
Right. Whereas the country overall may not be you know, may have a reasonable child mortality rate.

241
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,120
This is one of those public health problems that's hard to move.

242
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,700
You can do something like there are some basic things that are really I wouldn't say easy.

243
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,749
Some of them are actually not that easy to kind of move this. One is just giving them basic childhood vaccines, right?

244
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,310
Getting them out, getting them on time.

245
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:16,720
You're going to see a massive reduction in child mortality and in a lot of countries that had that happened very quickly.

246
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,850
I work in Nicaragua.

247
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:25,670
Nicaragua was a country that had that happened very quickly with the revolution, with they had a revolution then they kind of ruled out vaccination.

248
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,370
There was a huge focus on health and really making sure that they got them.

249
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,450
So this dramatic drop in child mortality, even though.

250
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,879
Like there wasn't a dramatic increase in income or at the country's level at that time.

251
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,510
Right. Providing clean water is another big one, obviously, in Africa that you're going to be really concerned with malaria.

252
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,840
Right. Working on malaria vaccines. There is a malaria vaccine out there now.

253
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,720
Hopefully we will get an even more effective one in the future.

254
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:06,190
All right. So Mortel or maternal mortality ratios, the number of maternal deaths per thousand births?

255
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:19,030
Why do you think we don't use a rate? Yeah.

256
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,290
So. But why can't we actually. Like, it's incredibly difficult to actually calculate the rate.

257
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,160
Why is that? You don't know the number of pregnancy. Yeah, it's really hard to get data, like really good data on the number of pregnancies.

258
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,420
Right. So you can have somebody who.

259
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,010
And it's a ratio, right? Because somebody may die without having a life.

260
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:47,700
That's obviously right. So maternal mortality ratio, right.

261
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:56,880
Once again, highest we see the highest ratios in in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa.

262
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:05,760
But really overall largely ties pretty closely to country income levels.

263
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,979
However, not necessarily true in the U.S., you know, we spend a ton of money.

264
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,190
We spend more money than like pretty much every other country on health care.

265
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,950
And yet we have a embarrassingly high maternal mortality ratio.

266
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:26,880
I think it's actually had to come down a little bit and has now then with the pandemic, it did go back up a bit.

267
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:34,740
And just this is kind of a specific question, but I, I did my Peace Corps service in sub-Saharan West Africa.

268
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:45,330
And why is it it's why is it more difficult to determine the number of pregnancies than, for example, like malaria cases?

269
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,990
I guess I would think it would be easier to determine a maternal rate than it would be to determine,

270
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,070
like, how many people died specifically of malaria or something like that.

271
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,540
Yes. So so some people get get pregnant, they miscarry.

272
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,139
They don't have a report. It doesn't come in that that is difficult.

273
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,670
It's it would not be that difficult to determine that at the time somebody was.

274
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:16,680
You had had passed away that they were pregnant. Right. You can do a blood test if it's not physically apparent or you can't do an ultrasound.

275
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:23,520
Right. There are all sorts of ways. But the number of pregnancies are really never fully counted anywhere.

276
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:32,670
In a lot of places where, you know, people don't necessarily report that they were pregnant and had an abortion, for example, or or miscarried.

277
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,520
And, yeah, it's a pain in a lot of places.

278
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,079
Births are not necessarily reported either. Right. They're more reported.

279
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,050
So we're using thousand live births. But certainly there are children that are born at home, don't get a birth certificate,

280
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,770
are not counted in the numbers ever or for quite a period of time.

281
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:05,320
Our proportionate mortality is the proportion of mortality caused by a specific cause,

282
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,390
which is the number of deaths from that specific caused by the and the deaths from all causes.

283
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,130
So this is just two examples of five communities with proportionate mortality.

284
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:20,020
So here we got worse mortality from heart disease, 10%, 20%.

285
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,940
So if you take the mortality rate from all causes, I'm said by 10%,

286
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,160
then that's going to be the mortality rate from heart for heart disease three per thousand.

287
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:39,370
I have two different examples up here. They come from a textbook. I'm sure I should have noted which one and they don't have that but one here.

288
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:46,480
Right. The proportionate mortality is different in those two communities in community AIDS causing 10% of deaths,

289
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,160
whereas community vs 20% of deaths are from are from heart disease.

290
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,470
But you actually end up with the same mortality for heart disease in those two populations.

291
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:03,400
And that's because the all cause mortality rate is different between the two populations.

292
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,840
So it's just important to think about what the measure is telling you and the background information for that.

293
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:16,120
Down here we have the opposite situation, right? We've got the same proportionate mortality rate, 30% in both populations,

294
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,750
but you end up with a much higher double the rate, proportional fatality rate.

295
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,340
We've got a higher proportion of mortality.

296
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:33,820
You end up with a much higher mortality rate from heart disease than community egg because the all cause mortality is higher in community aids.

297
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:42,880
So years of potential life lost. It's a measure of premature mortality or early death.

298
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,740
It's a mortality index, really.

299
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:54,280
So what you're going to do for years of potential loss are just subtract age at the death of each fatal case from a standard age, kind of.

300
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,370
Ideally you use light tables because in fact everybody has a life expectancy.

301
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,510
Even if you are 110. Right, you have a life expectancy.

302
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:14,020
But in simple analysis, what is typically done for the US is the age of 75, right?

303
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:23,950
So then you just calculate how many years were life? Life were lost for each person and then you were going to add them together.

304
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,240
So does anybody see a problem with just using 7570 votes?

305
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,450
Yeah, like they don't count, right. Like that. That's a massive problem in this.

306
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,290
Which is why you should really use, like, tables. But I'm.

307
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,730
I mean, you go to like people in class and stuff,

308
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:52,710
but you'll still see plenty of papers that actually use a standard age rather than, you know, a life table based age.

309
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,900
So it's often done using life expectancy instead of a standard age, and I would say should be done using life expectancy instead of a standard age.

310
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,559
But here we're going to use the standard age because it would be you know,

311
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,250
I would have to tell you, the life expectancy for each person based on their age.

312
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,100
So we've got community and we have four cases of RSV that occur.

313
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:23,250
RSV is a disease that occurs in everybody but can be quite severe in infants and young children,

314
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,489
particularly when they're experiencing their first few infections.

315
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:34,530
And so most RSV deaths are seen in infants and young children, although there is a growing recognition of the burden in elderly individuals as well.

316
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,229
But here anyways, community aid.

317
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:46,770
We've got four infants and very young children that have passed away from RSV and going to community B, we have 12 cases of influenza.

318
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:57,330
So you can you go through and calculate the years of potential life, loss of a community, a four hour speed, and then a community B for influenza.

319
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,170
All right. So we'll go through and add that up for community aid.

320
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,660
We get 290 years. And so for Community B, we also get 298 years.

321
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:50,780
Obviously, that was on purpose to point out, you know, how this was calculated.

322
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,590
And there you know, there's also a lot of debates around this, right? Like so we've got four deaths.

323
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:03,710
Well, that's right. We're counting them as exactly the same due to to the age of the individuals who passed away with this measure.

324
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:15,320
All right. So you see these examples. Here's a of potential life lost for influenza and talking about different pandemics, the average age of deaths.

325
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,990
Right. So obviously, the average age is much lower with the same number of deaths.

326
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:26,899
You end up with a higher years of potential life lost here though.

327
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:33,690
The the number of. That's was was was actually lower in the in 2009 pandemic,

328
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:42,090
but still quite a substantial burden by years of potential weight loss because of that younger age.

329
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,590
So disability adjusted life years or DALYs is the sum of the years of potential life lost

330
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,290
due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability.

331
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,580
Use a social weighting where the value of each year varies.

332
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,500
It's going to also reflects on high social value of the young adult years because those are time, very productive years.

333
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,790
So here are our global attributable tallies from level two risk factors for males in 2019 two,

334
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,920
we're looking at things like tobacco, child and maternal malnutrition, etc.

335
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,459
And then we're talking about what the outcomes are.

336
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:34,600
So they, you know, the risk factor was tobacco, but you've got cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, etc.

337
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,480
On those cost management. Mortality.

338
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:49,610
So we like to talk about mortality a lot and that's immunology. Why is that why we like mortality so much?

339
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:59,030
Well, it's a clear index of severity. It's very hard to debate the definition for mortality or for death for somebody died.

340
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,909
Whereas other things like hospitalization, whether or not you get hospitalized in one setting or another, is going to vary.

341
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:10,450
It's also going to vary by your age and by your like comorbidities or risk factors, right?

342
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,430
So the same criteria are not necessarily being applied to every person.

343
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:22,760
Mortality is going to be a good estimation of incidence when both the case fatality rate is high and the duration of disease is really short.

344
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,770
It's not a good measure of incidence when the disease is mild.

345
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:35,810
And that's fairly obvious, right? So J-Shaped mortality curves and mortality curves.

346
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,600
If you look by age, you know, this j shape can be more or less kind of accentuated.

347
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:50,210
But here, you know, you have the highest mortality in the younger well, at least for the younger years in young children.

348
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,790
Right. Then you kind of hit this this low point, and then as you age, it goes up.

349
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:04,220
These are two countries with, at the time, very different SARS levels, but kind of showing that you still see that same curve.

350
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,750
Here's the U.S. mortality curve in 2005, right?

351
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,510
J-Shaped not as strongly, but that highest kind of at the youngest age.

352
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,180
Then it goes down really low, comes back up as people age.

353
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,040
So you can see the j-shaped mortality curve with things other than age.

354
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,800
BMI is another classic example, right?

355
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:38,240
Where we see the highest rates of mortality in people that are underweight comes down for normal rate weight and then will increase as BMI increases.

356
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,480
Any questions about the mortality measures and specific measures?

357
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:50,770
All right.

358
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:56,800
We are going to take a ten minute break a few minutes early just because I want to get like 5 minutes into standardization when we take a break.

359
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:30,970
So we'll start back up at 1055. So.

360
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,040
Yeah. Yeah. That's not important.

361
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,870
No. Yeah, exactly. Right.

362
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:50,640
Well, it's sometimes also her cases. It's actually from the film game.

363
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,930
And so they make not so proportion of the time.

364
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,060
I don't know, is this kind of idea just going to work?

365
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,820
But still, there were times where you were like this character.

366
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:11,430
You know, people look at you and you said, as an infectious disease,

367
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:23,320
you got some pyramid and you have these people are going to have their cases and these people are infected.

368
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:37,229
But it's it's not apparent to us that those people right out of the small boxes, as we saw in the case.

369
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:49,210
Let me tell you something. I think this was really hard for me to read it like communities is what they look like.

370
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:57,719
Weights for like more simple runs less of people those people wouldn't necessarily you so he says it was

371
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:05,280
always going to be nothing or it's like that would be more like kind of but but like so for the wastewater,

372
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:14,790
I don't know. Yeah. And like these dramatic cases of shedding, like it's only going to be a decent man, asymptomatic cases to shed.

373
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:23,069
So that's also nothing. And then how do you approach that, you know, serological test.

374
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,160
And then what you do is you take what it tells people.

375
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,770
You're not gonna be like this. You do?

376
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,559
Yeah. And so, like so it's like a process. How many people actually and hopefully you had it beforehand.

377
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,390
So like if you have an epidemic curve,

378
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:46,260
another curve here and you want to determine like how many people infected and ideally you have a blood sample here,

379
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:53,850
but you can say like I know it didn't circulate you were that you write about the results and you take a look here, right?

380
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,740
And then you set up here and then hopefully you're also monitoring and same that that was that might be serious

381
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:12,600
consequences for some of his actions occurred this person's always there so is you know typically one person who

382
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:26,500
they had stepped others that had reported seeing your sample as measured I'm still here so it's usually just just

383
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:34,050
oh transgressions and you know like but you've got like five words you can monitor every second of the day.

384
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:43,920
Like always trying to be able to monitor people closely enough to where you would stay in close to the discussion.

385
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:51,890
And really that was like, Oh, do you want to leave?

386
00:45:52,710 --> 00:46:04,110
Or you could say that person, I guess you would be you got to go because so there are there are methods just like what I can change mostly.

387
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,780
And while it really depends on, you know,

388
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:18,299
carrying out the demise of some of the other veterinarians or that case of like every night as we like to call.

389
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:30,300
But, you know, I don't really know why I think it has to do with, you know, versus not using against time.

390
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,440
So like if the transmission conditions are just like like on the shoulder season, let's say, right?

391
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:45,540
Like maybe like I breeze out a bunch of them. Yeah. Like you breathe in sometimes nearly as much as you would usually.

392
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:54,480
And then you just like, you know, with versus prior close together or your circulation to different maybe or different,

393
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:02,159
but you see that even in like years mosquito borne diseases like so maybe that

394
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,090
has to do with the virus replicating in the mosquito and the amount of people.

395
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:15,719
There are factors that we just can't seem to ask you to do on this.

396
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:23,250
A lot of people just to put in the name that was like, yes.

397
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,040
And then we know what the exterminator is there. And it really has to do with the viral animals.

398
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:37,400
Like it's just not. But if you can keep the viral load really lower and practical,

399
00:47:37,400 --> 00:48:04,490
then it's only work I can't speak for and I have no idea why and demand for making it work or whatever.

400
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:18,500
I can feel like I can feel like on every play. Their company will consider all the same places where they're like, You know, I remember all these.

401
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:24,679
And it would be it would be like, you know, they're still trying to like they just want to know a lot of stuff.

402
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:45,240
That's right. You know, they also do community service industry, which is so if you look at work and what it means for you to serve like that,

403
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,560
it depends on the calculation of things like that.

404
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:58,950
Like for example, for example, like it was investigating the community for like economic social perspective.

405
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm not here to tell you, you know, I just thought, yeah.

406
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,950
And they went up and it was like Lutheran.

407
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:19,220
Yeah. It's all see is a company like like and then it goes down.

408
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:31,010
Yeah. So I really want to look at the people who's at least doesn't sound like a strange college degree.

409
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,990
There are some standards out there. I don't go because it's just it's worrying.

410
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:52,309
But there's certainly a lot of really good data, different sets of people saying, you know, a lot of stuff is very much not you know,

411
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:59,720
this is not the ones that have like a life expectancy for something with government officials to be.

412
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:27,390
So we find out what it's like to live in 76 looks like it was yesterday when you were when you were born 100 years ago when it was 105.

413
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:41,590
And then I don't believe this record that you are trying to utilize know it's much less than soccer.

414
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:50,440
So you probably should help everybody who holds making money, getting ready to do this.

415
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,600
You know some things about a man and his statement I would put into place.

416
00:50:54,330 --> 00:51:00,870
I figured you need a good one right now.

417
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,850
And then when these guys anything,

418
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:28,930
ideally what you would do and I think this is going to keep people from yeah yeah look there's some baseline rate at this point I think know.

419
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:41,570
So you're comparing it to what it's like the only time it's not but you also want them to be the same goals.

420
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:56,740
So I don't think anybody would be particularly surprised.

421
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,680
Thank you. All right. You are turning the microphones on.

422
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,920
Okay. So we're going to go into standardization.

423
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:20,060
So standardization is really going to be used for comparative mortality or it can be other measures could be morbidity as well across populations.

424
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:28,370
So why do we age standardized means? It's because age is the strongest predictor of mortality and population.

425
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,360
Age structures differ at different time points and between.

426
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:43,930
A punishment like the the life expectancy here is different than the life expectancy in France or Canada.

427
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,390
Maybe not that different, but there are actually lots of countries that have a greater life expectancy in the United States.

428
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,940
And there are many countries that the. Right.

429
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:59,080
And of course, the life expectancy today is very different from the life expectancy 100 years ago or even 40 years ago.

430
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:06,140
Right. So that's right. So here's an example for why why we age standardized.

431
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,460
So we've got crude mortality rates by race in Baltimore City in 1965.

432
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:15,200
And here we're comparing whites to blacks. And this is from the forties textbook.

433
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,640
So and in whites, the crude mortality rate is 14.3.

434
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,010
And in the black population, it's 10.2. Is that surprising?

435
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:36,159
So if I told you that there were massive differences in 1965 and SDS of whites and

436
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,649
blacks with whites having much higher scores on average better access to health care,

437
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,620
better access to vaccinations, etc. Right.

438
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:53,140
So the expectation then would be that the the black population would have a higher mortality rate and all else being equal.

439
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:00,140
Right. So what do you think's going on then? Underreporting could be underreported.

440
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:07,040
Yeah, the black population is younger and that's that is like the major thing here.

441
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,979
There's probably some underreporting as well. So you can get at that really easily by splitting it down to age groups here.

442
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,660
And that's what we've done. Right.

443
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:22,610
And now if you look across every single age group, right, the black population has a higher mortality rate than the white population.

444
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:29,900
But because of differences in the population structure, when you look at, you know, all cause mortality over the,

445
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:35,090
you know, the crude mortality rate over the entire population, the inverse appears to be true.

446
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:42,380
All right. So there are different ways to do standardization or adjustment.

447
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:50,990
So the direct age adjustment uses a standard population structure to adjust for population age differences.

448
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,860
It's going to use a hypothetical standard population. There are a lot of possibilities for what you use,

449
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:06,440
and then you're going to use the age specific mortality rates from that population or from those populations and apply it to the standard structure.

450
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,560
So I'll go through the steps quickly and we'll go through them one by one.

451
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:19,250
Then you'll have an example to work through, right? Because this tends to attract people up, but it's just a matter of learning the steps.

452
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:26,930
All right. So step one is to calculate the crude and age specific mortality rates for each community that you're comparing.

453
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,730
Step two is going to be to create or to choose a standard population.

454
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,370
Step three is to apply community age specific death rates to the standard population.

455
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,150
And then step four is to calculate age adjusted death rates.

456
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:53,260
All right. So step one, we're going to calculate crude and age specific mortality, death rates for the population, for the age specific.

457
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:59,650
Right. We're just going to take the number of deaths and divide it by the total population in that in that group.

458
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,579
And then it's here. We're expressing it per 1000 persons.

459
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:11,739
Right. And we'll do it for Community A and Community B for the crude mortality rate that's just in the overall population.

460
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,750
Right. So the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people in that population.

461
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,270
And this is an example from the Kleinbaum textbook. Right.

462
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:27,250
So we go through and you can calculate each of those death rates.

463
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,600
Okay. The second step is going to be to create or to choose a standard population.

464
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,840
There are a lot of different choices in that for this particular example.

465
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,670
We could go with either community A or community B for the standard population.

466
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:45,550
We could do a sum of community A and community B,

467
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:54,190
we could do an external community such as the U.S. population or another country, just for like thinking about efficiency.

468
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:01,810
If you were wanting to do this speedily and didn't care about your standard population, what population should you choose out of these choices?

469
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,920
Some of the communities. So that means you have to calculate it for both.

470
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:11,720
Right.

471
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:20,820
Like all else, being equal, if you're not told what to do and you're trying to do it quickly, I suggest choosing either community A or B, right?

472
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:27,540
Because you're already have some of the numbers you don't have to go through and calculate every single thing because now you've got their rate.

473
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,890
They're you're using them as the standard population or you've got the number of deaths for them.

474
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,820
You're using them as a standard population. Right. So they're they're actually going up.

475
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:42,900
The rates are going to be the same answer. You don't have to go back and recalculate it for both populations.

476
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,650
However, in this case, we're going to add up community A and B,

477
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:54,840
so we take the population from community and B add them together, and that's going to be our standard population.

478
00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:05,190
But once again, you can really kind of do anything you want within reason, and you'll usually have a reason for selecting what you do.

479
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,210
Okay. So then we're going to apply the age specific death rates to the standard population.

480
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,179
So this is our sum of A plus B here. Right?

481
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:20,219
But as I said, you could have used community A or community B and then obviously, if you had already used them,

482
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:27,570
you don't have to calculate the expected number of deaths because you already know the number of deaths which are used in the first place.

483
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:32,100
Right. For that one community. But here we don't know the number of deaths because we batted them up.

484
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,840
We're using a different standard population.

485
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:40,950
So you're going to go through so here what we're doing, what we're saying is that given the community age specific death rates,

486
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,920
how many deaths would we expect if they had the same population structure?

487
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,970
Right. That's what we're calculating. That's what we're doing. All right.

488
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,810
So we can go through we just take 15, 4000.

489
00:58:54,810 --> 00:59:00,450
We're going to multiply it by 6000, you know, and you end up with 90.

490
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:06,450
Right. Go through and do that same thing for each for community A and community B.

491
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,720
And then we're going to calculate the age adjusted death rate.

492
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,710
And to do that will divide the sum of the expected deaths from the entire population by the total population.

493
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:27,260
Right. So here we've taken three, two, two, two, nine, nine.

494
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:40,880
It's going to divide by 180,000 and we will get 22 deaths per thousand people making a living and 25 deaths per thousand people in Community B.

495
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:49,010
So if you remember kind of going back to the crude rate for Community A was 35.6.

496
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,760
Crude rate for Community B was 17.4.

497
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:58,340
So we think just comparing the crude rates, it looks like Community B had a lower rate.

498
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,150
Right. But really, Community B has a higher death rate.

499
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:10,130
It's just that it has a different population structure, fewer people in those really high risk groups.

500
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,709
And we've now adjusted for that difference. All right.

501
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,880
So direct age adjustment, just to go through the steps one more time.

502
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,230
Right. We're going to calculate the crude and age specific mortality rates for each community.

503
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,070
We're going to divide the deaths by population in each category.

504
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,770
To do that, then step two is we're going to create or we're going to choose a standard population.

505
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,259
If I don't tell you what to do and you're doing it in a time setting, I always suggest using one the populations.

506
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,460
You already have to minimize the number of calculations, but it's your choice.

507
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,010
Step three is to apply community age specific death rates to the standard population.

508
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:58,309
So that means we're going to multiply the community age specific death rate by our standard population to get the expected number of deaths.

509
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:02,780
Right. And then step four is going to be to calculate age adjusted death rate.

510
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:07,760
So we'll sum the expected deaths by community and then divide by the total standard population.

511
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,680
So that's direct age adjustment or direct standardization.

512
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:24,600
Okay, indirect age adjustment or indirect standardization uses a standard mortality rate and applies it to the population.

513
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:32,579
You're going to compare the expected and observed mortality rates and it's used to calculate a standardized

514
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:39,629
mortality ratio and everything are standardized mortality ratio is actually also used for morbidity,

515
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,870
for other outcomes. But that's what it's typically called.

516
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:50,790
So here we've got the observed number of deaths over the expected number of deaths, but you're out doesn't necessarily have to be death.

517
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,270
It's just usually what you're going to see. All right.

518
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:02,940
So steps an indirect age adjustment. Step one is we're going to apply standard rates to the population structure.

519
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,950
Step two is we're going to sum the expected number of deaths over each strata.

520
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,920
And then step three is we're going to calculate the standardized mortality ratio, the SFR.

521
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,510
So the smaller is the observed deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.

522
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,480
All right. So for step one, we're going back to that same example.

523
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:33,260
We're going to apply a standard rate store population structure. So here we're using the community structure of a right.

524
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:39,660
And if you look back at your slides, this is actually the death rates from Community B, right?

525
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,790
So we're using Community B as the standard rate and a counterfactual there.

526
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,180
Right. What would have happened if it had had community abuse rates?

527
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,429
And then we will just multiply it out and we're going to get the expected number of

528
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:58,230
deaths in each of those age groups based on the population structure here for eight.

529
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:07,570
And our standard death rate, which we're using from community B. Then we're going to some the expected deaths over each strata.

530
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,770
Right. So get the total number of expected deaths in the population.

531
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,180
And here we get 2,032.5.

532
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:20,860
I know you can't get half a death, but that is what we do. And then we're going to calculate the similar.

533
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,560
So we're going to take the observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths that we just calculated.

534
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:35,290
And we will get an estimate. So 1781 over 2000, 32.5 and we get 0.876.

535
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:40,580
Right. So this is the actual. Number of deaths that occurred in community.

536
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,080
This is the number that we would expect if they had the rates from community beat.

537
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:50,990
Right. And so this is saying that they have a lower rate than expected.

538
01:03:52,530 --> 01:04:01,350
A ratio that expected. All right. So smaller is going to vary depending on the choice of the population for your standard rates.

539
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:13,920
Right. And some are equal to one means there's no difference in mortality after you've adjusted for age or whatever other other factor.

540
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,989
We're doing age here, as is the most common,

541
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:23,580
but you can't adjust for other factors and some are of greater than one means that the mortality rate is higher in the population.

542
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:30,540
And this prior example it would be community a rate at a summer of less than one,

543
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:35,550
which is what we found in that last example means that the mortality rate is lower in that population.

544
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,960
Sometimes you'll see the same R multiplied by 100.

545
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:46,620
So if that's the case, of course all of these become one hundreds. When asked about equal to 100 then would mean there's no difference.

546
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:57,769
Right? So for direct and indirect adjustment or standardization for direct right, we are taking the population structure.

547
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,299
It's a standard population.

548
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:07,280
We have many different choices for that and we're going to use the observed specific death rates for indirect standardization.

549
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:15,530
We're going to use the observed population structure, and we're going to use that to do the standard age specific death rates.

550
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:24,290
Right. So kind of a counterfactual perspective on that, which already kind of mentioned, right, for the direct standardization.

551
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:28,350
We're using a counterfactual age structure, right.

552
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:34,400
Applying an age structure that we don't see in that population for indirect standardization or indirect adjustment.

553
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,710
We're using a counterfactual a counterfactual age, specific rates.

554
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:47,690
And as you see me already, just jump back and forth. Your textbooks use different terminology because this is a problem we have in epidemiology.

555
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:53,720
So you just have to get used to all of it. So standardization adjustment in this case did the same thing.

556
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:02,640
Right? So. All right. So we're going to give you a few minutes to do an in class activity.

557
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:31,840
So if you can work on both A and B. If you want to.

558
01:06:37,650 --> 01:07:25,510
I. He's.

559
01:07:47,110 --> 01:08:26,360
Something. I'm capitalism.

560
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:48,820
And. Yep.

561
01:09:01,650 --> 01:12:16,410
This just comes. All right.

562
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,170
We're going to get started.

563
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:30,980
So for the crude and the cumulative incidents, like crude incidents, we're going to take the number of cases divided by the total population.

564
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,370
So community A, the number of incident cases.

565
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:42,050
That's going to be 12 divided by 22,500, which equals 0.00053.

566
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:45,830
For community B, it will be 29 divided by 40,000.

567
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:55,530
Is there? And then we're going to do our standardization, right?

568
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:59,520
So we take we're going to calculate out.

569
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:14,000
Right. The. Community rate expected number of deaths Tier four using our standard population rate, which was from community B.

570
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:21,050
In this case. Thank you. My current question was calculate the age adjusted death rates per thousand people for pneumonia.

571
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,830
Each community use community B as the standard population once again.

572
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,860
Why did I do it this way? Cos because it gives you like you have to calculate how many rates.

573
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:40,790
It's a little bit faster for us to be sample. All right, so we got the community a 0.4 per 1000 persons community B 0.7254 thousand persons.

574
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:46,100
It's going to be the same here as the crude rate because we're using community B structure as the standard.

575
01:13:49,140 --> 01:14:00,209
Everybody okay with that? What type of standardization was this? Give me a thumbs up if you think it was.

576
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,220
Direct me a thumbs up if you think it was indirect.

577
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:10,820
And the direct people have it. This was a direct standardization, right?

578
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:25,740
Because we're using our standard population, but the actual community rates of age adjusted severity of SARS-CoV-2.

579
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:33,300
So one of the things I always get is like, Yeah, but I'm never, ever going to use this and act like people recently did it.

580
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,540
Right. So you do use it. There are very good reasons to use this.

581
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:40,290
This is actually severity we're not using. We're not looking at mortality here.

582
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:50,700
Right. And so, yeah, you can use these methods for looking at things other than mortality.

583
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:55,500
So the reason we did this is because you can kind of back from the reviewers and say, yeah, but your cohort,

584
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,700
you know, it has it require that kids get each household, which is actually kind of the standard.

585
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:06,599
It's like 90 over 90% of households in Nicaragua have a child in them, you know, but they said, Oh, it's under 12.

586
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,490
So your age structure is really different. So like, yeah, you're telling us severity, but what does that really mean?

587
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,530
Right. And so we said, okay, well we can do that. You know, we can look at infection and case rates.

588
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:22,439
So looking at infections and then looking at cases. So we did the total Nicaraguan population.

589
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,839
So first we adjusted our cohort to the Nicaraguan population and also looked at the U.S. population,

590
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,150
right to to characterize severity of infections and then severity of cases presenting.

591
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,979
We also did Italy and some other countries where there was really good data out there so

592
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:43,260
that then you can compare across these different sites or where there was better data,

593
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:49,170
at least other. All right. So age period and cohort effects.

594
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:56,340
All right. We've got three distinct of time related variables that can influence the risk or rate of health outcomes.

595
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:00,900
We have biologic age of the individual. Right.

596
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:05,310
We've got calendar time and then the year of birth.

597
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:11,190
Right. So this is age period cohort.

598
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:22,890
So this is what an age effect looks like. This is just regardless of when you were born and over time as you get older.

599
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,589
Right. The risk increases. It could also be with that something else, the risk could decrease.

600
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:36,780
Right. That's an age effect. Another way to represent age of fact here is we're going to be looking for these are birth cohorts.

601
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:42,059
We're just looking down each one. Right.

602
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,320
And you can see that they're you know, you've got this kind of highest rate in the youngest individuals.

603
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:53,640
Then it drops down and then increases to kind of a plateau and then a increase in kind of the end.

604
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:05,240
All right. So that's an age effect. Curing effect of period effect diseases varies by period by calendar time regardless of age or birth cohort.

605
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,620
So looking at this graph, can somebody tell me when something happened here or something happened?

606
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:19,450
Right. Can you tell me what year that is? It's not exactly let's say this is a 30 year and it's looks a little off over there.

607
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:23,260
Maybe it's better, but still. Oh, yes. At 30.

608
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:28,750
At 40. At 50. Right. You're looking at.

609
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:33,280
People are confused. Okay. What?

610
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,730
I want this to show or what this is supposed to show. We've got somebody that was born in 1920.

611
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:41,560
It occurs at 930 or so. Something that happened at 1950.

612
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:47,470
Right. Or centering on 1950 for this to go up for somebody who was born in 1910.

613
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:52,720
It's happening at age 40. Right. So once again, calendar time, 1950.

614
01:17:53,350 --> 01:18:02,710
Right. And then for somebody who's age 50 at this point, born in 1900, it once again happening at the year 1950.

615
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:11,110
Right. So that's why this is a period of fact. There there's other ways to look at period of that, which is kind of the simplest one.

616
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,220
You've actually done a really nice example with 1918, right?

617
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,130
And then shown that like, you know, it's big epidemic, big pandemic, right mentality, pandemic.

618
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,630
You see the sudden increase in mortality due to it.

619
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:35,370
You would see this, you know, if there's some sort of incident, comic bomb exploding right now, a pandemic and a big epidemic in the population,

620
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:44,010
some point thing happens and that causes mortality to jump across the age groups or across at least multiple age groups.

621
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:48,390
And that's when you see that kind of pattern in data.

622
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:54,240
You can also see period effects that look like this. So this is going back to that same example, right?

623
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:59,880
Obviously, from one of the textbooks that failed to put it on work on that.

624
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:06,150
But here we can see if we look at different time periods. Right. This is tuberculosis deaths.

625
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:11,250
Right. People in 1880 had much higher risk.

626
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,740
Right, than people in 1930. Across all of the different age groups.

627
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:20,010
Right. And that's there's some period effects occurring.

628
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:29,569
So it probably has to do with exposure to tuberculosis, also has to do with other risk factors, right?

629
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:35,720
People's nutrition is better. They're generally healthier in 1930 than in 1880.

630
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:40,070
Right. There's probably less crowding as well. We're starting to see.

631
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:47,390
So a cohort effect. The disease rate varies by year of birth, regardless of age.

632
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,860
These are, of course, very simplified graphs, right, to demonstrate the concept.

633
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:57,409
But here we have different cohorts born in 1920 or 1910 who were born in 1900.

634
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:02,690
It doesn't matter how old they are, their rate of disease is different quite by birth cohort.

635
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:11,250
And so looking at this table, if we want to look at cohort effects, where you're going to look across.

636
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,430
Right these diagonals because people are aging as they go through life and dropping down.

637
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:23,370
So somebody who's in this category in 1880 is going to move on to be in the next category.

638
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:39,989
Roughly in 1890. Right. So here is an example from an article looking at some cohort effects, right?

639
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:45,660
So this is the boomers and then the silence, which are the generation that came before the boomers, right?

640
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:49,950
We've got younger boomers and older boomers and then younger silent and then older silent.

641
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:54,240
So these people are more and more recently. You're going further back in time as you go down.

642
01:20:55,170 --> 01:21:01,190
And we're looking at age. And this is the problem.

643
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:09,230
This is the BMI weighted prevalence of a higher BMI for meeting the criteria for obesity.

644
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,920
And when we had a notice, what do you notice about age in this graph?

645
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:22,230
Generally speaking, across all these lines as people get older, what's happening to the prevalence, the weight and prevalence of obesity?

646
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,760
It's increasing. So we see a clear age effect here.

647
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:32,340
But and I know it might be a little hard to show to see these little symbols.

648
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:38,700
This is older, silent or silent, older boomer, younger boomer age men.

649
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:47,370
This is women. What are we seeing by cohort or group categorized by, you know, the silent period or the group of group?

650
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:55,490
We're seeing as they were born and more recently. Right. They actually the prevalence of obesity is increasing.

651
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,370
So there's both an age effect and a cohort effect that's being seen here.

652
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:13,100
So here we have another example of lung cancer mortality rates for U.S. white males by birth cohort.

653
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,959
So the birth cohort are solid lines right there. Right.

654
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:28,050
You can see it's it's. It's going up and current age rate has dropped and looking at things by current age, not necessarily by birth cohort.

655
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,590
What you can see is as people get older, right.

656
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:42,420
Their risk is going up. Not surprising what you see this dramatically different risk depending on birth cohort.

657
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:52,950
So if you look at age 50, right, if you were born in 1870, you are better off than you were born in 1890, actually a later period.

658
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:57,810
Right. And then you really see some big differences occurring over here.

659
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,710
This is actually like part of the reason you see these patterns here is because of tobacco smoking.

660
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,429
Right. So tobacco smoking was becoming more prevalent over time.

661
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:17,740
And so that you saw these birth cohort effects. You don't have to sit and look at the graph a little bit.

662
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:27,490
Okay, so that's the lecture summary. We went over basic concepts, incidents, cumulative incidence, which is risk prevalence,

663
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:33,489
mortality measures and you know, infant mortality, child mortality, standardization.

664
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:36,250
So both direct and indirect standardization.

665
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:53,650
And then we just talked about age period and cohort effects and we are going to use one pointer start of our next lecture.

666
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,430
I'm running a little bit behind on where I would like to be.

667
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:05,680
I debated what the best way to deal with that is, and I think what I will probably do if I don't catch up entirely,

668
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:12,040
rather than cutting out in class activities or trying to speed up and completely lose you in the lectures,

669
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:16,030
I might leave you to look over confidence intervals on your own.

670
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:21,069
And then we would just agree that I'm not going to test you on calculating confidence intervals,

671
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:24,490
because hopefully you've seen that in bioscience courses. I'm not committing to that yet.

672
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:29,080
I'm just telling you that that's what I think is probably the best option if we run behind.

673
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:35,890
Right. Most of the time, you're going to be populating confidence intervals, using programs anyway, and you very rarely do it by hand.

674
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:42,250
I do think it's important that you do it by hand at some point. So it is in the exercises and we'll see where we get to.

675
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:50,680
But that's a bunch of slides that we could potentially not go over and not be directly tested on calculating them.

676
01:24:50,830 --> 01:25:01,090
You would still need to have an understanding of what you would expect to happen to the confidence interval based on certain scenarios occurring,

677
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:05,500
such as the sample size increasing and understand what confidence intervals are.

678
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:10,760
So all right with that, is everybody okay with that plan?

679
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:17,590
As an example, you can object silently to me. You can send an email if you really object to that, that plan if we run short on time.

680
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:25,090
But I don't like to just rush through material or cut out time for you to work through examples,

681
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:31,030
because I think that makes the lecture much less the classmate much less valuable to you.

682
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:41,500
All right. And I'm going to go over here, switch up my display settings again.

683
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:49,330
All right. Measures of impact and measures of association.

684
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:57,069
I'll be going over this for the next two lectures. So the lecture overview is basic concepts.

685
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:01,480
We're going to go through some basic concepts like we always do. We're going to have measures of effect.

686
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,650
Then we'll talk about measures of association, which is what we spend most of our time on.

687
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:09,700
We'll talk about relative measures, absolute measures and some other measures.

688
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:17,860
And then here we've got into interval estimation of relative measures, a.k.a. confidence intervals, which we may or may not.

689
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,740
It'll be in the slides we may or may not go over in class.

690
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:26,980
And I will also talk about in class a little bit, which I don't have slides for pulling, do it on the board,

691
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:35,910
the difference between relative measures and absolute measures and why one might be better than the other from a causal perspective.

692
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:42,720
All right. So two by two table. This is four count data.

693
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:46,470
So it could be used for a cohort study or a case control study.

694
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,450
Note This is the standard way that is used in Kleinbaum Morgan Stern.

695
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,740
And again, slow, I would say, in a majority of textbooks.

696
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:02,070
Very important to know that Robin does not use this.

697
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,990
The set up, right. So you've got the exposed and deceased or swapped.

698
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:13,680
So every time people get kind of confused because, you know, then he's got the equations in there.

699
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:21,240
You look at the equation and you're like, Wait, wait, that's not what I thought it was, because you're thinking of this table rather than his table.

700
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:29,910
So just be aware of that in going over. If you use the Rothman textbook, it's a very good textbook.

701
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:34,980
Sometimes you have to read things four or five times to absorb what it's saying.

702
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:44,760
Right. But there you go. Okay. But this is the two item table that we will be using in this class because it is kind of the most used to the table.

703
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,230
The other thing to remember,

704
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:54,900
although I think anybody uses I don't know anybody I actually still use data is you know that most shows where I went to school

705
01:27:54,900 --> 01:28:04,710
and dates me a little bit in a way but state of actually uses a different two by two set up which is important to know.

706
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,790
I SAS does not I know.

707
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:18,629
Or you can probably set it to do whatever you want. Right. So it'll depend on what package you're using for what, but just kind of in space.

708
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:24,630
I haven't used as much I'm not familiar with, but just something to know too, that the statistical programs may set it up differently.

709
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:28,000
So sometimes you want to see where to type do table looks like you know,

710
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:34,020
you get it to pull up and then people will get very mixed stuff because it's not, you know, the stuff they're used to using.

711
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:42,420
All right. Or you might want to enter that data into have it calculate the, you know, the stuff for you based on the data.

712
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,440
Okay. So do you buy two tables for incidents, density data.

713
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:56,309
This is where we had for some time, right? We're going to get rid of the the population number and replace it here with person years.

714
01:28:56,310 --> 01:29:00,600
Or it could be anything. It could be person months, but most commonly it's going to show up as person years.

715
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:07,229
Right. So Petey one here is the person years and the exposed and Petey zero is the person

716
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:13,740
years in the unexposed and of course is the total person years in in that population.

717
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:20,580
All right. So that's just our basics. Two by two tables, you would be able to draw out your two by two tables.

718
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,200
So measures in effect, right. We've already mentioned this a few times.

719
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,069
It's the Holy Grail.

720
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:35,190
And at me we're really trying to get to like some exposure influences the outcome of a disease, either increasing the risk or decreasing the risk.

721
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,610
Right. Or maybe you're trying to see if there is any influence.

722
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:49,020
So for measures of affect, right. We're looking at the causal effects of an exposure on disease occurrence in a population.

723
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:57,600
Really, this is, you know, done theoretically through comparing observed to counterfactual and really describes how outcomes are.

724
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,220
Probabilities would change if exposures change at some measure of effect.

725
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:09,540
There are two types of measures of effects the causal risk ratio, which we're going to use just because, you know,

726
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:18,180
cursive you scroll are is the ratio representing the risk of disease of everyone more exposed in the population divided by the risk of disease,

727
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:25,200
of everyone more unexposed. And then we've got the causal risk difference is the difference in the risk

728
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:31,050
of disease if everyone were exposed compared to if everyone were unexposed.

729
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:39,420
All right. Those are our measures of effect. We'll go back into some measures we calculate and look at as measures of impact or affect later on.

730
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:49,110
Okay. So for measures of association, we're going to compare exposed individuals to unexposed individuals.

731
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,640
Right. These are different people.

732
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:57,810
Generally speaking, we're estimating the counterfactual number of cases in the exposed in the absence of the exposure.

733
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,390
And this is where we kind of get into that exchange ability.

734
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:08,070
We want those unexposed persons to be as similar as possible to the exposed persons or to adjust for the differences in those populations.

735
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:17,580
It could be based on any type of frequency measure. That means we can do incidence, density we can do with incidence, you can do prevalence.

736
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:25,440
So measures of association are going to tell us the strength of the association you can tell us have been strong or weak.

737
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,040
And remember, we kind of tied that back into like thinking about a causal inference, right?

738
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:36,720
With things that are having a stronger association, people may feel more.

739
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:42,530
Or more short, like a more likely to be causal. But just because it's a weak association does not mean that it's not causal.

740
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,390
We can also talk about the direction of association, right?

741
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:53,780
So we'll talk about risk factors, which is an increased risk rate or prevalence of your outcome or a protective factor,

742
01:31:53,780 --> 01:32:01,430
which is a decreased risk rate or prevalence. Right. And people do use an item to risk factor for something that's actually protective.

743
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:09,290
So you would not do the inverse. All right. Measures of association.

744
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:15,770
We've got our relative measures, our absolute measures, and then other measures that we're going to go through.

745
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:20,030
All right. So this is where we are in the lecture. All right.

746
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,530
Risk ratio also called a relative risk.

747
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:28,520
You'll see it called relative risk in a lot of our manuscripts.

748
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:34,430
You also see many other things called relative risk and back to manuscripts, correctly or incorrectly.

749
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:42,260
But it's the risk of incident events in the exposed group divided by the risk in the unexposed group,

750
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,100
you're really going to have kind of for the ratio measures. It's basically the same formula, right?

751
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:54,020
You're just you're measure is what is differing in all of these things.

752
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:00,470
Right. So you're not having to memorize, you know, many, many formulas, really.

753
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:07,230
As long as you understand what the measure is and how to calculate it, then you're just taking the ratio of the exposed to the unexposed.

754
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:17,450
Right. All right. So the interpretation of risk or rate ratios or people's relative risk, right?

755
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:26,000
So if you have 2.0 the risk or the rate of disease and the exposed is two times the risk or the rate of disease in the unexposed,

756
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:29,389
we're also going to want to add where and when to these statements.

757
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:41,030
But that's the basic statement I are of a relative risk of 0.5 dependent risk for rate measure once again that we're using to calculate it.

758
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:48,620
But the risk or the rate of disease of the exposed is 0.5 times the risk or the rate in the unexposed.

759
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,740
That's the simplest way to interpret it.

760
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:57,740
Okay, so for relative risk, and when you see people talking about low risk rate,

761
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:07,570
it may be a ratio and maybe a risk ratio rate on separate cohort data with counts are relative risk.

762
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:11,570
Here is going to be a cumulative cumulative incidence ratio.

763
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:19,520
It's much clearer if we just call it out by exactly what it is because we've already gotten used to calling it a cumulative incidence rate.

764
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,550
So in this class we're going to call it a cumulative incidence ratio.

765
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:30,230
So it's the cumulative incidence in the exposed group divided by the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group.

766
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:34,830
So for cohort data with person time.

767
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:48,640
Our relative risk measure will be or a ratio measure will be the incidence density ratio, right, which is the IDR.

768
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:59,050
So it is a ratio of the incidence density rate in the exposed group divided by the incidence density rate in the unexposed group.

769
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:03,130
Okay. So what does that look like here? We've got our account data.

770
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:11,049
This is our our two by two table that we've set up disease across the top, exposure to the side so called data,

771
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:14,860
cumulative incidence and exposures divided by cumulative incidence in the unexposed.

772
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:24,070
So if you go to your table a rate, the number of cases in the exposed group divided by the total number A plus B in the exposed group,

773
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:33,520
that's our cumulative incidence and exposed over see the number of cases among the unexposed individuals divided by C plus D,

774
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:41,320
which is the total of the total population in the unexposed group.

775
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:46,929
So some people like to kind of remember the concept. That's my preference.

776
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:57,880
Other people like to kind of memorize out the formulas for based off of the table and and you'll see it you see a lot of this in the textbooks, right?

777
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:04,210
Telling you which which which cell to use from based on whatever table they happen to be using.

778
01:36:04,570 --> 01:36:09,790
All right. So we have a study here in which to calculate the sea air.

779
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:12,790
So it's conducted over a ten year period of time.

780
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:17,320
And remember to include the risk period when you're interpreting sea air.

781
01:36:18,730 --> 01:38:18,910
So calculate it and go ahead and interpret it. All right.

782
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:28,360
So we get 84, right? That's the number of cases among the exposed divided by 3000.

783
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:39,430
That's the total exposed population, right? In this case, 84 +2916 divided by 87 over 5000.

784
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:47,500
During the same thing, you're right, 87 cases among the unexposed and then the total unexposed population, and we get 1.6.

785
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:56,500
So we say smokers have 1.6 times the risk over a ten year period of coronary heart disease compared to non smokers.

786
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:06,070
All right. So the incidence density ratio also called the incident rate ratio or the IRR.

787
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,719
Here's our table. We've replaced counts with person time because of our data.

788
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:18,080
We've got people coming in and leaving a longer period of time.

789
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:26,150
Right. So it's going to be the incidence density rate in the exposed divided by the incidence density rate in the unexposed.

790
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:29,420
I just remember always exposed over unexposed.

791
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:39,290
So we've got a over person years and the exposed group and then see over person years in the unexposed group in this table.

792
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:45,470
If you're not happy with getting a number less than one.

793
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,390
Just switch your exposure around. Okay. So.

794
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:55,820
So it makes sense. Like if you use the helmet use right rating, then you're going to get protective for motorcycle accidents.

795
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:59,070
Right. But you're like, oh, people have a really hard time interpreting it.

796
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:02,240
It's less than one. Just changed it to no helmet use.

797
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,810
Right. And then you'll get a number higher than one. So that's that's how we do that.

798
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:13,670
All right. So calculate the incidence density ratio that actually should not be up there.

799
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:18,650
That should have been like the second step. But go ahead and do that for this for this problem.

800
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:30,510
All right. So we get 322 episodes of Eli and the Asthmatic Children divided by their little person TIME, which is 447.8 divided by 2274.

801
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:38,790
And the non asthmatic children of 7,091.7, which is their person time right.

802
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:46,800
So we've got the incidence density in the exposed the asthmatic children divided by the incidence intensity in the unexposed you know with 2.2.

803
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:55,530
So we say the incidence of Eli in children with asthma was 2.2 times the incidence of Eli and non asthmatic children.

804
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:04,740
So in IDR in the air, right, the circumstance, the ratio and the incidence ratio.

805
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:13,110
So the risk ratio or CAIR, the cumulative incidence ratio approximates the rate ratio, the IDR,

806
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:20,910
when the period of observation is small and the number at risk at 20 zero or followed for the whole time period,

807
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:27,810
then the risk, the number at risk will thus approximate the person time at risk.

808
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:32,310
Right? And so that's when your IDR and your CAIR are going to be pretty similar.

809
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:39,389
Conversely, right, as time goes to infinity gets longer, longer, right, everyone becomes a case or dies.

810
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:45,840
The value of CAIR incidence ratio is going to approximate one, right?

811
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,580
So what we're saying is when time goes to infinity, everybody is either going to become a case or they're going to drop out.

812
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:54,060
They're going to they're going to one case of something else. Right.

813
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:05,099
And when the time period is small enough and everybody's followed for the whole time, person, time, and people are going to be roughly equivalent.

814
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:11,230
Right? And so for that reason. So if you follow everybody for for a year, right.

815
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:16,559
This is the most obvious example. I guess you get everybody in there, everybody's followed for a year, right?

816
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,370
IDR and CAIR are going to be the same. That makes sense.

817
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:23,820
So we don't lose anybody in that your time period. Okay.

818
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:30,360
The prevalence ratio as the prevalence in the exposed group,

819
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:35,429
the prevalence in the unexposed group is going to provide information on the

820
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:39,450
relative prevalence of disease and the exposures compared to the unexposed.

821
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:44,250
Remember, this is going to be influenced both by the incidence in the exposed and

822
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:48,299
unexposed groups as well as the duration of disease in the two different groups.

823
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:53,910
And that may vary right between the exposed and the unexposed groups for the

824
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:58,379
interpretation of the prevalence of prevalence ratios of problems ratio of 2.0,

825
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:05,280
the prevalence of disease and the exposed is two times the prevalence in the unexposed 0.5, right?

826
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:10,170
The prevalence of disease of the exposed is 0.5 times the prevalence in the unexposed.

827
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,900
So in interpreting ratio measures of association, right.

828
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:26,050
The exact meaning depends for the time depends on the measure of disease being used.

829
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,790
Right. And so here's an example where we're going to say it's a value of eight, right?

830
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:37,390
Suppose we're interested in the association between lung cancer and smoking and we get eight is our calculation, right?

831
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:46,450
So if we're looking at a five year CAGR, it's a smokers eight times more likely to develop lung cancer in five years than a non smoker,

832
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:51,400
conditional on first not dying of any other disease during that five year period.

833
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:57,910
We often don't write that in there, but that is actually what you're doing when you calculate it out that way.

834
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:07,600
IDR rate the incidence intensity ratio of smokers of eight times the rate of developing lung cancer over a five year period compared to nonsmokers.

835
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:15,610
And then the p r the prevalence ratio, a smoker is eight times more likely to have lung cancer than a non smoker.

836
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:23,910
All right.

837
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:31,430
I'm going to go over this one more slide and we're going to end so quickly and this time so you can have two or more ordered expression categories.

838
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:39,950
All these previous examples, it was yes, no, wait. There will be two categories that will allow us to look at a dose response relationship.

839
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:47,000
So here's an example with with smokers. It's my favorite example of this lecture, right?

840
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:54,709
Just using smokers here. But we've got heavy smokers which are greater than one pack a day light smokers less than a pack a day.

841
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:59,180
And non smokers, obviously, you can get into even more categories.

842
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:05,479
Right. Look at the incidence density ratio in heavy light and non smokers.

843
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:09,379
So this is going to be a reference group and that's what we do when there are multiple groups,

844
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:18,020
we're going to pick one as the reference group and here we see a positive dose response relationship which supports causality.

845
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:22,580
Right. As they increase in the amount that they're smoking, the risk increases.

846
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,830
And with that, I will end for the day. I'll stick around for a few minutes because 30 questions.

847
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:40,350
We're going to take a long time. And I.
