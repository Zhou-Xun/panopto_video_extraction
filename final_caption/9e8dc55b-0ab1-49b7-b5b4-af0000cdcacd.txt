1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,400
That's why I'm asking, because I know that's also an option.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:10,980
So just skip the Friday, you know, when I think next Wednesday, this Wednesday, the week after would be good review session.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,470
Wednesday the 14th. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,240
Is that going to be during the same time that you originally had? Yeah, the time the time when it changed, it's going to be 330 to 530.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,470
So that's what you want? No one wants me to keep the Friday open. I guess you don't want to do the accounting thing.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,760
Or is everyone doing the accounting thing? I'm not I'm not I'm not doing the accounting, though.

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,660
So keep it off the again. Definitely.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm taking the first. I'll put an announcement on canvas.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:55,460
So anyone who wasn't here, thanks to the team's review session, the ninth and the 15th, or just off of them, I mean, thank you for being with us.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
This. I think we have a couple. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,070
So I don't know anything else Friday.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:16,090
But I think this is like someone wants to learn everything right now.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,260
It makes sense. I think you have to. On Friday I want to ask you you know,

14
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:34,320
that's not want me to it is there any way you can do an alternate time so when possible we can do in this van like you know for a whole week,

15
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,780
like sometimes I strongly prefer that everybody takes the exam at the same time.

16
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,869
I think I had something happen a few years ago.

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,960
That's not. That's not my policy.

18
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,440
Sorry. In the university. No, I know you have the final words.

19
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,090
I'm it's going to have a good holiday.

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,190
So we really are in the homestretch now. I've got to go.

21
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,319
So today we're going to also be in the homestretch for the theory of the firm,

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,650
because we're finally getting to the setting of prices and determination of profits and selling of quantities.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,490
So we started Theory of the Firm by talking about production functions,

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,260
and we use production functions on things to drive the idea of Isaac once again, those are just technical relationships.

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,850
What is it possible for the firm to produce, given the amount of inconsistencies?

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:36,270
And then we talked about cost functions and we added in the idea of cost minimization that among the technically efficient things,

27
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,829
the bundles on the production function. Some of them are for a partner I supply to the production functions.

28
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,600
Some of them are going to be cheaper than others.

29
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,200
So the firm is going to try to find the cheapest possible way of producing whatever quantity it decided to produce in the first place.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,110
So today we're going to come back to figure out, well, why would it decide to produce one quantity rather than another?

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,470
So we're kind of closing the circle on the theory of the firm,

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,970
and then we're going to talk about pricing in markets and the presentation on pricing and health care.

33
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:14,890
So even though we've got kind of one day off on this, actually parlays perfectly into the presentation for today.

34
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,190
So what economists assume is a primary objective of a firm that's sort of an old one,

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,560
but today it's really going to come into place to maximize profits. And we're going to see how firms do maximize profits,

36
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:37,160
when they're going to do that by determining what's the best possible quantity to produce or talk about how a firm's demand curves.

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:45,610
The demand for a firm's product, in other words, is going to affect those output decisions in a characterized firm supply curve.

38
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,830
So we're going to get sort of the analog demand curve from the consumer side, global supply curve for the producer side.

39
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,550
So I decide what quantity I ought to produce.

40
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,660
Again, I have to say, what's my objective? Why would I choose one quantity rather than another?

41
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,680
So I choose one quantity rather than another because it's more profitable.

42
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,090
So assuming the firms try and choose, the quantity maximizes profits.

43
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:27,109
So if you look and feel like it doesn't matter what the demand is, then if the demand is not there, you want to know what the demand is not there.

44
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,120
It won't be profitable. So you have to consider the demand.

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,120
You have to consider two things. Well, we've already considered how our higher costs are going to produce are going to change with quantity.

46
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:45,739
So that's what we did before break. We've said, well, you know, power cost is a function of quantity, the total cost curve.

47
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,100
And then we derive from that average and marginal cost curves and that tells us sort of half of our profitability equation everywhere.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,510
Probability, what do we have to spend to produce a particular level of output?

49
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,740
But then the demand comes in here. So that's kind of go to your question.

50
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,060
The demand is, well, all my or my revenue is going to change with quantity.

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,870
If nobody wants my product, I revenue is going to be zero, right?

52
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,640
How about like that? Does that have implication about the resources?

53
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,240
The resources are too limited. Even the demand is high.

54
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:25,340
It's perfectly able to make more of that because they're like uniform, like some of the pharmaceutical ingredients that they may be.

55
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,910
They are already like, we're going to go right? So that's going to come in here eventually.

56
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,940
If the resources are available, your costs are going to get very,

57
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,550
very high to expand output any further in the limit if the resource is absolutely fixed.

58
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,970
Then beyond that, beyond that quantity that you can make with the resources that are available, your costs will essentially be coming in for that.

59
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,830
So you would never go there because you couldn't feasibly do that.

60
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,560
So basically, demand is going to be captured in this. How are your revenues going to change with your output?

61
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,780
And then your resources are going to be on the cost side.

62
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,810
That sort of my question. So but number two, the concept that we've been talking about is like returns to scale.

63
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:22,190
Right? So if I have increasing returns to scale, then we'd expect my costs would be rising at a slower and slower rate as my water increases.

64
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:30,300
So if there is enough demand for my product, it says I want to be really big and it's really cheap for me to produce extra.

65
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,709
You have to look at the other hand, I've got decreasing returns to scale.

66
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,070
My costs are going to be rising faster and faster and faster with quantity, and that's going to eventually limit my size.

67
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,500
So if we want to just write profits as a function of quantity, as ultimately today we're saying, well, what's the what's the best quantity to produce?

68
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,810
My profit is a function of quantity or simply my total revenues when I produce quantity.

69
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,940
Q Minus my total across, I produce quantity. Q So I want to pick quantity.

70
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,160
Q That makes that gap, that difference between revenues and costs as big as possible.

71
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:19,750
So let's look at one example here and then we'll talk a little bit more about sort of why I drew the revenue curve,

72
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,240
total revenue curve with that sort of convex shape.

73
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,540
And then situations where we'll have a different shape for I now just kind of assume it looks like this and then we'll talk about,

74
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:38,050
you know, why it might look like that in some scenarios. And so this curve tells us how our revenues vary with quantity.

75
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,930
And then we've got what type of returns to scale is this firm have if we look at its total cost curve.

76
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,839
And this sort of S-shaped total cost curve where it's getting flatter and flatter,

77
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,170
and then all of a sudden it gets steeper and steeper called optimal, optimal scale.

78
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,770
Yeah. So we've got sort of an optimal scale to the cost curve here.

79
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,230
So quantities between zero and Q one. Are those any good at all?

80
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,890
I want to be in a quantity between zero and Q one. No, because there are always quantities.

81
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,370
My costs exceed my revenues, so I'm losing money.

82
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,940
So essentially, this bottom panel is just a graph of the difference between those two curves in the top panel.

83
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,950
When cost is greater than revenue, that difference is negative.

84
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,839
My profits are negative. So I see that I've got negative profits.

85
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,040
I'd be better off just shutting down. If I shut down, I could have zero profits.

86
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,570
I have no revenues, I have nothing to sell. But it's a long run situation.

87
00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:01,399
I know it's long run because that total cost curve starts at zero. So in the long run, I could avoid all costs if I produced nothing.

88
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,550
So why would I incur any costs? So I know the answer I get on the spot backstop level of profit of zero.

89
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,510
I can always earn zero profits by simply setting Q equals zero.

90
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,660
Whether it's going out of business, I'm not going to produce anything.

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,360
So I would never accept in the long run is a situation where profits are negative.

92
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:29,210
But now, wait a second. Once I get beyond Q one and see that now the total revenue curve has passed above the total cost curve,

93
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,270
so all those outputs between Q1 and Q2 are going to be profitable.

94
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,130
Now, if I somehow foolishly go beyond Q2, what happens again?

95
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,520
I've got to look, I'm again losing money because at that point, again,

96
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,710
the total cost curve has crossed above the total revenue curve and I'm unprofitable.

97
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,700
So I know for sure I want to be somewhere between Q1 and Q2 because I know that's better than shutting down.

98
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,420
I can always earn zero profits by shutting down. But wait a second.

99
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,930
I found some quantities where I could actually earn positive profits, so that's better.

100
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,340
Definitely don't want to be beyond Q2 is that I'm again losing money.

101
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,140
So what's the best quantity? And so a Q star.

102
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,220
So Q star essentially is the quantity where that gap is maximized.

103
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,980
So if you got start out here at Q one, so gap is growing and growing.

104
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,530
So I'm becoming more and more profitable. It's growing and growing and growing.

105
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,740
And then as I keep going beyond here, it starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking until it gets the profits disappear.

106
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:42,590
Q To. So the very best I can do is climbing up that hill.

107
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,450
I don't want to be down this valley of losses. I want to be up this hill of profits.

108
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,760
And the peak of that hill is a huge star. Now, what if we drew the engine line?

109
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,530
To both of those curves and you start to the total cost curve in the total revenue curve.

110
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,830
What do you see about that? Another parallel. Okay.

111
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,400
So the total revenue curve, the slope is marginal revenue.

112
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,940
How much does revenue rise as quantity rises? The slope of the total cost curve is what?

113
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:41,050
One of the classic curves we derive from it last time. Marginal cost, it's a slope of the total cost curve is marginal cost slope.

114
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:49,700
The total revenue curve is marginal revenue. So at that point where profits are maximized, marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

115
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,960
So we call that our golden rule for profit maximization.

116
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,490
So we want to find a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

117
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,210
Why is that? Suppose we do that same exercise aq1, for example.

118
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:17,520
Let's draw the tangent lines. The revenue curve is steeper than the cost curve.

119
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:29,920
So at Q1. Could that possibly be the profit maximizing quantity?

120
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,560
So what would be good to do? Increase quantity or decrease quantity?

121
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,100
And definitely increase that to say marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost.

122
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,930
That means if I produce another unit, my revenues are going to go up by more than my costs are going to go up.

123
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,590
So therefore my profits have to go up any time my revenues rise more than my costs for producing a unit of output,

124
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,810
that unit is profitable I should produce. So what if we did the same thing here?

125
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,240
Let's draw tangent lines at Q two.

126
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,200
You see that the total cost curve in Q2 is steeper than the total revenue curve.

127
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,440
In other words, marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue.

128
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,480
That says I'm actually losing money on that last unit. I shouldn't have produced it.

129
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:35,860
I should back off and produce less. It looks like before Q1, there's probably a point where the tangent lines are parallel as well.

130
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,850
So should we also say that more has to be greater than MSE?

131
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,190
And the tangent lines are parallel and. Total revenue has to be grand.

132
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,969
Total. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So. Yeah, that's a good point.

133
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:56,280
Because here you could also draw. Parallel tangent lines.

134
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:06,320
So in other words, if you put it in mathematical terms, marginal revenue equals marginal cost as a necessary condition for profit maximization.

135
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,700
It's not a sufficient condition. Sorry to bring it back to math, but that's kind of what I put in.

136
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,540
There are two, but there are two quantities where I'm already examined on this graph.

137
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:25,010
Only one of them is the graph of profit maximizing wanted. The other one is actually sort of like a loss maximizing probability over this region.

138
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,750
So that's actually as bad a quantity as I could possibly pick.

139
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,239
So more equals empathy is necessary for profit maximization.

140
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,230
It's not sufficient.

141
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:43,850
There might be more than one quantity where Amari equals C, and we have to check which one of those is actually the most profitable quantity.

142
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,480
In fact, in this case, one of them is actually a very unprofitable one,

143
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:55,610
so I sure as heck don't want to be here even though it meets my golden rule condition is the golden rule is sort of necessary but not sufficient.

144
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,940
So if to be a profit, maximizing quantity and bar has to equal AMC.

145
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,590
But just because mere equals M.S. doesn't make it a profit maximizing quantity.

146
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,290
Because we found two points where MA equals M.S. and one of them is actually a very stupid quantity to choose for the firm.

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,820
Is MA always going to equal M.S. at the inflection points on the profit curve?

148
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:32,720
So it's not just coincidence. It's not really a coincidence with an optimal scale type production function because the you know,

149
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,560
the firm, if you imagine this industry is made up of a whole bunch of firms,

150
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:45,650
it may be two, it may be ten, it may be 20, depending on sort of how big the the market is for that product relative to the quantity.

151
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:56,180
And we'd be sort of at the minimum average cost. But we would expect firms to be operating sort of close to that minimal average cost in the long run.

152
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,809
And then that's going to determine how, you know, how many firms can fit in the market.

153
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:06,799
Essentially, you know, if that minimum average cost is very small at a very small quantity, we're going to have lots of firms in that market.

154
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,490
If it's a big quantity, we're going to have fewer firms in the market.

155
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:18,620
But we wouldn't expect to see a lot of firms operating, say, at this point or at this point, because they'd be at a cost disadvantage.

156
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,910
So some of those would go out of business, or if they're out here,

157
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,160
maybe they'd merge with another firm that was too small so they could kind of get to that minimal average cost point.

158
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,920
So it's not really a coincidence in this case because the way that the way entry index.

159
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,020
So we're kind of jumping ahead to next week with the way entry and exit would work in a market.

160
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:49,350
If you weren't operating at your minimal average cost, you'd be at a cost disadvantage relative to your competitors.

161
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,390
So you either have to grow or shrink or exit, or maybe some new firms would enter.

162
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,229
If there are too few firms and they're all operating at too large of a quantity and

163
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,500
suddenly there aren't enough firms in this market and some new firms are going to enter.

164
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,890
So jumping ahead a little bit to next week, but it's not entirely a coincidence.

165
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,680
So that's a it's a good question. Yeah.

166
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,600
Now we're in the short run. How do we know we're in the short run?

167
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,620
What's different about the total cost curve here?

168
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,640
Yep, exactly. The intercept is not zero. So there's some fixed cost where in the long run, the definition of the long run.

169
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,150
So I can freely. Very, very the quantities of all of my inputs.

170
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,490
So if I could do that, why would I ever incur positive costs to produce zero output?

171
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,500
I say, wait a second, if it's in the long run, I'm producing nothing. Otherwise I'm not going to be in this industry.

172
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm shutting down. I would hire no capital and no labor, and I'd encourage zero costs.

173
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,610
In the short run, though, there's at least one input that I'm stuck with the amount I have.

174
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,310
So there's a fixed cost. So in the short run, we're going to see the total cost curve has a positive intercept here.

175
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,530
Even if I shut down, I can't avoid all of my costs.

176
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,820
I can avoid all my variable costs that some of these variable costs are called avoidable costs for just that reason.

177
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,760
But I can't avoid my fixed cost. Okay.

178
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,970
Now, should I shut down in the short run?

179
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:34,159
Is there any profitable quantity in the short run for this firm? Now you see these curves never intersect.

180
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,310
The total cost curve always remains above the total revenue.

181
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,750
So in other words, I'm going to lose money in the short run no matter what I do.

182
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,820
So really, my profit maximization problem in the short run is kind of converted in this case to a loss minimization problem.

183
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,370
So this firm is out of whack. They're going to lose money no matter what.

184
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,490
But if they shut down in a short run, what's their profit going to be?

185
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:07,150
While they have nothing to sell? So they get no revenues and they have fixed costs of F so shutting down.

186
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,879
Loses F dollars. Loses my fixed cost. So that's kind of my backstop level of profit.

187
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,970
We're talking a long run zero being the backstop level of profit.

188
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:23,500
In the long run, I can always earn zero profits by shutting down. So in the long run, I would never accept a situation where I'm losing money.

189
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,400
I'd leave the industry. It's better to do nothing and earn zero profits then to lose money.

190
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,840
In the short run, I might not shut down even though I'm losing money.

191
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,470
So the question is, can I at least find a positive quantity where I lose less money than half dollars,

192
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,790
where I can at least cover my variable costs and help pay at least part of my fixed costs?

193
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,980
And in this case, I can. The Q star again.

194
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:09,200
That's where if we do a tangent lines, they'd be parallel. And that gap, the loss is less than the gap at zero.

195
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,850
So in the short run, this firm is not in a very good position. It's going to lose money no matter what it does.

196
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,230
But you're better off losing less than half of dollars, then losing half dollars.

197
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,590
If you go back to the restaurant example, those are the things like different days of the week.

198
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:39,790
So I have this physical restaurant. I'm paying for it. If I decide that Monday is really slow and it's not worth being open,

199
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,570
do you think I can write a nice load to my landlord and say, Oh, by the way, I'm closing on Mondays?

200
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,670
So enclosed is 6/7 of your weekly rent payment.

201
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,930
Probably not. So I'm going to get evicted pretty quickly. Even if I write that note really nicely and explain that, you know,

202
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,100
I really just can't be open on Mondays, so it really shouldn't be paying my Monday rent.

203
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,450
So you're six, seven, so the week's rent and that's what I'm going to pay you for that from now on.

204
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,040
Okay. So I'm getting evicted from my restaurant. In other words, that rent as a fixed cost.

205
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:22,860
If I want to stay in business at a restaurant until my lease is up, I've got to pay that rent the four weeks rent, not just six or seven of it.

206
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,230
So if I decide Monday is so slow that if I were open at all, I would just make the bleeding worse.

207
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm better off just eating one seventh of my week's rent for a day that I'm closed.

208
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,019
Because I couldn't even make enough money, because Mondays are so slow to cover my labor,

209
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,380
my ingredients and my utilities that I would have to spend if I was opening it out Tuesdays a little better than Monday.

210
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:56,960
And maybe on Tuesdays I would say, You know what? I can't cover my full one seventh of the week's rent on Tuesday by being open.

211
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:06,050
But I can cover my labor, I can cover my ingredients, I can cover the extra utilities I used to run the stoves and things like that and the lights.

212
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,020
And I can have at least something left over to help me pay part of Tuesday's share of the rent.

213
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,680
So in that scenario I'd say on Monday I'd be better off closed because if I were open, I'd make the bleeding worse.

214
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,049
I couldn't even cover the variable costs that I have to incur on Monday to be open on Tuesday.

215
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,540
I said, I'm still losing money, money on Tuesdays,

216
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,620
but I am able to cover my variable costs and have a little something left over to help me with Tuesday's rent.

217
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,309
Now, maybe Wednesday is kind of a million people start going out to dinner again on Wednesdays and Wednesday.

218
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,520
I kind of break even. In other words, I'm paying my full.

219
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,680
I can pay all my variable costs and I'm covering one seventh of the week's rent.

220
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,980
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'm actually making profits. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'm busy enough.

221
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,640
I can cover my variable costs. I can cover one seventh of each of those days rents and I've got money left over.

222
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:10,200
So in that scenario I'd say, Well, Monday would be kind of like this.

223
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,300
Here's my loss of f dollars. If I stayed open, it would just get worse.

224
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,110
So Monday and I produce Q equals zero.

225
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,830
I mean, it is my fixed cost, which is that day's rent I can't get out of.

226
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,510
Tuesday is kind of like this. And I'd say, Yeah, it's worth being open.

227
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,630
I can't cover one seventh of my week's rent on Tuesday, but I could at least cover some of it.

228
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:49,970
And that's better than covering none of it. You know, Wednesday, maybe I'm at the scenario where my profits look like this.

229
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,360
So I roughly break even. So on Wednesday I can cover the full day's rent, but I don't have any profit left over.

230
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:09,340
But that's definitely better than losing that day's rent if I shut down on Wednesdays, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

231
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm in a situation where I definitely want to be open because not only am I covering the rent, I've actually got profit left over.

232
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,750
So in the short run, just because you're losing money doesn't mean you'll shut down.

233
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,250
On the Monday scenario, I'll shut down because if I were open, I just lose more and more and more money.

234
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,530
So it might as well just eat Monday's rent as a loss. Take the day off.

235
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,410
Tuesday. I'm not making money, but I'm at least covering part of Tuesday's rent, so I'm still better off open on Tuesdays.

236
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,100
The original graph of the week was Tuesday Wednesday uncovering the red, not making any profit.

237
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,210
But on the weekends I'm really busy. I'm making profits. So the only day I ought to shut down is Monday.

238
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:15,090
That analogy kind of makes sense. All right.

239
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,510
Now, what about the shape of the total revenue curve? So we start out with this sort of concave shape.

240
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,500
It's going to be a term it's going to be determined basically by how competitive the market for that product is.

241
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,660
Let's now take a scenario where a firm is very, very, very tiny relative to the market it operates in.

242
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,440
So we have an example for that other than about wheat farmers and example maybe something else.

243
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,760
I think of things like commodity markets, you know, various agricultural products where there are many producers around the world.

244
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,680
So each producer. It's pretty small relative to the market.

245
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:12,810
So if I'm a wheat farmer in North Dakota and I'm making my decisions at the beginning of the year, I've got a certain amount of acres.

246
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,720
How many of them am I going to plant this year? How many of I'm going to leave fallow of the ones I plant?

247
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,549
How intensively am I going to cultivate them? Am I going to weed them very aggressively to maximize my yield?

248
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,860
Am I going to irrigate them? Am I going to use fertilizers?

249
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,070
So how intensively am I going to cultivate those acres that I am planning?

250
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,480
Those are decisions they're going to determine at the end of the year, along with a lot of weather.

251
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,080
How many bushels of wheat do I have to sell?

252
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:55,830
So do you think my personal decisions on any of those variables are ultimately going to affect the price so I can sell that wheat for.

253
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:10,410
Or is it a drop in the bucket? It's a drop in the bucket, even by a pretty big wheat farmer by North Dakota standards.

254
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,350
I'm producing a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of 1% of the world's wheat.

255
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,820
So my decision to produce, say, 10% more or 10% less on my own farm is absolutely negligible.

256
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,840
It's going to have no discernible impact on the price of wheat when I go to sell it.

257
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,600
That's going to be determined by the world market. How much wheat is there in the whole world and what's the demand for wheat in the whole world?

258
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:47,090
So what would my total revenue curve that look like to be a straight line?

259
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,150
In other words, marginal revenue should be constant. Straight line has a constant slope.

260
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,910
So marginal revenue equals price. So I've got this price that's determined externally to me.

261
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,510
It's determined in the world market. I have no no ability to impact that price whatsoever.

262
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,350
If I doubled bi output, that wouldn't lower the world price of wheat because even doubling my output, nobody would notice.

263
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,580
But we saw negligible relative to the world price of wheat.

264
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:23,450
If I cut my output by 50%, I would say, wow, if I cut my output back 50% of the to charge twice as much for my wheat.

265
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:30,050
No, because again, losing 50% of my production, the world market of wheat is not going to even notice that.

266
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,040
So my marginal revenue was just going to be equal to my price, which is not determined by my own quantity.

267
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:48,160
It's independent of my own quantity. So if price is independent of quantity, then my total revenue curve ought to look like this.

268
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,700
It's just going to be happy times. Q. Where he is determined by the world market for wheat.

269
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:08,260
It's not determined by my own quantity choice. So marginal revenue is going to be constant and it's going to be equal to the price of wheat.

270
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:14,260
And again, that price of wheat doesn't depend on my quantity. It's determined externally I react to that price.

271
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,210
So that's why we call a firm in a commodity market like that, a price taker.

272
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,330
They observe the price and then they react so they can see.

273
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,940
So if I have a certain number of bushels of wheat and I observe the world price of wheat,

274
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,730
and I say it's really high, I could react by selling all of my wheat at that high price.

275
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,750
And me selling all of my wheat at that price is not going to make the price drop.

276
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,290
If it's really low, I have a couple of choices. I can sell it at the low price.

277
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,390
I'd be disappointed, but at least I know what I'm getting.

278
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,970
Where I can speculate, I can store my wheat. And hope that the market price goes up.

279
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:04,159
But my decision to sell versus store is not big enough relative to the world

280
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,790
market for wheat to have any influence on whether the price is going to go up.

281
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,790
That's purely speculation on my part. It's low now.

282
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,219
Maybe it'll go up. I'll take my chances instead of getting my revenue.

283
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:25,780
Now, I'm going to put it in a grain silo and wait and hope that I can get a higher price in the future.

284
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,820
But whether there's a higher price in the future is not going to be influenced by my decision to have stored that wheat.

285
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm not sold it now because that's too small to influence the price.

286
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,480
So what is the demand for my product look like? I'm a single wheat farmer.

287
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,589
It's not the world demand for wheat. This is just the demand for my wheat farmer.

288
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:55,650
Jones's Wheat. North Dakota Farmer Jones has a price tag or there's some market price.

289
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:04,350
And Farmer Jones believes I can sell any quantity of wheat I want to without changing that price.

290
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,350
If I try to sell a little bit of wheat, I'll get PM per bushel.

291
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,139
If I sell medium amount, I'll get PM per bushel.

292
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,180
If I sell a lot of wheat, they're going to a lot by my standards, not a lot by the standards of the world.

293
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:29,790
I still get PM. The other hand, what if I went to my local grain elevator operator and said, you know, PM, that price really stinks.

294
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:36,450
I refuse to sell it at PM I demand p star. What does a grain elevator operator get?

295
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,440
Tell me how much how much wheat are they going to buy from me if you start losing zero?

296
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,710
Exactly. Can say, well, wait a second. I've got thousands of other wheat farmers who are happy to sell it to me at PM.

297
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,660
Why would I give you a penny more than that? So in other words,

298
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:02,420
the demand for my weed is absolutely zero at any price above the market price for weed because somebody else will sell it at the market price.

299
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:10,200
So why would you give me even a penny more? And it's horizontal at the market price of wheat because at that point,

300
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,810
if I'm willing to sell at the market price, I can sell any quantity I want to without affecting that price.

301
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,890
Because, again, even if I even if I try to sell a lot by my personal standards, if the world doesn't care.

302
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:28,070
That's so negligible relative to the market price of wheat that it's not going to drop.

303
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,060
So it's good news and bad news. Bad news is I have no ability to charge higher price.

304
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,370
The good news is, well, at least I don't have to reduce my price to sell more of my wheat.

305
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:48,550
I can sell whatever I have without reducing the price. Okay.

306
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,550
So let's just redo the graph for a price taker. We still got the golden rule.

307
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,330
We've still got the two different quantities where the Golden Rule was satisfied.

308
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,780
One being actually a bad quantity, sort of maximizing losses in the region between zero and Q one.

309
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,230
So we don't want that one. We want Q Star.

310
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,890
We maximize profits. So we.

311
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,410
We still have the golden rule. We look for a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

312
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:36,180
But now we know for a price taker. Our general revenue is just equal to the price, so we can just substitute live forever.

313
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,520
So all we're doing is we're changing our golden rule by the realization that for a price taker,

314
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,629
price equals marginal revenue Y, because the total revenue curve is a straight line.

315
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,850
So marginal revenue is constant. What's the slope of that straight line?

316
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,520
It's going to be the price. Save the prices.

317
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:13,880
$2 a bushel, then the total revenue curve. Just price times quantity would be to you the slope of that curve as to some marginal revenue as to.

318
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:21,510
So all we're doing is we're substituting P for M.R. in the Golden Rule to account for the fact that, hey, this is really easy.

319
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,380
We know that marginal revenue equals price when the firm is a price taker.

320
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,270
So they're looking for a quantity where price equals marginal cost.

321
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,920
Okay. Now, what if we have a firm? It's a very different market position.

322
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:46,680
It faces a downward sloping demand curve for its product. In other words, if it wants to sell more, it has to accept a lower price.

323
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,160
What might be an example of that name.

324
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:58,510
Affirmative might face a downward sloping demand for its product rather than an externally given market price.

325
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:05,340
Like a weed farmer would face. Oil.

326
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,299
But oil. Well, yes, a very big producer of oil.

327
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,820
So say if you consider like Saudi Arabia, a producer of oil and they produce.

328
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,410
No, not 0.01% of the world's oil.

329
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,690
They produce, say, 10% of the world's oil. So if they were to say double how much oil they pump,

330
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:34,830
price of oil is going to drop because them doubling their output is not negligible relative to the world market for oil.

331
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,200
So it's very different. The wheat farmer, one wheat farmer in the world doubles their output.

332
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,790
The market price is not going to budge. That's negligible.

333
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,400
What about Ford? How many cars do you think Ford makes a year for sale in the United States?

334
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:04,250
A couple million and the number of, let's say, 2 million to 2 million cars a year for sale in the United States.

335
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,770
What if Ford were to say, hey, you know, next year we want to sell 4 million cars in the United States?

336
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,729
You think you could sell 4 million cars for the exact same price?

337
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:22,880
That it could have sold 2 million cars? No, because all of a sudden cars are piling up on dealer lots.

338
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:29,210
Dealers are going to be haggling over price. Ford is going to have to offer rebates to move the cars off the dealer lots.

339
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,980
So relative to the market for automobiles, Ford is not a small player.

340
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,320
So their quantity decisions definitely have some influence on the price they can set.

341
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,640
They're free to sell more cars. But they would have to accept a lower price in order to do so.

342
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,220
They're free to set a higher price. But what do they have to accept in order to set a higher price?

343
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:05,620
They'd lose some sales then. So in other words, since the demand for their product is downward sloping, they can sell more, but only at a lower price.

344
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,180
They could set a higher price, but only at the penalty of sacrificing some sales.

345
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,410
Another is accepting a lower quantity. They face this trade off.

346
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:25,450
They're constrained by their demand curve. So let's kind of see that on this graph.

347
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,630
Suppose it's deciding between two different output levels. I could sell three or I could sell for.

348
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,790
If I sold three, I would then ask myself, what's the highest price I can get away with?

349
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,130
Or What's the highest price at which the market would buy three units of output from me?

350
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,700
That's going to be $7. So what are my revenues be?

351
00:37:53,570 --> 00:38:04,760
$7 times. Three units of the area of that red rectangle is going to be $21.

352
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,270
It's seven units times $3 a year are $7 times three units.

353
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,330
Okay. So what if I wanted to sell four instead of three?

354
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:27,630
Could I sell four at a price of $7 a unit? You know, because that's outside my demand curve.

355
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,970
So the only way I can sell for. This to accept a lower price.

356
00:38:38,070 --> 00:39:02,200
Of $6 per unit. So there's my revenues, $24.

357
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,560
So the area those boxes are my revenues that the two different choices I could make.

358
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,940
The first one is skinnier but taller. Taller is good.

359
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm getting a higher price per unit. Skinnier is bad for my revenues.

360
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,050
I'm selling fewer units. The second one is shorter.

361
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,850
That's bad. Got a lower price per unit, but it's wider. That's good for my revenues.

362
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:32,470
So what's the marginal revenue of the fourth unit? Mean it's going to be.

363
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,140
It's going to be two eight. It.

364
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,390
Now, look at the two the two different revenue numbers.

365
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,270
So what's. This is my. This is my revenue. When I sell three, that's my revenue I sell for.

366
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,330
So that's my marginal revenue of the fourth unit. $3, $3 I revenues go up by $3.

367
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,860
Now, what was the price? The six?

368
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,200
So in this case, marginal revenue is less than price.

369
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,130
Remember the price taker? We said marginal revenue equals price. Why?

370
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:18,340
Because for a price taker, if I sold that fourth unit, I wouldn't have to reduce the price.

371
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,820
So that box showing my revenues graphically would be getting wider, but it wouldn't be getting any shorter.

372
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:35,139
So here we have. The difference between those two boxes as two areas there is a loss of $3 is I'm losing

373
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:41,020
a dollar per unit times the three units I could have sold at the higher price of seven.

374
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:53,120
There's a gain of $6 because I'm getting $6 for one extra unit and I couldn't sell at the higher price of seven.

375
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,210
So selling that fourth unit for $6 gains $6 in revenues kind of, obviously,

376
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,809
but it costs me $3 in revenues that I could have had if I wouldn't have sold that fortunate.

377
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,970
That is, I could have charged a higher price.

378
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:18,060
So I'm gaining from the revenue of that extra unit I'm selling, but I'm losing because I have to reduce the price in order to sell that extra unit.

379
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,150
I stayed or did not have to make that type of a tradeoff. Sager.

380
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,800
Their demand curve was horizontal. So if they were to say, well, why not sell three units?

381
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,160
And let's just say hypothetically, the market price was seven or under sell four units.

382
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:45,180
What happens to their revenues? That's 21.

383
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:55,390
The bigger one is 28. The marginal revenue will be seven, which is equal to the price.

384
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,520
So the price taker doesn't need to sacrifice price in order to increase quantity.

385
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,650
So that's why our equals p for a price taker resume is less than P for a firm facing a downward sloping demand curve.

386
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:16,210
And firms that are slow sloping demand curve as basically has to pick a price quantity combination on their demand curve.

387
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:23,770
And they're welcome to set as higher price as they want to at the penalty of reducing their sales,

388
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,380
because fewer people buy the product at a higher price. They're welcome to increase their sales,

389
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:36,490
but in a penalty of having to charge a lower price because not so many people will buy that product at a high price.

390
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,110
You have to ultimately decide what's the best point in terms of that trade off.

391
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,810
So, you know, way back to consumer theory when we get linear demand curves.

392
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:06,600
One of the things that we. Show then is the midpoint of a linear demand curve is the point where the elasticity of demand is exactly negative y.

393
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,270
And we said that upper portion is the elastic portion.

394
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,410
So if demand is elastic, it makes sense that marginal revenue is going to be positive.

395
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,229
Is elastic demand means quantity goes up by a greater percentage than price goes down.

396
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,200
So if I drop my price by a certain percentage, my quantity is going to go up by a bigger percentage.

397
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,470
So revenue price times quantity has got to go up.

398
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:44,970
Now, what if I were on the inelastic and I actually just do a quick elasticity calculation going from the price of seven to a price of six.

399
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,340
So how big a decrease in prices? That's a 14% decline in price.

400
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,460
What happened to quantity one went from 3 to 4 and that's a 33% increase in quantity.

401
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,679
Elasticity is a percent change in quarter divided by percent change in price.

402
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,570
So it's 33 divided by -14, it's -2.3.

403
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,720
So we're definitely on the elastic part of the demand curve.

404
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,620
I cut my price by quantity goes up more than proportionately, so my revenues are going to go up.

405
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,780
So if I'm on the elastic part of the demand curve, marginal revenue is going to be greater than zero.

406
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,850
So let's do the same thing on the inelastic portion of the demand.

407
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:39,240
The firm is choosing between these two points on their demand curve. They could charge a price of three and sell a quantity of seven.

408
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:53,200
In the areas, their total revenue price of three times the quantity of seven is $21.

409
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,730
Or they could say, Well, I want to sell an eighth unit.

410
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,450
Problem is to sell an eighth unit. I've got to drop price to $2.

411
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,560
So what my revenues be if I sold eight units.

412
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:18,540
So what's the marginal revenue of the year? Negative five.

413
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,270
I actually lose $5 in revenue. Just think about what happens with the elasticity.

414
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:36,310
Now we've got a 33% drop in price going from 3 to 2 and then only going on 14% increase in quantity going from 7 to 8.

415
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,560
So the elasticity we can now flip the numbers, it's about 14% increase in quantity, divided by 33% reduction in price.

416
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:51,520
And now that's less than one, an absolute value on the inelastic portion of the demand curve.

417
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,060
So does it make sense for me to produce an eighth unit?

418
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,800
Definitely not, because you have profits as being my revenues and my costs.

419
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:06,070
Well, I've dropped my revenues by $5, so that's obviously bad for my profits.

420
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,940
And I've had to incur extra input costs to produce an eighth unit.

421
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:18,840
So my costs have gone up. So moving from 7 to 8 units of output here is clearly a loser.

422
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:25,610
I've cut my revenues and I've raised my costs in order to accomplish that reduction in revenues.

423
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Okay. I'm firing this manager instantaneously. If they produce it with you, it.

424
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,560
So we've got the marginal revenue curves for the firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve.

425
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:58,250
And so we see a marginal revenue is declining, was up on the high portion of the demand curve, the elastic part was positive.

426
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:06,680
And then I moved out of the elastic part to became negative. So I see the marginal revenue is declining as quantity increases.

427
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,020
Now as linear demand curves is actually really easy to figure out the marginal revenue curve.

428
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:27,910
For any linear demand curve, the marginal revenue curve. It's going to have the exact same price intercept.

429
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,590
It will be exactly twice as steep. I'll try to make some sense out of that in a moment.

430
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,850
But just remember us. That's going to be true for any labor demand curve.

431
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:49,419
We could use calculus to prove it. So then you have calculus to prove that you have.

432
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:57,970
And that's certainly a matter of trust here. So the marginal revenue curve is going to have the same intercept as the price.

433
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,440
Access is going to be twice as steep. If it's twice as steep,

434
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:11,650
that means where is it going to intersect the quantity access in turn from positives and negatives that mean exactly half the distance here.

435
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:20,740
So in terms of quantity, that would be at the midpoint of the demand curve, which is where the elasticity was exactly negative one.

436
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,250
So there's as long as the elasticity is greater than one, an absolute value EMR is positive.

437
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,970
MA is exactly equals zero. Where.

438
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,610
Let's test the negative one and then marriage turns negative.

439
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:49,380
Once we're at the inelastic portion of the demand curve. So we've got our demand curve Q equals ten minus P or we solve it for P.

440
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,620
So that demand curve has a price intercept of ten, a slope of negative one.

441
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:08,000
So therefore, the associated marginal revenue curve. It's going to be ten minus two.

442
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:17,030
Q. The exact same intercept, but double the slope, negative two rather than negative one.

443
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,500
So let's take a look at just some numerical examples using this demand curve.

444
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,160
Well, obviously, if my price is ten, my revenues are going to be zero.

445
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,980
Is it a price of ten? Nobody wants my product at all. So if I can't sell anything, I've got no revenues.

446
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:42,080
So obviously, if I drop my price to nine, I'm going to positive marginal revenues because now somebody is going to buy my product.

447
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,460
I'm going to sell one unit at a price of nine. My total revenue is nine.

448
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:52,640
The marginal revenue of that first unit is $9, just nine -0.

449
00:49:53,510 --> 00:50:00,659
I produce a second unit. Well, I'm going to have to reduce my price. I can't sell two units for $9 apiece.

450
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:08,330
If I want to sell two units, I could only charge $8 apiece. However, eight times two is 16 and that's still more than nine.

451
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,140
My marginal revenue is still positive.

452
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:19,050
It's fallen to seven, but I'm still gaining revenue as I lower my price and increase my quantity and resources that move down my demand curve.

453
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,350
Where is my revenue maximized? Right at the midpoint of that demand curve.

454
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:30,800
If I sell a quantity of five, the highest price I can get away with charging is five.

455
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:38,370
My revenues are 25 and I see if I sell that sixth unit, all of a sudden my revenue begins to decline.

456
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,570
So my revenue is going up and up and up and up until I hit the midpoint of that demand curve.

457
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,780
And then it goes down and down and down and down. If I keep lowering the.

458
00:50:50,150 --> 00:51:01,870
Price a lot of the inelastic portion of the demand curve. There's our demand curve that we just drew and the associated marginal revenue curve.

459
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,240
So now how do I calculate the profit maximizing quantity?

460
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,560
I also need to know something about my marginal costs. I want to.

461
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:22,620
I want to apply the golden rule mirror equals empathy. So we start out with the demand curve.

462
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:30,390
Q equals ten minus P or since we grappled with P as the Y variable will solve it for y equals ten minus Q.

463
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,430
And then like we did, we said, well, that means the marginal revenue curve is also very simple.

464
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,420
It's ten minus two. Q. Same intercept and double the slope.

465
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:47,710
So there's our marginal revenue curve, and I suppose this firm has constant marginal costs of $2 a unit.

466
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:51,940
So it's the constant returns. Firm marginal cost is horizontal.

467
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,540
And two. So now we can say, well, just supply this rule.

468
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:07,990
Send me A equals of C and solve for Q. There's marginal revenue that are equal to the marginal cost of $2, and we see that Q equals four.

469
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:16,840
So that's the best quantity. Are we done now with determining a firm's profit, maximizing decisions, or we only have half of it.

470
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,740
See you shaking your head. What do we still need? Need?

471
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,120
Plug it back into the demand curve to see what the price exactly.

472
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:32,760
So the profit maximizing quantity is for. But then I have to ask myself, well, what's the profit maximizing price is based on?

473
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,850
That would be the highest price I could set and expect to actually sell those four units.

474
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:45,830
So if I plug Q equals four into the demand curve. P equals ten minus four and that's going to be six.

475
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,450
I'd love to charge $7 for four units. What's the problem?

476
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,060
Only three people will buy it at a price of seven. So I've got one unit sitting here unsold.

477
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:02,220
Is there any reason why you should only charge $5 if I only want to sell four units?

478
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,660
No, because I could sell five units at the price of $5. If I only have four to sell, why not charge six?

479
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,860
How do you know that? At this point, we're more equals. I'm see.

480
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:21,960
The total revenues will be greater than the total cost because isn't that jumped ahead?

481
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:32,690
So there's our profits. So our revenue is going to be $24 price times cost for price.

482
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,190
Times quantity. If marginal cost is constant at two.

483
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,899
That's right. That means the first unit has a marginal cost of $2.

484
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,760
The second unit is a marginal cost as we are as a third unit. The fourth unit, they all have marginal cost of $2.

485
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,220
So our total cost are just going to be two times Q. These are that linear.

486
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:01,420
Marginal cost curve or the horizontal marginal cost curve, there's a marginal cost of two.

487
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,050
It's going to give a linear total cost curve.

488
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,110
So the quarter for our total cost is eight.

489
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,090
Can there be some interest costs that we've already paid in this case?

490
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:26,280
So the total cost might not necessarily be too few. So this is kind of implicitly a long run situation.

491
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,110
So because I've got the total costs sort of starting at the origin, if this were a short run situation,

492
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:38,040
you could say, well, my short run marginal cost is two and maybe I have a fixed cost of $10 that I've already paid.

493
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,350
So that I would then need to net that $10 out of my profits as well.

494
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,170
So if this is a short run situation, you could have a short run marginal cost of $2 per unit,

495
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,180
but your total cost would be f dollars of fixed costs plus two q.

496
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:01,460
So in that case you would have to that method fixed costs out. Fixed costs were 20 then you actually be unprofitable.

497
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,749
You'd have to decide, well, negative four.

498
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:10,360
I'd still be open because I'd lose that whole $20 fixed cost if I were closed.

499
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,550
So it's still worth being open. Even though I'm losing money.

500
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:26,220
So if there were a fixed cost, then we'd have you know, you could have say short run, total cost to say $10 plus to two.

501
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,910
Q If there was a $10 fixed cost or $20 plus two.

502
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,270
Q If it was a $20 fixed cost, yeah. And that to calculate profit, you would need to net that fixed cost out of it as well.

503
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:51,010
Okay. It is 925, so I better turn it over to the speakers.

504
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:13,760
Fortunately about prices. Hi, everyone.

505
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,780
So today we're going to be talking about pricing and health care.

506
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,640
So to give an overview of what we're going to be discussing today, so we have two articles.

507
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:29,420
The first article is going to be discussed by myself, Manisha and Jacob.

508
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,500
And then the second article is going to be discussed by Sam and Morgan.

509
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,660
And then we will have some discussion questions for you guys to engage with as we go through the presentation.

510
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:46,040
So to give an introduction to the first article, which is called The Price Ain't Right.

511
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,220
So a little background is there's over 61% of the U.S. population that has private health insurance.

512
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,850
And this accounts for nearly 34% of total health spending.

513
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:04,490
So in 2017, the average insurance premium for employee sponsored health coverage for a family of four was $18,764.

514
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,710
And between 2001 and 2017, premiums increased by 55%.

515
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:17,840
And so what this study did was it used newly accessible claims data from three of the five largest health insurers in the U.S.,

516
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:26,450
which is Humana and UnitedHealth. And it included 88 million individuals and over $165 billion in spending per year.

517
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,920
So what this study did was it kind of broke it up into three phases.

518
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,480
And we will go through all of these phases. So you guys have a clearer understanding of what they did.

519
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,480
So first, I will be discussing the data and variables used.

520
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:49,820
So first, so the main source of the study's data came from the Health Care Cost Institute data, also known as the CCI.

521
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,570
And this data covers all health services paid for by insurers from 2007 to 2011.

522
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:01,700
And this figure here on the right shows hospital mergers and acquisitions by year.

523
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:07,070
So as we can see, the main data they covered was the 2007 through 2011.

524
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:10,790
And this is where they consistently saw an increase in mergers.

525
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:20,810
And then the data focuses on individuals between the ages of 18 and 64, and they all have payors that are within the HCI data.

526
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,790
So the next in the data and variables are these sample definitions.

527
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,609
So there are three broad sub samples from the HDI data.

528
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:35,810
This is spending samples and price samples and procedure samples.

529
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:44,210
So what spending samples are? Is there a measure of inpatient overall spending per year from privately insured beneficiaries?

530
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:51,410
And inpatient price samples are derived from hospital claims for all inpatient care provided to the covered population,

531
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,190
which is the age range of 18 to 64 as stated before.

532
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:02,720
And then the procedure samples capture claims from hospital based, surgical or diagnostic inpatient and outpatient procedures.

533
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,690
And then this table here, there's a lot going on here,

534
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:10,850
but essentially what it's doing is it's reporting the summary statistics for the inpatient sample.

535
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:16,160
So here you can see the mean standard deviations of all of these samples used in the data.

536
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,490
Next is measuring hospital level prices. So hospitals vary and a mix of services they offer.

537
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:31,120
And as a result, there's a general concern when analyzing differences in prices across hospitals is the

538
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:36,400
variation in prices could reflect observed in items are differences in the quality of care,

539
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:44,110
mix of care or the quantity of care provided. So with this, the article will address these issues in the following ways.

540
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,970
So first they showed or they relied on risk adjusted price measures.

541
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:55,480
Secondly, they showed results are stable when we control for hospital quality using for a variety of measures.

542
00:59:56,350 --> 01:00:00,340
Three they measure price variation across plausibly undifferentiated services.

543
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:09,550
So this could be such as like a lower limb MRI. There's little variation in services like this across hospitals or within hospitals,

544
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:16,150
and therefore they define procedures narrowly by a choice of clinical codes and exclude cases with complication.

545
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:21,370
And then five, they limited the age of patients analyzed by procedure of narrow age groups.

546
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:27,190
And they did this in older patients or an atypically young patients may raise costs.

547
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:36,700
And then lastly, as these statistics distribute, sorry, descriptive statistics on prices.

548
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:41,890
So if we take a look over here on table three there,

549
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:48,910
this one is showing the correlation between different inpatient services that are provided within the hospital.

550
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:55,510
So what they found was there's a high correlation in prices within service lines like orthopedics.

551
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:00,729
So I don't know if you guys can really see it there, but if you get like a hip and a knee replacement,

552
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,090
those have a high correlation and 0.9 for that one.

553
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,070
And then if you look at services that have a weaker correlation across service lines,

554
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,840
so like for example, knee replacement and vaginal delivery, it's only 0.5.

555
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:19,030
And then this figure to here this there's a lot going on here,

556
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:24,940
but essentially what they're showing is there's a substantial difference, A, that Medicare and private insurers pay.

557
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:33,010
So the article calculated that private prices were set at about 120% of Medicare rates rather than at their current levels.

558
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,420
The inpatient spending on the privately insured would drop to 19.7%.

559
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,050
And then I will hand it over to Manisha to explain the variations.

560
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:46,120
Okay. Okay. So I'm talking about spending variation in health care.

561
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:53,529
So first, you can see on this graph, you can see there is a geographic variation in spending like Alaska,

562
01:01:53,530 --> 01:02:03,400
which has the highest how health care spending is like three times higher than the Hawaii, which has the lowest spend in health care.

563
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,770
And you can see that we learn from each MP 600 that spending equals prices times quantities.

564
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:22,900
So from a medicare perspective, you can see that the prices do not like vary across providers, but the quantities differ across each ours.

565
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,189
And from privately insured perspective you can see both price and quantities contributes to the spending,

566
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:37,120
especially the prices, the prices as related to the negotiation between providers and insurers.

567
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,910
So now we talk about prices. Then what's the variation and hospital prices?

568
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:51,520
First, you can also see the there is a geographic variation between prices across each ours take and patient prices.

569
01:02:51,520 --> 01:03:02,110
For example, you can see that Canada for India has the highest price and patient price and it's like four times higher than the Louisiana,

570
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:08,710
which has the lowest inpatient price. So not only across ours, there is a price difference.

571
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:16,300
Also price variation within hospital take lower lump MRI as examples that you can see from this graph.

572
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:24,730
Insurers pay different prices for the same services, and if you are a stronger insurers, you can negotiate a lower prices.

573
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:31,390
So we know there's a difference between prices and spendings.

574
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:38,440
So how about contracts? Now you have to know that there are three types of intra hospital contracts.

575
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:46,570
First, as a perspective, stock prices, which means that the insurer pays a fixed amount of payments based on DRG.

576
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:55,810
So because this is a fixed amount of price payment, so the hospital or providers have a strong incentive to contract their cost.

577
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:00,790
Another kind of contract, a share of charges.

578
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:05,080
So it means that the insurer pays a percentage of hospital charges.

579
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:12,190
And comparing to the that process contracts, the hospitals have a less pressure to reduce their their cost.

580
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:17,430
And the last types of contract is hybrid payments basically it's as a.

581
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:22,360
Prices contract, but the insurer is willing to pay more of that.

582
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,410
The hospital costs are higher than the average cost.

583
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:33,550
So bargaining power is also an effects of the types of contracts.

584
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:38,920
So in this study, they found that if you all have stronger bargaining power,

585
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:44,680
your share of charge contracts will increase and your stock price, those contracts would decrease.

586
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,360
So they shows that evidence of different types of contracts.

587
01:04:49,360 --> 01:05:00,460
And this this graph you can see on the right triangle represents they have absolute prices represents the assets prices contract.

588
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:10,780
And for the Blue Circle Line, you can see they have a cent of the same constant percents of charges, which represents the share of charge contracts.

589
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:16,299
So there there's to take away from my part here is that a single hospital has

590
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:21,190
multiple forms of contracts and different insurers have different bargaining power.

591
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:25,690
So what's the payment contrast linked to Medicare?

592
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:34,600
You can see and the hospital, A, they sets their percentage of Medicare rates and the same rates and hospital B,

593
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,560
they do not correlate to the medical care, Medicare rates.

594
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:48,460
So in this study, they found like 23% of cases of our share of charge payments and not directly linked to Medicare.

595
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,410
But up to 57% of total cases are linked to Medicare payments.

596
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay. All right, guys.

597
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:03,530
So I'm going to start up my part by talking about the negotiation between providers and hospitals with insurers.

598
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:10,009
These negotiations are affected by different factors. A huge factor is leverage.

599
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,420
So a lot of this is influenced by the market share that that institution has in that area.

600
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,990
If they have a larger market share, they're obviously going to have more bargaining power and more kind of clout in that negotiation.

601
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:27,950
Demand shifts. So if new hospital rankings come out and a hospital sees a bump in their ratings,

602
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:33,290
that may affect the way that they're able to negotiate with payers supply shift.

603
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:40,130
So things like labor costs, not only just the cost of labor, but if there is a significant event at a institution.

604
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,130
So say a nurses strike, something like that over time.

605
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:49,280
Those strikes have ripples and impacts within institutions and that also affects the negotiations.

606
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:58,610
So going to prices, there's many, many different things that affect the price of something at a hospital.

607
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:04,010
I'm just going to touch on a couple of them. So hospital type, whether it's for profit or not.

608
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,850
For profit. For profit hospitals tend to have slightly higher prices.

609
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:11,599
Technology use. So things like cutting edge technology,

610
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:17,570
things that are that require a significant amount of R&D that's going to raise the overall price at an institution,

611
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,720
the major reimburse reimbursed type.

612
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:29,900
So this has to deal with, you know, what share of patients that are in institution are covered by Medicare or Medicaid versus private insurance.

613
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:35,960
So generally, if you have more government covered payers, the price is going to be lower.

614
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,370
And competition rankings. Local market share. Cost of living.

615
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:45,260
Not as much as you would think. But those are other things that also affect it.

616
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,260
So prices and contracting type.

617
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:55,920
So like I just said, larger share of Medicare patients means that you're going to have lower private prices in that area for that institution.

618
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,080
So each CCI data insurers have a higher local market share.

619
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:03,540
When this happens, you see prices that are generally much lower.

620
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:07,830
And this could be due to many things, but maybe price transparency.

621
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:15,660
The data is shared with researchers. So it could be could become made public institutions that have a heavy technology investment.

622
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,810
So they have like the brand new MRI is the most advanced technology.

623
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:26,010
This increases the overall price at an institution, and this is just due to the upfront costs, cost of the R&D.

624
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:34,170
And then acquiring that capital is very costly. So some individual procedure results.

625
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:40,380
So areas with a monopoly hospital, they do have higher prices across nearly all of their procedures.

626
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:45,090
The differences in the procedures and their prices vary.

627
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:50,280
So something like a hip replacement in under monopoly, generally about five, 6% higher.

628
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,299
But when you get to certain other things, like an MRI, for example, over a 23% increase.

629
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:05,160
So a very, very noticeable increase in price. One thing to consider when looking at like monopolistic environments versus, you know,

630
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:10,830
a situation where you may have multiple institutions in a given area is that monopoly hospitals may have to

631
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:16,650
perform more complex procedures because they're the only institution in the area that is actually able to do it.

632
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:22,830
So this also increases costs because they have to bring in specialty equipment, specialty providers.

633
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:27,390
There's a large upfront costs associated with these complex procedures.

634
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:34,800
Their market concentration is positively associated, associated with the percentage of cases paid as a share of charges.

635
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:45,730
So moving to robustness. So the results in this article, they actually took a lot of measures to make sure that they actually were strong.

636
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:48,729
So the things that they did, the results,

637
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:55,390
they looked at them and basically they determined that the results were not sensitive to the size cutoffs for the sample size.

638
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:59,350
They did different market definitions for urban and rural areas.

639
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:04,419
So that's very important because in an urban environment, it could be very different than, say, you know,

640
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:08,950
in an area where there's hardly anyone living and they only have one hospital that's a critical access hospital.

641
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,120
They use different size radius to define the market.

642
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:21,939
So different radii, essentially, they can basically look at the space that an area is and do their analysis based on that.

643
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:29,050
So if they change that, they can make it fit more with different areas and concentrations of hospitals in those areas.

644
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:37,840
And they also dropped the most extreme observations. These mainly came from markets that were purely monopolistic markets with six or more providers.

645
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:41,260
So they dropped some of those also to make sure the results were not skewed.

646
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:51,250
So when talking about mergers, it's really important to know that around 2000 mergers started to become more common.

647
01:10:51,580 --> 01:11:00,639
So institutions were starting to merge together to create health systems and mergers between hospitals that are close geographic competitors,

648
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,810
say five miles or less. These led to the highest price increases.

649
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,430
But when looking at these mergers, it's very difficult because of the way that they take place,

650
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,970
varies based on the merger itself and the institutions that are involved.

651
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:20,080
So a merger with Michigan Medicine and Saint Joe's might look very different than a merger with NYU and some other institution in New York.

652
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:30,330
So between this study looked at some data between 2007 and 2011 were more than 350 murders were examined.

653
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:36,020
Almost a third of these were hospitals between 15 miles of each other.

654
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:44,010
So very, very close geographic distribution with a lot of these murders that are happening, they tend to be in less concentrated markets.

655
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:51,870
And also the exception, the expectation is that the closer together a hospital is to the institution that it's merging with,

656
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,960
the more that it's going to impact the prices locally.

657
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:03,180
No evidence was found that merging hospitals had any different pre-merger pricing trends relative to non merging systems.

658
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,330
You can see that with the table on the bottom there.

659
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:14,010
Basically, the closer these institutions are together, the more of an effect it's going to have on the baseline price.

660
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:19,709
So this is again showing the quantity of mergers.

661
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,740
So you may only want to look at the start in 2007.

662
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,800
Look at the numbers. Look at the composition. Many of these murders are happening very, very close together.

663
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:37,840
So they're having a big effect on prices. So after the merger, we look at the effects that they had on the price.

664
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:41,980
So it does take time to realize these price changes don't happen overnight.

665
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:46,250
So you don't just have a merger and then immediately have price changes.

666
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:51,130
After about two years, you could start to see and observe these changes.

667
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:58,990
I also noted that hospitals that merge, like I said, five miles apart, that's where you see the biggest increase in price.

668
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,100
And mergers can have an effect on nearby health systems.

669
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:08,680
So if we have a merger in Ann Arbor of Michigan Medicine and another smaller localized provider,

670
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:14,560
this is going to have effects on St Joseph's is going to have effect on the entire southeast Michigan health care market.

671
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:19,590
And this is just due to labor supply shifts, policy changes.

672
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,770
So if you drop something like the ACA on the health care market, you're going to have big,

673
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:29,980
big changes on basically how payors interact with hospitals and how hospitals are governed.

674
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,930
This is going to have an effect on prices.

675
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,940
Basically, they can make new agreements between insurers with the newly merged organizations, and that's going to have an effect.

676
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,830
The big takeaway here is that mergers increase one institution's local market share.

677
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,840
This increased market share means that they're likely going to have more bargaining power with payers.

678
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:56,650
And this leads to a decrease in competition because you have overall less firms in a region and this leads to higher prices.

679
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:05,129
This just shows here about the after effects of the increase, but we're running a little low on time.

680
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:08,460
So here's a question for you guys to think about.

681
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:15,030
How would a large scale shift from fee for service structure to like an APM model type situation?

682
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:22,230
How would that affect the prices of hospitals, insurance markets and would it affect the quality of care if anyone has any thoughts?

683
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,770
So just thinking about it, well, think about value based payments.

684
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:41,790
It encourages hospitals to improve quality efficiency as well as patient experience that decreases or eliminates.

685
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:47,720
I can't speak to the error part, but I definitely agree with the first part of what you said.

686
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,850
Absolutely. Anyone else have any thoughts on alternative payment models versus the fee for service?

687
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,709
That all ended up. All right.

688
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,270
So I'm going to be discussing the second article.

689
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:12,860
I know we're running a little bit on time to speed it up, but what Martin and I ended up looking into was it's still the price is stupid.

690
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:21,860
And so this article was kind of a review of a 2003 article that was coauthored by the same people who did the study for this article.

691
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:31,190
And what happened in that 2003 article was that these authors, they examined a wide range of different explanations for higher spending in the US,

692
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,479
and they compared it to other industrialized countries that were part of this

693
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,080
organization called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

694
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:48,650
And this is really it is OCD. And basically what they are is they're different governments that are that have market based

695
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:55,220
economies and collaborate to establish more sustainable policies to promote economic growth.

696
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:02,990
And from this 2003 study that they had done before, they concluded that the higher prices were responsible for higher spending.

697
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:10,040
And so now what they wanted to do is look back on that data and compare it to more recent data they had found.

698
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:15,390
So study data and methods, the methods that they used to do this.

699
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,150
They took the tables that they had from 2003,

700
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,490
and they compared their findings to trends that are from the most recent data that was collected by the OECD.

701
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:30,150
One thing that they noted was that those who didn't include information for pricing on specific goods and services,

702
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,700
just because that was going to be a little bit more difficult.

703
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:38,640
Instead, they looked at observations for the health care spending and resources and utilization,

704
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:44,020
and they made inferences on why these differences might have occurred.

705
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,130
So the categories that they had explored were health care spending,

706
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,740
both public versus private sectors pharmaceuticals, the health care, workforce distribution.

707
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,970
Hospitals. Care and services and medical technology.

708
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,960
So the first thing that they looked at was the health care spending.

709
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:07,549
Some important things to note was that as you can see, that the US base,

710
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:12,270
their spending was the highest in relation to all the other countries within the organization.

711
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:20,809
That 9009 9892 were capital health spending and that was actually 25% higher than Switzerland.

712
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:25,160
It's not noted on here, but in in some of the other data points that they had,

713
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:32,510
it's 25% higher and those actually $630 billion more, which is just a significant gap.

714
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:41,030
And at the same time, they were also 145% higher than what the median was, 4033.

715
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:46,549
So we can see that the US spending is just significantly higher and also that

716
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:52,630
the percentage of their GDP was 17.2% relative to 8.9% of the OECD median.

717
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:01,970
And then if we take a look down at the public versus private sector, over half of U.S. health care is financed through private sources.

718
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,370
As you can see, it's about 50.9% compared to the ECB, median of 25%.

719
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,870
So, I mean, it's like slightly double than what is typical.

720
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:16,130
And another important thing to note was that 80% of their funding,

721
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:21,739
the public health spending in the US was higher in four of the five countries that

722
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:26,479
were listed and they received over 80% of their funding from public sources as well.

723
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:26,930
So again,

724
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:34,760
there's just lots of money that's being pumped into the health care system and go into further detail with some of the other metrics that they use.

725
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,230
So, yes, second was pharmaceuticals.

726
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:50,720
And again, right in this category, the range of per capita spending was huge, ranging from Poland spending about 171 to the US, spending about $1,011.

727
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:56,000
And so we can see also that the median is well, it's around 400.

728
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,770
And I know in the article they had said around 400 to 600 was the average spending for most of the countries that were participating in the study.

729
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,840
And another thing to note was that the prices for brand name pharmaceuticals

730
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,710
were responsible for most of the differences in the pharmaceutical spending,

731
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:18,950
and the US provided a considerable portion of those profits to the pharmaceutical industry.

732
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:26,239
And then again, like that annual growth in the US, pharmaceutical spending was more than three times of what they received.

733
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,770
The median was if we look at 3.8% and 1.1.

734
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,900
All right. And then this is describing the health care workforce,

735
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:46,540
particularly the supply of nurses and physicians in our country relative to the other countries that were part of the OECD.

736
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:57,760
And we can see that some two notable findings were that practicing nurses per thousand population declined a lot from 2000 to 2015.
