00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,147
Hi there,
I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez, and

2
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:11,097
I'm a faculty member in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:15,052
Today, we're sitting in the clinic space
for our research clinic in the Center for

4
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,570
Midlife Science.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,360
In this room, we visit with our research
participants, collect information about

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,310
their health and wellness, and also
collect blood specimens as well as urine

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:31,210
samples which tells us about their
biomarkers and health status overall.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,520
Have you been ill with any viral or
bacterial infections this year?

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,800
How did you feel?

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,930
What kind of symptoms did you experience?

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,120
You can imagine how we encounter
infectious pathogens all of the time.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,250
But luckily, if you think back to
those symptoms that you had where you

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,810
probably didn't feel too well,
luckily we aren't sick all the time.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,120
So how is it that we are able
to prevent getting sick despite

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,310
all of these encounters?

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,630
Well, our body has an amazing, intricate
immune system which works continually

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,660
in multi-leveled ways to keep us healthy.

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,020
However, this immune system
is also concerning in ways

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,330
when it starts to attack our own body.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,080
And so we see very many diseases
called auto immune conditions.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,479
Such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
and multiple sclerosis which are ways

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,897
in which our immune system goes awry by
attacking and destroying our own body.

23
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:29,898
The immune system is the way in
which our body provides immunity for

24
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:34,650
us against infectious pathogens and
other invaders.

25
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,400
Immunity is the process by which
the body recognizes foreign substances,

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,360
neutralizes them, and in doing so,
prevents damage, infection, and

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,530
illness within our bodies and tissues.

28
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,730
Our body does this by
identifying pathogens or

29
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:57,070
other invaders as non-self,
meaning, not part of our own body.

30
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,530
The identification of these
invaders as non-self is

31
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,320
based upon the presence of antigens on
the surface of those cells of invaders.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,330
These antigens trigger the body
to initiate an immune response.

33
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,636
It is critically important that our bodies
are able to distinguish between self and

34
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,137
non-self cells, because of course,

35
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:22,795
we wouldn't want our body to
destroy its own self cells.

36
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:25,568
However, this does,
in fact, happen sometimes.

37
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,468
If our immune system is hyper-reactive,
or for

38
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:33,420
reasons we don't fully understand, our
body will sometimes destroy self cells,

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,830
and in doing so, it results in health
conditions known as autoimmune diseases.

40
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,210
This includes diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus, and Crohn's disease.

41
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,460
And understanding the ideology and

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,210
the natural history of these diseases is
very much of interest to public health.

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,820
Our body has many lines of
defense to keep us healthy.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,140
All of these lines of defense
are part of our immune response.

45
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,764
Some of these defenses are non-specific.

46
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:05,210
By non-specific,

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,020
I mean that they are mounted in
response to any injury or any invader.

48
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,613
They just start without
any specific trigger.

49
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:18,763
This non-specific immune response is
called our innate immune response.

50
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:23,970
Innate because it's
fundamentally part of our body.

51
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,519
The first line of defense as part
of our innate immune response,

52
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,180
are the physical and chemical
barriers within and around our body.

53
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,233
Examples of our first lines
defense include our skin,

54
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,471
our mucus membranes, our hair and
our body secretions.

55
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:44,883
The first line of defense is
always ready against any invader,

56
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:48,809
it doesn't need to be primed or
signaled in ways to act.

57
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:54,131
For example, our mucus membranes in our
nasal passages will trap pathogens before

58
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:59,085
they get into our respiratory airways,
deposit in our lungs and make us ill.

59
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,884
These nasal passages
are lined with mucus and

60
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:06,538
this is one of the first lines of defense
against these types of pathogens.

61
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,862
Another example is our skin.

62
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:14,490
Our skin protects us from pathogens on
surfaces like desks or drinking fountains.

63
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,620
And so that even if we get into
contact with those types of pathogens

64
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,567
our skin is able to keep
them out of our body, and

65
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:28,351
this is part of our first line
of defense of our immune system.

66
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,238
Our body also uses inflammatory
mechanisms as part of the non-specific

67
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:34,540
immune response.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,720
The second line of defense is also
part of our innate immune system.

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,660
And remember, our innate immune
system is one that is ready to act

70
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,358
in non-specific ways against any
type of invader or pathogen.

71
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:52,620
Parts of our inflammatory response
include phagocytes which engulf and

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,165
destroy pathogens and also include
things like proteins that have

73
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:02,760
anti-microbial properties and then of
course, our classic inflammatory response.

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,780
We won't go into the inflammatory
response in detail in this module, but

75
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,060
if you're interested there is a module
on inflammation in this section.

76
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,600
The third line of defense
against pathogens and

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,620
other invaders is called our
adaptive immune response.

78
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,210
Unlike our innate response, the adaptive
immune response is specific and

79
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,440
tailored to specific invaders.

80
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,980
It responds only to certain invaders.

81
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,230
And these certain invaders are identifies
as such based upon the antigens which

82
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,070
are on the surface of their cells.

83
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,200
Our body is able to identify these
specific antigens as non-self, but also

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,610
identify them as which antigen they are so
that we can mount a tailored response.

85
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,690
Our adaptive immune response formulates
specific antibodies to respond and

86
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,710
destroy to that given antigen or pathogen.

87
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,845
The antibody response is tailored and

88
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:03,710
only responds in certain
ways to given invaders.

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,670
Thus, the antigens and antibodies must
match to have an adaptive immune response.

90
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,580
We will go through adaptive and innate
immunity in more detail in another module.

91
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,207
In this module, we have learned that
immunity is the process by which the body

92
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,565
recognizes foreign substances and
neutralizes them.

93
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:27,029
And in doing so,
can prevent damage, infection and

94
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,190
illness in our body and
throughout our tissues.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,717
We have reviewed that our body
has three lines of defense.

96
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:38,832
The first and second lines of
defense are non-specific, and

97
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,340
thus are part of our innate immune system.

98
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,805
The third line of defense is specific, and

99
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,390
thus is part of our
adaptive immune system.

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,830
Our immune system is an unsung hero in
keeping us well, it works in non-specific

101
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,660
ways against pathogens and other invaders
that can come into our body through

102
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,950
multiple ways, but it also works in
a very specific and tailored response.

103
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,998
In other modules, we will learn about
how this system works in coordinated

104
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:15,060
ways between both the adaptive and
the innate response to keep us healthy.

105
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,363
However, we also need to keep in mind
that over reaction of the immune

106
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:23,158
system can actually lead to
health diseases and disorders.

107
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,621
This is the amazing part of our body,

108
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:31,029
everything is in such a fine balance we
need our immune system to keep us healthy.

109
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,451
But what keeps us healthy,
when disregulated or

110
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:37,294
overreactive, can also make us ill?.

111
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:41,795
And we see this manifest in many
diseases of public health importance.
