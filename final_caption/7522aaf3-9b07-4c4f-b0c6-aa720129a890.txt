1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,250
Hi. I'm [inaudible] and I'm

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,295
a faculty member in
the Department of Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,990
Today we're going
to take a look at

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,150
chronic inflammation
and how this is

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,230
related to many of

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,950
our underlying age-related
chronic diseases.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,830
Within our body,
inflammatory processes

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,155
are critical to our health
and well-being.

9
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,630
Acute inflammatory
processes are needed

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,910
to address the incoming invaders,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,150
pathogens or injuries that
we experience and to mount

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,530
in efficient response to

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,035
destroy those and
heal our tissue.

14
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:39,469
However, these
inflammatory processes

15
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,225
must be tightly regulated

16
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,385
to avoid excess tissue damage

17
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,575
and spillover to normal tissue.

18
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,185
What we see is that
in the situation with

19
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:52,460
ongoing or persistent exposure
to pathogens or injuries,

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,740
we can experience
chronic inflammation,

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,020
which is when the
inflammatory response goes

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,495
on for such a long period of time

23
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,910
or in such high levels
that it damages

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,500
the tissue and causes
health consequences.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,180
There are several ways
in which our body

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,460
might experience
chronic inflammation.

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,550
For example, we may have
an unrelenting injury,

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,610
exposure to a persistent
infectious pathogen

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,525
or prolonged exposure
to toxic agents.

30
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,980
All of these are
things that initiate

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,770
an acute inflammatory
response but if

32
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,790
the exposure is persistent,
unrelenting or prolonged,

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,700
we may experience
an ongoing high level of

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,360
an acute inflammatory response,
and in doing so,

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
the exposure to these ongoing

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,290
inflammatory mediators
can actually damage

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,330
the tissue within our body and be

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,870
detrimental rather than helpful.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,950
Another way that
our body initiates

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,625
chronic inflammation is through
auto-immune conditions.

41
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,130
These conditions are
characterized by having

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,110
an inflammatory response as part

43
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,480
of their underlying
pathophysiology.

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,520
Understanding how
these conditions

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,670
initiate that inflammatory
response and how

46
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,070
that inflammatory response
then is related to

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,960
disease outcomes is an area
of ongoing research.

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,100
Obesity is a condition that is

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,320
associated with chronic
inflammation because

50
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,900
many of the by-products
associated with

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,820
inflammation are
actually secreted

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,970
by adipose tissue themselves.

53
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,830
We often see the
individuals who are obese

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,860
have high levels of
inflammatory markers,

55
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,195
and there's great interest in

56
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:28,685
understanding how
obesity as a condition

57
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:29,840
can be related to

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,175
a persistent and ongoing
chronic inflammation.

59
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:36,965
Similarly, diseases such
as chronic illnesses and

60
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:39,740
aging related processes
also are known to

61
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,415
have associations with
chronic inflammation.

62
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:47,810
Many diseases or conditions
that have inflammation in

63
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,000
their pathophysiology or cause

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,315
inflammation have a name
that ends in 'itis'.

65
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,505
Seeing diseases ending an 'itis'

66
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:57,620
is an easy way for us to identify

67
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,080
them as having
an inflammatory component

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,940
to their pathophysiology.

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,470
For example, arthritis is
inflammation of the joints.

70
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,695
Cystitis is inflammation
of the bladder.

71
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:13,010
Colitis is inflammation
of the colon and

72
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,390
Otitis media is inflammation
of the middle ear.

73
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,590
However, not all diseases or

74
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,780
disorders with
inflammation as part

75
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,790
of their pathophysiology are

76
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,130
classically named as this 'itis'.

77
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,860
An ongoing area of
research is understanding

78
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,140
the inflammatory component
underlying many diseases.

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,110
In this figure you'll
see the depth and

80
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,885
breadth of the types of
diseases and disorders

81
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,370
that are now known to have

82
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,855
an inflammatory component

83
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,285
underlying their pathophysiology.

84
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,970
These include
many types of cancers,

85
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,430
many of the
neurological diseases,

86
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,300
complications of diabetes,
pulmonary disease,

87
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,025
bone and joint diseases,

88
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,145
as well as metabolic disorders.

89
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:59,600
Of course auto-immune
disorders as we mentioned

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,645
earlier and
cardiovascular diseases.

91
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,460
All of these disorders have

92
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,160
documented evidence
showing that there is

93
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,380
an inflammatory
component associated

94
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,670
with not only the onset

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,620
of these diseases but also
the progression and severity.

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,510
Understanding and
characterizing the impact of

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,340
the inflammatory response on

98
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,410
these types of disorders helps us

99
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,150
understand not only
how to measure

100
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,430
their impact but
also to think about

101
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,710
strategies that we
might use to prevent

102
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,525
these diseases and treat
them in the long-term.

103
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,000
There are several new avenues and

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,030
inflammation research hinged
on the idea that there are

105
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,810
both pro and anti-inflammatory
agents within our body

106
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,400
which work to facilitate
our overall inflammatory burden.

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,090
Pro-inflammatory agents
are those in which trigger

108
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,010
an inflammatory response and are

109
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,745
characteristically associated
with poor health outcomes.

110
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:57,085
Much of the research
that is focused on

111
00:04:57,085 --> 00:05:00,670
age-related diseases has
demonstrated the individuals

112
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,870
with high markers of

113
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,289
pro-inflammatory markers
such as interleukin

114
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,145
six or C-reactive protein
have greater risk of

115
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:11,740
diseases such as
cardiovascular disease,

116
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,555
diabetes and osteoarthritis.

117
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,520
So the overall burden of

118
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,190
these pro-inflammatory
bio markers is known as

119
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,740
inflammaging because we often see

120
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,315
an increase in these markers

121
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,775
associated with
the aging process.

122
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,130
We perhaps deem these individuals

123
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,650
as having unsuccessful aging.

124
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,620
The question of what to do
for these individuals who

125
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,110
have high pro-inflammatory
burden across

126
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,570
the life course is compounded by

127
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,520
the other conditions
that can be related

128
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,865
to an inflammatory response.

129
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,870
Much interest has been focused

130
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,270
on the other part
of the scale and

131
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,040
understanding the impact and

132
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,405
the responsiveness of
anti-inflammatory markers.

133
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:55,460
The idea is that pro-inflammatory
markers might be

134
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,850
balanced out by anti-inflammatory
markers and that

135
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,790
perhaps some individuals
who are resistant to

136
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,120
the onset of age-related
conditions might actually

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,790
have a very robust ability within

138
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,840
their body to mount

139
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,050
an effective
anti-inflammatory response.

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,450
Early evidence from studies

141
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,000
conducted amongst centenarians
demonstrates that

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,380
these individuals who have

143
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,440
high levels of
anti-inflammatory bio markers

144
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,570
actually have better survival in

145
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,990
late life and fewer age-related
chronic conditions.

146
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,940
If in fact this is true,

147
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,560
that not only the burden of

148
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,840
pro-inflammatory bio markers but

149
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,970
also the ability of
our body to mount

150
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,210
an effective anti-inflammatory
response can be related

151
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,690
to age related
chronic conditions is

152
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,720
important because then it's
two avenues for which we can

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
consider interventions to improve

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,830
one's health and well being.

155
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,720
We can either work to reduce

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,790
the pro-inflammatory burden or

157
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,710
work to increase one's ability to

158
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,190
mount an anti-inflammatory
response.

159
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,930
So understanding the unique ways
in which our body

160
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,600
works to mount inflammatory
responses and how

161
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,460
those responses result in

162
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,730
chronic inflammation is
important as we work to tackle

163
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,765
some of the most complex
chronic diseases

164
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,230
which are of importance
to public health.

165
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,340
In this module we reviewed
chronic inflammation,

166
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,670
which occurs as our body
is exposed to persistent,

167
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,040
prolonged or
unrelenting levels of

168
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,310
inflammation due to
many different causes.

169
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,840
Chronic inflammation can be

170
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,180
detrimental to our body
as it is related to

171
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,090
many chronic and other diseases

172
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,210
including auto-immune disorders.

173
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,260
Chronic inflammation is the way

174
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,210
in which our body experiences

175
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,755
the negative impacts
associated with inflammation.

176
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,280
So I encourage you to think about

177
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,380
your own work and many
of the diseases of

178
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,420
major public health
importance and

179
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,980
how chronic inflammation might be

180
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,738
underlying many of
those conditions
