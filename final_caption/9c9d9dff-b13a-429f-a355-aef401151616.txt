00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:20,608
My name is Joanna Kovacevich. I work in the instructional services team at SPH.

2
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:26,608
My title is Instructional Technology consultant, and joining me today,

3
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,608
co-leading is Monica Rosen.

4
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:32,608
Do you want to say anything about your role, Monica?

5
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:38,608
Sure thing. And so, yeah, my name is Monica I'm an instructional design center on the team.

6
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,608
I help with Joanna, melding technologies for pedagogy.

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:52,608
So how we get the most out of bringing these 2 pieces together to create really rich learning experiences for students awesome.

8
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:58,608
So before we begin. just some zoom related things i've enabled the live transcript in case you would like to turn that on.

9
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:10,608
In your view there is a live transcript button in your zoom toolbar at the bottom of your screen, where you can view a subtitle and automate its subtitle for questions.

10
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:18,608
Please feel free to use the chat I have my window open so I can see questions as they pop in, or feel free to unmute your microphone.

11
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:34,608
I'm gonna discourage the use of it the raise hand feature in the reactions, because, as i'm screen sharing. That's a little difficult for me to see and I don't wanna Miss any of your questions So before we

12
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:44,608
begin. I want to reference a workshop that Monica has led for us a couple of times, because I think it gives a good intro of the why use Perusall?

13
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:49,608
Do you want to just sort of preface a little bit about what you share in that presentation?

14
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:55,608
Monica. sure. So in the beyond participation works. Job

15
00:01:55,608 --> 00:02:09,608
I review over how to talk, how to integrate active learning strategies into your course, whether that be online, hybrid or residential and capitalizing in some of the tools that best aligned with active learning tool practices and one of

16
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:12,608
those tools that I briefly discuss is actually Perusall.

17
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:20,608
So this workshop is intended to go a little bit deeper into like how Perusall aligns well with active learning strategies.

18
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,608
And and we know that active learning involves student participation.

19
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:37,608
Engagement in a meaningful way, and what Perusall will you do enjoy. And i'll kind of go over this is it allows you to bring in course, content material such as readings, or textbooks or videos and things like that and

20
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:48,608
allows students to have a conversation regarding those materials which is a really great way to bring active learning to that content.

21
00:02:48,608 --> 00:03:06,608
Thank you. So we're gonna share that a link to that recording along when we follow up after this workshop in case you want to explore any of those so specifically about Perusall Perusall is a social

22
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:14,608
annotation, e reader, although we'll find that it does a little bit more than just allows you to discuss around readings.

23
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:26,608
But primarily it allows asynchronous peer discussions around assigned course materials, and one of their slogans is every student prepared for class.

24
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:43,608
And so when when students leave the classroom, and they're supposed to do some readings prior to coming to the next class, a lot of times, the instructor is not sure if students are actually doing that, and so Perusall is one

25
00:03:43,608 --> 00:04:01,608
way to sort of ensure that they're reading but not only that, taking it from an individual activity to a social activity. And so this can be used as a graded component of the course, Perusall has a customizable ai algorithm

26
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,608
for scoring student they're called annotations the comments and posts.

27
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:11,608
Students lead on course, content, and then there's a canvas gradebook integration.

28
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:22,608
So it can then pass that over to the grade book, and then that can factor into a course participation grade.

29
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:34,608
So looking at the content types that Perusall allows you to upload, let me grab my

30
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,608
I'll grab my laser pointer so this book from the Perusall catalogue.

31
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:47,608
You can actually assign a textbook and then, students pay for it through Perusall.

32
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:52,608
And so then it's already built in for any annotation and not taking.

33
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:58,608
You can import a web page And so you just paste the url in and purse.

34
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:02,608
I will basically pull it in I think it usually in the background.

35
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:09,608
It's converting it to a pdf but then it allows your students to be able to leave their comments on it.

36
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:21,608
Can import documents from dropbox upload something from your computer upload something from your computer that you don't have digital rights to, and Perusall will will do that for you.

37
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:31,608
And do a charging students whatever whatever they determine, it costs to access that article.

38
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:36,608
A new feature is quizzes which works a little bit more like a quick knowledge.

39
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:47,608
Check. that you can build in we're still sort of experimenting with this materials from another course, so as an instructor uses Perusall from semester to semester.

40
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:54,608
They can copy these items over. I can upload a video and have students comment on a video.

41
00:05:54,608 --> 00:06:00,608
I can insert a podcast I can organize my content in a folder.

42
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:10,608
I can have a student upload folder and Then there's an I clicker integration which is the student response, which I have not experimented with at all.

43
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:23,608
A quick note about digital accessibility when documents like Pdfs get uploaded into Perusall, Perusall does some optical character recognition.

44
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:35,608
So that that text is distinguishable there's also a read out loud functionality that's available for going through comments.

45
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:39,608
The video. and podcast is where you really want to be careful.

46
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:48,608
Does the video you're sharing have closed captions where someone who has hearing loss be able to follow along and same with.

47
00:06:48,608 --> 00:07:00,608
Podcast could you reference a website? you know the podcast, web page on the Web, where maybe there's a transcript available.

48
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:04,608
So just keep those things in mind that We Do need to make sure that we're putting content out there.

49
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:19,608
That any student could access. There was a really helpful help article about this on Perusall that suggested the use of a feature.

50
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:25,608
I was not aware of in Chrome, which is a live caption tool inside of chrome.

51
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:32,608
So I will provide a a link to that page on how you you can enable that.

52
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:50,608
And so, then, if you have media, you could also provide instructions to your students on how to enable that so to kind of do a subtitle similar to what we see with the zoom, live transcript

53
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:55,608
So this is just a quick screenshot we're actually going to get into Perusall very shortly.

54
00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:00,608
But I wanted to give you a quick tour of what it looks like from the student side.

55
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:10,608
So when my students are in a Perusall course they've clicked on an assignment in canvas and launched into the Perusall tool.

56
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:15,608
So along here in the left hand I have some navigation.

57
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:20,608
I could back up and go see my other courses. If I have other courses that you use Perusall.

58
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:24,608
Some of these settings are instructor view items.

59
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:29,608
Readings are items that are I have in my course library.

60
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:37,608
But when I launch from an assignment I go directly to the assigned reading and notice.

61
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:55,608
There are some highlights here in the document, and those all correspond to conversations over here in the right hand side panel. and so I have the ability to click on any of these to just look at the discussion around this single

62
00:08:55,608 --> 00:09:11,608
bullet point here, or I have an all conversation bubble option where I can kind of get a snapshot of, and it's almost like a little bit of a preference of all of the comments that have taken

63
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:15,608
place in this entire document, so you can kind of look at it in different ways.

64
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:19,608
When I'm. a student and I just want to read through it for the first time.

65
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:22,608
There's a menu option up here which we'll see later.

66
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:34,608
It's just cropped out of this screenshot where I can hide all these annotations just so I can focus and read, and if you've enabled downloading the readings to read offline and come back

67
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:41,608
later to add my comments that a student would have that option as well.

68
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:47,608
So when those comments happen, I can reply, Notice, this one has a plus one here.

69
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:51,608
This is sort of an up vote of this, was a helpful comment.

70
00:09:51,608 --> 00:10:00,608
Perusall recognizes when you put question marks in your comments.

71
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:05,608
Maybe there's not one there but this you can almost sort of up. Vote it as a question of like.

72
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:17,608
Oh, I actually have the same question, and then that's going to show to the instructor on an analytics scale.

73
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:25,608
And so speaking of from the instructor high-level view, when I go, look at the assignment I set up.

74
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:30,608
I'm gonna get some analytics of how students interacted with this reading.

75
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:35,608
Here is some analytics that will put together different reports.

76
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:40,608
That you can click through. There is a confusion report.

77
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:49,608
And so this is going to consolidate all of those little question marks, and give you a summary of questions that came up.

78
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:55,608
You can look at all comments, and so these will be out of context of the reading.

79
00:10:55,608 --> 00:11:08,608
I could go in and look at the reading to see them all in context, or I could just view them, and then we'll let you download them in case you want to print these off Take them to class and use them as a

80
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:15,608
discussion guide the next time your class meets you get a quick bar graph.

81
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:24,608
Of how many students have completed this and so for this assignment 88.9 have completed with the maximum score.

82
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:29,608
If they've done some work they've completed the requirements of the assignment.

83
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:37,608
But they didn't get their maximum. score some work submitted, or no work submitted. and so it'll kind of give you that information.

84
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:43,608
It's also gonna give you some summary information so this article.

85
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:56,608
This one article has 92 comments, 27 questions, and 17 unanswered questions and students spent average an hour.

86
00:11:56,608 --> 00:12:11,608
In this document on Perusall again that might differ if i'm alloweding downloads. so that may not be a fully accurate picture, but sometimes it helps here i'm going to get to see what the most upvoted

87
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:16,608
annotations are, and you can kind of see those and see

88
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:24,608
How many students that resonated with and then it's going to show you who your most active students are, and how many comments they've been leading.

89
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:30,608
So just sort of some snapshot information and you can drill down further into all of these things.

90
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:38,608
So it's pretty interesting to see how students interact with the materials. alright.

91
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:50,608
So let's give it a try i'm going to copy and paste the link into the zoom chat

92
00:12:50,608 --> 00:13:04,608
And this is going to take you to an assignment in the resilient teaching canvas site.

93
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:15,608
At the bottom of that page is a button. to launch Perusall or load per result in a new window.

94
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:22,608
So i'm gonna go to that same

95
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:32,608
You're gonna load the sample proof all assignment in a new window, and that's going to jump you into the Perusall environment.

96
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:38,608
There might be some tutorial information first where it's trying to give you a tour.

97
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:49,608
Feel free to click through that or or you can hit end tour

98
00:13:49,608 --> 00:14:05,608
But you should be in the article, and I see your bubble here. so I know that other students are also in other people are also in the same document.

99
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,608
And so this article has some highlights in it.

100
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:17,608
So feel free to click around or select a section. that you would like to leave a comment on.

101
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,608
As I mentioned before, There are some options across the top.

102
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:27,608
One of them here is by default Perusall is going to display all comments.

103
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:32,608
But that's a drop-down menu and I can actually decide how I want to look at this.

104
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,608
And so I always suggest you know when i'm looking at it for the first time.

105
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:50,608
I don't need all the you know me personally I don't need all of the chatter, even though it's you know static text and comments up to the side I want to say no comments or I want only

106
00:14:50,608 --> 00:15:06,608
my comments, so that's going to clear this out and so here's one that I left just so I can focus and read.

107
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:20,608
But as I mentioned on this course, i've enabled downloading so athletes in the top Menu bar, I would be able to download this document and read it on my own in whatever quiet way I need to focus and read

108
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:29,608
even if it's printing out if that makes it easier for me. and then there's an option to download with comments.

109
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:36,608
And this is something you can make available to students if you'd like

110
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:43,608
I'm gonna switch back to all comments so at the top here.

111
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:50,608
It's A. It indicates this assignment has 2 parts scroll to the bottom to continue to the next part.

112
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,608
So in this assignment, there's a part one in part 2.

113
00:15:53,608 --> 00:16:06,608
So as I scroll through and read this whole article and leave comments, it's gonna take me to part 2, or I can just jump.

114
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:13,608
So if I have a couple hours and i'm doing the article part, and I come back, I can just jump down.

115
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:23,608
This is an example of adding a video to Perusall

116
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:31,608
And I was able to this is a a Youtube link and So it's a little finicky about where your videos come from.

117
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:38,608
But there's help, articles and then we can also help with that, and I was able to get it to pull in the captions.

118
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:45,608
Since this is a video I created, I was able to get it to pull in the captions that I wanted.

119
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:50,608
So when any point while the students playing this video they can click the blue, add comment, button.

120
00:16:50,608 --> 00:17:01,608
So It's a little bit different from the article where i'm highlighting a section of text, or creating a selection region.

121
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:10,608
I I would need to pause the video and add a comment

122
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:26,608
And it's gonna leave that time stamped option

123
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:31,608
Right, and the bar the gray bar at the top is gonna let me jump back.

124
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:46,608
I guess not. Always the top back to where I was

125
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:54,608
So that's a quick look about what a quick look at what it looks like to be in Perusall.

126
00:17:54,608 --> 00:18:05,608
And so how would you go about setting this up so the the short list is when you're working in a course where you want to collect a grade?

127
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:12,608
And I guess not even a it could be a grade that you're including as a participation grade.

128
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:22,608
It could even be just an assignment that is set to be complete, incomplete, as opposed to worth points.

129
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:40,608
You just want to know if everyone's done it so you would create a assignment in canvas, and then set up your Perusall options when you first set a Perusall assignment up you're going to be able to

130
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:51,608
kind of set your course level settings of how you want your your readings and content and commenting on the Perusall side to work.

131
00:18:51,608 --> 00:19:03,608
And then you're going to upload items to the Perusall library, and you can do this all at once, if you kind of know and have your set articles that you want Students to comment on you can upload those all at

132
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:13,608
once, and then you're going to sort of parse those out into individual assignments with you could set due dates on those.

133
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:24,608
If this seems overwhelming at all I just want to say that we're here to help, if we can help walk you through these help you set any of these things up we're available at Sp.

134
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:31,608
Instruction.

135
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:39,608
And so before you join this course, If you didn't notice I invited you to a sandbox.

136
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:48,608
Course, and so I set these up just in case any of our participants did not have a sandbox site going in.

137
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:53,608
So if you wanted to try the setup, we could walk through this now.

138
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:58,608
In the sandbox site. so that you don't have to work in a live course.

139
00:19:58,608 --> 00:19:59,584
If you're not ready to do that and shot a since since just you let me know if this is helpful to walk through this the canvas site setup, or are you thinking a different type.

140
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:17,789
But I will go ahead and demo that as we walk through in my own sort of sandbox site, and so we're going to begin by going to the assignments.

141
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:30,789
Menu, and we're going to create a new assignment and so, depending on how you think you might use Perusall, you could do this in different ways.

142
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:37,789
This could be, you know. week one reading

143
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:43,789
Or readings. If I have a couple of things I want them to do in week.

144
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:51,789
One. I could write a short description. if this is in week.

145
00:20:51,789 --> 00:21:10,789
One. we'll be using Perusall here is some help information to get you started, and i'll provide some resources for students, particularly in those first couple of proofs.

146
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:24,789
All exercises. Just so. they know what they're walking into right. I would probably also add that I also get instructors who ask me, How should I tell the students how to get full credit, even though we'll do the setup on like what does it mean to

147
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:39,789
set up that algorithm we typically mention, not to tell them exactly what they you do get 100% of the grade, but say something on the lines of like, hey? if you put in 3 high quality comments you should get full credit for it So it's just kind

148
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:45,789
of giving them a little bit of an idea, or just for how to get credit without telling the entire game plan for how to like game.

149
00:21:45,789 --> 00:22:02,789
The system that's right, because one of the things we're gonna look at are Perusall allows you to create multiple pathways to get full credit. And so we'll talk more about that but you can set up how You want

150
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:10,789
them What? what piece you want them to focus on and so we'll often see like you may have seen in that our resilient teaching. example.

151
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:18,789
Hey? Leave 2 comments and go up. vote and interact with some of your peers comments.

152
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:28,789
So you can use this description, However, you'd like you're also going to have an opportunity to put information in when we get to the Perusall assignment.

153
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:38,789
Step So and sometimes, you know, you can even copy Paste the same information

154
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:54,789
So you can set your point value if you'd like if there's points for this and you can set it also to be completing complete

155
00:22:54,789 --> 00:23:03,789
The important step at this initial. All of this you can come back and edit at any time. But what we want to do is set the submission type.

156
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,789
This is where you tell canvas that you're going to be using Perusall.

157
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:19,789
Students are going to be doing work in Perusall and so we're gonna change the submission type to external tool

158
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:37,789
Which is going to open up sort of a url option and we're going to use that find button over on the right to open up a list of all the possible tools you could be using in canvas and so these

159
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:48,789
are listed in alphabetical order so i'm gonna scroll down until I find Perusall

160
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:56,789
I'm gonna click it on it to enable it and hit the select button.

161
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:03,789
When I use these tools I do the I always check this load this tool in a new tab button.

162
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:16,789
Because as we put things and don't do this and the tool is gonna try and squish into this canvas window, which sometimes makes things too small.

163
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:23,789
So it's okay to launch this into a new tab so students can kind of see everything as big as possible.

164
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:28,789
And then, just like with any canvas assignment you're going to be able to get set availability dates and due dates.

165
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:43,789
If you have those specified and my course is not open yet to students. So i'm going to go ahead and save and publish

166
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,789
And so now we see a page similar to what we saw in the resilient teaching.

167
00:24:46,789 --> 00:25:03,789
I now have a button that says load week one readings which is just pulling that assignment title into a new window, and I'm gonna click on it

168
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:12,789
And so that should take you in

169
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,789
I may have used this before, so you're gonna be so some setup.

170
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:26,789
You may see some setup information on the right hand side

171
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:33,789
That I hope sorry

172
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:38,789
Okay.

173
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:44,789
So over on the right hand side you could always set up the department.

174
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:52,789
Set your course, start an end, date and I think that there is if not on this page.

175
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:56,789
We'll see another page where you'll be able to say

176
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:02,789
This is a demo site like I won't have real students in here.

177
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:12,789
But if you're setting it up in a real course, you can set those core States easily, it's going to allow you to set what type of analytics you might want for your use.

178
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:27,789
Case we use the top option, automatic grading and engagement analytic analytics, so that Perusall is doing a lot of the work for you, and then compiling that where you can just go and review it in that

179
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:33,789
summary page, like we looked at

180
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:47,789
Enrollment estimate. And then, if you wanted to if you have a really large class, you would have the ability to break them down into groups so that it's not, You know, 200 students all typing comments on the same document But

181
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,789
you can break those down into smaller groups if you have

182
00:26:52,789 --> 00:27:01,789
If you don't have a large class or you don't want to use groups, you can just make this target group size equal to the number of your enrollment.

183
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:08,789
Estimate, and I would also add that proposal does recommend that for the best engagement on

184
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:14,789
You know, readings, that they situate somewhere between that 5 to 20 students per group.

185
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:21,789
So definitely make it take advantage of the groups to make those more meaningful interactions with each other.

186
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:27,789
Else was like, as Joanna was saying, if there's 120 students commenting on the same pdf!

187
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:28,789
It can be a little overwhelming and kind of make.

188
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:46,789
The conversations going along directions and then like you wanna balance that with like Oh, if I've broken these down into 5 groups of 5 people, there's not a whole lot to comment on unless everyone's in there commenting so you kind of

189
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:55,789
want to strike a balance, so you can save those changes on the side.

190
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:04,789
I'm gonna jump back over to my slide so here's where we set up the canvas items and then the Perusall options.

191
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:12,789
Okay. And so one of the places I like to start is in the far left hand panel.

192
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:28,789
There is a settings. menu and here's what we're gonna continue to set up specifics about how you want to use this Perusall site in this class.

193
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:39,789
So Beginning with this general page, it should carry over any of the settings you set in the introductory information.

194
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:56,789
The tabs across the top include access. If you need to invite any tas or sort of instructor coleeds, the grouping menu is gonna allow you to work more within dividing students into different groups If

195
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:09,789
you would like to do that. The scoring is really how you're going to set up any defaults you want for what are the pathways you want to offer that students can get full credit for participating?

196
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,789
And then some advanced things.

197
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:26,789
So this is a very option heavy tool. If you scroll through, I even have to pause and read and read their sort of tips.

198
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:32,789
And so again, I would just offer, if you want any assistance going through these, of course.

199
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:39,789
Let us know at any time it's gonna let you set up things like, Do you allow late commenting?

200
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,789
You know how strict or flexible would you like to be?

201
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:50,789
Do students get to see assignments as soon as it's been created.

202
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,789
Oops this one or Are you releasing them at specific times?

203
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:56,789
And so some of that can be done on the canvas side.

204
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:04,789
But some of that Perusall also built some of these in, so you can decide which tool you want to manage.

205
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:09,789
That usually I tend to lean towards using the canvas.

206
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,789
Options, because students are used to looking for those due dates.

207
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:24,789
Availability dates because canvas lets them know if you want to grow a grade sync to your Lms.

208
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:31,789
Because we launched this from canvas. This will should automatically Sync:

209
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:41,789
Unless you want to turn that off. This is the welcome message you may have seen when you entered in the resilient teaching, but you can modify this.

210
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:46,789
This is all just the default here's a little bit about Perusall.

211
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:50,789
It can be a little bit overwhelming if this is the first thing you see coming into Perusall.

212
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:58,789
So you can customize this there's an option to require students to enter their student.

213
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,789
Id but because they're coming in through canvas already.

214
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:14,789
We would consider that They're already authenticated I have worked in a with a group that used Perusall and had us do this, and for University of Michigan students.

215
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,789
It was type in your unique name, and so because that's not the wording Exactly.

216
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:30,789
You would need to let students know that that's what their student Id is in Perusall

217
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:39,789
Going across the top instructors with access. I can invite, you know, Monica, to co-teach this with me.

218
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:48,789
I can invite you to join me or add teaching assistance

219
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:56,789
So grouping again. It allows me to modify if i've changed my mind of what I want to do.

220
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:03,789
So scoring. This is the big one and this I would consider this to be.

221
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:22,789
If you're setting up sort of a general scoring that you want to apply to all of your assignments, you would want to set that here under the settings, scoring for each individual assignment, you can make adjustments, So say there's

222
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:28,789
a really long article or really important thing you want them interacting with on Perusall.

223
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:38,789
You can make it worth more points. you can be more strict about how you'll accept accept sort of completion of this item.

224
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:44,789
You can always make individual, but this is sort of going to be your default.

225
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:50,789
So when do students get to see their scores released scores to students?

226
00:32:50,789 --> 00:33:02,789
So note that this defaults to only after the instructor manually releases them in the grade book, and by grade book they mean the Perusall grade book.

227
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:17,789
If you want these to automatically load to canvas, you can set that up in one of these options.

228
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:27,789
I think that it does that automatically. I haven't changed this setting, and I've seen it still pushed over like by the end of the day, or something.

229
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:42,789
So maybe it is referencing I know we've had an issue with Coursera before where it required somebody to go and say, Yeah, post to the Lms.

230
00:33:42,789 --> 00:34:04,789
I would I wouldn't recommend this option because i've run into it, issues as well immediately as the student submits work because that generated student questions about I have a one, but I did everything because the grade they

231
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,789
they entered in and looked at the assignment which got them.

232
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:17,789
Some score, you know, got their scoring sort of started, gave them some points based on the scoring algorithm that was created.

233
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:33,789
But there the score that for all of their comments hadn't pushed over to the grade book yet, so they were kind of concerned, and so, having them see their score go up, they can see that in Perusall

234
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:43,789
but we don't want them to to see that in kvas just yet, and I think that the push is somewhere between one to 6 h.

235
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:52,789
That's whenever Perusall, sends it to the grade book So even if students are working in there, and they're seeing their score go up in Perusall, but they don't see it going back to the

236
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:59,789
canvas, or course, they are a great book that does take sometimes a little bit of time, because they only do that in batches.

237
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,789
That's right yep and so those scores aren't always live.

238
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:07,789
They maybe be delayed by an hour. so

239
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:16,789
And then that is an unknown amount. of time even proves I won't make promises of how frequently that pass back happens in your assignment. Score range.

240
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:29,789
You know What's your typical score one to 11 to 5, this 12 of one to 3, and threshold score for credit, Monica.

241
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:35,789
Any guidance. you'd give on this one this is like a complete incomplete.

242
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:41,789
Yeah, I think it is. I have. I actually had to mess with this option.

243
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:46,789
For the ones that i've set up before but that's what is kind of looking to me.

244
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:57,789
It looks like maybe like if they get something for instance, if the assignment score range was from 0 to 10, and maybe a passing score is a 6 like a 60% like a d then maybe that's where you're defining

245
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:09,789
what threshold is for a passing grade, and they have more detailed instructions that will share out after this on their help page, because they have just a lot of parameters.

246
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:24,789
So let's scroll down to the fun rainbow part, which is how you basically map students to get credit.

247
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:35,789
And so one of the things on this setting right here which is my default is the There's a message here that says your scoring weights add up to more than 100%.

248
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:44,789
So students have multiple ways to earn full credit. There are some presets for how you can grade students.

249
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:59,789
There's a whole list which this might be the holistic not quite where there's a variety of ways across several different parameters annotation content.

250
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:11,789
Only this would be where the only way students can earn full credit is by leaving comments and replying to comments.

251
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:17,789
And so all of these other ones interacting with the material getting responses.

252
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:28,789
Getting some of their comments up through voted won't count at all Perusall won't pay attention to those. There's a preset that focuses on reading.

253
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:38,789
And why So they're tracking how much time students are in this content.

254
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:46,789
And so again, if i'm offering download that's not gonna help me, because i'm giving students the option to not be on the screen.

255
00:37:46,789 --> 00:38:02,789
There's a preset for focusing on social engagement so getting, you know, posting something that's going to earn replies and comments from students or earning up votes from my peers, and then noticing how

256
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:12,789
low the annotation content is on this preset is I can only get about 30% of my grade from annotating.

257
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:17,789
So that's pretty spread out and then focus on quizzes which they have implemented since.

258
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:24,789
This is a new feature

259
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:41,789
And so again, this is how you would set your baseline and each of these parameters have additional options that you can drill down into so particularly when you're using annotation content.

260
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:55,789
You want to see how many high quality comments you want to set, how many comments students need to make on the content in order to get full credit.

261
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:03,789
And I would recommend definitely going through these special, these ones, and using a dropdown to open them because they are a little bit from the with the instructors that I work with.

262
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:07,789
On these they tend to feel that the default is a little high.

263
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,789
We typically say, somewhere around 2 to 3 high quality annotations.

264
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:21,789
But the default, as you can see here is at that high 7 level, and there's a few other ones like opening The assignment, I think, is a defaulted that 2020 times the student needs to open the assignment, which seems

265
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:29,789
you know a little bit high. it's very high and then yeah, up votes and getting responses is like 20 and 30.

266
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:38,789
And so it's like let's bring that down to a little bit more reasonable, unless they're looking at this one piece of content for the entire semester.

267
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:44,789
We we definitely lower these in our default we're just not able to do it sort of across the board.

268
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:53,789
Yeah, I can imagine maybe a scenario where you put the entire textbook in, and it's just like one assignment. where you maybe you're opening the textbook several times.

269
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:58,789
Got the semester absolutely. And so each of these has options.

270
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:04,789
The longest one is definitely the annotations, and how you want to utilize those.

271
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:16,789
So we encourage you to look through that. These other ones are all adjustable and usually shorter.

272
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,789
Yeah. active engagement time, 90 min, actively engaging with the content.

273
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:27,789
And that might not work if it's just a short abstract that they're looking at.

274
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:34,789
So depending on the content type

275
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:36,789
And then you can set this if you're not using any quizzes.

276
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:45,789
You can always set modify, and customize this However, you'd like, and then workforce available.

277
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:59,789
And we'd be happy to talk through any use cases. You have And settings would work best right whenever working with instructors on figuring out what is the best algorithm for them.

278
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:08,789
You know, the main thing comes down to like. Is it more important that the students have read the reading, because this is something that we hear from graduate level courses?

279
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:14,789
You know we have these zooms we have these sessions that we come together, and I don't know if the students are actually reading the reading. So this is one way.

280
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:22,789
You can say, well let's focus on that reading watching or annotation side, whereas in other instructors are like, well, I'd like to have more socialization.

281
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:26,789
I want the students talking to each other about the content. and So then we kind of skewed that algorithm.

282
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,789
So that's focusing more on that social engagement so it's really what you have to have a kind of a clear idea.

283
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:34,789
So what it is the goal that you have for the students whenever you're implementing the tool.

284
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:42,789
So that you set it up correctly, and I know maybe Joanna will go over this. But one thing i'd like to know is especially in the beginning.

285
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:48,789
You may be playing around with the scores like maybe you know you you're popping in there, and you're looking in there like, Oh, students definitely should have gotten a 100%.

286
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:55,789
On this, I think they're engaging with it the way I want, and one of the great things about proposals you can actually make live updates to the score.

287
00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:00,789
And it'll retroactively correct all the students scores from before.

288
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:03,789
So you know. maybe they're not getting that full credit but you think that they should.

289
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:06,789
It'll fix those scores so you can cut a tinker with the algorithm.

290
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:20,789
Live during the course as well that's right and I just wanted to emphasize that there's a save changes button in the lower right corner, so that as you're making adjustments hitting save to make

291
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:42,789
sure those stay in place. and so in addition to making adjustments to this baseline algorithm, you can also check in on the grade book of your course, and you'll be able to see your students And So if you're looking at the

292
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:50,789
assignment analytics, And you thought students did a really good job like Monica said, and you thought they should have earned better.

293
00:42:50,789 --> 00:43:04,789
You could retroactively update the outcome as she mentioned, or come in here and edit their score manually

294
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,789
So i'll just jump quickly over to that last advanced

295
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:14,789
There are some things in here that would probably be best reference assignments.

296
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:20,789
Core position, for example, best reference in the help materials.

297
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:29,789
One thing that is in here is the allowing students to download uploaded course materials.

298
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:38,789
So those Pdfs you could enable assignment reminders.

299
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:44,789
Here is the hide from students the number of comments required for full credit.

300
00:43:44,789 --> 00:44:01,789
So you could leave that, or you could let them see that and that's going to be that setting of how many comments were needed to hit the annotation full credit option

301
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:08,789
Enable group and one on one chats. You could leave that on or turn it off, enable.

302
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:11,789
Real-time student nudges that look like it was on by default.

303
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:23,789
Students will receive periodic in app nudges, with intelligent suggestions on how to increase their productivity, based on their engagement

304
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,789
Here's that hiding this is a depth test course or demonstration course.

305
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:35,789
So here's that checkbox where if you're just using it to sort of do your own personal testing, you could turn.

306
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:41,789
You could check that. and then you know the way. We could see that each other were in the Perusall document.

307
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:47,789
You can turn that off if you'd like you know that's a very social aspect of Perusall.

308
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:59,789
So we would suggest leading it on it's it can be motivating to know that somebody's in there with you and you're both kind of working away at together.

309
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:13,789
And then there's some other options. you know Students do have the ability to flag inappropriate comments, which proves all will bring to your attention

310
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:18,789
So if you make any changes there again there's a save changes.

311
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:25,789
I did want to point out one. Come, if you could scroll back up to the one that allows you to download items.

312
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:40,789
So this will you have to keep this in mind that, If, for instance, you create an outcome that is telling that it's calculating this, that the students are actively reading the article live on the you know on the site, that this one may not be

313
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:48,789
getting the score if they are downloading it. So now downloading, it would be great for students who have poor Internet connectivity and things like that.

314
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:54,789
But just keep in mind that if you put it in your algorithm that 60% of their grade is coming from active reading it in the platform.

315
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:59,789
They may not be getting that score if they're downloading it, reading it offline.

316
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:06,789
So you don't wanna accidentally make it impossible for them to get full credit.

317
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:22,789
I'm gonna come back over in the latin panel to my course home, because I wanted to touch briefly on the library, which is how we add content that you're going to create into assignments in the upper right

318
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:29,789
there's the add, the content, and so if I have some pdf articles that are already on my computer.

319
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:34,789
I can use the documents from my device. it's a Youtube.

320
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:45,789
Video like the one I showed You can click video and it's gonna allow you to put in a url once you have content listed here in your library.

321
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:55,789
This is actually a web page I entered in a url, and it imported it in sort of like a Pdf style.

322
00:46:55,789 --> 00:47:01,789
Once you have your content in the library, you can now link it to assignments that have due dates.

323
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,789
And so, when I add an assignment, I have additional options, part one.

324
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:18,789
And so here I, by adding another part that's how I come combined more than just one content item into one assignment

325
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:25,789
Content to assign. I can only pick from things that are in my library, which is why that first step is to load those items.

326
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:43,789
There, and you'll get to see different options here like setting the due date, giving it a name

327
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:52,789
And assignment instruction similar to what we have in canvas.

328
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:58,789
Would you i'm going back 1 one step so yeah to the previous step.

329
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:02,789
One thing to note about also is the assigning of the page readings.

330
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:09,789
So one of the things that i've noticed too is sometimes you'll have these lengthier articles, and sometimes it'll have 10 pages of references.

331
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:20,789
It's a really good idea, to assign the pages only of the content, so that it's not calculating the algorithm of them spinning time on. you know, going through all the references as Well, this is just kind of a tip that

332
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:31,789
i've learned from setting some of these things up is to just make sure that the article doesn't have 10 pages of Arctic references and the students are getting docked because they're not going through those that's

333
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:49,789
a great suggestion, and so I just expanded that from the it will assign all pages, unless you modify that

334
00:48:49,789 --> 00:49:01,789
And then the last step, every to any time you set up an assignment is going to allow you to use those default, scoring settings, or modify them for this particular assignment.

335
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:07,789
And when you say changes, your assignment will appear here in this list in due date.

336
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:12,789
Order. And then here's where you would also see any of those statistics

337
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:24,789
When students begin interacting and correct me, if i'm wrong Joanna, that you can add any kind of items to the library, and students can still annotate on them.

338
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:30,789
They just will not be getting any points for It so right is that how it is.

339
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:42,789
That's right you just have to direct them how to get to the library, because we typically in what i've shown so far they're getting it getting to Perusall from assignments which is taking them directly to an

340
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:58,789
assigned reading. but in the library that's correct they could come and read and annotate on anything in the library, and you would get the library if you came in to your canvas site, and enabled the Perusall

341
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:13,789
menu item in the left hand. column so maybe there's things you want to want to add in that you don't need a grade book column, for if you come into your canvas site settings and go to the

342
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:22,789
navigation tab. You can find Perusall if it's not already in your active menu.

343
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:37,789
You can look through the disabled tools and enable it and then once it's enabled it appears in your course, menu, and you can drag it around.

344
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:42,789
But if you need those things to go into a gradebook column, you'll actually need them to go through the assignment.

345
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:47,789
At least the first time anytime you make changes to your canvas navigation.

346
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:56,789
You want to come down to the bottom and click save one of the reasons I always bringing that up is

347
00:50:56,789 --> 00:51:05,789
I've heard of people possibly putting in their syllabus sometimes as an ungraded library item, so that there's an avenue for students to have a discussion.

348
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:23,789
Or ask questions about the syllabus in student being able to learn from each other, and you can reply directly in it, creating more of an informal participation and option instead of a required you're, being graded on this

349
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:43,789
so just because we're running out of time I was going to offer our consultation and support at sphinx instruction at Emish Edu, and then our additional workshops that we have going on to tomorrow we are doing a session

350
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:59,789
on poll everywhere for live interaction. Audience feedback and Then on Monday we'll be doing sessions for Gsis, but actually, anyone is invited to attend will sort of be aiming towards dsi's that are

351
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:03,789
supporting courses, and maybe getting up and running with some of our tools.

352
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:13,789
For the first time. Those are all available for registration on the sp events calendar.

353
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:18,789
Any questions we can answer for you

354
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:23,789
No, I don't have any questions I think once I start playing around with it.

355
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:28,789
I might have some absolutely feel free to email us anytime.

356
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:35,789
And if you have questions about implementation but thank you so much for coming

357
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:49,997
And yeah, I will go ahead and stop this recording. And yeah, we hope to see you around this fall.
