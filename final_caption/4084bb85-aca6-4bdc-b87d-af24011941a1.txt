1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,309
Okay. Hello, everyone. And good afternoon. So I'll start with not using the microphone, but if it's if you're having trouble hearing me,

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,379
raise your hand and I'll never know what the acoustics in here get.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,550
So maybe a little bit hard to hear. So today's lecture will be about complex systems and mathematical modeling.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,950
I do a lot of mathematical modeling and the work that I do, and I think it's a useful tool.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,710
And so I want to share a little bit about that today.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,200
So as we get started thinking about what a complex system is, let's sort of start by breaking that down.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,510
So what does the word complex mean to you?

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,820
So you would like to volunteer to.

9
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,920
So there are multiple things that are interacting with each other in a way that's not quite clear, but something that refers to something that's very.

10
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,280
So it's not straightforward. And so there is nuance.

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,510
And that comes partly because we have these sort of pieces that are interacting in some way and with the system as a system.

12
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,860
Yeah, I think. Like the Lakers is close to winning.

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,200
What's going on now? Right. So when we use the system, it's often in the context of an open system or a closed system.

14
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,460
But what makes the things that are the system? A system? Yeah, there are different components.

15
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:52,329
Yeah. So there's different components and we're kind of like drawing a circle around them and saying like, these components make the system great.

16
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,570
So what does it mean to be a complex system?

17
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,500
Well, you have a set of pieces.

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:08,410
That's the system. And they're complex because they're interacting in ways that give rise to things that are not straightforward.

19
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:16,960
Maybe they're nuanced and it takes more to think about them.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,840
And so in this context, we're going to say a complex system is a collection of components that interact with the other components.

21
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,000
And the way that those they interact depends maybe on their own properties,

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,340
the properties of other components and the properties of the environment in which they are situated.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,550
And this may be somewhat like general and hard to sort of like make concrete, but we're going to go through quite a few examples, right?

24
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:57,640
So here on is this your mind, right or left, a system of networks that are clustered in some way.

25
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:07,210
So in others we have these nodes in the network that are interacting with each other and maybe they depend on maybe they are peer groups

26
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,920
and people are in different peer groups and they have different risks depending on the behaviors that are shared within that group.

27
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:23,320
And we can think about how their the health of the system depends on how the peer groups are interacting.

28
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,720
The central one is just to be pretty, but I think that's the Lorenzo attractor from Dynamical Systems.

29
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,360
And on the other side we have a cell at the very basic sense cell is a collection

30
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,860
of pieces that are all interacting with each other in complicated ways.

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,430
And of course the cells interact with other cells in ways that give rise to tissues.

32
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,070
Tissues give rise to organs, organs, improvised organ systems and organ systems give rise to organisms.

33
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,240
Some other examples in the context of public health come from a lot of them come from

34
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,580
biological systems because biological systems underlie a lot of what we do in public health.

35
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:12,370
So one example might be thinking about how cancer arises and maybe cancer arises from even just a single nucleotide replacement.

36
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:25,870
And how fast is that mutation arise and how does population level cancer incidence data reflect the rate of mutation?

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,820
That might be one example or you might say and this comes from the research, Dr. Lee Pierce, who is a faculty member in the department.

38
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,160
But the idea that birth control,

39
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:45,040
hormonal birth control is associated with reduction in ovarian cancer risk at any point that you've taken hormonal birth control.

40
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,370
But while you're taking hormonal birth control, there is a possibility of increased breast cancer risk.

41
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:01,660
And so arguably, you might say, is there a public health benefit from prescribing hormonal birth control at a

42
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,610
certain period of time in your life to reduce your lifetime risk of ovarian cancer,

43
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,080
but not substantially increase your breast cancer risk just because it's low.

44
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:20,020
So there might be an optimal timing that causes lots of ethical such things going on there beyond just the biological.

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,870
But you can think about sort of ask questions about things like optimality, other examples, gene environment interactions.

46
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:37,300
So individuals that may not have disease in one environment may have that disease in another environment.

47
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:50,260
And for example, certain genes might be triggered by air cancer, polluted air pollution exposure causing, for example, increased cervical cancer.

48
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,890
We talked a little bit about social networks already, and we can think about things spreading like ideas.

49
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,350
Often we think about substance use.

50
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:11,830
And on social networks, there is also a lot of research showing things like obesity can be transmitted along social networks, neighborhoods as well.

51
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,250
So if you're interested and that level of social epidemiology,

52
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:22,389
you can think about neighborhoods as systems in which you have people who are actors that are

53
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,380
interacting with other people in the neighborhood and the elements of the neighborhood itself,

54
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,370
influencing things like walkability, self sorting of the people who live in the neighborhood and how they're arranged in neighborhood,

55
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,620
and how things like gentrification can impact that. So those are some sort of broad examples.

56
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,990
I want to sort of spend some time in a couple of bigger examples to really give some concrete.

57
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:53,690
Uh, uh, examples of how this work might be used and the kind of questions that we can ask.

58
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:03,530
So I'm going to talk about the wash benefits trial. So we know that manufacturing and diarrheal disease are huge, have a huge burden.

59
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,070
And globally, so about 500,000 children under the age of five died in 2015.

60
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,310
That was the last time the Global Burden of disease study measured disease sort of globally.

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,700
And as one of the leading leading causes of morbidity and mortality, diarrheal disease also leads to recall stunting,

62
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:32,370
which has reduced growth in children who have had repeated diarrheal disease exposure.

63
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:43,280
Of course, we like to prevent diarrheal disease and we know that there are interventions that should be efficacious at reducing exposure.

64
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,290
These include things like water treatment, sanitation, so things like latrines, hygiene, so things like handwashing.

65
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,640
And so we collectively call these wash for water, sanitation and hygiene.

66
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,710
The wash benefit trial was a cluster, randomized controlled trial funded by the Gates Foundation,

67
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,130
a very large trial looking at wash nutrition to see how it impacted both diarrheal disease and studying.

68
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,260
One of the challenges with working with diarrheal disease is that diarrhea in growth is a very complex system.

69
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,480
And so this you may be familiar with, this is the diagram where we think about exposure for diarrheal disease,

70
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,850
where we think about how feces from one person is getting to a new host.

71
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,060
And we often come up with clever enough names for all of the environments along which these parents can be transmitted fluids,

72
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,580
food, fingers, fomites, fomite things surfaces that can harbor pathogens,

73
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:54,320
fields, flies, etc. When we start thinking about this as a complex system,

74
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,810
we might want to start thinking about how that new host is putting pathogens back into the environment.

75
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,940
And so you have that dependance circling back into the system.

76
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:18,440
And the wash benefits trial, which had, I think around 20,000 participants was very well powered, found really suboptimal reductions in diarrhea.

77
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,850
So I was actually in the room when they announced the results at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

78
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,579
And you could just like feel the energy in the room kind of deflate when they announce the

79
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,370
results where we can see that there was a reduction and their prevalence for sanitation,

80
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,330
handwashing and nutrition, not liquid water, but overall very modest.

81
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,720
And you don't really see much interaction between the experiments.

82
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:56,690
And so this led the field to say we need a pause to better understand how to intervene on water, sanitation and hygiene.

83
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,080
And how do we explain the reasons for that sort of suboptimal results?

84
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,260
Is it because of coverage? There's too much transmission pressure from people who are not in the study.

85
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,950
Is it because of the interventions were complete enough,

86
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,010
meaning that there's obvious transmission from, say, animals that's not being intervened on by water,

87
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:27,440
sanitation and hygiene, is it that people aren't receiving or using interventions because that fidelity and adherence,

88
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,890
could it be that people in the study already had too high levels of sanitation, for example,

89
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,819
to think we weren't going from unimproved to improve security from improved to slightly better latrines?

90
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,030
So that's not enough of a of an increase to see an impact.

91
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,040
Or was there too much or too little disease in the system for you to see an impact?

92
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,030
Statistically speaking, if you have more disease, it's easier to see a reduction, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything about transmission.

93
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,830
Or was it that the efficacy of the interventions was not good enough? The interventions themselves did not actually reduce transmission.

94
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,720
You have all of these questions that are kind of hard to answer when you have a randomized controlled trial,

95
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:18,560
which is designed to tell you causal information about whether the interventions worked, that the interventions didn't work.

96
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,660
What do you recommend? How would you know what would have happened in another situation?

97
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,540
Well, sort of our traditional epidemiological approaches may not be good at answering that, but mechanistic modeling is.

98
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,110
So we can evaluate these hypotheses by developing a mechanistic framework to understand disease

99
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,390
transmission in the context of the environmental transmission and the impact of these trends.

100
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:54,120
So we might say, what are the parameters that are consistent with observed data and what would the data have looked like in an alternative scenario?

101
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,570
Better interventions, higher coverage, less disease in the community, etc.?

102
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:11,460
And so this is a mathematical model where we think about people who at the bottom have regular exposure.

103
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,480
Maybe they're not in the study. They have whatever normal coverage of sanitation and hygiene there is.

104
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,160
And then you have the people that are in the intervention at the top, the attenuated exposure,

105
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,680
because they have whether it's the chlorination or hand-washing stations,

106
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,010
they have reduced transmission along with environmental pathways such as water and food.

107
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,870
And so if we sort of create this model to think about how the system is actually working mechanistically,

108
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,780
we can try to find mechanistic parameters that are consistent with the data.

109
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:57,719
So this is an example of fitting the model, which has a lot of details that are worth going into for this context, but happy to chat about that.

110
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:07,980
After that's a contrast, we can see that the simulation with the virus and plots are distributions of capturing the data reasonably.

111
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,270
And what we're coming up with are these distributions of mechanistic parameters that are consistent.

112
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:25,770
So if you just have your you're trying lots of different values of the set of the parameters like transmission,

113
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,950
pathway, strength and say which of these are consistent with the data.

114
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,030
What we find is that there's a pretty clear basic reproduction number which talks about the overall force of infection,

115
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,520
the overall strength, the disease burden.

116
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:50,130
But there's a lot of uncertainty in whether that transmission is coming from a wider pathway, A for my enhanced pathway or is it just other causes.

117
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,260
And so you can see there's quite a lot of uncertainty there.

118
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,220
And even though there's uncertainty, it doesn't look like any one of these pathways can really sustain transmission.

119
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,700
So that's actually important to know. And if you look at something like the efficacy of the interventions,

120
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,060
you can see that there's a little bit more information about whether some interventions are efficacious and others are not.

121
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:24,990
So, for example, for nutrition and the lower right hand box, we can see that nutrition is only a little bit efficacious for reducing diarrhea.

122
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,860
It has an effects, but it's not a large magnitude. Everything else, there's uncertainty likely due to sort of tradeoffs.

123
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:41,560
And so we can now start to think about, given all this uncertainty, what would have happened if we had,

124
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,200
for example, a larger community coverage so that more people were receiving intervention.

125
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:56,980
So each of these points in this plot represent one set of mechanistic parameters that are reasonably consistent with the data.

126
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:07,030
In this example, the mean estimated coverage is 4%, and we might be interested in saying if instead of 4%,

127
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:12,879
what if we had 15% of people covered by the study and now each dark report?

128
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,920
Here is the new prevalence associated with one of the light blue points under this new higher coverage.

129
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,890
You can't do that with a triple traditional AP.

130
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:36,770
You can't do that with mechanistic modeling. And so if you take the ratio of the pairs of points, we can get the relative risk in the counterfactual,

131
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,440
the what if scenario versus the factual or true scenario.

132
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:50,460
And so in this plot, if you're close to one, that means the increased coverage is not changing the intervention effectiveness.

133
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,110
But if you're near the bottom, increased coverage is actually eliminating disease.

134
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,650
And we can see in this war somewhere between no change and about a 25% increase in effectiveness.

135
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,720
The median is 8% increase. Okay.

136
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,440
So but there's lots of different configurations of this efficacy, adherence coverage or completeness that can explain the trial results.

137
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:23,500
So there's all this uncertainty, but we can even begin to the fact that we can even ask the question is a really big step forward.

138
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:31,840
And we see that increasing the coverage to 15% would increase hygiene effectiveness by about 20%.

139
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,900
But that's just hygiene. What about sanitation? The sanitation?

140
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,530
We actually see quite a lot more potential for improved effectiveness with increased coverage.

141
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:55,690
So whereas the number of stimulations where you reach up is 20% increase was only 8% for hygiene, it's 27% presentation.

142
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,870
And we can do this for the other interventions. Water is even greater.

143
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,310
It doesn't have quite the spread of sanitation, but the median is lower.

144
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:14,140
And we see that all three interventions together water, sanitation and hygiene give us that.

145
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,090
Almost 70% of the interventions had at least a 20% increase in effectiveness.

146
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,800
So we really see that complementarity of the interventions coming through.

147
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,850
There's a lot of uncertainty here, and that's because there's a lot of uncertainty,

148
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:38,880
particularly in the completeness parameter, which is the total transmission that is not being covered by the interventions.

149
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,550
So that might be things like food or animals.

150
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:55,710
And we can't really distinguish between an effective but incomplete intervention and a complete but ineffective intervention.

151
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,880
So there's that tension here with the lack of identified ability.

152
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,210
And what we find is that completeness is an effect modifier for coverage.

153
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,780
So all I have here is the same as before, but now I've colored the points based on the completeness,

154
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,240
and you can see that you lose sort of dark colored points near the bottom.

155
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,450
And that means that you can only improve your effectiveness if the completeness is high.

156
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,540
And that makes sort of logical sense.

157
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,670
Right. But we didn't kind of know ahead of time a priori that that was going to be the answer,

158
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,390
as opposed to saying that like, oh, it's really the efficacy that matters.

159
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:54,080
And so we can actually plot this diagram looking at those parameters that are associated with high completeness or low completeness.

160
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,910
And we can see sort of quantitatively the importance of completeness.

161
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:07,299
So what I wanted to show in this example is a situation where we have, you know,

162
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:15,490
the gold standard of AP information, the randomized controlled trial, and it only takes us so far.

163
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,700
And by treating the system like a complex system or mechanistic modeling care

164
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,850
or mechanistic modeling can explain sort of what's going on under the hood.

165
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,570
That can give us some ways to begin to ask questions about what's the next step, what are the next trials that we should be trying?

166
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:41,950
Do we need to find the more effective intervention, or do we just need to get the interventions we have to more people?

167
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,760
And this work suggests that it's the latter. We need to get more people covered, but that's one example.

168
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,740
Another example might be tobacco regulation.

169
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,720
Now we're a completely other side of public health, but modeling is a very transferable technique.

170
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:09,700
So this I like this example because it can be you can start to ask some other questions with about the goals of simulation and mechanistic modeling.

171
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,999
So one of them might be forecasting. And forecasting in this context means forecasting smoking,

172
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,100
prevalence and related health outcomes sort of down the road even to just the status quo is maintained,

173
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:30,670
even if the sort of normal initiation cessation of cigaret use is met.

174
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,129
But we also know that the status quo is not going to be maintained currently

175
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,260
before the FDA has a proposal to ban menthol flavoring in secondary cigarets.

176
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,160
What are the likely public health implications of that regulation?

177
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,530
And we can also ask counterfactual philosopher Campbell was really focused on counterfactuals.

178
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,550
Here's a counterfactual in this context what would have happened?

179
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:02,110
How we banned menthol when we should have earlier, maybe in 2009, when the Tobacco Control Act was passed.

180
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:09,270
We're banned all flavors except for menthol, or maybe back in the 1980s when we knew it was bad news.

181
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:19,810
So that's all not familiar is a sort of minty cooler flavor that masks the harshness of tobacco smoke,

182
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,100
makes it easier to breathe and deeper, makes it easier to get hooked.

183
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:33,429
The nicotine and tobacco product. So you can use simulation modeling to think about how cohorts are evolving over time and

184
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,730
their initiation cessation death because they have higher death rates because of smoking.

185
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:46,630
People that are not smoking also have death rates. And thinking about this all together and moving forward in time,

186
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,450
and you can ask the question, what would have happened if you had banned menthol in 1980?

187
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,660
And then this this is a Mendez of all analysis.

188
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:10,660
They found that over the 1980 to 2018 period, there was 23% excess smoking prevalence because that menthol was not banned,

189
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:20,800
10 million more smokers, 3 million life years lost, 380,000 premature deaths, and a large fraction of these, you know.

190
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,050
And so while we can't go back and fix that, what if menthol cigarets are banned now?

191
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,430
This is David Levine's group again, compartmental mechanistic modeling.

192
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,410
Just saying if we had these underlying rates of people initiating smoking,

193
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:50,920
transitioning between smoking and vaping and looking at menthol flavor and then projecting forward,

194
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,610
we can say what would have happened, what will happen in the menthol ban?

195
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:03,670
And so by 2060, assuming a mental ban goes into effect, I think this was in 2021, which didn't happen, but hopefully will happen soon.

196
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:18,340
We hope to find a 15% reduction in smoking prevalence and preventing 11.3 million life years lost and reducing premature deaths by almost 400,000.

197
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,080
So again, really like huge public health gains.

198
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,690
Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.

199
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,970
And so what do we do about that?

200
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:40,600
Well, we can help regulators make good decisions by preventing providing them with simulation models, saying how the regulations are going to.

201
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,530
In a pause here for questions on either the first two examples.

202
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:57,610
Yeah, I've heard that, but.

203
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:20,480
Sure. So so the question is what happens like when you want to account for sort of these like one off situations but by COVID really increasing the,

204
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,670
you know, all cause deaths. So for example, you know, we can't predict a lot of these things happening.

205
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,219
We don't you know, we could have another pandemic of a different disease 15 years from now.

206
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:44,420
We can't really account for that. But if we're thinking about what happened in the past, we would definitely want to account for actual death rates.

207
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:50,190
And hopefully we have the data to account for something like COVID in the year that that happened.

208
00:24:50,210 --> 00:25:01,580
So oftentimes you can get age specific AIDS by year from the national mortality database or whatever it's actually called and account for that study.

209
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,760
So other questions. Yes.

210
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,240
Simplistic question, but but obviously is going to be some sort of margin of error research.

211
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:21,080
Is there like an accepted. Except there is a very large house that.

212
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,110
The situations that. Absolutely.

213
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,349
So the question is, how do you deal with error and uncertainty in your predictions?

214
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:38,600
So there's basically a whole school of uncertainty quantification trying to actually put numbers to the uncertainty.

215
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:48,110
So the couple of different options for something like this, I'm not saying confidence bounds, but I'm in advance here.

216
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,070
So typically what happens is you do for this type of model and you might have a

217
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,010
sensitivity analysis where you say that these are our best guess of the parameters,

218
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,850
but we're going to allow them to vary between, you know,

219
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,410
half that and basing that based on, you know,

220
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,889
sometimes if you are going to have to set assumptions about what realistic variation in the parameters is going to be,

221
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,980
and you say, how does that translate into the outcomes and results?

222
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,640
So that's one approach, the approach in this.

223
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:34,170
Is to say this is based on likelihood setting.

224
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,610
And so there's a how well does that is does the model fit the data?

225
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,900
And you can come up with quantitatively how well the model does fit the data.

226
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,630
And so you can build in a distribution.

227
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,750
Based on what we know about statistics and then say that distribution and the parameters translates to a distribution in the outcomes.

228
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,090
And then that tells you you can just it's not your 95% confidence interval on those outcomes.

229
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,260
And there you go. So it's not a naive question.

230
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:12,600
It's a really important question. And one thing that's really important for communicating to audiences, particularly regulators.

231
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,880
I was involved a little bit in COVID modeling.

232
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,580
And they're just like, what's going to happen?

233
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:27,570
And we're like, Well, it looks like this, you know, in terms of the uncertainty balance, there is a best fit.

234
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,770
But we know that there's huge amounts of uncertainty, and it's very important that they recognize that.

235
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,400
So I think that's a really important because other questions.

236
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,830
Yes. I feel like this.

237
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,770
Central. Great.

238
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:00,980
Great. So, yes. So how do we. So the 23% drop is the outcome.

239
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:11,200
But but your question is more like does how does banning cigarets impact mechanistically the initiation rate, for example?

240
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,790
And so how do you decide how menthol banning menthol is going to affect their decision?

241
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Either you do a sensitivity analysis or you make sort of reasonable assumptions, or you ask experts and you do an expert elicitation to say,

242
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:34,180
this is what ten experts think is going to happen to initiation once you ban menthol cigarets.

243
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,540
So normally it's some combination of kind of like going to the literature and seeing what people are suggesting,

244
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,200
making a sort of reasonable assumption or saying like, we don't really know, here is a span of values.

245
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,610
And based on the standard values, what are the span of values that could come out of it?

246
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,010
So good question. Oh, I know.

247
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:08,650
Like father, like I've been like, sure like that balls that are maybe bad and they reduce like cigaret smoke but the maybe that's causing.

248
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,250
It's like, baby. Yes. You think so?

249
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,440
Good question. So to what extent are things like perverse outcomes taken into account?

250
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:30,120
And it depends on the model. I don't I don't think the Méndez group did too much with that.

251
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,380
I do know the group does include vaping users, e-cigarette users.

252
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,270
And so not knowing exactly what they did.

253
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:55,540
I would not be surprised if they included a term that accounting for increased vaping of menthol among people who be smoking smoking instead.

254
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:02,640
If there is, then it also brings the question of like, well, what what is what's going to happen with like black markets?

255
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:13,230
And so I'm not sure to what extent that was included here, but people can, you know, could potentially model that.

256
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,640
Yeah.

257
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:22,810
So but I think that the discussion is important because it kind of it kind of is asking like, where do you draw the line around what you're modeling?

258
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:35,400
And typically, it's a kind of bit of an art as well as a science and including as much complexity as you need to to address the problem,

259
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,360
but not so much the complexity that you're kind of just getting mush out and that there's too,

260
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,840
too many assumptions in the matter, too much uncertainty that you're kind of not not able to really get a handle on.

261
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,040
So modeling, as I'll talk about a little bit later, is not a cure all.

262
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:05,190
It's a tool to answer some kind of question some or to begin to answer some questions that our other approaches may not be able to.

263
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,990
So. You know,

264
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:21,460
switch gears a little bit to talk about some properties that are important for complex systems and how they function and why we care about them.

265
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,310
And the properties that I want to focus on here are nonlinearity, emergence and feedback loops.

266
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:38,640
And so nonlinear. So the effect is not proportional to the magnitude of the cause.

267
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,700
Can anyone give me an example of a system that you think displays a nonlinear.

268
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,190
Yes. Right. Yeah.

269
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,230
The spread of the common cold, COVID, other diseases.

270
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:15,100
So that is sort of the classic nonlinear example where you have that the rate of infection depends on how many people are currently infected.

271
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:22,330
So that's really important. It's not independent of the prevalence.

272
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,310
Anyone else have suggestions?

273
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:38,630
Yes. As the outbreak spread again, the outbreak spread so ashes again, but baked beans.

274
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:50,720
So what I like about this is that we're sort of digging in a little bit more into that, this idea of infections sort of thing.

275
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:57,139
The number of infections Japan drives the rate. But now you're actually thinking a little bit more complex and saying you're

276
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,600
to have contact structure by age in the way that people have sexual contact.

277
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:18,680
Absolutely. So there's a lot of. Well, not only age, but but other social status, race, lots of things that people like sort sexual networks.

278
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,360
And you would have a non disease related nonlinear.

279
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,210
Yes maybe. I'm sure.

280
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:34,890
Okay. So racism and socioeconomic status, very complex situation.

281
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,650
And so it definitely I'm trying to think if I can make that a little concrete.

282
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:53,070
So. So, for example, let's think about wealth and how racism affects wealth.

283
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:59,310
And then wealth begets more wealth or a lack of wealth begets not increasing wealth.

284
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:05,639
And so that that can create situations where you have different trajectories among different social status.

285
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:14,470
So that's maybe one, one way of many, many ways in which you have nonlinearity and racism in a situation.

286
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:27,090
So number one in my examples are rate of new infections that an epidemic depends on number because it requires a susceptible person,

287
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,150
an infectious person to come together to make it to infectious people.

288
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:38,010
Another related infectious example might be dose pathogen dose.

289
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,930
So one of the reasons that mask wearing and the COVID epidemic was helpful was that it was reducing

290
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:53,430
dosages to people even if they did get infected and a reduced dose meant less severe outcomes.

291
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:02,400
And these dose response functions are typically not linear, like they can't be linear because they maxed out at one because there's a probability.

292
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,840
Okay, so that was nonlinear. How about emergence?

293
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:19,080
So emergence is the idea that local rules of interaction give rise to global properties and that can take a little bit of thinking about.

294
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,590
But it means basically like if the way that we interact with as people one on one,

295
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,980
how does that translate into how does society function as a larger group?

296
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:42,090
How does the fact that these two DNA molecules interact with each other, give rise to cell structure?

297
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,600
And how is that cell structure, give rise to tissues and so forth?

298
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:54,000
Anyone? Give me an example of emergence in a public health relevance system.

299
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:21,400
Yes. If the decision was geopolitical boundaries and how and how what can happen in

300
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,140
one place may be different than another place and how it would work for me.

301
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:39,610
Think about that for a second. So. So one of like it's it's a it's a little outside the box and I don't know, think about it.

302
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,260
That doesn't mean it's not right, though,

303
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:52,030
because you can definitely think about how you have like certain states are going to create their own public health policies.

304
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:56,770
Right. And what they do may affect what happens in a neighboring state.

305
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,370
So if we think about like access to reproductive services and abortion, you can think about, well,

306
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:15,780
how how is what's happening in like Indiana affecting what's happening in Wisconsin, for example, how is travel, interstate travel kind of doing that?

307
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,720
But, um, that's a good, good one.

308
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,590
I need to think about it a little bit more. Any other restrictions in emergencies?

309
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,590
Yes. Your traditional.

310
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:44,230
Oh great. I like that so bad. Cultural practices around burial in Africa and how that relates to the Ebola epidemic.

311
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:56,920
And so the idea is that there are certain sort of like literal interactions between people who are grieving and the body.

312
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:05,500
And that actually affects how things are happening in terms of disease spread at the larger.

313
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,639
That's great. These are great. These are actually emergencies.

314
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,000
A little bit harder to see. Why don't we be a little bit of talk about before a half way,

315
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:23,180
which is the idea of loving people that are like you and that gives rise to structures and sexual networks.

316
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,049
We talked about that also things like neighborhoods so that you have people wanting to live near people

317
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:39,130
that look like them or have the same values and that can create certain kinds of political structures,

318
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,170
but also health outcomes.

319
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:52,450
I also find that it's helpful to think about emergence, having some sort of nonpublic health complex systems, one of which is flopping.

320
00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:04,210
So birds or fish are composed of individual actors, and these individuals are seeing not the whole structure.

321
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:12,040
They're seeing only what the people in their immediate surroundings are doing in terms of their velocity and direction.

322
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,320
And so they're making decisions about which way they turn and you go depending on what everyone else is doing.

323
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:34,900
But that is still creating this larger shape, this larger form that is moving through space depending, and that that structure has properties.

324
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,120
And those properties depend on how those individual fish with individual birds are making decisions.

325
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,600
Crystal structure is also relevant here because for the creation of snowflakes, for example,

326
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,600
depends on the deposition of single water molecules and how that how they are

327
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,620
being deposited depends on very specific temperature and relative humidity.

328
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,690
And that's not sort of like there's no intention to build this larger structure.

329
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:15,340
But just the fact that you have these tiny variations in very local properties is affecting a larger structure.

330
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:24,190
So that's that's the piece that I want to emphasize here. The last thing keeping an eye on time here are feedback loops.

331
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:31,990
We've learned we feedback loops are a little bit more sensible or a little bit easier to conceive of.

332
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,680
So where are some feedback loops that you see in public?

333
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,860
Yes. One hashtag we have.

334
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,090
I have my own stuff, but it's made out for me.

335
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,740
And it is a message that just happened to be.

336
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,410
If that happens a real function, so be asked naturally.

337
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:28,800
Liver function, which then can turn. Treasury Securities Assets Tax Credit.

338
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,610
That actually pretty. After he was here he passed first grade.

339
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:45,020
So you're exposed to previous is accumulating in the liver that accumulation is

340
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,550
causing changes to the globule filtration rate in the blood and the kidneys.

341
00:41:50,030 --> 00:42:00,020
That is meaning that less passes being removed to the larger concentrations, further creating disease in the liver and the kidneys.

342
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,490
Hopefully I was a good summarization.

343
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,240
Great. So biological feedback was hugely important.

344
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,190
The body has these regulatory pathways to keep homeostasis,

345
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:21,500
but that also means that these pathways can be hijacked by disease and and further promote disease.

346
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:31,010
Other feedback? Yes. Could you consider advancing coverage of feedback if vaccine coverage so that you have so there's

347
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:37,430
like social mores where someone will say that like I'm kind of going to go with the flow.

348
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:48,770
And if you have that hesitancy to, to, to get vaccinated, then you say, well, vaccine is not really like people aren't rushing to take it.

349
00:42:49,070 --> 00:43:00,570
Maybe, you know, maybe I should also wait and that and just kind of like continue to sort of put the brakes on maybe one more tier.

350
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,570
Well. Great.

351
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,710
So again, so the idea had wealth building that if you have more wealth, it's easier to build wealth.

352
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,260
And we don't have wealth, it's hard to build love.

353
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:27,230
And so you that leads to that projection that that separation and we talked a little bit about for another good example.

354
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,340
So let's see what I have here. So a positive feedback loop.

355
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,870
So substance users tend to associate in their social networks with other substance

356
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,790
users and that can reinforce and promote behaviors around substance use.

357
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,700
And so that's you see this sort of social network effects, negative feedback.

358
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,160
This is an infectious disease example.

359
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,310
You see a lot of those because that's mostly about getting sick, maybe is going to make it say in a perfect world,

360
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:05,510
going to keep you away from working if you have the ability to to be able to say,

361
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,799
I'm sick and to stay home, and maybe that means that you're less likely to spread it.

362
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,420
So sort of self quarantining. So that's one way.

363
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:23,060
So there's been some research, for example, and nurses who are self-quarantine and that can reduce spread of disease in hospitals, for example.

364
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:30,170
So these are all great examples. So what are some of the implications of thinking about complex systems for public health?

365
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:37,670
So you have to remember that you can't necessarily understand your problem by analyzing its components separately.

366
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:44,360
And so one of the ways that I think about that is that like we don't just look at like men versus women,

367
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,570
we don't just look at sort of different races. Ethnicities really have to think about those together.

368
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,810
And so this is always a reminder to me and think about intersectionality is really of marginalized identities.

369
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:06,650
We also saw in the early examples places where our traditional AP methods and assumptions aren't really appropriate for some types of questions.

370
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:14,120
So it's hard. You have the randomized controlled trial, which gives you so much, so good information.

371
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,690
It's just not designed to tell you about what's going to happen when you take the intervention to the next country over.

372
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,830
And the idea of what causes something else becomes complicated.

373
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:33,620
But, you know, in AP we do a lot of detecting associations, right?

374
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,680
But when you keep having these sort of, you know,

375
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,939
you get to be a little bit careful because if you like, look a little bit too much behind the screen.

376
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:52,160
And just like everything is connected, like that's scary and then, you know, have to go be in a fireplace for a while.

377
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,500
Then we don't want to overwhelm ourselves by trying to take too much into account.

378
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:07,760
We want to recognize that that there are the all these interacting pieces and we're going to try to study them the best we can,

379
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:16,970
either in traditional AP by isolating the confounders or in a sort of more complex systems approach, explicitly accounting for the interactions.

380
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,460
So a couple of ways to move forward. That's kind of where I was going.

381
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,040
You can think about complex systems in the traditional AP approach. Often these are sort of more statistical.

382
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,950
You can use things like causal diagrams, tags,

383
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,730
you can leverage your generalized in your models in certain ways marginal structural models, which I'm not an expert in,

384
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:44,930
but we do have some people that are or you can kind of go more to the complex systems and modeling approaches

385
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:52,280
which are more mathematical and can include things like compartmental network agent based models.

386
00:46:53,090 --> 00:47:00,380
These can either be data driven and that you have data that you're trying to understand or more mechanistic where you're trying to say,

387
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,870
I have some information about the mechanisms and I want to see where that leads me.

388
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,610
You know, pause. Other questions at this point.

389
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,210
So I would talk a little bit about these couple of approaches to modeling.

390
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,830
The first is Compartmental. Now, the examples I showed you earlier at the beginning of class were also compartmental.

391
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,630
That's because it's the generally the easiest to work with.

392
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:42,730
And so in a compartmental model, you're partitioning your population into groups and these groups are interacting with each other.

393
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,200
And this is a convenient approach.

394
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:51,610
So here we often will be like we have people that are susceptible, people that are infectious, and people that are recovered.

395
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,150
And then in this study, there also pathogens.

396
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:05,050
And if every susceptible person is essentially like every other susceptible person, every infectious person is essentially every infectious person.

397
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,790
Then we can think about them as being separate groups and they're interchangeable.

398
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:20,350
So this is a good approach when that homogeneous, whole generic assumption is pretty good or at least acceptable.

399
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,970
And it's good when contact structures don't matter that much.

400
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,960
And these models are really meant to capture broad population level actions.

401
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:39,940
They're not really intended to measure or capture individual outcomes or variation in individual outcomes.

402
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,430
These kinds of models are very common in infectious disease epidemiology.

403
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,650
If you take 634 foundations of infectious disease epidemiology,

404
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,469
you're going to be just learning about compartmental effects, these models the whole time, which is great.

405
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:05,200
They're very effective. But you may need to start thinking more specifically about how contact networks matter.

406
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,010
Basically, if you're thinking about a sexually transmitted infection,

407
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:19,720
where the idea that everyone is the same is just so false that it's not, you shouldn't even begin to sort of make that assumption.

408
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:28,090
Sexual contact matters matter and a totally and structure of sexual networks really matters.

409
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:37,300
It can also matter you thinking about spatial spread. So if you want to think about how diseases are spreading outward from a central hub.

410
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:53,290
So for example, in the HIV epidemic in New York City in the 1980s, a lot of that's there there was spread from the city into outlying suburbs.

411
00:49:53,890 --> 00:50:01,390
And the public health professionals at the time were like, oh, no, keep the suburbs from getting infected.

412
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,630
And so control efforts were focused on the suburbs.

413
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:10,950
And guess what? It didn't do anything because the disease focal point was coming from the city.

414
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,490
So that's where it needed to be interacted.

415
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:25,330
Of course, easier in hindsight, but that does sort of bring us to the point that networks do matter and how people are connected matter.

416
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:33,550
We also talked a little about transmission of ideas, strategies and behaviors along networks, and those are also.

417
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:43,480
And then finally, even based models which are the most customizable and also tend to be the sort of hardest to use.

418
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,380
And in agent based models, you had individual agents,

419
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:55,900
like every single person is being modeled by a by computer and they have rules about how they're interacting with people,

420
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:01,170
how they're interacting with each other, how they're interacting in an infectious disease context.

421
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,950
I often see agent based models when you want to like model Washtenaw County.

422
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:14,050
And so each person has a very specific house that they live in where the people that they live with

423
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:18,760
and they have specific places where they go to work and they interact with those people at work.

424
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:27,670
And I actually want to see how I my simulated population, how people are being infected and where and how that's being transmitted.

425
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:33,670
So that's an example where you have individuals that you're following in your model.

426
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,280
And these types of models are hard to code, but very flexible.

427
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,000
The best choice for observing emergent behavior.

428
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,620
And again, emerging behaviors. We have local rules creating larger structures.

429
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,710
So we see that. So here we have this is an essay, our model.

430
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,060
Is there something like wolves and sheep running around?

431
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:04,600
This is basically flocking behavior in the public system world.

432
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:14,930
We don't talk about fish or birds. We call them Boyds. I don't know why, but these are Boyds and I have no idea what this is.

433
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,880
I got an Asian baseball. A couple of years ago, I would have completely forgotten.

434
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,730
But the idea is that you have individuals creating programs.

435
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,930
Okay, so why do we do modeling? The modeling has a number of very important advantages.

436
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,630
The first being that we can incorporate lots of different scales as needed.

437
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,979
So maybe that's biological, behavioral, individual groups.

438
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,510
Populations probably don't want include all of those scales because that gets kind of unwieldy.

439
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,760
But you can incorporate multiple scales, as we did.

440
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:55,970
Perhaps more importantly is this idea of dynamics and feedback between the relationships and the exposures and the outcomes,

441
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:03,230
and so that you can kind of deal with these nonlinear eddies and these feedbacks.

442
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:13,750
Modeling is great when you need to do proof of concept. So for example, cancer screening.

443
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:25,000
So the National Lung Cancer Screening Trials gave a bunch of information about different types of CT scans.

444
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,870
And when people had them, that's how long people have been smoking, what age they were.

445
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,060
And what we'd like to do from that is to recommend when people should get screened and what

446
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:47,710
age and what background has come out of the pack years of smoking as this person died.

447
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:55,989
But unfortunately, you can't really do just sort of a trial where you assign these different combinations.

448
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:01,150
People are just too many combinations. They're like, okay, age 55 and you do it every year.

449
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:09,220
The people have 30 pack years or you do it people starting at 70 every year, but people are only ten pack years.

450
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:17,290
So there's lots of different potential combinations and it's not really feasible to do trials, mathematical modeling,

451
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:28,300
if you know things about the underlying mechanism of how lung cancer risk and likelihood increases over time,

452
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:41,800
then you can say, okay, based on the data that I fit you, what is the most optimal lung cancer screening choice?

453
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:51,550
And in fact the Cessnock Modeling Group did this for lung cancer and the United States Preventative Services Task Force,

454
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:00,810
which is the group that decides when insurance has to cover medical procedures, use the modeling in their recommendation.

455
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:07,010
And so our current lung screening guidelines are based at least partially on modeling.

456
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,140
Modeling is great for prediction. So you can assess potential futures.

457
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,010
You can test which intervention is likely to be the most effective.

458
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,760
And you can assess these counterfactual questions. What would have happened if we had done something differently?

459
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,100
This is particularly great when you think about like an epidemic happened.

460
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:36,419
What should we have done instead? Sensitive analysis.

461
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,180
We talked a little bit about that before. Which parameters are important and how do they affect the uncertainty of the outcome?

462
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,070
Which is which the parameters do we need to know more about empirically?

463
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,899
So we can partner with our basic scientists to reduce uncertainty in that

464
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,470
parameter so we can do better at predicting what's going to happen in the future.

465
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,550
We can ask questions about parameter estimation.

466
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:10,080
What does the data what does this outbreak of disease suggest about the transmissibility of Zika disease?

467
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:22,800
Zika virus? What does that tell us about cross-reactivity between Zika and dengue and how that impacts hemorrhagic fever risk?

468
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,840
Modeling can help us look for emergent properties. You're not going to get emergent properties in one.

469
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,510
They only happen if you have a complex system or a complex systems of correction, she said.

470
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:42,110
Okay, but modeling is not magic. Models are inherently inexact.

471
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:52,430
They're inherently simplified. So in your question about, you know, when do we when do we include certain feedbacks and our others,

472
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:57,410
when do we account for, for example, black markets? Well, all models are wrong.

473
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:02,090
Some models are useful as the the classic to come back to that.

474
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,810
And so the model is wrong, but it might be close enough.

475
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:16,820
A model can only tell you if a mechanism can explain the phenomenon.

476
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:27,530
Not that it does. So just because the mechanisms that you chose to explore are reasonable,

477
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:31,999
fit to the data doesn't mean that the true mechanism is a different set of mechanisms.

478
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,050
Could have also expected data to be a little bit careful. That logical trapping.

479
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:46,780
A lot of the output can be dependent on implicit assumptions that you're not even realizing that you're making.

480
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,540
And so that kind of bias is kind of insidious in these models, which are very careful.

481
00:57:53,710 --> 00:58:05,110
And there are certain sort of approaches to think about how to how to, how to think, fear your assumptions, how to list them.

482
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:10,330
So someone that's reviewing your work can say, okay, I understand the assumptions that they're making and why.

483
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,470
And finally, the idea modeling is not magic. If you think modeling can honestly create something out of nothing.

484
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:31,270
And the story that I like to tell here is when a colleague and I were invited to discuss some drug kinetic modeling for depression drugs,

485
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,290
and they're like, okay, I'm really interested in working with you.

486
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:42,790
We want to know how fast this drugs in and decay. We want to understand how it's what doses are right for different people.

487
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,169
And we were like, okay, cool. Like what data do you have? And they're like, Well, we don't have data.

488
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,739
That's what the models for. And we were just like, okay, nice talking with you.

489
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:56,020
But like, there's not really anything we can do because without we don't know what the rates

490
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,390
of absorption you don't want the rates a degradation of the drugs are in people.

491
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:13,030
And so the model can't do anything if it's not informed by real information or past their first questions.

492
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:31,700
If not, then I like to wrap up this task by bringing in some discussion of anti-racism, anti sexist approaches to my life.

493
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:41,540
And when I talk about racism and sexism in this context, I'm not talking about individual actions or individual behaviors,

494
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,610
although those certainly can be problematic and effective.

495
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,690
But I'm really referring to here the impacts of larger structures and larger patterns.

496
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,510
And in the context of modeling, I want to ask questions like, Is this model based on stereotypes?

497
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,570
Does the model reinforce notions that whiteness and maleness are the norm?

498
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,560
Is it pathologizing minority status? Is it overlooking?

499
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,330
How are social structures that drive the patterns that we're seeing?

500
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,410
Are there differences or disparities that are attributed to biology erroneously?

501
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:31,130
And so you want to interrogate. So some of these are some of these are assumptions about model structure or interactions in the model.

502
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,290
We want to be careful as we think about them.

503
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:45,020
And so the story that I like to tell around this question about whether a model can be racist or sexist is on the next page.

504
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:56,140
But the idea that modeling is a quantitative field means that we sometimes don't think about these kind of questions of racism,

505
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:03,559
sexism, and sort of in some case, some people call that sort of qualitative questions.

506
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:08,180
And you say like a model can't be racist because it's just numbers.

507
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,630
Well, I disagree for a number of reasons.

508
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:19,550
And I think that it's not a good excuse for not thinking about anti-racism and sexism in all of the public health work that we do.

509
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,290
So, for example, like to tell is that I was a conference,

510
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:36,230
I was a postdoc and the professor was at an Ivy League school and he gave a talk about HIV in Africa and interventions.

511
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:46,880
And the problem that they were trying to model was that men were paying high school aged girls for sex and they were infecting them with HIV.

512
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:55,910
And that the intervention that this professor was modeling was that they're going to give cash to the girls, but only the pretty girls who needed it.

513
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,180
And those girls are going to go to the mall instead of having sex.

514
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:04,280
And then the men, because they can find that sex, they are going to go watch soccer and bars.

515
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:11,720
And this this actually happened. And I was just like like what?

516
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:19,280
And so I was supposed to look at the time and not super confident.

517
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,300
But I asked the question and the question session.

518
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:29,300
What would you say to the critique that your model is sexist?

519
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,980
And what he said to me is how can a model be sexist?

520
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,190
And a model can be sexist because modeling does not happen in a vacuum.

521
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:47,450
How is your model structured? Are you making assumptions?

522
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:53,840
Are you making sexist assumptions that you're then taking into the model as what is was happening in that moment?

523
01:02:55,130 --> 01:03:01,010
It was meant to be a joke. But, you know, as with many jokes, it was not funny nor appropriate for the context.

524
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:11,260
So as you do your own modeling, you might say, how is my model structured by not including race or sex?

525
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,450
Am I glossing over dynamics, important health disparities?

526
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,450
Are there problematic assumptions?

527
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:25,370
So I definitely want to make sure that I'm applying extra scrutiny to models that use race or sex as a proxy for behavior.

528
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:33,230
And we're often guilty of this in epidemiology because race in particular is very easy to measure, quote unquote.

529
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:41,900
You know, behavior is a lot harder to measure and relevant behavior is even harder to measure because,

530
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:47,060
you know, we don't even know whether our learned behaviors are happening. Think about sexually transmitted infections.

531
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:54,890
Is that lifetime number of partners, is it whether you use condoms with your partners in the last six months, it's not necessarily clear.

532
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:08,030
But we have to be really careful to not just, you know, say that American Indians have really high rates of this because, you know, of their culture.

533
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,390
It's not a good thing to do.

534
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:16,430
And so you may say, are the choices anthropologically justified?

535
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,520
And so that example of HIV in the poster.

536
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,100
And afterwards I went to this person's graduate student and I was like, Is there any anthropology like defending any of this?

537
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:34,260
Or like, you know, if you if you want to, like, say, tell me that like people are observing that like this is actually what's happening.

538
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:38,990
Like, that's one thing. But if you're just, like, making this up based on your, like,

539
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,780
assumptions about how people work in a culture that you may have never even visited, then like that's a problem.

540
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:54,120
And similar to this idea of race as a proxy of behavior, are using race in proxy of socioeconomic status.

541
01:04:55,110 --> 01:05:02,640
Again, it can't always be avoided, but you want to make sure that you're being careful about your choices.

542
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,370
And then finally, how are the results presented?

543
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:13,620
Are you giving enough context and discussion results, or are groups being blamed for their health disparities?

544
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:26,510
And that can happen even if you just like don't discuss the larger structural socioeconomic or socio cultural issues that are driving behaviors like,

545
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,140
you know, we'll talk a little bit more about this in the paper discussion,

546
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:40,230
but are there larger structural issues that are driving the behaviors that are driving the health disparities?

547
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,950
And if we don't talk about them, we don't really understand how to improve.

548
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:51,180
Okay. We also we to be careful because our models can learn racism.

549
01:05:52,020 --> 01:06:02,460
And, you know, you have every once in a while you get like neural network models, like reading Twitter and then like just becoming trolls.

550
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,419
Like, that's a problem. But what I mean here in the context of an analogy is that a lot of our older clinical

551
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:15,160
trials and medical studies really were only in white men or women primarily.

552
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,620
And so if you're like going to literature and saying, like, I want to know, you know,

553
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:26,790
rates of probability related to this disease, well, then they may not apply to black women, for example.

554
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:33,549
Or you try to like figure out what's going to happen with this intervention on Hispanic men.

555
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:39,480
And you're like, I got a totally wrong because there's this important difference is that we're not accounted for.

556
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:49,020
So what do we do about this? And, you know, I think the first step is to acknowledge that there aren't easy answers.

557
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:54,780
If we want to investigate health disparities, that's inherently about comparisons between groups.

558
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:06,600
And so we have to make those comparisons. And we want to do it with care and being careful.

559
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:12,540
We don't want to stigmatize the groups that we are working with and working for.

560
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,180
We need to acknowledge that. How, you know,

561
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:24,209
our understanding of what the best practices are are both our individual and our

562
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:28,590
collective understanding is going to continue to evolve and has evolved greatly.

563
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:39,840
You know, like over when I was a graduate student and since then I've seen huge changes in how we think about these problems and what standards are.

564
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:47,700
So when we look at the Morris paper that was in 2009 and a very different set of

565
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:55,970
mores and standards about how you talk about things like race than we do today.

566
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:01,770
And so we should acknowledge that we can think about past literature both

567
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:08,760
through today's plans because we don't want to give them anything a free pass, but also understand that they didn't necessarily have those approaches.

568
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:18,190
Yes. So how?

569
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:44,649
So. So the question is when work is getting presented to a broader audience that in our in our field,

570
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,980
a lot of that goes through journals and it goes to conferences.

571
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:53,740
And so who is doing the screening and are they doing a good job with that?

572
01:08:54,180 --> 01:09:09,280
A good question. And so I think that this underscores a broader push to a make these issues more at the forefront of people's minds and B,

573
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,360
and probably more importantly,

574
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:20,530
diversify who is doing the reviewing, diversify who is being invited and elevated both in journal articles and in conferences.

575
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:32,740
So we can only do a better job of holding the work that we're presenting collectively accountable if we have people thinking about it.

576
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:41,850
So. Probably probably people have thought much more deeply about this than I have, but think that that's my first step.

577
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,080
Other comments or questions for us here?

578
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:59,040
Yes. There are as long as an assumption that.

579
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:07,450
The. What about?

580
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:18,170
I don't know a lot about. And there's this whole that.

581
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:27,740
How do you find his crew right away?

582
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:33,090
So question is particularly in medical fields.

583
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:40,530
But you get these sort of long standing assumptions that calcified into really problematic assumptions

584
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:48,569
about how people interact with patients and then probably more broadly think about data around things.

585
01:10:48,570 --> 01:11:02,760
And so their specific example here is black women and pain and the idea that they feel less pain or that their pain is less meaningful and.

586
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:15,160
I mean, so I think the first step is to sort of challenge these assumptions whenever they come up.

587
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:25,090
And that means both as epidemiologists and sort of people interacting like even even not

588
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:29,559
necessarily in a professional capacity when you hear these people making assumptions,

589
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:36,580
challenging them. It means giving people the agency to challenge things when they're in the situation,

590
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:46,610
that they're having something that assumptions being laid upon them and feeling that they can challenge it.

591
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:53,260
And even if it doesn't work, that individual, they have structures in the health system that they can go to.

592
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:02,530
So, again, a huge problem that, you know, I don't I'm not I don't have really great answers to.

593
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:15,460
But I think that the first step is to do each of our responsibility in looking out for and challenging these types of issues.

594
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:25,660
Okay, great comment. So the other point I had on here is, is to.

595
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:34,130
Pay attention to the way that we talk about problems, because it can be very easy to to just,

596
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:39,170
you know, as an epidemiologist or like this was the association. And that's what I'm reporting.

597
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,550
And like, this is important because health disparities important.

598
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:52,000
But if you don't really. Address why those are happening.

599
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:57,690
It leaves the narrative open and it can leave the impression that, for example, that you were sent,

600
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:04,210
you are allowing for the potential for a biological basis for disease without casual evidence.

601
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:11,260
For most diseases, there's not really a racial evidence for disease.

602
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:20,890
You might have different sort of like in distributions of illegals and certain types of cancer or cardiovascular disease.

603
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:32,050
But broadly speaking, there's not the there's much more evidence for structural issues, sociocultural issues, racism issues driving these.

604
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:37,860
And it's important to acknowledge them when we are talking about the disease.

605
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:49,000
So if we if a minority group has a higher incidence, don't just say that there's higher incidence and they have this higher prevalence as a behavior.

606
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:58,420
So that so what we'll see in the Morris paper is that higher rates we see higher rates of HIV among black Americans.

607
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:04,570
We also see higher rates of, uh, concurrent partnerships.

608
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:13,810
We don't want to stop there because I think we do need to explore why that group has higher rates of the behavior,

609
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:18,370
because you can't intervene until you understand the larger context.

610
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:25,540
So this means that we have to both scrutinize our own work and be careful about our own work.

611
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:33,070
But you can also. So this was the point we talked about before the work that we review in our job.

612
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:41,620
So depending on what what sort of specific sort of jobs you go into, you'll have different types of work that you review.

613
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:47,080
Might be colleagues in government forms, it can be journal articles, it can be conference proceedings.

614
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:55,660
So what you review is going to be very important and you can also challenge and look at the existing literature.

615
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,270
And so what I mentioned before is that this older work, we can we can assess them.

616
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:11,110
There are contemporary understanding, but also through acknowledging that they're a product of their time in the context of health disparities.

617
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:20,290
There is often you know, there may be fear of being called out for being insensitive or doing the work wrong.

618
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,850
And I just want to stress that we don't shy away from that necessarily.

619
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,230
We work on health inequality because it's really important.

620
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:37,390
Sometimes it does bring greater scrutiny, but as long as we all go well,

621
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:47,530
understanding and and sort of have compassion for doing the best that we can and what Loretta Ross says,

622
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:50,590
call people into the conversation rather than calling them out.

623
01:15:50,980 --> 01:16:01,510
I think that that can create a environment where we can be empowered to do the best we can.

624
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,860
So maybe you'll help me here, but I have a couple of discussion questions.

625
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:18,460
The Morath paper that I think you were asked to read before class, and the two questions that I want you to focus on are, one,

626
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:28,090
why did this group choose modeling complex systems and why was it a good choice for the specific question that they're looking at?

627
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:33,550
Why doesn't why wouldn't traditional epidemiological practices be a great choice?

628
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:40,330
The second is to take this anti-racist lens that we've been talking about in evaluating here.

629
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:46,210
What I like about this paper is that it's neither really great nor really terrible.

630
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:51,130
It has some things that it did well and some things that it didn't sort of take far enough.

631
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:58,750
And let's think about some of those. Did they make assumptions based on data that they make based on stereotypes?

632
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:03,760
Does the paper blame, even through omission, the groups for its disparities?

633
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,780
Are they giving sufficient context for where those disparities exist?

634
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,630
And I want to emphasize that there isn't any right answer here,

635
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:17,080
but it's just a matter of thinking about what did the paper do well and what did it do poorly?

636
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:21,610
How would we do better if we were to go forward? So I'll hand it off to you.

637
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:26,979
Yeah. I mean, could we get the students, like 10 minutes for 5 minutes, take a break to do something,

638
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:31,990
but then third and maybe just discuss both of these things are integrated as well.

639
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,920
And, you know, this is a book with the four classes, so I'm sure you all have your back on your.

640
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:46,230
But there may be around 5 to 3.3 to the.

641
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:54,180
The class and. Effective. In a positive recording.

642
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:58,994
And I started the band but the first time.

643
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:08,858
So let's start going back to the very first.

644
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:18,378
For boys. We do the same with the attendant setting up for making its way around.

645
01:18:18,388 --> 01:18:25,197
But if by the end of the class it has to have it here, a friend said Please, please do sign in.

646
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,097
And, uh. Yeah.

647
01:18:29,098 --> 01:18:39,478
So let's start talking about these questions. So the month paper, um, why was this a good approach?

648
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:46,197
Is that the model of the versus, you know, typical observational study doesn't make for you and that we've talked about for the

649
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:51,268
past few weeks in this past why was involved particularly good for the future question.

650
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:08,788
Yeah. So they're calibrated. There's like a network approach there.

651
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:14,668
Yeah, it's difficult to get cinder blocks.

652
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:21,038
Very. Or.

653
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:29,857
Yeah, I think that that is one of the key key parts here is that that looking at the

654
01:19:29,858 --> 01:19:34,928
individual is not necessarily telling you about how the system is going to evolve.

655
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:43,838
And trying to predict individual behavior is just not narrowly tailored that adult cultures and in particular,

656
01:19:43,838 --> 01:19:50,827
as Nancy said, the network and the network mechanism is part of this,

657
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:56,467
part of the reason that that individual level is not telling you about the the

658
01:19:56,468 --> 01:20:01,718
associations of the individual who are not so telling you about what's going to happen, the population level of their thoughts.

659
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:05,288
Yeah, it was interesting to see that.

660
01:20:07,898 --> 01:20:13,738
How? Like.

661
01:20:18,128 --> 01:20:21,408
On New Year's Eve. In the magnitude of.

662
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:37,528
You know. Trying to write the piece that I that I especially want to highlight from what you said is this idea of like,

663
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:43,858
where is the difference creating the outcome?

664
01:20:44,278 --> 01:20:54,748
And it's coming down to how the behavior that is an interaction is different for the two different groups.

665
01:20:54,748 --> 01:21:02,908
Right. And that that because that that because that that behavior is an interaction

666
01:21:03,388 --> 01:21:07,858
that we really need the sense of the complex system in order to catalyze a.

667
01:21:09,848 --> 01:21:14,458
Yeah. They're nuances that people are raised here.

668
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:25,018
One question I sometimes like to ask is If you didn't do modeling, what would you do?

669
01:21:25,408 --> 01:21:40,168
To ask the question to or to assess whether the at the idea of concurrent partnerships could be driving persistent increased problems.

670
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:53,738
If you were given an infinite amount of money, both in an observational study.

671
01:21:55,258 --> 01:22:17,128
Due to. Said a little bit louder.

672
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:31,398
Okay. So it's contact tracing so that you have a very explicit network and that I mean, you could do something kind of like snowball sampling.

673
01:22:31,818 --> 01:22:35,027
And, you know, one of the challenges with that, of course,

674
01:22:35,028 --> 01:22:47,238
is that snowball is it much more effective when it's not something that people like to keep private or feel shame about or,

675
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:54,108
you know, if perhaps their partners don't know that they're having concurrent partnerships, that makes it challenging to disclose.

676
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:58,128
So so is not to say that that is a good idea.

677
01:22:58,278 --> 01:23:00,168
I just want to highlight the challenges associated.

678
01:23:00,948 --> 01:23:13,518
And there is another and yes, there was a cohort study and so and so you think about following a cohort over time.

679
01:23:14,068 --> 01:23:23,088
Yeah. All right. And so you're saying, like, okay, based on if you had a concurrent partnership recently, does that increase your individual risk?

680
01:23:24,048 --> 01:23:30,048
And so I think that that reasonably can get at some of the questions, particularly from the individual perspective,

681
01:23:30,348 --> 01:23:40,818
but it doesn't necessarily get at the idea of how is population level prevalence being maintained higher.

682
01:23:41,298 --> 01:23:47,447
And that's why the that that this question, which is really they frame it as a proven concept.

683
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:53,448
It's a proven concept to understand whether concurrent partnerships could be the mechanism, not that it is the mechanism,

684
01:23:53,628 --> 01:24:00,848
but could be the mechanism by which population level prevalence is held at an elevated rate.

685
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:08,118
Because what we would normally think is that if there's enough intermixing that the prevalence should kind of come together.

686
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:19,248
And so while I think these are all great thoughts, so maybe let's switch to the second question of the anti-racist questions.

687
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:32,778
So maybe let's start with something the paper did as well from your perspective in how it handled this model of of a racial disparity.

688
01:24:44,518 --> 01:24:48,558
Everything's the paper did in the classic 15 seconds. There's nothing really.

689
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:56,888
Okay. Well, what what are your what is something that you think that paper did not do?

690
01:24:59,638 --> 01:25:04,648
Nobody just wants to give first. Nancy.

691
01:25:18,418 --> 01:25:22,708
So it's using different modes of transmission other than sexual.

692
01:25:23,438 --> 01:25:28,708
Right. So that so that they did not account for like.

693
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:33,088
Like needle use, for example. Um.

694
01:25:33,518 --> 01:25:45,058
So. So. So if I were, if I were saying that, like, if this was a model HIV transmission, particularly among people that use drugs,

695
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:53,158
I definitely think that that's a good critique in this context because it's more of like, could this mechanism alone account for?

696
01:25:54,868 --> 01:26:02,108
I'm less concerned, but it isn't. It's a good observation. Yeah.

697
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:18,618
The nature of the networks and how I feel about the societal factors that lead to that.

698
01:26:18,628 --> 01:26:24,998
And I don't think it's again, like claiming, but it's not really interpreting.

699
01:26:30,048 --> 01:26:42,228
So. So what we said was that the paper kind of just like says that there's this this sort of activity and doesn't really explore the why.

700
01:26:42,228 --> 01:26:49,038
They're not blaming black Americans for having higher, but they don't really talk about the larger context.

701
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:55,308
And for me, I think that that is actually the core of what probably could have been done better with this paper.

702
01:26:56,928 --> 01:27:03,588
And and so maybe what are some things what are some contextual things that maybe people would want to add?

703
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:18,278
Here. I'll offer one from so I can't take credit for this.

704
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:23,558
As another student in a different lecture suggested that, you know,

705
01:27:25,328 --> 01:27:39,968
the cultural state and the much higher likelihood of black males in particular at being in incarceration changes that sort of the the.

706
01:27:42,578 --> 01:27:54,017
Socio cultural basis for coupling and that could I honestly not had no idea this is true but they're positing as one hypothesis that

707
01:27:54,018 --> 01:28:06,198
could be a larger structural basis structure that could be have the downstream effects of creating differences in sexual networks.

708
01:28:06,528 --> 01:28:10,068
That is creating differences in the health outcomes.

709
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:19,608
Yes. Also.

710
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:30,878
Absolutely so. Sorry. So. Lack of access.

711
01:28:31,718 --> 01:28:36,148
Distrust in the system. Your timing is everything else. Okay, great.

712
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:39,968
So lack of access, distrust in the system. So these are important.

713
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:49,178
We definitely see these things. We saw them hugely in the COVID epidemic.

714
01:28:49,778 --> 01:28:59,738
Abraham You do work on vaccine hesitancy. So definitely things like mistrust contributes to that.

715
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:11,177
And so, you know, around things like testing for STIs could certainly be a difference in how,

716
01:29:11,178 --> 01:29:19,448
how then people act in terms of treatment and in terms of sexual protection when working in police.

717
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:29,438
Any other thoughts? Yeah. Oh, well, with personal suffering in the context of residential segregation, I felt that.

718
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:41,208
Absolutely. So it's not just that you have a necessity, like a preference and the sort of sexual networks,

719
01:29:41,658 --> 01:29:51,528
but that pure geography is changing who you typically have access to and your sexual networks.

720
01:29:51,888 --> 01:30:02,928
And so you have the larger policies, things like redlining, that have made it very that have created these very segregated structures in America.

721
01:30:03,318 --> 01:30:12,168
In terms of housing, then that affects who the population is nearby you, which affects who you are dating pool.

722
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:20,498
Great. Great observation. Have their thoughts.

723
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:37,558
Yes, that's. Absolutely so.

724
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:44,148
Socio cultural attitudes around sex and norms around sex and norms around dating.

725
01:30:44,488 --> 01:30:48,898
And how do those how are those created?

726
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:53,488
How are they how are they maintained? How. To what extent?

727
01:30:54,508 --> 01:31:04,668
You know, we could say like and then the question that comes to my mind is like, do we want to intervene on certain types of behaviors?

728
01:31:05,308 --> 01:31:09,538
Is it to what extent is it racist to want to intervene on certain cultural practices?

729
01:31:10,588 --> 01:31:17,168
Or as public health professional, you recognize that these practices are related to health outcomes.

730
01:31:17,408 --> 01:31:20,248
How do you deal with that? So that's a great question.

731
01:31:20,248 --> 01:31:26,368
That sort of brings brings some tension in my mind about how we act as public health professionals.

732
01:31:28,978 --> 01:31:31,708
No one has mentioned the Uganda example.

733
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:41,548
So in previous years, people have really hated the fact that the primary thing place that they talk about interventions in Uganda,

734
01:31:43,018 --> 01:31:49,778
on the one hand, is certainly not the case that, like black Americans are interchangeable with.

735
01:31:49,828 --> 01:31:54,217
Like Uganda was right in the defense of the authors.

736
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:58,858
So it's not really about the context being the same,

737
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:07,168
but about places where the intervention has been tried before and that this is that Uganda was one of places where the intervention was tried.

738
01:32:07,678 --> 01:32:10,108
Of course, as we saw in the wash benefits trial,

739
01:32:10,618 --> 01:32:16,738
having an intervention in one location does not really tell you that much about having another location.

740
01:32:18,628 --> 01:32:24,538
But to be fair to the authors, they're not saying that the context are the same.

741
01:32:24,898 --> 01:32:29,878
They're saying that the interventions were similar and thus worthy of being discussed.

742
01:32:33,588 --> 01:32:38,058
Anything else that people want to bring up around the paper?

743
01:32:42,358 --> 01:32:47,668
Also happy to talk more about modeling or this paper or other topics offline.

744
01:32:48,148 --> 01:32:53,518
My email is on the website, but thank you for learning.

745
01:32:53,528 --> 01:33:00,538
Yeah. So. Please, actually.

746
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:08,148
How does that work? Was.

747
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:18,418
But it's difficult for. She's an actress. On their.

748
01:33:20,998 --> 01:33:24,838
Yeah. I'm just thinking. Do you have an example? I.

749
01:33:28,678 --> 01:33:32,628
Right. HIV AIDS is one of the.

750
01:33:36,738 --> 01:33:42,298
Response was so they didn't have access to the phone.

751
01:33:49,018 --> 01:33:55,078
Okay. Yep. So this is a broader problem than just for modeling, of course.

752
01:33:55,648 --> 01:34:00,138
How do we improve the public health population?

753
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:08,398
Is that the part that public health officials don't have access to due to any number of reasons,

754
01:34:08,548 --> 01:34:13,528
many of which may be very legitimate due to how they've been treated by other officials in the past.

755
01:34:14,188 --> 01:34:20,848
What I would say is that certainly is like models need data and data needs actually the population.

756
01:34:21,298 --> 01:34:29,458
And so it's a challenge. We could talk more about it, but since I think we're running out of time here, happy to talk to you.

757
01:34:31,138 --> 01:34:35,038
So I will stop there. Thank you so much for going on this modeling journey with me.

758
01:34:36,058 --> 01:34:39,118
And I'll do this to Abraham to finish this that.

759
01:34:39,178 --> 01:34:43,328
Yeah well I think for me in thinking that the affected.
