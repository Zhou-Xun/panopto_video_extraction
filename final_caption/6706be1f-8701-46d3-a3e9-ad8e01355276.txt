1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:12,826
Monica Rosen: Okay, so we're at one o'clock I have eight people who have registered for this so i'm going to give it another minute or so, but as we're waiting.

2
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:19,906
Monica Rosen: I want to throw in the chat link because I want to make sure that this training about zoom.

3
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:28,186
Monica Rosen: is as relevant to everybody who's participating it as possible, so if I need to skip over things i'm happy to do so, so i'm going to go ahead and put this link in there.

4
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:37,876
Monica Rosen: And you guys can drop some ideas as to what you'd like what your concerns are about zoom or what things you would like to flush out a little bit more.

5
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:49,186
Monica Rosen: so that I can tailor this training towards your own needs, if you see something that you really like feel free to upload it to actually add a new idea you're going to push the green plus button.

6
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:57,826
Monica Rosen: So let me show you a quick.

7
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:14,252
Monica Rosen: So you can push the green plus button here and add an item which will show up as a sticky note for things that you'd like to dive into a little bit deeper or any concerns that you specifically have about you, using zoom to teach.

8
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,638
Monica Rosen: Okay, so i'll just keep letting that go and i'll start the.

9
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:26,628
Monica Rosen: Presentation now and as those come in we'll we'll check back in with it in a moment.

10
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:32,988
Monica Rosen: So today i'll be talking to you guys about teaching with zoom you may be familiar with zoom already.

11
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:42,258
Monica Rosen: From a attendee perspective, but maybe you have a had the control of being the host yes, so there are a few more options.

12
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:49,998
Monica Rosen: Being the host that I want to go over and because zoom is rolling out updates constantly there may be some new features that you may not be aware of.

13
00:01:49,998 --> 00:02:03,318
Monica Rosen: I want to make sure that everybody if you have questions feel free to drop them in the chat at any point and i'll try to get to them as it relates to the content that i'm covering and if we need to skip over stuff we can do so as well.

14
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:12,078
Monica Rosen: So, the main thing that the function of this workshop is to give you guys an idea or being able to identify and implement the basic zoom functions for teaching.

15
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:25,608
Monica Rosen: You would assess some of the utility of these features and zoom as they relate to your courses learning objectives and competencies and then be able to identify some of those zoom features that will help to liven up your course or to engage students.

16
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:32,208
Monica Rosen: And to facilitate collaboration between students.

17
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:42,168
Monica Rosen: So, as I mentioned earlier, when you first came on I put in that link to idea boards i'm seeing a couple of things coming in, I see.

18
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:45,678
Monica Rosen: I think that the chat function is a great way for students to participate.

19
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:54,978
Monica Rosen: But it can be overwhelming in a large class when everyone is sharing and put and asking questions via the chat any suggestions great a great question.

20
00:02:54,978 --> 00:03:01,878
Monica Rosen: So, the main thing I would say i'll come back to this when we talk about the chat feature, but if you have a very large class.

21
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:07,368
Monica Rosen: Sometimes you can let some of those conversations go on, among the students, they might have a conversation around the content.

22
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:12,378
Monica Rosen: But if you want to make sure that questions are coming at a particular time, maybe you want to set the precedence or.

23
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:24,648
Monica Rosen: early on in your course so maybe there will be points in your in your in your lectures that you say Okay, if you have questions now please use the chat feature, or you can already tell them to leave questions to the end.

24
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:29,688
Monica Rosen: What are some of the ways to ensure that the students are participating during a zoom class.

25
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:41,838
Monica Rosen: I think this really depends on what your definition for participation is and how you'd like them to be involved, so if there is content that you're covering that you are actively trying to get students to.

26
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:52,968
Monica Rosen: engage with, then you might need to have prompts within there that kind of facilitates that and brings them together that way, but we can talk about some of those a little bit more, as we look at some of the features that kind of.

27
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:58,458
Monica Rosen: brings students in the breakout rooms, the whiteboard annotations in the chat feature.

28
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:05,238
Monica Rosen: How can I make the zoom classes engaging very good question and, as I go through some of these features i'll try and highlight those.

29
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:13,008
Monica Rosen: But it really depends on the kind of the way you set up your course and the way they invite students to engage in the zoom room.

30
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,798
Monica Rosen: And what is the best whiteboard.

31
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:27,858
Monica Rosen: To using zoom so there's a couple of different options, the main one that i'll be focusing on are the features that are within zoom so zoom has its own whiteboard you may see it down the tap on the toolbar down at zoom.

32
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:39,318
Monica Rosen: Where it says annotate we will cover that in a moment, but there are also external tools that you could use such as jam board jam board is part of the Google suite that allows you even more options to.

33
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:48,468
Monica Rosen: annotate on there, and if you have a if you're a draw you really like to show depictions of things you can actually use that with a tablet as well.

34
00:04:48,468 --> 00:05:01,638
Monica Rosen: And last one what's the best way to pull students in class most easily integrated into the zoom lecture i'll be covering that as well zoom actually has a built in simple poll feature that i'm going to go over Sophia very simple.

35
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:04,458
Monica Rosen: Basic polling.

36
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:12,168
Monica Rosen: But you want to question with students, you can use that function, but we also have a subscription available to sth faculty and staff.

37
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:25,848
Monica Rosen: Including GS is called poll everywhere, you may have seen poll everywhere, and of course that you've taken or in any of the town hall meetings, but it has a breadth of more complex and more engaging types of polling options if that's something you're interested.

38
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:31,698
Monica Rosen: You can reach out to us and we can help you kind of explore poll everywhere, as well, so thanks.

39
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:45,168
Monica Rosen: for putting in those if questions come to you in mind feel free to throw them in the chat or you can go back to the idea boards and throw it as a sticky note on there i'll continue to monitor it and, as I can.

40
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:56,268
Monica Rosen: So what is zoom like I said, most of you are probably aware of zoom's functions it's a video conferencing program that fosters both large and small group discussions.

41
00:05:56,268 --> 00:06:16,608
Monica Rosen: It doesn't necessarily have to be purely passive like we're doing so right now, but you can actually create and generate engagement with students by making use of some of its features, so there is a quick 13 minute zoom produced video for educators, I will share out this.

42
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:19,548
Monica Rosen: presentation to you guys.

43
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,458
Monica Rosen: After this is after the training is done.

44
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:30,978
Monica Rosen: So, in case you want to check that out we've also have a couple of different resources that we've created at university of Michigan and in the School of Public Health specifically.

45
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:46,158
Monica Rosen: So we have zoom instructor guy which I can show you guys i'll share that out with you as well, and then how to run an effective zoom sessions, and this document, right here has some tips based on feedback that was presented from students who really.

46
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:54,078
Monica Rosen: said they got a lot out of certain classes that had very engaging zoom sessions so feel free to look at that whenever you.

47
00:06:54,078 --> 00:07:00,468
Monica Rosen: Like if we have a little bit of time at the end of this training we can explore those a bit more, and then lastly.

48
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:19,848
Monica Rosen: The it s also has some zoom resources there, which I will look over an ambit with you guys, because there are some interesting things in case you want to load like a background as a university of Michigan background they have Those are all on the ids zoom resources page.

49
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:33,018
Monica Rosen: So some of the things that I want to cover here are setting setting up your profile So if you are just a zoom attendee you actually don't need a profile somebody can just send you the link and you can click on that link and you go straight into the zoom meeting.

50
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:45,858
Monica Rosen: But if you are a host you actually need to have set up your account on the zoom website so zoom we have at university of Michigan we have the availability to have all of the.

51
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:57,648
Monica Rosen: Full advantage of zoom and all of its privileges so make sure that you do navigate over to the zoom website at some point and register your account using your Google your umesh account.

52
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:08,928
Monica Rosen: And then we're going to set up a zoom meeting i'm going to show you how to set up a zoom meeting you can do this from a couple of different ways can actually set up your zoom meeting from the zoom website.

53
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:16,458
Monica Rosen: You can also do it from your canvas site if you're having if you're you know your courses being hosted in canvas and once you.

54
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:26,658
Monica Rosen: Once you download the zoom application to your actual computer, you can set them up from the offline on the program as well, then i'll talk about some of the basic features.

55
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:35,748
Monica Rosen: The lingo and the Navigation of the toolbar which is going to be the main thing I want to make sure that you guys all get an opera a feeling of what the toolbar looks like for the host.

56
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:45,138
Monica Rosen: And we'll talk about some of the more advanced or the type new features, this includes some expansion on the breakout room options.

57
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:56,118
Monica Rosen: Being able to use powerpoints as your actual background, which is pretty neat and some of the new features newest features include the immersive view which i'll show you how that looks as well, which is kind of neat.

58
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,198
Monica Rosen: It really depends on.

59
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:05,718
Monica Rosen: Whether everybody has the latest version of zoom and some of the breakout room updates that they've made and then lastly i'll.

60
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:19,908
Monica Rosen: give my host privileges out to each of you, so if you want to see what the you know it looks like to create breakout rooms, to move people around you'll have a safe place to kind of play around with that as well.

61
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:30,978
Monica Rosen: So, first I want to talk about setting up your profile, as mentioned, you can do this within the zoom meeting, if you want to go to the zoom meeting you would just have to i'm on a MAC right now, but you would go.

62
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:33,018
Laura Cifor: Up to the top toolbar.

63
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:34,068
Monica Rosen: settings.

64
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,148
Laura Cifor: i'm going to go ahead and.

65
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:41,058
Monica Rosen: mute some of you, and from the settings.

66
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:46,638
Monica Rosen: You can actually notice it it'll have some profile options there you can change your name from that way.

67
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:56,268
Monica Rosen: there's another Monaco rosen here at the University of Michigan so often i'll actually use my middle initial just so people don't get us confused if that's something or you have a nickname that you'd like.

68
00:09:56,268 --> 00:10:11,838
Monica Rosen: You can put it in that way you can also add your pronouns, if you like, from both the inside the zoom room so again, if you want to go ahead in there, feel free to play around with changing your name now or adding your pronouns.

69
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:26,238
Monica Rosen: But you can also do this from the actual zoom website so I want to go ahead and navigate over there, and she you all, what that looks like.

70
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:30,168
Monica Rosen: So here is my profile on the zoom.

71
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:38,688
Monica Rosen: And then, once you signed up using your umesh account, you can notice that there is an option for your profile and you can go into edit.

72
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:54,738
Monica Rosen: From here you can't actually edit your name, you can only do that from within the actual zoom meeting, but you can add your pronouns here, you can talk about the department if you'd like to eliminate like the department that you're from feel free to do that put in in your title.

73
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,858
Monica Rosen: As well as a.

74
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:14,658
Monica Rosen: Setting other options for the actual meeting so i'm going to do that in just a moment.

75
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:22,638
Monica Rosen: This is also from the website is where you can upload your picture it's really nice to have a picture to look at sometimes it's a little bit difficult.

76
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:31,218
Monica Rosen: When we're talking about how to engage students it's nice to have a face to look at so feel free to go ahead and upload your picture there as well.

77
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:46,908
Monica Rosen: And, as I mentioned, you can change your name and your pronouns and your title and things like that from within the zoom meeting or from the actual application online.

78
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:51,408
Monica Rosen: So the next thing to setting up a zoom meeting you can do this, a couple of different ways.

79
00:11:51,408 --> 00:12:01,338
Monica Rosen: You can set up it from the downloaded zoom program so when you do download zoom you want to make sure that you have you keep up to date, because they're constantly pushing out new features.

80
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:14,178
Monica Rosen: And I think that you have them has recently said that they're going to require that everybody have the newest version, for some of the features that are available, so do make sure you're able to check and download the newest latest version of it.

81
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:19,878
Monica Rosen: You can set up the reoccurring zoom session from the zoom website which i'll show you in a second, you can do it from the data.

82
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:29,328
Monica Rosen: loaded zoom program so once it's actually on your computer, you can open it up and set it up that way, or you can do directly from canvas which i'll cut a brief over as well.

83
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,218
Monica Rosen: Some of the important feature.

84
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:43,128
Monica Rosen: for setting it up include enabling a waiting room, especially if you're going to be using zoom for office hours that would be a really good idea is multiple students may be coming in at the same time, you may want to have them in a waiting room and bring them in.

85
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,808
Monica Rosen: To the personal office our room whenever it's convenient for you.

86
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:55,008
Monica Rosen: You can also pre assigned breakout room, so why might you want to do this, maybe you already have groups group projects that you have people in.

87
00:12:55,008 --> 00:13:04,188
Monica Rosen: And so you want to be able to easily have those students already in specific rooms, especially large class that may be a good idea to pre assigned them.

88
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:19,518
Monica Rosen: And also allows you to do record the meetings, so let me take a quick look over at the website again, so I can show you some of how to set up meetings.

89
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:31,158
Monica Rosen: Okay, so here's from the actual zoom website and after you've filled in your information, for your profile, you can go ahead and go to your meetings.

90
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:41,688
Monica Rosen: And then you would, if I had any upcoming meetings, they would show up here, I do not, at this moment, so there's nothing in there and then you would hit schedule a meeting.

91
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:49,158
Monica Rosen: From here, you probably call it your course i'm not sure what everybody's teaching but let's say it's by.

92
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:57,738
Monica Rosen: ESTA by the one you can put a description, if you like, maybe a link to your syllabus or directly to your canvas site whatever makes sense for you.

93
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,288
Monica Rosen: When that course would be running.

94
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,468
Monica Rosen: When it would should start and how long the course should be.

95
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:15,558
Monica Rosen: So, once you make that link for how long it is that anybody could still click on the link, but if know if the host isn't in there it's actually not going to start anything it's just going to show you waiting waiting waiting for the meeting to start.

96
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:24,948
Monica Rosen: So just because it says it's set for a certain amount of time does not necessarily mean it's going to get cut off or that students don't have access to it it's mainly for the scheduling purposes.

97
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:40,038
Monica Rosen: And then you would say that this is a reoccurring meeting how often weekly, however, often in the week and then what days, and then you can set when the end date is or by how many occurrences are actually going to be.

98
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:53,328
Monica Rosen: So I would recommend that if you're going to have zoom office hours at these be separate you could in theory use the same link, for your course but for clarity sake, I would have a different link.

99
00:14:53,328 --> 00:15:03,048
Monica Rosen: And you can actually then once you've created and set this all up it'll give you a link and you can actually put this into your syllabus you can put it on your canvas site.

100
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:07,968
Monica Rosen: You can email it out to students and they can all have access that way.

101
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:16,008
Monica Rosen: um registration doesn't really apply for apply this is for like workshops that they actually need to register, so we don't we can keep that off right now.

102
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:32,358
Monica Rosen: Pass codes again, you could put a password on there nowadays we don't necessarily do that because we have the zoom link hidden, such as in a canvas site, or in the actual syllabus so only certain students would have access to your link in the first place, but you can have that on.

103
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:38,208
Monica Rosen: Again, enabling the waiting room, but I would alert that if you have the waiting room enabled.

104
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:48,438
Monica Rosen: Be sure that you're paying attention to students being admitted the words are quite small when it comes in, so you'll just need to make sure that you're admitting the students as they're in the waiting room.

105
00:15:48,438 --> 00:16:00,468
Monica Rosen: So for the course I probably would turn the waiting room off for office hours, I may have the waiting room on.

106
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,408
Monica Rosen: You can also set what the.

107
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:17,268
Monica Rosen: How the video and audio is when when people enter the room, if you would like them to be automatically off, you can make sure you put that I personally, if you want to encourage engagement with students.

108
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:23,568
Monica Rosen: I would have it on so but they actually have to turn their video off if they don't want it off off one I mean.

109
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:30,858
Monica Rosen: Being able to access access through telephone or computer audio again I would enable both of them you never know what people situation is.

110
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:45,738
Monica Rosen: As you guys all saw and Michigan recently we had a power outage so maybe they don't have access to the Internet and maybe they're only way of getting in and hearing the lecture maybe through audio through the telephone so keeping that access Sarah is is is pretty important.

111
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:56,628
Monica Rosen: And then, how you want the meeting options to go allow participants to join us anytime that is again if they click on that link it's it's open there they're just maybe nobody in the room.

112
00:16:56,628 --> 00:17:01,758
Monica Rosen: You can also say you want to make sure you mute participants Upon entry, this is probably a pretty good idea.

113
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:06,468
Monica Rosen: You never know what kind of background stuff is going on, when people were first entering the zoom room.

114
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:17,148
Monica Rosen: Again, this is where you would, if you wanted to have pre assigned breakout rooms, this is where you could do it, you could create your rooms create your different groups, depending on how many students who have.

115
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:30,108
Monica Rosen: And you could assign them That way, there are some rules on here, as it says here, you can only create up to 100 breakout rooms and assign up to 1000 participants So hopefully none of you have more than 1000 students in your course I would.

116
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:38,448
Monica Rosen: But who knows that might be there and then automatically recording the media, the recording the meeting.

117
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:43,458
Monica Rosen: it's kind of it's you can do this, a couple of different ways, you can have the meeting actually.

118
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:53,928
Monica Rosen: be recorded to your local computer or you can have it saved in the cloud, and there may be different reasons why you might sometimes want to have this on your own computer or have it up in the cloud but.

119
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:59,268
Monica Rosen: I would suggest, having it in the cloud if you're going to attach this to the canvas site and i'll show you in a moment.

120
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:06,018
Monica Rosen: Why, that would be the why you would probably want to go down that route for students who might want to access if they miss course miss the class.

121
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:14,118
Monica Rosen: canvas if you set up your meetings within canvas site there will actually be a placeholder for it once it's been done processing.

122
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:25,218
Monica Rosen: So that anybody who missed the class can come and watch the recording later, as well as if you put it on your local computer you'll have to manually upload the video which could be a very large file.

123
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:28,998
Monica Rosen: So it could be a little bit more time consuming that way.

124
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:40,608
Monica Rosen: and approve or block entry for users from specific countries or regions, I can I don't really see a reason for having to do this at this point we have many foreign students, so I probably wouldn't.

125
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:49,098
Monica Rosen: put that on there at this point, you can also create assign somebody as an alternative host this may be a good idea if you have an.

126
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:57,348
Monica Rosen: undergrad ta or another co instructor with you, making sure that those that there's somebody who can be the alternative posts.

127
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:06,498
Monica Rosen: So then, once you've created this you would save it and they would give you that link that you provide, so let me just do this one, so you can kind of see what it looks like like.

128
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:13,848
Monica Rosen: So, then you can share this meeting, if you're a user of Google calendar, you can put it in that way and share with the students.

129
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:30,408
Monica Rosen: You can also just copy the invitation copy meeting invitation and you can put this within your on your canvas site and the announcements are wherever you need to and then here's the directly to the invite to the actual meeting.

130
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:50,958
Monica Rosen: If you wanted to go ahead and start that meeting you could start it from here also if you are the actual host of the meeting, if you just click on the same link it'll know it'll recognize you as the host and you'll be the host when you enter it.

131
00:19:50,958 --> 00:20:04,908
Monica Rosen: So I wanted to go ahead and take a quick check in make sure I don't see any questions coming in, but did anybody have any questions up to this point.

132
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:11,958
Monica Rosen: Well, if you do feel free to use the chat function, and let me know.

133
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:24,438
Monica Rosen: So some of the basic features within a meeting they wanted to kind of go over i've talked a bit about the profile options that you can do with your picture uploading a picture setting your pronouns renaming yourself.

134
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:35,778
Monica Rosen: But also another interesting one is creating that virtual background, so, as you can see right now, I have a backup from on it's a blur maybe that's something you'd like to do to that's pretty simple.

135
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:53,658
Monica Rosen: And if you also wanted any of the University of Michigan types of backgrounds, if you go to the actual link to you, am I T information technology services you'll notice that they actually have some custom backgrounds here i'll drop this link in the chat.

136
00:20:53,658 --> 00:21:09,108
Monica Rosen: Just in case you'd like to explore the US.

137
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:20,838
Monica Rosen: So I see a question coming in, we sometimes have concurrent sessions for discussion sections, is it Okay, if the same person host sets up the zoom meeting links for multiple meetings at the same time.

138
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:28,248
Monica Rosen: Yes, you can you can totally do that, but I would make sure that there's somebody who is listed as the co host so that they have or.

139
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:39,078
Monica Rosen: there's an alternative host because then they won't be able to actually run it from within one of the students somebody will randomly be picked as the actual host.

140
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:53,478
Monica Rosen: So somebody has to start that meeting or give some privileges over to another individual so that they can run the meeting they can't be in both zoom reading meetings at the same time.

141
00:21:53,478 --> 00:22:09,948
Monica Rosen: Okay, so, as I mentioned, there are some custom backgrounds, for the zoom in here if you're interested in exploring some of those and downloading them to upload an actual zoom background.

142
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:16,218
Monica Rosen: Real quick and you would actually click there's a couple of different ways that you can actually do it.

143
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:22,398
Monica Rosen: So you can actually click on the three buttons So if you go to your own participants and.

144
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:31,908
Monica Rosen: To everybody that's listed up at the top, and you click on the free button, the three dots and there will be a drop down menu that'll come down and they'll say choose a virtual background.

145
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:42,258
Monica Rosen: So the virtual background, you can change to whatever you like your I am in California, you know these are some of the preset ones that zoom already have.

146
00:22:42,258 --> 00:23:04,218
Monica Rosen: Know maybe want to get away get the nice little tropical oceans moving around So those are fun to work with play with a few like.

147
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:12,318
Monica Rosen: And then, so the next part of this session i'll be talking mainly about that host toolbar down at the bottom.

148
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:26,898
Monica Rosen: we're going to talk about the chat the closed captioning i've actually turned closed captioning on So if you, you will have to see on your side that you actually have to turn them on as well, if you want to see the actual closed captioning showing up down at the bottom.

149
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:37,338
Monica Rosen: Share screening polling reactions and all the other functions as well, and then we'll have that practice activity and passing off the hosts.

150
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:46,578
Monica Rosen: So the toolbar down at the bottom, it feels like it's almost always changing, but this was the latest one before we have participants listen.

151
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:55,128
Monica Rosen: If you actually click on participants you won't see all the options from your side of the view but on my side at that point, if I open up participants, I can actually.

152
00:23:55,128 --> 00:24:10,338
Monica Rosen: turn things off I could ask you if you want to turn your video on please I can request that I can actually mute mute people manually I can actually also make somebody a host or a Co host as well.

153
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:17,388
Monica Rosen: there's also the chat function we've been using that one, so I think you guys are pretty familiar, you can throw your questions in there.

154
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:28,158
Monica Rosen: You can put links to items we have a screen share option and there's a couple of different ways, things that you can find when you open up the screen share.

155
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:31,638
Monica Rosen: Including the whiteboard which i'll talk about in a moment.

156
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:42,918
Monica Rosen: You have the polls or polling as well, these are simple polls, not very complex ones, but it's pretty good to get some quick immediate feedback without bringing in too many external tools.

157
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:54,018
Monica Rosen: And there's the recording option, again, I would recommend recording all of your lectures that you're having with students, as this is a good way for making sure that students who missed the course can review it.

158
00:24:54,018 --> 00:25:02,388
Monica Rosen: Live transcripts what I have going on right now with the closed captioning and then breakout rooms and then reactions.

159
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:12,918
Monica Rosen: So, just a quick note again and with participants, as I mentioned, you have muting power, you can also request that the bit the students turn on their video.

160
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:19,428
Monica Rosen: And you can actually also rename students yourself, so there may be reasons why this might work, perhaps you have.

161
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:30,588
Monica Rosen: Several ashley's who only have their first name and you might need to distinguish between them, or perhaps they are doing a role playing and they're using a particular name, you can rename them that way.

162
00:25:30,588 --> 00:25:40,128
Monica Rosen: You can also turn over the hosting privileges or make somebody a host from the participants section.

163
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:46,938
Monica Rosen: The chat function pretty straightforward and again i'm assuming that many of you are familiar with the chat function at this point.

164
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:54,078
Monica Rosen: But again, you can on your side of things click on the chat box and the chat box is open, you can see, the questions and the links to it.

165
00:25:54,078 --> 00:26:01,638
Monica Rosen: Again, if if you find the chat function to be a little bit overwhelming because you have many students and there's too many questions come coming out at you.

166
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:07,158
Monica Rosen: I would set the stage for when they should post their questions, having.

167
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:15,228
Monica Rosen: A little breakout sessions on your slides if you're using slides during your time saying you know, please go ahead we're allowing five minutes put some questions in there.

168
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:27,798
Monica Rosen: But I will I didn't completely tell them not to use it at all, because I think that there's a lot of good conversation that happens between students and they can answer in address each other's questions as well.

169
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,208
Monica Rosen: From there you'll notice that if you open up the chat function there's a on the bottom.

170
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:43,848
Monica Rosen: screen there's a little too, and it says, right now, the standard is to everyone, but you could actually have direct messages as well to students, so if you have a specific question that's coming to you from a student.

171
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:49,548
Monica Rosen: Or you want to direct question somebody you can choose who you'd like to go to.

172
00:26:49,548 --> 00:27:01,488
Monica Rosen: You can also attach items in the chat function So yes, you can go to links, but if you push the little page button it's got the little dog ear over it, you can actually attach other files as well.

173
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:10,068
Monica Rosen: They have the emojis full emojis in there, that you can use as well as if you open up that three dots over to the side.

174
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:26,178
Monica Rosen: You can save the chat as well, maybe there's some good important questions that you weren't able to get to during your actual live zoom session, and it may make sense to download the chat and address the questions offline later.

175
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:37,638
Monica Rosen: So next is the share screen or screen sharing option it's the one that's right in the middle it's always green if you actually open that you'll notice a variety.

176
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:47,958
Monica Rosen: of things that you can actually share, you can share your entire desktop if you use multiple monitors, it will ask you indicate you wish just stop you'd like to show.

177
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:58,548
Monica Rosen: You can actually show a specific browser windows and maybe have several browser windows, you might have chrome or you know Internet explorer or safari.

178
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:11,838
Monica Rosen: And you can choose one of those as well, we can also when you open it up you'll notice there's the whiteboard option and the whiteboard option is where you can actually do annotations i'll come back to that in a moment.

179
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:18,078
Monica Rosen: So up at the top of the extra share screen you'll notice there's basic advanced and files.

180
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:32,148
Monica Rosen: So if you go over to advanced This is where you can actually do slides as a virtual background and again i'll also come back to this in a moment, as well, because those are pretty fun, perhaps you want to play weatherman and you can actually upload.

181
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:35,688
Monica Rosen: would be your lecture powerpoints as your background.

182
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:40,908
Monica Rosen: That way, which is kind of cool you can also from that advanced function.

183
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:56,148
Monica Rosen: i'm Sorry, I know that you can only see my Google page, I actually can't share me opening up those share screen option so whenever I give you host options, this is where i'm going to ask it that you can kind of look at all those different functions.

184
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,998
Monica Rosen: And then there's a portion of the screen, so you can.

185
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:09,888
Monica Rosen: actually asked for you can share just only a specific part of the screen that you're showing there's also ways of sharing your video specific video files if that's the way you'd like to do it that way.

186
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:18,108
Monica Rosen: And then, if you when you notice they'll also be a file section that you can share directly from various.

187
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:26,718
Monica Rosen: cloud services.

188
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:43,248
Monica Rosen: So, as mentioned when we do the share screen option, this is actually where you find the whiteboard or the annotations to draw on you kid internally, you can input text directly, you can draw on it with a variety of different colors there since stamps.

189
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:50,508
Monica Rosen: And spotlight laser pointers as well, and then any annotations that are made on it or actually can be saved as well.

190
00:29:50,508 --> 00:30:02,088
Monica Rosen: there's also the option of using something externally, as I mentioned jam board is one it's got a lot more options, and it has a variety of slides like type thing that students can go to annotate that way.

191
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:19,848
Monica Rosen: Or, as I showed you before something kind of similar to that is idea boards it doesn't have as much annotation options, but i'm going to go ahead and open up the annotations so that you guys can play around with that from your point of view and see what that looks like.

192
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:26,898
Monica Rosen: So, are you guys seeing the whiteboard now.

193
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:42,318
Monica Rosen: yeah so feel free you can draw on this, you can add your stamps please make use of of looking at how this one works and then as a, as you can see, we can undo things as well, and you can save the whole.

194
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:46,428
Monica Rosen: The whole image as a PNG image.

195
00:30:46,428 --> 00:31:10,338
Monica Rosen: In case there is something that you'd like to use later, a different point.

196
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:15,588
Monica Rosen: So the one that I just use, now is the vanishing pin.

197
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:29,478
Monica Rosen: Okay, so, is it not giving you the options, you should be able to use it as well as a toolbar not showing up for you guys.

198
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:42,558
Probably not.

199
00:31:42,558 --> 00:32:10,338
Monica Rosen: Under view options.

200
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:42,708
Monica Rosen: that's it looks like thanks Joanna for adding that.

201
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:56,898
Monica Rosen: Alright, so i'll go ahead and close the whiteboard now.

202
00:32:56,898 --> 00:33:09,918
Monica Rosen: So, as I mentioned, this is just a very simple annotation whiteboard if you want something a little bit more elaborate I would definitely recommend checking out jam board again jam board is under the Google suite that we all have.

203
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:13,428
Monica Rosen: full access to with our you mesh accounts.

204
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:28,308
Monica Rosen: And then again it would have several whiteboards you could have three or four or five kind of all combined combined as one and you could have different settings on them, so, for instance, you could have a question on one and students can put in their responses that way.

205
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:43,128
Monica Rosen: And then maybe you want to do some graph paper on the next one can upload an image and then have students actually draw directly on that image, so if you need something a little bit more complex feel free to check out jam board.

206
00:33:43,128 --> 00:34:11,178
Monica Rosen: So then there's also the polling option um i'll go ahead and throw polling there right now.

207
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:21,648
Monica Rosen: So for the polling option there's actually a couple of different ways they're all more simple types of polls, but they're single and multiple choice questions that it.

208
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:27,228
Monica Rosen: Is you can have multiple different responses, but they can only just choose one option or they can you.

209
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:34,668
Monica Rosen: can have it, so that they can choose multiple options within their you can use the polling as a form of of a formative assessment.

210
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:42,018
Monica Rosen: And this is a good idea for being able to obtain some student feedback on something on these could be quick, simple check ins.

211
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:50,508
Monica Rosen: every couple of you know 20 minutes or so maybe you want to throw something in that that kind of jars students back to live there.

212
00:34:50,508 --> 00:35:06,738
Monica Rosen: And then you can also generate some data and download the csv files for any types of graphs of statistics that you might want to run or look at if you wanted to use more sophisticated polling or, if you want to have more options than just what.

213
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:13,398
Monica Rosen: What zoom has you actually could use poll everywhere, as mentioned before poll.

214
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:27,288
Monica Rosen: Everywhere, we have the full access to it at school, public health, specifically for students, so if that's something that you want to explore a little bit more feel free to reach out to us and we can get you set up on our poll everywhere account.

215
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:37,578
Monica Rosen: But you would need to be added so definitely make sure you reach out if you if you want to use that.

216
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:45,378
Monica Rosen: So, then the next button is the record option so again, you could set have set it up in your previously when you were setting up.

217
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:51,288
Monica Rosen: The zoom meeting that you wanted to have it automatically record, but if, for some reason it hasn't been.

218
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:55,248
Monica Rosen: You haven't done that you can actually then choose to record.

219
00:35:55,248 --> 00:36:13,368
Monica Rosen: While right when you start the actual meeting so it's pretty simple it'll ask you once it pops up whether you want to save this on your again your local drive or whether you want it to go to the actual cloud service some notes about cloud recording within canvas.

220
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:39,168
Monica Rosen: Let me go ahead and navigate over to my canvas site, so I can kind of show you what zoom looks like, if you want to set it up from directly and in canvas and then i'll kind of talk about some of the ways of accessing those recordings there.

221
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:54,378
Monica Rosen: Okay, so this is my sand box within my canvas site and what you'll notice is that there should be a zoom option here if it's not showing up directly for you in this panel, you may need to add it.

222
00:36:54,378 --> 00:37:05,118
Monica Rosen: To add it you go to your settings at the bottom of your actual course and then to the navigation and you'll see that there are all these different.

223
00:37:05,118 --> 00:37:08,898
Monica Rosen: items that could be added to your course if you're using them.

224
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:16,578
Monica Rosen: zoom will probably be maybe somewhere down here if you're not seeing it and you would just need to drag it and pull it into your actual course and then hit save.

225
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:27,588
Monica Rosen: And the next time you refresh, you will see that zoom should be an option available to you, so it would be very similar, this is just an LTE is nested directly into canvas.

226
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:34,788
Monica Rosen: To scheduling a meeting you can schedule your meeting, call it what you like, with your description.

227
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:40,548
Monica Rosen: Again, all have the same options look identical as they were on the actual zoom website for saving yep.

228
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:47,448
Monica Rosen: And then do it, you put all your directions in there hit save it should be in there and then, as mentioned.

229
00:37:47,448 --> 00:38:00,108
Monica Rosen: There are some things to keep in mind your cloud recordings in will show up here they are very large files, so they may not show up right away, they do need to process before they're actually available in the actual cloud recording.

230
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:05,928
Monica Rosen: So zoom recordings can be accessed from canvas menu, as I mentioned, under the cloud recordings tab.

231
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:18,378
Monica Rosen: But you will need to make sure that the zoom option is publishable so it doesn't have the you know it's not not visible students can actually see it yeah and the actual cloud recording is published.

232
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:19,728
Monica Rosen: zoom.

233
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:33,258
Monica Rosen: recordings are deleted after 150 days, but they can be backed up to dropbox we have some instructions again i'll share out these slides which have the instructions in there, for, if you want to back them up on through on dropbox.

234
00:38:33,258 --> 00:53:31,717
Monica Rosen: Alternatively, you could download and record them and upload them to conoco and then in conoco they can access the video files that way.

235
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:58,398
Monica Rosen: So, then the next one, I want to talk about is the closed captioning option.

236
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:09,678
Monica Rosen: The clothes are the live transcripts are subtitles view once you actually enable this it is you need should know that the attendees also need to click the button to turn them on.

237
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:21,018
Monica Rosen: On their site as well, and a new feature that just came out is that students can actually click the live transcripts and request that life transcripts be turned on from the instructor or the host.

238
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:26,388
Monica Rosen: One thing you might want to keep in mind is I would try and get into the habit of turning the live transcripts on.

239
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:33,588
Monica Rosen: Because we never really know the situation of students on whether they can actually hear us or they can understand us.

240
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:45,708
Monica Rosen: They may have a hearing impairment, they may be a foreign students who could benefit from having the LIFE transcripts or, for instance, maybe their audio isn't working or they need to keep it quiet.

241
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:57,198
Monica Rosen: They have a baby in the background, having the LIFE transcripts benefits, many people so trying to get into the habit of turning those on would be really great for everybody.

242
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:08,268
Monica Rosen: Last is the breakout rooms some notes about breakout room activities by why you might want to use them, you can use breakout rooms, for a variety of different.

243
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:22,638
Monica Rosen: variety of different contexts is, for instance, you could do think pair share types of activities with students, you could do a peer review or mock interviews debates discussions anything you might have a small group discussion and, of course.

244
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:26,808
Monica Rosen: You can generate that again in a breakout activity, I would try and create.

245
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:41,508
Monica Rosen: The breakout rooms relatively small between two to five students each just to make sure that invite students actually turn on the camera and chat with each other and then, once you set up those breakout rooms, you have the ability.

246
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,958
Monica Rosen: To actually navigate to the different rooms, if you like.

247
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:54,678
Monica Rosen: room room assignment options include that you can create the rooms and then you can have the students actually select which room you want, so that could be the situation that you have.

248
00:40:54,678 --> 00:41:02,088
Monica Rosen: Each room is like a type of content that you're going over and they can choose what kind of content, they want to go over in that area.

249
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:16,788
Monica Rosen: yeah you can do the instructor pre assigns everybody, you can also assign on the fly, that is, that you have these various rooms and you're just deciding to put students in them randomly and you can also use zoom's auto created groups.

250
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:19,998
Monica Rosen: as well.

251
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:30,858
Monica Rosen: And something new kind of that's been that's out there now is the ask for help feature, this is avail students can now once they've been put out into breakout rooms.

252
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:39,558
Monica Rosen: They can ask for help from the instructor it will flag, the host to come to that specific breakout breakout room to you know clarify anything.

253
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:48,378
Monica Rosen: And now what's new is that whenever your screen sharing the screen sharing continues out to the various breakout rooms.

254
00:41:48,378 --> 00:42:03,648
Monica Rosen: It didn't used to do that and so we're very thankful that does decided to have that update for us and the breakout room limitations is 50 breakout rooms, I think that that has just been updated to 100 from what I just saw.

255
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:18,078
Monica Rosen: On the other side of things, I had to come back to make sure, but I believe that she has just not been up up to 100 and we'll pray get practice with the breakout rooms whenever I turn over host as well.

256
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:27,438
Monica Rosen: The last thing is the reactions so reactions are another way is an alternative, basically a simple form of polling, if you like.

257
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:35,268
Monica Rosen: going to pertain student feedback just by you know, asking them to vote yes or no, the green check button or the red X.

258
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:42,618
Monica Rosen: You can also have students, you know thumbs up on things which kind of gives us a little bit of information as to how things are going.

259
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:52,728
Monica Rosen: And I would say, if you want again to encourage student engagement model behavior expect of students, so if you have students sometimes presenting and you're turning over.

260
00:42:52,728 --> 00:43:06,528
Monica Rosen: presentations to other students try to also engage with these reactions, so that it kind of gives the idea that the students should be using it as well.

261
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:19,038
Monica Rosen: So some of the new features that i've recently come out is the most of you, this is just a fun one and it doesn't everybody needs to have the latest version of.

262
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:27,318
Monica Rosen: zoom for this to actually work immersive view has a couple of different backup background images that you can actually set.

263
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:33,648
Monica Rosen: So this only works for a maximum of 25 participants, so if you have a very large group it doesn't it won't actually work.

264
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:40,788
Monica Rosen: And if students don't have the latest version of zoom they won't actually see the background, you can continue doing what you're doing.

265
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:53,358
Monica Rosen: But they're not going to see that how they are in the background, so, for instance, this top one show is like one of the presets and you can choose as a one on one kinds of conversation and which you put two people in there.

266
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,988
Monica Rosen: You can also have a larger room that has like this, a URBAN.

267
00:43:56,988 --> 00:44:05,808
Monica Rosen: Urban types of classroom and you can actually move people around and the different seats and so, even if they vote for instance on things.

268
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:16,548
Monica Rosen: You can see this little green check mark here up in the top corner of each person's face, you can actually vote, and they can kind of it makes them feel like they're really immersed in some kind of virtual room.

269
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:23,778
Monica Rosen: If you're interested in learning more about how to enable it, we have a link that will be in here for you to check out.

270
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:33,978
Monica Rosen: But again, keeping in mind that everybody needs to be up to date on on zoom and you have a maximum of 25 participants that can be in a single scene together.

271
00:44:33,978 --> 00:44:45,828
Monica Rosen: If you have more than that they'll just be up at the top, like they traditionally are in zoom, as you can see in this version, right here, where this immersive view is only for two people.

272
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:56,088
Monica Rosen: I think I kind of covered this one, one of the new features was a screen sharing continues to break out rooms and the ability to ask for help from from the host.

273
00:44:56,088 --> 00:45:08,778
Monica Rosen: Another new feature is that they've actually uploaded updated the Co host privileges, so now the Co host for maybe it's a ta of some sort or an assistant.

274
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:10,758
Monica Rosen: Co teacher, for instance.

275
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:25,158
Monica Rosen: can manage and join groups now too, and they can also also broadcast message just out to all of the room so, for instance, maybe you want to give them a five minute warning that will be coming to the main room after so such set of time they can do that.

276
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:29,718
Monica Rosen: They can also force all the participants back into the main room as well, so if you close.

277
00:45:29,718 --> 00:45:36,078
Monica Rosen: The co host has the ability to close all the breakout rooms, which forces all all people back into the original room.

278
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:56,928
Monica Rosen: And so, this is what the toolbar would look like for both the host and the co host very similar, but the only difference, maybe mainly being that they can't actually in the meeting they can only leave it, but if the host leaves they The co host becomes the host and can then end it I would.

279
00:45:56,928 --> 00:46:09,888
Monica Rosen: Sometimes I would think about making a student a Co host because if the host gets bumped out it actually automatically just chooses a random person, which may be a student to be the host of the meeting, and you may be kind of like.

280
00:46:09,888 --> 00:46:21,498
Monica Rosen: have trouble getting back into that room so again, it might make sense, sometimes to have somebody that you want to make the Co host for your course.

281
00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:30,198
Monica Rosen: So at this point now, I want to go ahead and kind of give you guys a little bit of room and to play around with what the host features look like.

282
00:46:30,198 --> 00:46:36,438
Monica Rosen: So what i'm going to do is i'm going to just choose somebody one of the participants in the room to become the host.

283
00:46:36,438 --> 00:46:43,698
Monica Rosen: Look at the different features look at the breakout rooms look at the annotate anything that you'd like spend just a minute, you know, two or three minutes doing so.

284
00:46:43,698 --> 00:47:02,808
Monica Rosen: And then you're going to pass your hosting privilege off to somebody else to do so again, you would go to the participants and then just choose somebody it should you'll see next to their name in the more option that you can then make them the host.

285
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:29,688
See.

286
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:43,308
Monica Rosen: One moment sorry i'm not seeing it now for something, then.

287
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:45,708
Monica Rosen: Oh sorry Julian I think.

288
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,918
Monica Rosen: you're actually listed as a very tough they.

289
00:47:48,918 --> 00:48:42,378
Monica Rosen: just say oh I wasn't actually so i'm going to go ahead and pass over the hosting privileges over to Andrea and again once I make you host if you have any problems, trying to shift it over just reach out and we'll walk you through that.

290
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,548
Monica Rosen: So as Andrea is.

291
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:53,868
Monica Rosen: Being the host if you guys have any additional questions or you want me to review or look over anything.

292
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:59,148
Monica Rosen: In more in depth feel free to to let me know.

293
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:05,658
Monica Rosen: i'm happy to answer any questions.

294
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:21,318
Monica Rosen: And i'm going to go ahead and stop my share.

295
00:49:21,318 --> 00:50:00,048
Monica Rosen: That looks like Andrea was able to find how to turn over to the host and Nikki so thanks for that.

296
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:30,018
Monica Rosen: Oh, it looks like Nikki made a breakout room awesome cool i'm going to go ahead and go into the breakout.

297
00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:38,598
Monica Rosen: One thing I will also know is that if you when you go to download the actual zoom APP you can play with a with a lot of these features.

298
00:50:38,598 --> 00:51:39,018
Monica Rosen: Except there won't be anybody in the room, but you can play with it off line, basically, so you can open up a zoom room, with no one in it, and you can see all the different options that are there for you as well.

299
00:51:39,018 --> 00:52:15,558
Monica Rosen: Thanks thanks making.

300
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:31,758
Monica Rosen: So I will also mention that there's any other, we have a couple more other trainings that are available that are coming up i'll put the link in the chat since I don't want to share right now, so that you guys can take your turns with being host.
