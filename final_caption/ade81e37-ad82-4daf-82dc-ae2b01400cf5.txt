1
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:13,992
Okay. So let's get going here.

2
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:25,062
So we are going to talk, as I said, about inner bacteria, a.k.a. some general characteristics of these organisms.

3
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:31,902
These are pathogenic genera. They are human colonizers or pathogens.

4
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:40,632
But of course, anything that colonize is a human. If it gets in a site that it doesn't normally colonize can be a pathogen.

5
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:51,102
The other bacteria, a.k.a. also include nonpathogenic genera, and these can be human colonizers, or they can be environmentally acquired.

6
00:00:51,102 --> 00:01:01,302
And then also, there are some oxidized negative. These are all oxidase negative isolates, and they ferment glucose and they grow on mcconkey agar.

7
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:08,882
That's the definition of Enterobacteriaceae other than being gram negative.

8
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:14,552
So where do the antibacterial ACA live, what are their reservoirs?

9
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:20,702
So they love the human gastrointestinal tract, so they inhabit the human GI tract.

10
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:28,202
They also inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of other animals, rabbits, birds, dogs, cats and so on.

11
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:35,282
They are environmental organisms. They can be found out in the environment. Our skin, your knee.

12
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:41,312
And you might get an infection with a gram negative organism if you don't take care of the wound carefully.

13
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:44,882
They are also zoonotic pathogens.

14
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:57,062
They can cause disease in animals other than humans, and they are only present in non gastrointestinal sites during disease.

15
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:05,102
If there's no disease, they will only be present in the gastro and enteric areas.

16
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:11,162
How are they transmitted? There's endogenous infections from the patient's own flora.

17
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:17,852
There can be person to person transmission by hand or a lack of handwashing and other mechanisms.

18
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:25,202
They can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water, and they can also be vector borne.

19
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:28,232
You get a bite from an animal you get. They can be.

20
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:35,642
You cut your hand playing baseball when you slide on the ground and you can acquire them from ground.

21
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:40,312
Also, not really a vector, but it could be. You could be vector animals there.

22
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:47,392
Next slide. So what's the pathogenesis and spectrum of disease for the antibacterial?

23
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:55,732
Some organisms are overt pathogens. They are always pathogens, no matter where they're quiet, where they are isolated from in the body.

24
00:02:55,732 --> 00:03:00,172
So salmonella species salmonella causes gastrointestinal disease,

25
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:08,542
can cause bacterial with organisms in the blood can cause extra intestinal infections infections outside the intestinal tract.

26
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:13,252
It can cause something called enteric fever, which we now call typhoid fever.

27
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:18,472
Shigella species is always a pathogen, and it can cause dysentery.

28
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:25,612
And if you don't know it, dysentery is is diarrheal disease that you think that will never end.

29
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:32,602
And then of course, there's your city of pestis, which is the cause of plague or black plague, which some people call it.

30
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:40,582
We don't see your cilia pestis in Michigan, but in areas of the southwestern part of the United States, they do.

31
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:46,472
So those are overt pathogens. There are also opportunistic pathogens in the antibacterial.

32
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:52,612
Okay, so you may be familiar with some of these names of organisms Citra vector species,

33
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:58,222
antrobus or species, Klebsiella species, Proteus species and Serratia species.

34
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:07,312
These can be very pathogenic and cause a great deal of disease, but usually only in immunocompromised patients,

35
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:12,412
unless, of course you have a cut that gets infected or something like that.

36
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:19,822
And then, of course, our friend. E. coli, it is more pathogenic than the opportunists.

37
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:21,982
Some strains are overt pathogens.

38
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:28,912
So if you have your copy of Bailey and Scott, look at Table twenty five Dash two in the 13th edition of Bailey and Scott,

39
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:37,922
or Table 19, Dash two in the 14th or 15th editions of Bailey and Scott.

40
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:43,982
So here's an example of what you might see there. So an organism, the table is broken down into organism,

41
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:50,882
virulence factors and spectrum of disease and infection, so E. coli as a cause of extra intestinal infections.

42
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:59,842
What are the virulence factors? There are several, including an endotoxin capsule production and pili that mediate attachment to host cells.

43
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:04,742
So why is capsules? Why are capsules virulence factors?

44
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:12,782
Will there consider them as a large, slimy coating over the outside of a bacterial cell?

45
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:22,832
The they're so slippery that the cell cannot get engulfed by a white blood cell, so that's what capsules do.

46
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,772
What's the spectrum of disease of E. coli causes?

47
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:34,232
Urinary tract infections very commonly can cause bacteremia, nosocomial infections of various body sites,

48
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:39,302
and it's the most common cause of gram negative nosocomial infections.

49
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:44,282
Going down this list, there are entero toxic gennych E. coli called E-Tech Etsy,

50
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:53,672
and these virulence factors for the E-Tech isolates are pili that permit gastrointestinal colonization.

51
00:05:53,672 --> 00:06:03,212
They also have heat label oil and heat stable A. Toxins that mediate secretion of water and electrolytes into the bowel lumen.

52
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:11,612
Here we're talking a massive diarrhea. So travelers and childhood diarrhea is characterized by profuse, watery stools.

53
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:19,172
It's transmitted by contaminated food and water. Going down the list.

54
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:27,842
There's intro invasive E. coli known as EIC, and the very virulence factors here are not clearly defined,

55
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:40,112
but they allow the organism to invade the air and to enter a sites lining the large intestine similar to how Shigella invades those cells.

56
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:48,062
What can it cause? Can cause dysentery, which is necrosis, ulceration and an inflammation of the large bowel,

57
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:54,902
usually usually seen in young children living in areas with poor sanitation.

58
00:06:54,902 --> 00:07:03,662
Then there's the antral pathogenic E. coli known as APEC, and these cells have bundle forming pili.

59
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:11,222
They have Intiman and other factors that mediate organism attachment to the mucosal cells of the small ball.

60
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:16,592
And this attachment to the mucosal cells results in changes in the cell surface.

61
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:20,582
For example, there's a loss of microvilli. What does this cause?

62
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:29,462
Causes diarrhea in infants in developing low income nations and can cause a chronic diarrhea.

63
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:39,722
Also, very, very difficult to get rid of it. Then the one I have marked in a red box entro hemorrhagic E. coli EACC.

64
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:46,322
These isolates of E. coli produce a toxin similar to Shiga toxin,

65
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:52,832
and it's most frequently associated with certain serotypes of E. coli, most commonly.

66
00:07:52,832 --> 00:08:01,412
E. coli O157:H7 causes enter hemorrhagic diarrhea with this organism.

67
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:04,862
There's inflammation and bleeding of the mucosa of the large intestine.

68
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:15,152
Causing that hemorrhagic colitis can also lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, resulting from toxin mediated damage to the kidneys.

69
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:21,782
It's transmitted by ingestion of undercooked ground beef or raw milk.

70
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:28,412
And then, of course, with E. coli, there's an aggregate of E. coli known as EIC.

71
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:35,342
And this probably involves binding by Pillai s t like and he like toxins.

72
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:42,962
The actual pathogen pathogenic mechanisms are really not known, but it involves binding a binding situation,

73
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:48,302
and it causes watery diarrhea that can be prolonged in some cases.

74
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:54,162
The mode of transmission is not well understood. It needs additional studies.

75
00:08:54,162 --> 00:09:07,092
Next slide. So now we go to Shigella and Shigella species have several factors that mediate adherence and invasion of mucosal cells,

76
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:13,602
they can escape from Fagg acidic vesicles. There is intracellular spread and inflammation.

77
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:21,852
They're like the perfect pathogen. Shiga toxin role in disease is uncertain, but it has various effects on host cells.

78
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:32,262
It can cause dysentery type disease defined as acute inflammatory colitis and bloody diarrhea characterized by cramps,

79
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:36,672
abdominal tenaciousness and and bloody mucus stools.

80
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:43,042
Infections with Shigella sonii may produce only watery diarrhea.

81
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,262
And then, of course, we have Salmonella species,

82
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:53,002
and it has several factors to protect organisms from stomach acids because it has to get through the stomach to get to the intestines.

83
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:58,672
Has factors to promote attachment and phagocytosis by intestinal mucosal cells.

84
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:04,822
Factors that allow survival in and destruction of phagocytes. And it facilitates dissemination to other tissues.

85
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:09,442
There are three general categories of infection here, and I've got them shown here.

86
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:14,332
There's gastroenteritis and diarrhea caused by a wide variety of serotypes

87
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:20,552
of salmonella that produce infections limited to the mucosa and some mucosa,

88
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:27,082
the gastrointestinal tract. This is most commonly caused by Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis,

89
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:31,612
and those these are the most common serotypes also in the United States.

90
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:38,032
There can be bacteremia and extra intestinal infections by spread from the gastrointestinal tract.

91
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:45,532
How do they spread? Well, if there's the gastrointestinal tract is is involved, there's massive enteritis and diarrhea.

92
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:51,502
There may be breaks in the gastrointestinal wall and they can get into the bloodstream.

93
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:59,812
And these infections usually involve salmonella, cholera sue us and Salmonella Dublin, although any serotype can cause bacteremia.

94
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:05,392
And then, of course, enteric fever, which we commonly know is typhoid fever, typhoid.

95
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:12,112
And this is characterized by a prolonged fever and multisystem involvement, including lymph nodes, liver and spleen.

96
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:22,492
This is maybe a life threatening infection most commonly caused by Salmonella typhi or Salmonella Paratici.

97
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:27,852
Next slide. So let's go on to your city pestis.

98
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:36,252
And this is the causative agent of plague. There are multiple factors at play, a role in the pathogenesis of this organism.

99
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:45,492
They can adapt to for intracellular survival and production of Anti-Flag Ferguson capsule so that they can't be Fargas.

100
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:51,402
They can produce extra toxins and or toxins, coagulation and fibrin, eliason.

101
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:56,292
So there are two major forms of infection with this organism.

102
00:11:56,292 --> 00:12:01,362
What is bubonic plague? And one is pneumonic plague.

103
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:10,272
Bubonic plague is characterized by a high fever and painful inflammatory swelling of of lymph nodes in the axilla and in the groin.

104
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:14,352
And these are the characteristic bubbles that people refer to.

105
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:19,452
The infection can rapidly progressed to four-minute bacteremia that is frequently fatal.

106
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:31,212
If untreated, pneumonic plague involves the lungs, as you might expect from that name, and it's characterized by malaise and pulmonary signs.

107
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:37,812
The respiratory infection can occur as a consequence of bacterium spread associated with bubonic plague

108
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:43,902
or can be acquired by the airborne route during close contact with other pneumonic plague victims.

109
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:54,672
And this form of plague is also rapidly fatal. Then we go to your Cynthia and her political subspecies enter clinica,

110
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:59,352
and there this organism has various factors that allow the organism to attach

111
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:06,442
to and invade the intestinal mucosa and can spread to the lymphatic tissue.

112
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:14,722
So these factors can cause an enterocolitis characterized by fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain,

113
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:26,532
but it can also cause acute mesenteric lymphangitis, which may present clinically as appendicitis, and it's called pseudo appendix killer syndrome.

114
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:34,802
Pseudo appendage, killer syndrome, excuse me, the Bactrim bacteremia can occur with this organism, but is uncommon.

115
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:38,342
If we go down to the next organism on the list,

116
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:45,812
you're sitting a pseudo tuberculosis is similar to has similar factors as you're sitting in our politica.

117
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:49,442
It can cause similar infections but as Analytica,

118
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:57,062
but it's much less common than we get down to the gram negatives that we commonly think of as in inner bacteria,

119
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:03,722
AK citro, vector and a vector, Klebsiella Morganelli, Proteus Providence's and Serratia.

120
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:07,062
There are several factors that they may have.

121
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:19,212
Each or many, including endotoxin capsules, adhesion proteins make it bind to the cell much easier and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents.

122
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:29,892
And here we see a wide variety of nosocomial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract blood and several other normally sterile sites.

123
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:35,922
Most significantly, if it gets into the spinal fluid, that is very, very, very bad,

124
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:42,682
most frequently infected, hospitalized and seriously debilitated patients.

125
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:47,242
Next slide. Now we go on to your city, how that's a duplicate.

126
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:58,432
Go on to the next one. OK, so laboratory diagnosis? Specimen collection and transport and processing, it's all what we normally do in the laboratory.

127
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:05,872
There's no special considerations for these organisms beyond the use of appropriate transport media for specimens or if it's an interior specimen,

128
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:14,992
we need an transport media. If it's a piece of tissue, it needs to be transported appropriately and so on.

129
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:24,112
There are no specific procedures for a direct detection for routine and tariffs, except for on a stool.

130
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:35,032
Stool specimen we can do a toxin detection for E-Tech strains by an enzyme immunoassay or a molecular assay.

131
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:40,042
And as I said, there are molecular panels available for direct detection of multiple pathogens.

132
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:46,972
But we absolutely still need to set up a culture of the specimen so we can do a susceptibility test,

133
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:54,162
which will be necessary and mandatory if we isolate one of these organisms.

134
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:59,712
So what do we set the culture up with? We use Blood Auger. We use Chocolate Auger.

135
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:07,572
And we use McConkey. All support will support the growth in the colonies on blood and chocolate will be large, kind of grayish and smooth.

136
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,812
Now, if we are thinking about maybe a year city infection,

137
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:20,022
we use Sinaga since stands for Safe Saladin or Gas and Novo Bias and Augur, and that is selective for your city, a species.

138
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:26,982
We can use Hecht on Augur to isolate salmonella or Shigella, and we can use McConkey Sorbitol,

139
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:32,352
which is a McConkey server, a specific kind of mcconkey auger that uses sorbitol in it.

140
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:40,772
And E. coli cannot ferment sorbitol within 48 hours.

141
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:46,952
Next slide. So here's a gram stain of intéret gram negative four, and you can see they'll all look the same.

142
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:52,192
So you can't tell which is which from a grand state. Next slide.

143
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:59,362
So what do we do starting our laboratory diagnosis? Well, we look at the appearance of the colony if there's swarming.

144
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:12,972
We know it's most likely a Proteus. If it's all positive swarming, it will be Proteus vulgaris, if it's all negative, it would be Proteus mirabilis.

145
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:23,792
Very easy identification now, Klebsiella species are may commonly be very, very much coy, they look slimy occasionally.

146
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:29,952
E.coli may be new quite often. But the more common genus is Klebsiella.

147
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:39,072
If the organism grows as a black colony on Hecht on agar, it is H2S positive salmonella.

148
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:46,252
Salmonella grows on Hector Agar, and if they can produce H2S, the colonies will be black.

149
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:55,132
If you look at colonies on a McConkey Auger, Serratia sometimes makes a red pigment and on Sinaga Auger,

150
00:17:55,132 --> 00:18:01,612
your city will have a red center to the colony with a clear border on this on the colony.

151
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:07,432
How do we identify these organisms? We can use automated identification systems that I've already mentioned.

152
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:14,722
We can use AI API strips that have to be inoculated manually, but they work very, very well.

153
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:21,412
If it's a salmonella, it will need to be stereotyped. Stereotyping is not done in clinical labs, it's done in public health labs.

154
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:28,072
And here in Michigan, everything would be sent to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Microbiology Lab.

155
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:37,132
And unless there's an outbreak, most labs limit the typing to the Vianna and the major groups of antigens.

156
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:44,442
And then, of course, we can identify gram negatives very easily with MALDI-TOF.

157
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:55,692
And MALDI-TOF is a means of identifying bacteria based on their structure and their and their chemicals.

158
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:59,952
Next slide. So here's intéret gram negative rods on blood auger.

159
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:09,252
And you can see that the E. coli doesn't look much different from the club seal, except Klebsiella is more mew quite.

160
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:14,822
It looks more slimy, the colonies are a little bit larger.

161
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:22,232
Going to the next slide here is a Proteas species, and you can see that it's swarming and it swarms almost in waves.

162
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:32,842
You can see where the initial inoculum was applied at the bottom of the plate and then it has swarmed out after that.

163
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:38,492
Next slide. Here we have Hector Augur and its use for identification of salmonella and Shigella,

164
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:48,202
and you can see these black colonies and those are the ones that you would like would need to subculture and identify,

165
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:52,012
and the colorless colonies would be ones that you'd want to look at.

166
00:19:52,012 --> 00:20:03,162
Also, because not all salmonella produce H2S and Shigella does not produce age to us, you'd want to look at anything that was black or colorless.

167
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:08,472
Next slide. And here we have seen Augur for your city, a species,

168
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:19,262
and you can see the red is just a subculture of a peer to peer culture, and all the right colonies are your city of species.

169
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:26,932
Next slide. So how do we. Going on in laboratory diagnosis, we can't tell the physician what to treat with,

170
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:33,712
and we know that there is a lot of unpredictability in the susceptibility of these enteric organisms.

171
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:43,372
So we do need to do susceptibility testing for extra intestinal infections, as well as on isolates from very young children and travelers.

172
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:49,822
Now, we don't know in the lab who is a traveler, so unless someone calls and tells us it may not be done.

173
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:57,682
However, there are other laboratories major lives that just do routine susceptibility on these because we don't know the patient's

174
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:05,332
requirements and also because presumptive treatment of gastrointestinal disease with antibiotics is quite controversial.

175
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:17,692
You can cause more problems by treating unnecessarily with the wrong treating, with the wrong antibiotics or with antibiotics that are not necessary.

176
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:24,532
Next slide. So now we're going to go to a different group of organisms, vibrio acrimonious and please, I'm honest.

177
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:30,772
And these are different from the entire because they're all oxidase positive and their glucose ferments and they grow Markakis.

178
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:36,952
So E. coli and the Enterobacteriaceae are not oxidase positive.

179
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:48,112
That's a major dividing line. Well, antibacterial ACA and the the Vibrio Eremos, please monitor all glucose from it as they grow on my Mac.

180
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:53,662
But the big difference is that oxidase positivity. Where do these organisms occur?

181
00:21:53,662 --> 00:22:02,392
Vibrio likes brackish or saltwater. Airmar is in Michigan, but likes various aquatic environments.

182
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:05,212
And please IMO, this is also in Michigan, in freshwater.

183
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:12,602
But it's not as common as Arizona's, and there can be outbreaks if waters are not treated appropriately.

184
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:20,732
How are these organisms transmitted? Vibrio is transmitted by the fecal oral route exposure to contaminated seafood or water.

185
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:25,052
Hand-washing is critical, absolutely critical.

186
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:30,242
You need to wash your hands very well so you don't spread anything, including Vibrio.

187
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:35,402
And I would also suggest never eating and uncooked seafood.

188
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:43,442
Acrimonious can be acquired by exposure to contaminated food or water or by traumatic injury due to a fish hook.

189
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:48,152
So if you're taking a fish hook out of a fish and you accidentally stab yourself,

190
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:54,122
you might want to tell your physician about it, particularly if it looks like an infection is being is occurring.

191
00:22:54,122 --> 00:23:02,132
And then please, the onus is can be transmitted by exposure to contaminated food or water or exposure to reptiles.

192
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:06,602
And there are people who have reptile pets and they left them out of their cage.

193
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:15,882
And you have to be very careful with that because they can transmit, please Mona's.

194
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:25,722
Next slide. So what's the pathogenesis in the pathogenesis and spectrum of disease, so vibrio cholerae clearly is the most serious.

195
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:38,052
It has a cholera toxin that can cause a mucosal cells to hyper secrete water and electrolytes, causing massive diarrhea, profuse watery diarrhea.

196
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:43,122
The patients suffer from fluid loss. They get dehydrated.

197
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:47,832
The stool from these from patients who have cholera is called rice water stool

198
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:53,532
because it's massive fluid with mucus flex that that looks like pieces of rice.

199
00:23:53,532 --> 00:24:01,632
But the fluid loss here and in cholera through cholera can can be life threatening for a patient, particularly for a child.

200
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:08,712
Now there's also non cholera vibrio disease, and the specific virulence factors are really undefined here.

201
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:13,302
But a patient can get gastroenteritis from uncooked or improperly cooked.

202
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:20,712
Seafood can get wound infections. They get stuck with a fish hook that's been in the water in the lake.

203
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:24,912
They can become sepsis. And then, of course, there's acrimonious and please him honest work.

204
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:30,732
We really don't know too much about the virulence factors, but these two organisms can cause wound infections.

205
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:40,922
They can cause gastroenteritis and worse than both of those is becoming sepsis with septic with either one of them.

206
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:43,172
Next slide. So what do we do in the laboratory?

207
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:51,242
Well, first we have to get the specimen into the laboratory and we don't have any unique requirements for transporting specimens,

208
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,702
except that suspected Vibrio should only be transported.

209
00:24:54,702 --> 00:25:05,342
And Blair, which is a standard transport media for stool specimens and not use glycerol and buffered glycerol saline because that's toxic for Vibrio.

210
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:18,462
So almost all of the. Transport media that's obtained commercially for stool specimens has Kerry Blair, MediaBuzz, so that should be used.

211
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:21,942
What you would see direct detection on a gram saying you're not going to see much

212
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:27,282
if you look at a stool specimen because it will be massive amounts of organism.

213
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:36,792
However, it's not in a stool specimen. You might be able to see individual from Vibrio gram, negative rods, slightly curved air Morris will be.

214
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:40,572
This will all be gram negative rods. Aaron Morris will be straight rods. Please email.

215
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:45,552
This will may be single or in pairs. Paris it could be short chains or long filaments,

216
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:55,812
so you get more of that filamentous activity with pleasing monitoring what you do with the Vibrio or airman's.

217
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:03,402
Next slide. So here's a gram stain of Vibrio species, and you can see how curved the rods are.

218
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:10,242
There's no no question that these are curved rods. But then of course, you know you're going to think Vibrio, but where did this patient get it?

219
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:17,262
So there would need to be an investigation also and talk to the patient and find out where they've been and what they've eaten and so on.

220
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:17,952
Next slide.

221
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:26,442
So going on with laboratory diagnosis, what do we use for culture, media, all of these organisms growing blood agar and they all grown macaque yoga.

222
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:30,552
They may be lactose fermenters or non lactose for a minute, so it doesn't really help you there.

223
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:37,302
But when we set up stools, we use thilo's sulfate citrate, bile salt sucrose tubes.

224
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:42,732
And this is a selective medium for Vibrio and selective media.

225
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:51,152
Vibrio will ferment sucrose and makes the yellow colonies on a blue green plate.

226
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:56,612
For colony appearance, they look like other gram negative rods, if you put air monies on a blood on your plate,

227
00:26:56,612 --> 00:27:01,892
it might be better hemolytic all of these isolés oxidase positive.

228
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:06,902
And so you want to look for oxalates, positive colonies that are not pseudomonas.

229
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:12,782
How do we identify them? We identify them with MALDI-TOF, which of course, is mass spectrometry.

230
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:19,982
We can identify them with biochemical tests. And there are molecular assays that you can do a stool specimens,

231
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:30,802
and they will tell you a variety of organisms that that that can detect a variety of organisms that might be in the specimen.

232
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:34,742
Next car, next slide, and this is TV for four Vibrio,

233
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:45,172
and you can see Vibrio makes kind of greenish colonies with maybe yellow hemolysis or yellow yellowing of the media around many, many, many colonies.

234
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:55,302
But the colonies are kind of greenish on TCB Sogar. And once again, TBS is file citrate, bile salts, agar.

235
00:27:55,302 --> 00:28:00,792
Next slide going on with laboratory diagnosis for these organisms,

236
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:10,482
we really think about doing susceptibility testing so tetracycline or dockless doxycycline or first line drugs for cholera,

237
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:21,372
but fluid management is critical. And and for this and other organisms and so fluid management is part of the main therapy for these for this.

238
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:29,272
If you're thinking about cholera, many of these infections will clear with and without anti-microbial therapy,

239
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:34,062
but your patient may also detect extra intestinal infections.

240
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:39,732
These can be life threatening, and the patient absolutely needs antibiotics.

241
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:46,752
And then, of course, there's resistance factors. Some of them easily develop resistance to common antibiotics.

242
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:52,722
This has happened in Arizona species that produces a variety of different fatal act masses.

243
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:59,682
And so it is necessary to do susceptibility testing.

244
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:06,762
Next slide. Oh, that's it. Questions you can't ask me any, but you know how to reach me if you have any questions.

245
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:14,049
Email me if you have any questions. Thank you so much and I will see you next week.
