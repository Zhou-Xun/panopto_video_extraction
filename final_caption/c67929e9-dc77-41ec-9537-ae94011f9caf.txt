00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,512
Morning everyone,

2
00:00:01,512 --> 00:00:07,401
welcome to our first lecture of the custom nationalized discourse I'm Linda Valeri,

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,851
assistant professor of Biostatistics at Columbia University.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,579
Today, I will review important principles in causal inference in particular,

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,511
I will review with you counterfactuals,

6
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:30,361
marginal structural models and causal diagrams.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,137
This note set should provide you with all the information that will be needed for

8
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:44,690
our first class where we will spend some time working through exercises

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,451
to become familiar with this important principles of causal inference.

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,845
Causal inference attempts to articulate the assumptions needed to move

11
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:02,561
from conclusions about associations to conclusions about causation.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,387
One should always be aware that association and

13
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,920
causation are two distinct concepts.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,949
And while association indicates whether two variables

15
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:20,941
are related in the sense that knowing something about one of them,

16
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:25,863
tells you something about the likelihood of another,

17
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:30,584
this is also referred to statistical correlation.

18
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:35,275
Causation said goes deeper into the type of relationship

19
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,919
that these two variables have.

20
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:42,791
And in particular, wants to establish whether

21
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:47,664
two valuables are causally related which means

22
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:52,901
whether an intervention on one of the two variables

23
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:57,918
has the potential to directly change the other.

24
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,804
Association does not imply causation,

25
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:09,927
causation is a stronger conclusion that we might give to our statistical analysis.

26
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:15,320
What else, we are almost often safe in interpreting our say output

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,424
from the regression model as an association we should be very,

28
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:24,183
very careful to translate that associational

29
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:28,161
interpretation into a causal interpretation.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,257
We actually need the discipline of causal inference,

31
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:40,433
to be able to articulate what is being assumed when we go on moving to and

32
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:45,160
interpretation of our findings under a causal lens.

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,949
In order to formalize the idea of the cause effect relationship,

34
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:55,591
counter factuals are the main mathematical tools.

35
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:01,215
The counterfactual, helps us thinking what would have happened

36
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:07,240
if contrary to fact we have done something other than what we did.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,115
This is a concept that dates back to you but

38
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:16,986
as well as part to Aristoteles when philosophers were thinking

39
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:22,082
about how to formulate our knowledge about the world,

40
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:26,202
our causes for phenomenon that we observe.

41
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:29,813
So what is the counterfactual,

42
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:34,897
Neyman was the first in 1923 to translate

43
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:40,261
this idea from words to mathematical objects.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,849
In this course, we will always refer to counterfactuals,

45
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,317
those random variables such as the under variable

46
00:03:54,317 --> 00:04:00,043
Y to which we also attach a sub strict, for example,

47
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:04,990
let's say that we have a binarity outcome Y,

48
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,040
that we denote to be the cure status.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,654
And let's say that we have an exposure or

50
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:19,946
treatment of interest that we will call a, and

51
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:24,834
let's say that both our health outcome and

52
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:31,755
our exposure at binary, with the notation Y sub strict one,

53
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:36,643
we denote the potential outcome of whether

54
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:41,155
the individual would have been cured.

55
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:46,939
If potentially contrary to fact these individuals

56
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,183
were given treatment one while sub strict zero

57
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:57,831
is the potential cure status for the person if he or

58
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:02,419
she was assigned treatment level zero.

59
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,470
For each individual, we only get to observe one of these potential outcomes Y

60
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,356
sub strict one, Y sub strict zero.

61
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:12,880
We observe the Y sub strict one if they give and

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,120
receive treatment one, we observe Y sub strict zero

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,597
if the individual received treatment zero note that,

64
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:28,854
we have no way to observe the other counterfactual.

65
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,824
I introduced here for example,

66
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:37,214
consider that this is the table that we received from God,

67
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:42,824
who knows everything maybe, [LAUGH] for eight individuals,

68
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:48,214
for this eight individuals, let's say we know what would

69
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:54,640
be their potential cure status when treatment is equal to one.

70
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,261
And we also get to know what their cure styles under treatment equals zero.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,147
Note that these eight individuals can be classified according

72
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:17,278
to the combination of values that this potential outcomes take,

73
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:21,067
in particular since both the outcome and

74
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:26,761
the exposure are binary, we get to see four types of people.

75
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,748
There may be some individuals like individual one,

76
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:37,361
who were cured only if they are given treatment one.

77
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,788
There may be some individuals like individual two,

78
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,736
who are cured only if they are given treatment zero,

79
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:51,582
there are also some individuals like subject three who are cured

80
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:58,140
regardless of the treatment that they received, they are always cured.

81
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,543
Whereas individual four, is a type of person who will not be

82
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:06,341
cured regardless of the treatment they received.

83
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,313
If you think about it, individual three is

84
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:17,406
the healthiest among these eight individual types,

85
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:21,261
and individual four maybe the sickest.

86
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,544
So remember that these combinations of potential

87
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:32,138
outcomes are the archetype of our confounding.

88
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:37,845
That is, we know that there might be people that are very,

89
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,873
very different from others and

90
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:45,764
this might confound our study of the relationship

91
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:50,901
between the exposure or treatment and the outcome.

92
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:56,019
In particular, we want to make sure that we can balance

93
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,587
the presence of these latent unobserved response types and

94
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:04,838
how do we typically achieve that?

95
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:11,296
Via randomization, when randomization is not gonna be visible,

96
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:16,022
we will try to collect a lot of information that we

97
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:20,998
lacked as good practices of these response types.

98
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:26,770
Why these response types are typically unobserved,

99
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,515
because we only know one of these two columns

100
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:36,143
depending on what is the exposure styles.

101
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:41,277
So let's understand what would be the individual level cause and

102
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:46,142
effect of the treatment for each individual from this table.

103
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:50,969
For example, for individual one, the treatment would be beneficial,

104
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:54,624
for individual two, the treatment would be harmful.

105
00:08:54,624 --> 00:09:01,143
For individual three and four there would be no individual treatment accept because

106
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:07,408
the two potential outcomes would be the same regardless of the exposure status.

107
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:11,945
By taking the column sums and averaging,

108
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:16,742
you cannot take average treatment effect,

109
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:22,444
here is how we define it, it's the change in the mean

110
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:27,241
of the potential outcome had everyone being

111
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:32,449
exposed relative to if no one had been exposed.

112
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:38,362
In this case, we would see that, the treatment has a beneficial

113
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:43,509
effect on the outcome has if everyone had been treated,

114
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:48,235
we would have a higher probability of being cured.

115
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,845
But let's see what happens in practice, in practice,

116
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,810
we will observe the third column,

117
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,025
the treatment sum is variable where we see that for example,

118
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:15,461
individual one is treated and individual three is untreated.

119
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,312
We see that, if we get to observe the treatment status and

120
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:27,458
the potential outcome associated with that treatment status,

121
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:33,951
we will not observe the counterfactual under the alternative exposure status.

122
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,802
And if we were to ask, what's the individual level

123
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:44,374
causal effect that would be impossible to answer.

124
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:48,900
And if we were, still wanting to receive them asking what

125
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,522
is the average causal effect and taking the column sums and

126
00:10:53,522 --> 00:11:00,051
averages averaging across people, we would get a rather different conclusion.

127
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:02,614
We would actually obtain and

128
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:07,848
apparent effect that is negative rather than positive and

129
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:12,759
if we wrongly conclude that this is a causal analysis,

130
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,661
we would actually indicate that the treatment might be harmful.

131
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,410
Now what could have caused this discrepancy between

132
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,872
the analysis when we know both counterfactuals then the analysis

133
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:39,804
where we are only conditioning on the treatment status as observed and

134
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:46,051
comparing the group of exposed and the group of the unexposed.

135
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,324
If we look at who belongs to the group of the unexposed,

136
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:59,328
three, five, seven and six,

137
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:05,642
we see that all the people that are always cured,

138
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:12,640
they all are assigned treatment equals zero.

139
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,378
That is gonna make treatment equals zero to look much better and

140
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:24,561
to make potentially cure more people than the treatment equal one.

141
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,697
Those who got treatment zero, are healthier, the treated and

142
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:38,940
untreated group is not balanced according to the response types.

143
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,254
That's why, our associational measure that compares the group

144
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:52,151
of exposed to the group of unexposed does not equate our causal effect.
