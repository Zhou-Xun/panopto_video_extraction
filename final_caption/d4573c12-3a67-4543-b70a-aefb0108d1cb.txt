1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,030
That's crazy, according to me.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,190
And I'm really happy for you to be with me.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,630
I did. I snagged the last 5 minutes.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,860
And as Abby, I noticed you weren't here this morning.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,330
I'm like yesterday when I did not use a yes, I.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:46,150
Yeah, he's learning. There is concern over the electricity supply issue, which I don't know what the reason is if I can't do it.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:01,830
I was like, I don't know. She must be able to classify it as of these other stories.

8
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:18,810
And he was like, okay, answer your question, I guess.

9
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:31,560
But it's like, okay, okay, we'll switch up the order just a little bit here and we will have the rare diseases screw up first,

10
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,750
then the cigaret bans group, then the bike lanes group, and then the substance use group.

11
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,820
We were missing one person. Oh, okay. She texted her about what?

12
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,870
Are we gonna switch around? Have the guys go a second or something?

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,870
Maybe you the target. Yeah, I can.

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,080
I can go second because these are short enough. But do you guys care if I, like, sit in this chair and slide my cell phone around?

15
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,209
Whatever is comfortable for you is heading for you.

16
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,070
Is there any other things?

17
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:22,770
I guess I could do it if I don't think they're getting ready to say we have any questions or.

18
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,860
There was.

19
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,000
Sorry it's taken you. Yeah.

20
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah. So if we want. Someone wasn't there.

21
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,020
It was almost chaos. Max is volunteering.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:24,190
It's like I said, this makes sense because if you think if you do presenter view, it's going to show that it doesn't do a dual.

23
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,410
If you want to do it. I think that's my computer. Oh, okay.

24
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:46,780
Good morning, everyone. Our group's cost effectiveness topic was on a phase and ban of cigarets in the US.

25
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,020
So within the last half century there have been enormous reductions in smoking.

26
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,670
Since 1964, the number has dropped from 40% to 12%.

27
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,139
However, smoking continues to be a major health problem in the US and it is currently the biggest threat

28
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,540
to mortality and morbidity in the US and is responsible for one in five of deaths annually.

29
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:21,840
So to tackle this health issue, New Zealand has taken a massive step and has introduced an age based ban on cigarets for anyone born after 2008.

30
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:32,010
This approach is unique in a few ways. First, this new ban does not affect currently like the adult population that are current smokers,

31
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,830
and the main goal is to introduce this ban to tackle the issue for the next generation of smokers by 2100.

32
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,960
It's estimated that there will be no no legal smokers in New Zealand.

33
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,920
And so now what would happen if we implemented a similar ban in the US?

34
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,180
So our model looks to examine the specific question, and Billy is going to begin by introducing our methods approach.

35
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:08,170
So cost effectiveness analysis is going to include three different models to compare the

36
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,050
theoretical cigaret ban in the U.S. to the current status quo of the state of American smoking.

37
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:22,780
We will be using a market model which looks at the impact of this ban over the next 75 years using each cohort for each year.

38
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,690
Then we'll be using a decision tree to model out the effect of this ban on the first cohort who

39
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,010
will be under this ban to essentially look at the marginal impact of implementing this ban.

40
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,850
And then we'll be extending the decision trees, all 75 cohorts who will come under this ban over the next 75 years.

41
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,040
So these models are using similar but slightly different parameters and methods

42
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,110
to estimate whether the CIGARET ban is more cost effective than the status quo.

43
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,430
If we get different results for different ones of these, then we know that we have to look more closely at each one.

44
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,870
But if we get similar results using different methods, then we know that we're probably on the right track.

45
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,520
So for the parameters that will be using the for the status quo will be using the percent of the population that will become smokers.

46
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,740
And non smokers will also be using a different estimate under the cigaret ban war.

47
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,429
So be looking at the lifetime access costs of being a smoker.

48
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,110
So that's specifically the health care costs that are attributable to smoking.

49
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,750
We also need things like the light tables and we need to use estimates of qualities associated with being a smoker for the decision tree,

50
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,069
but then for the health related quality of life will be generating our own quality

51
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,410
estimates using health related quality of life and the death rates of smokers.

52
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:55,270
And as the CIGARET ban will use all the same parameters as well as some differential estimates for what the population of smokers will be.

53
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,660
Expect that under the CIGARET event as well as some intervention costs as well.

54
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,590
About those assumptions or one thing to keep in mind is we don't have read direct friends

55
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,109
or an existing study done on same lines to which we should be set assumptions on.

56
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:20,240
So we've taken estimates of all the parameters and we account for this by having a very wide range when we do our sensitivity analysis.

57
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,389
So talking about or talking about about false assumptions,

58
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:32,930
we're assuming that 10% of people who would have become smokers if smoking ban were not implemented would become smokers if the ban gets implemented.

59
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:41,470
That comes to around 1.25% of all illegal smokers in the smoking ban and 12.5% on the state.

60
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,709
Well. And we are also assuming that the government will have to increase the budget of the Department of Alcohol,

61
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,300
Tobacco, Firearms and the Bureau of Prisons by at least 10%.

62
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm talking about the proposed model like we did for energy efficient.

63
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:08,300
That is the 2029 cohort. Now, this will be the first batch of people who would turn 21 if the ban would have gotten implement,

64
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,810
if the ban were to be implemented and would not be allowed to smoke legally.

65
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:21,049
So then the decision to begin splitting to like the two part status quo and the smoking ban and then the smoking ban is further and all the things

66
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:29,240
that further branched out into if you become a smoking non smoker and we calculated cost and fuel is associated with the age and of baby populations,

67
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:41,780
we found out that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for ban was negative nine oh 1009 $79.42, making it the dominant one or one state school.

68
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,180
And we found similar results when we did four decision three for 75 youth.

69
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,750
In that case. Also, we found out that the ban was dominant.

70
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,600
So this is our sensitivity analysis for the 75 year decision tree.

71
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:10,140
And you can see here that some of our results, when we have very the very bright range for parameter estimates, give us a negative ICER.

72
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,659
And some of us some of them give us a positive incremental cost effectiveness ratio so we can see like our results vary based on the very,

73
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,200
very wide estimates we gave for the parameter high and low values.

74
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,399
But doing a sensitivity analysis or for the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is challenging

75
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,740
because the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is a ratio is a comparison of two numbers.

76
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:42,780
So in our ideal situation, we want negative costs, meaning we're saving money in positive qualities, meaning with gaining quality adjusted life years.

77
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,560
But you cannot tell that from the ICR. It could be the other way.

78
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,159
It could be spending money, losing qualities, which is exactly what we do not want.

79
00:09:50,160 --> 00:10:00,120
But the negative icer would not tell us that. So we did a second kind of sensitivity analysis that you just we just second kind

80
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,070
of sensitivity analysis called an incremental net monetary benefit analysis.

81
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,770
And this kind of analysis helps us deal with the problems with ICER by converting it not into a ratio.

82
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:21,090
So in this case, we have our costs and then we add those to our qualities which are multiplied by our willingness to pay,

83
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:27,990
which in our case is $50,000 per quality. So this gives us results that are all in dollars.

84
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,870
And you can see that all of our results here are positive,

85
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,610
which is what we're which is what we want, which means that either we're saving so much money,

86
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,940
we have negative costs, but we're gaining so many life years that we're still getting a positive result.

87
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:50,460
Or you may be losing some life years, but we're but we're we're saving so much money that that sort of negates out those things.

88
00:10:51,240 --> 00:11:00,090
So you can see here that under all scenarios, we are gaining so many life years that even if we're spending more money, we're not losing dollars here.

89
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,730
So for a markov model, we use three different health states to model our population.

90
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,200
There will be people who are non smokers who then start moving to the smoker category that we

91
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,140
people who are in the non smoker and smoker categories who died during the course of our model.

92
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,180
And they'll be people who are non smokers and smokers who stay as nonsmokers and smokers over the course of the 75 years, about 40.

93
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:39,030
So a bit more detail here. You can see that we've estimated the percent of each group who die in each year.

94
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,280
We also use that to estimate the life years and then we can convert that to quality by

95
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,329
multiplying the life years of the smokers by our health related quality of life expectancy,

96
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,890
which is .76. And then we do that for each of the years under our model.

97
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,870
And then this is just for one point. What so we do the same thing for each of our 75 cohorts for the years over which this ban would apply.

98
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:08,490
And you can see at the top here that with this model, we find that the smoking costs will decrease under a ban,

99
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,540
but the always lived will actually increase under the ban.

100
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:21,510
So we get a negative ISA of -$2,428 and it's dominant over the status quo.

101
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:31,740
So we did also conduct a sensitivity analysis on the Markov models using both of the techniques that Trisha explained earlier.

102
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,850
For first, for ICER, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

103
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,210
As you can see, we did capture a large range scoring -5000 to 5000 at that it's chopped off.

104
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:51,180
But we did include a large range of values just to make sure we capture all of the uncertainty values and we do have some negative values,

105
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,240
which is good. That means we are saving money and quality.

106
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,640
We also did another sensitivity analysis using item B, the incremental net monetary benefit.

107
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,770
And so this was to fully interpret the negative values that we got using ICER.

108
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,750
And so specifically here we converted qualities to dollars.

109
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,850
And as you can see, there's no negative values here.

110
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:21,930
We have positive values and this shows that the strategy is effective and we have a large quality value.

111
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,920
We are talking about the conclusion you saw that board this decision and Michael

112
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,210
Moore that we saw with the calculation that implementing ban was dominant.

113
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:45,100
And in sensitivity analysis, we found that when the bear the banning was not dominant, it was at least cost effective.

114
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:56,400
We saw that in our sensitivity analysis. Well, despite the strong results, there are several limitations in our analyzes.

115
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:03,690
One limitation with the analyzes is that we don't know for sure what percentage of the population were becoming smokers.

116
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:13,380
Our evidence on the percentage comes from Massachusetts study of the effect of this state measures cigaret ban.

117
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:19,110
This is not a perfect analogy, but it is the best evidence that we can find.

118
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:30,719
Another limitation is that that we don't know for sure if the band have the substitution or complementing fact with alcohol cannabis because

119
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:40,470
there is no consensus on whether the alcohol and the cigarets are a complement or substitutes with some evidence to support each hypothesize.

120
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:48,210
And there is even less research on the relationship between the CIGARET and the cannabis.

121
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,730
So we thought it would be safer to just stick with the CIGARET consumption exclusively.

122
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,710
And also we don't include the VAT in our analyze because it's very complicated to calculate the cause and the qualities of the vaccine.

123
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:11,130
And again, we don't know for sure how the use of our use of adding and our working be the substitutions or complement as a cigaret.

124
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,620
So we exclude the betting on next and next the limitations of our analyzes date.

125
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,719
How we use it to calculate the health care cost, the number we used, it was already developed.

126
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,080
It started in the early 1980s,

127
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:39,510
although we have inflated to a current year's dollars but it's a to date may be the longer highly accurate a given that it's over 40 years old.

128
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,090
But since the number has been using many other cost effective analyzes, us always do use it.

129
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,970
And finally we assume that becoming a smoker is is a static process.

130
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,270
However, it is not because some may become smoker at a very early age and some may

131
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,590
become a smoker and a quick smoking later I would all including a randomized.

132
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,400
But in general our findings, our main focus is inform the US policymakers of the effectiveness of the fishing

133
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,430
ban to reduce tobacco use and the rapid growth in the lung cancer fatalities.

134
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:30,500
Our models suggest that implementing the CIGARET will have the long term health benefits to not only smokers but also the whole society.

135
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:37,610
So we strongly recommend the implementation of this phasing cigaret ban in the US to prevent the next generation of smokers.

136
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:51,440
And the bosom next steps. We think that researchers can collect data on the relationships between the smoking and alcohol or smoking cannabis and

137
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,040
smoking interventions to see if they are any substitution effect or accompaniments relation relationships between them.

138
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,180
Researchers can also conduct studies to calculate the lifetime health care causes, such as smoking,

139
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,190
to get the most updated data so that our analyze will be more convincing for policymakers.

140
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,660
And finally, we understand that the CIGARET ban is cost effective under different assumptions and models.

141
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,250
But there is also, as you could expect, that need to be considered.

142
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,980
Like, is it right to stop people from buying a product based on their age or is it a violation of their civil rights?

143
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,290
We need to figure out these ethical issues in our next steps. Thank you.

144
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,320
Any questions? As for the Markov model, I want to know how many percentage.

145
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,950
Well, the smokers become smokers.

146
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:04,239
Because I can only see the smokers because the nonsmokers will become smokers.

147
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,100
But how many percentage was not smoke? Smokers will become nonsmokers.

148
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,489
That in our model we just designated people as smokers and non smokers at the beginning,

149
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,160
because that's most of the data that we have either classifies people as smokers or nonsmokers.

150
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,360
It's a bit less clear the transition between smoking and nonsmoking over a lifetime.

151
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,390
But yes, that is a limitation. But that's that's mostly based on data availability.

152
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,889
Okay. And just to add to that, very briefly, like for our analysis is trying to estimate like what happened.

153
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,290
Most people become smokers when they're a teenager.

154
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:51,160
So if you interrupt that adolescent smoking initiation, like what happens to health and expenditures like over the course of an individual's lifetime.

155
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,240
So there is analysis that tries to like vary.

156
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,190
A lot of people at Michigan are trying to do this, especially Kastner are trying to model,

157
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,409
you know, you pick up smoking in a certain age, like how likely are you to quit by this other age?

158
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,710
And then you maybe quit, but then you pick it up again a few years later.

159
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,729
So there is that modeling that kind of exists, but that's not sort of like what the primary goal of our research was,

160
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,709
is the idea is like if you become a smoker or like if society significantly changes the amount of people who become smokers at a young age,

161
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,360
like what will happen over a lifetime.

162
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:32,530
So that's like another really good analysis that could be done, but it's sort of like a little bit beyond what we were trying to get at in our model.

163
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:43,390
Did you consider at all like the loss of tax revenue from Cigarets that they were totally banned and like the effect that that might have?

164
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:53,050
Yes. So we took the societal perspective and tax revenue is just a transfer within society.

165
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:01,030
So we did not take that into account. But in reality, that's something that like policymakers would be very worried about,

166
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,900
especially because in the US and I don't think this is the case in New Zealand, so the politics are different there.

167
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:18,160
But Cigarets tax revenue is used to fund a wide variety of public health programs of not just like smoking kinds of programs.

168
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:24,620
So yeah, there would be serious implications that like once you get into the nitty gritty of it, people would be worried about.

169
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,200
But that again was like, if we're looking out from society like we're really sick,

170
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,530
that doesn't really matter because it's like shareholder money versus government money.

171
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,179
It's all the same thing. And actually just to just to build on it.

172
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:45,399
Yeah. From the societal perspective analysis, you kind of don't care about who's who's dollars it is.

173
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,790
Because if I could be a shareholder, you know, Philip morris maybe makes us less money by selling fewer cigarets or whatever.

174
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Joe Schmo If they, if they don't pay a tax, then they, they save money.

175
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,909
So that might be good for lower income people like that. But then the government doesn't get money.

176
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,479
And then then you have to say, well, who's better to have the money,

177
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,600
the government or the Joe Schmo on the street or Philip morris or the shareholders of that Lawrence or, you know.

178
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,680
And so typically we just ignore that and just say, you know,

179
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,950
and sort of the total dollars spent on Cigarets and are really on the health outcomes related to cigarets.

180
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,590
And we don't care what the distribution of that who, who's getting those dollars, whether it's government tax money or other people.

181
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,069
But that sometimes is something also that would be interesting to, you know, look at and just keep in mind,

182
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:39,700
when you're looking at a cost benefit analysis, it often doesn't include that distribution of who ends up with the money after the policies.

183
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,010
Trying to hijack your other.

184
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,160
And you see tell value sometimes comments. But I thank you very much. Thank you.

185
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:15,690
And now we have the same thing.

186
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:24,580
She's she's working there.

187
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:52,200
And this is a very important business that she has now, which is likely to present your view of what to do that she's willing to say it doesn't know.

188
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,610
So I don't really like it.

189
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,220
I mean, I just like the pattern I'm hearing.

190
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:14,240
So in a sense, I think I mean, I haven't even like Professor, but this is probably what I'm going to throw out.

191
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,990
Yeah, well, you know, we did kind of get.

192
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,520
Okay. You know, we got e-mail or are we ready?

193
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,810
I was like, okay, this is what you need.

194
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,070
This is just our table of contents of the defense.

195
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,820
We did. Okay. Hello, everyone. First, I apologize for my informal position for a presentation, but I cannot help it at this moment.

196
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:50,790
So our group focused on Fabry disease, a rare disease that's genetically inherited if it causes a mutation,

197
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,469
and the glia gene, which produces a buildup of gb3.

198
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,280
And if you're a geneticist, you can explain this better than I am.

199
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:06,040
But it is a significant thing to look at because obviously it's affecting people's lives and eventually ending in death.

200
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,500
It affects about one in 40,000 males and one in 20,000 females.

201
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,280
The buildup begins in childhood, so a person is suffering with symptoms and side effects of this condition throughout their entire life.

202
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,600
Course up to death. And some of the features are extreme pain spotting and eventually, you know,

203
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:32,550
renal disease and cardiac complications, which is what we're going to specifically look at in our research question.

204
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,690
So our main research question was which treatment for Fabry disease would be most

205
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,770
cost effective while alleviating some of the organ damage and subsequent death?

206
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:51,709
We looked at enzyme replacement therapy, which I'm going to abbreviate as T for the rest of this presentation and oral capron therapy,

207
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,850
which is we're going to refer to as Miguel at the rest of the presentation.

208
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,100
And then, of course, no intervention. Our analysis very important, as I mentioned earlier,

209
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,570
because this is something that causes death and extreme suffering throughout a person's life course.

210
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:14,750
Given that it's a rare genetic disease, there is not a lot of research on it, which we have only found while we were researching it,

211
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,520
and we'd like to develop a better understanding about the available interventions while we were conducting this analysis.

212
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,640
So e r t is the first intervention we examined.

213
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,979
It is something that is distributed bi weekly as an infusion to the patient versus Miguel.

214
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,030
A stat is about every other day orally administered and has no severe side effects.

215
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,100
Our approach when we were building our model was obviously data collection research.

216
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,650
Then we transitioned to performing a markov model.

217
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:56,280
We conducted a sensitivity analysis, constructed our tornado diagram, and then interpreted our results.

218
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:05,730
I'll pass it off to our methods to introduce the background of every season of Not Me and

219
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:12,800
talk about sequester pass or we can duck to mark a photo of our analyze up to February uses.

220
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,740
So cycle we are using is why you're well using 3% for the this is a discounted

221
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,060
rate because we are conducting analyzes of over a time horizon of 15 years.

222
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,520
So we need to adjust the course and house at a different time.

223
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:38,630
We used the model to exam the polling disease on the status of the symptomatic stage, which means the patients have to have read.

224
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:47,340
This is really synonyms and renal disease, cardio complications, and that's the ratio between each state to follow.

225
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:58,590
A person can be symptomatic which will result so we know or presents opportunity sensible developed to cardio complications and the penalty to die.

226
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:09,389
Excellent. Also contact we are examining includes a cost and look of quality adjusted life years along with the

227
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,050
development of renal disease and their cardio complications to calculate the quality adjusted life years.

228
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:22,350
Ready to modify or decline to left your loop to buy utility value according to the formula.

229
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,729
Oh. Oh. Oh. We have selected a social perspective for our analyze our plans to a sinking into two dimensions

230
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,890
to help us to measure the burden of society and the patient level one comprehensively.

231
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,580
So we mainly look into clinical trials of our baseline data.

232
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:49,280
But since the data about our disease is severely lacking, we also did a lot of research about favorite diseases rare disease,

233
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,190
renal disease and cardiac disease in general to help us with making assumptions and estimates

234
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,879
about these values so we can see on the right from symptomatic to renal disease age,

235
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,200
we use the annual decline rate of asking medical marijuana for change for EGFR in patients with favorite disease.

236
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:17,540
So we estimated that EGFR in favorite patients when they were in the symptomatic stage and when they're at disease stage,

237
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,960
it's just give us an idea about the starting point and the ending point.

238
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,220
And then we did one over the average length of time.

239
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,410
A patient might progress from the symptomatic stage to the renal disease stage to

240
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,420
calculate the values on the on the first row and as similar things about the second row,

241
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:44,780
except that we use the estimated changes in left ventricular mass and docs and then for the last row from cardiac complications to that stage,

242
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,280
unfortunately, we're not able to find specific data about the disease.

243
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:57,590
And so what we did was that we use the general data that cardiovascular mortality accounts for about

244
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:05,629
40% to 50% of all death in patients with advanced CTE as well as and end stage kidney disease.

245
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,580
And we just in the middle, we don't know which is about point five.

246
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,100
And it has our utility right about each disease state.

247
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,150
And then on there are the resources we used to see,

248
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:30,170
the numbers used to account for them per patient as unit of the measurement to calculate

249
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,350
social and the patient difference in choosing so ends up to replace simply and or.

250
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,950
And the service went to the average of annual drug costs of enzyme IT breathlessness repeat

251
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,740
and the goal from the common drug review cost the comparison table for severe disease.

252
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:56,720
We also go to a discounted incremental lifetime total medical costs of no intervention and to

253
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:04,930
replace patient additional your cost for single up of every patient per year for renal disease,

254
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:13,719
you assume all the patient new to kidney dialysis as per your cost record from the article overall for patients need.

255
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:22,220
So can you transportation assume that the renal disease will be developed within 50 years with one time the kidney transplant?

256
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,509
So we really depend a divided to two annual together.

257
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:35,570
When you can't articulate the cost for the cardio complications, we'll look up to the treatment, of course, for for common or hard to complications.

258
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,990
You assume that a one cardio event happens each year.

259
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:46,100
So it's a cardiovascular event to avoid costs after even trial is coming up,

260
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:58,190
we're eventually divided to the baseline data for three treatment directions, so that's three different disease development stage.

261
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:07,430
We separate count cost for the based low and high value of the combination of the the article researching,

262
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,259
we found that a common medical care lasted physicians.

263
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:21,040
The same treatment to high costs of treatment is about twice as long combined to restore economy situation.

264
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:32,480
We started a minimal treatment course is asked of 75% of the best value and so makes more makes more is so 150% of

265
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,309
the symptomatic stage problem includes an average annual drug costs and incremental medical cost to renal disease.

266
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:48,470
Stage value is and also of you dialysis and the kidney transplantation culture also met metric based.

267
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:57,530
We assume the low value patients donate a kidney transplantations based upon the patient's needs and the OR having other

268
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:04,759
patients will do the kidney transplant patients and cardio coverage to state the best by the patient to the real.

269
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,930
And so a cardiovascular event average cost.

270
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,150
We assume the low value patients with the cardiovascular symptom of the low cost of which we used to calculate.

271
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:27,590
I recall studies of a stable are drawn up, all ended for the highest value which was the highest cost.

272
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:35,390
Oh, that is. Or coronary artery bypass. Now we're going to present our results.

273
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,190
So this is the main results. Again, we use the Markov model based on all the MPOs we just explained.

274
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:52,700
And the focus here is to examine whether, Miguel, that could replace enzyme replacement therapy, which is currently the standard treatment for this.

275
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,710
And the answer is no, as we can see from this table, because that has a higher cost and less effectiveness compared to your team,

276
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,290
which results in a negative ICR value about -$1 million.

277
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,940
And again, as this causal factor in this point illustrates relative to enzyme replacement replacement therapy,

278
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,180
because those on the second quadrant, which means it's not favored due to its high cost and less effectiveness.

279
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,580
And for our sensitivity analyzes,

280
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:34,420
we focus on the comparison between the two main treatment or if we dessous which are e r t and because and the reason why we didn't include the

281
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:43,530
no intervention is because the comparison between T and no intervention and they go said and no intervention are basically basically the same.

282
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:53,170
So we calculate by using monetary benefit fairly and we assume are willing to pay for quality of life because it's 100,000.

283
00:33:53,770 --> 00:34:02,540
And the picture on the top shows that the formula we calculate the net monetary benefit value and then there's around 3 million and 120,000.

284
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:14,120
And we really put a lot of effort in our sensitivity analyzes because we recalculate the whole sheet around like eight times.

285
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,320
So yes, and these are the six main parameters we use in our model.

286
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:29,270
And we can observe that the cost of Mikala started in the symptomatic stage, had the largest impact on our model.

287
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,770
And overall ERP is better than they all said under most conditions.

288
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:46,219
Just like our ICR results, and this is the data table we used to generate the tornado diagram and because that was preferred under two conditions,

289
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:54,380
which means they have the negative monetary value. And the first one is when the cost of ERP in the symptomatic stage is high,

290
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,970
and the other is when the cost of McAlister in the symptomatic stage is low.

291
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,480
Okay. So you probably could tell throughout the presentation we have limitations within our model, right?

292
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:15,570
So the first thing is we have some uncertainty from a number of assumptions we had to make due to the lack of data.

293
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:24,780
The other one would be we had a set 0.5 as our progression from cardiac to death for both McGill Asset and for LRT.

294
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Also, our model does not account for like social desirability of one treatment over the other.

295
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:39,330
Know what if McGill is that has different side effects or feelings for the patient than LRT, even though LRT seems to be preferred cost effectively.

296
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,010
Maybe the patient has a preference because of how they feel on one treatment versus the other.

297
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,320
And then of course, our model only compared renal disease,

298
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,489
cardiac to death or no intervention and didn't account for any other symptoms

299
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,180
that a patient might be experiencing other than the renal disease cardiac.

300
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,580
So for future research and policy implications, I mean, obviously we found that it's lacking and data.

301
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,040
Clinical trials, research availability. So we definitely need to expand on this topic.

302
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,360
Also, we need literature expansion specifically on cost effectiveness,

303
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,959
which we found seldom cost effectiveness analysis in regard to these treatment methods for policy.

304
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:29,780
And our results indicate that LRT is the best method of treatment for Fabry because its cost is lower and quality adjusted life years are higher.

305
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:35,430
So this can help with, you know, which one we're trying to promote or push for as a favor treatment.

306
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:45,600
And then further research demonstrating the cost effectiveness of BRT can help make these real world policy changes convince individuals.

307
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,620
Yes, that's true. Is why you picked this disease as opposed to any other, like rare disease.

308
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,650
There is like a motivator behind it.

309
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:14,490
I think in Nashville we had like several candidates, but just like in general over disease, like not many develop it.

310
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,280
I think the favorite disease is one that's the more common ones and that's another disease area that's coming.

311
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,260
Okay. I guess I'll ask the questions.

312
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,670
So I think if I understand correctly, this is, you know, a $300,000 a year or so and treatment costs roughly, right.

313
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,420
For for either one or two, both very, very expensive treatments.

314
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,940
One of the you know, one of your main sensitivity analysis conclusions was basically the cost of treatment is a big driver of the value of this.

315
00:37:48,940 --> 00:38:00,220
And I think the in your in your main main results here, your Miguel stat is five $3 million more expensive than T,

316
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,740
but they're both in the 60 something million dollars total cost.

317
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:10,339
So presumably a small percentage change in cost could make real estate cheaper or more expensive than an er.

318
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,580
T you are gaining two and a half qualities which is which is also valuable, looks like with the NRT.

319
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,070
But yeah. So anyway, it's, it's,

320
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:25,330
I think it makes sense that if you have a wide enough rate what are your ranges for the costs of a Miguel estate and when you're.

321
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,050
It's the cost of symptomatic, I think.

322
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:41,920
Anyway, one thing you I think you potentially could look at is so you found under certain conditions of the costs of either of these treatments,

323
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,510
you might actually before Miguel. Miguel is set to er.

324
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:52,719
And it might be interesting to figure out the threshold precisely what is that cost that would cause you to

325
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,640
switch your decision from saying er it is cost effective to saying regardless that it's cost effective,

326
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,150
that that could potentially be interesting. Because if in your previous tornado, I mean, at the extremes.

327
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:17,490
I mean, you're going from, you know, $3.3 million in benefit, I think, or so, to all of a sudden like $25 million negative.

328
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:26,910
So, you know, there is some sort of point there at which it flips between the two of questions.

329
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,950
Well, I'll post a few other additional comments for you.

330
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:45,090
Unfortunate, but thank you very much. And I'm sure the rest of the groups are going to do fantastic.

331
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,080
But unfortunately, I'm going to scoot out of Santa Fe with everyone there.

332
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,980
The medical community really wants to see their hospital.

333
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,780
Olivia, would you mind getting the door for me? I, I you're here.

334
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:30,780
I thought maybe next is the right place to make their case out of this because she thinks that he's going to try to do it.

335
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:45,910
So you can't change your mind.

336
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,430
This is true. But I saw it was a 47 minute, so I thought, oh, you're.

337
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:15,730
So maybe it's if I'm asking them is are we.

338
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:32,180
Oh, it's not your monitor. That's something I don't know.

339
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,830
Thank you for sharing. I'm great.

340
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:42,990
Are we ready? Okay. Guys, we're going to talk to you about the cost effectiveness of our bike things and the truth.

341
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,850
So over the past few years, Detroit has been investing a lot and their bike infrastructure.

342
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,020
So they've spent 14 million on bike lanes, I think, since around 2010.

343
00:41:54,650 --> 00:42:01,549
And so 50 miles of them are unprotected bike lanes and 200 hour protected bike lanes and 210 miles of them are unprotected.

344
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,260
So a majority are unprotected.

345
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:10,460
And at the same time, a lot of studies have been done around Detroit and how high the fatality rate is if you're a biker in the city.

346
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:18,740
So over the course of ten years, there was around 9474 bike accidents with about 282 of those being fatal.

347
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:24,710
And so, you know, Detroit does have one of the highest fatality rates of any large metro area.

348
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,840
And it's especially concerning given that they have a lot lower ridership than a lot of other atrocities.

349
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,120
And then this is also kind of important.

350
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,969
Ah, we thought this was important to look at because, you know, not only does this have impacts on your health if you get injured while biking,

351
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,110
but also can have economic impacts that are lasting, you know, loss of income savings,

352
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,280
medical bills, loss of employment and paid time off or unpaid time off.

353
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:57,320
And then one larger study that we had looked at found that across the US, and I think it is this time span of around 15 years of bicycle trauma,

354
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,170
just in air visits have produced 237 billion in medical costs and really want to talk about it.

355
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,440
Bicycle injuries should be completely preventable. So that was kind of the the reason we wanted to look into this.

356
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:20,060
So our actual question was, is it cost effective to convert all of Detroit's unprotected bike lanes so those 210 into protected highways?

357
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,240
And then we're comparing it to what is the current set of questions?

358
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,220
And then here's just an example of Detroit's bike lanes.

359
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:35,120
So this is what unprotected looks like first protected. So just minimal buffers, but it does cost extra money to do that.

360
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,210
And lots of studies exist showing how effective protected bike lanes are at reducing injuries.

361
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:49,670
So now Grayson is going to start talking about a review. So we've got a decision tree using the precision tree software in Excel.

362
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:56,960
And then these are just like the various inputs we had. So we had probabilities of different types of injuries and different type of bike lanes.

363
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,060
The cost of injuries that were inclusive of medical costs for classes and quality of life losses,

364
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:09,440
the cost of constructing and maintaining bike lanes year over year, and the loss of QOL going to different injuries.

365
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:16,380
Population was 1200 Detroiters who commute daily using bikes and like any other intervention,

366
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,630
wants to convert 210 miles of untreated bike lanes into protected lanes.

367
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,979
I think the only other thing that's really important on the slide is that upon fatality,

368
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:32,700
we're assuming that 28 qualities are lost and we got that number because the average age of a bicyclist in Detroit is 45 years old.

369
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,140
And so we took like the average life expectancy minus that number and got 48.

370
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,460
So just to be transparent about the assumptions that we made, so like I talked about the population that we're using,

371
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,299
we are assuming that that's the population of bikes in Detroit.

372
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,000
So we're we're probably ultimately undercounting how many people use bike lanes, but this is just the best data that we can find.

373
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,770
We're also assuming that the benefits of bike lanes are exclusive to bike riders, which again are probably undercounting that as well.

374
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:08,060
So we're not considering fatalities that occur after the injury, after the accident.

375
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,780
So like if someone was hospitalized and then they died, that's not counted in our data.

376
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:21,020
And we were also not counting any reduction in h.r. To allow for like injuries that don't result in a visit or hospitalization.

377
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,090
And our data is pooled from all over the US. Some of it is from Detroit, but not all of it.

378
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,020
So we're kind of assuming that that data holds true in the Detroit context as well.

379
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,920
So these are mostly the inputs. The only thing that isn't here is like the costs of hospitalization and E.R. visits.

380
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:40,700
But you can see that we have different values for protective and unprotected lens.

381
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,600
And then I'm going to talk about the model for a minute.

382
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:53,420
So there are two models for the cost because the first year there are the implementation costs that are different in subsequent subsequent years.

383
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,170
So you can see this is the status quo where, you know,

384
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:04,250
50 miles are projected in 210 unprotected and then the probability of being injured and having different outcomes between those.

385
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:09,320
And then this is with the intervention converting all claims to protective.

386
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:19,010
So this is the upfront cost of what that would be to implement all of those lanes and then the subsequent risk of injury and then in.

387
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,570
You just had your ten. This is the cost of maintenance for 260 miles of protective lanes.

388
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,890
And this is the possibility it's for 50 as opposed to 210 hundreds of.

389
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,870
And then we have another one for our region to allow, very similar.

390
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,790
But you can see we're looking at a tractor while lost.

391
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,290
And you can see that there's a very significantly smaller loss of control parallel with the intervention as opposed to grow.

392
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,749
And then work is now going to talk about our results. Yes.

393
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:01,900
So moving on to the results. So, you know, kind of the big takeaway high level is that this intervention is definitely cost effective, you know,

394
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:07,610
using the kind of standard 100,000 or your willingness to pay threshold that, you know,

395
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:12,980
we talked about in class a lot and this would be kind of the city or city of Detroit implementing this.

396
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,799
So, you know, some cities made different budgets than others and stuff.

397
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:23,350
But, you know, we think there's 53,000 and change, you know, numbers is going to be pretty cost effective and just kind of a no.

398
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,829
So we have deicer all the way over there on the regular, the forward 34,000.

399
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:36,710
So that's got over our ten year time span. So, you know, divided by ten to get the, you know, per year price is just the 53,000 number at the top.

400
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,350
And just kind of another thing to take away so that our kind of results are presented in a little

401
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:45,740
different format than you might see from some of these other projects in terms of probably lost.

402
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:52,090
Because basically what we're dealing with here is, you know, bad things that are happening as opposed to some interventions that were discussed in

403
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,579
class where you're taking a drug or some intervention that's improving your health.

404
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,050
Really, we're looking at the downside risk here where, you know, you get injured so you lose qualities.

405
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:06,690
So the kind of the difference here of the status quo being, you know, these 91 and while these lost as opposed to, you know,

406
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,580
a much smaller number with the intervention of the bike lanes, it obviously being driven by,

407
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,980
you know, getting in far fewer accidents which resulted in hospitalization or death, etc.

408
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,530
So in that we have our incremental gain, which is kind of just subtracting those two numbers to get the, you know,

409
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:29,900
basically 91 impact, solid state intervention number and just kind of, yeah, this didn't need to go with that kind of covered.

410
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:37,220
But you know, the upfront implementation costs are really what kind of make the the bike lanes a little more expensive at the beginning.

411
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,500
So kind of spreading this out over a longer time horizon kind of makes it more and more cost effective as you go.

412
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,180
And you know, we're get into a little more later.

413
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,409
But yeah, this is really driven by the reduced injuries in the protected bike lanes, which, you know, makes sense.

414
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,879
That's kind of the point of doing this whole intervention is that, you know, you put up these lines, injury rates are going way down.

415
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,750
And we saw that as we were kind of running through our models. And yeah, so moving on to this nicer plane here.

416
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,190
So this is kind of, you know, just a visual representation of what we were talking about before.

417
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:13,460
And just for kind of visual purposes, we kind of flipped the, you know, interpretation here to make it an incremental quality gain as opposed to the,

418
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,480
you know, all these losses we're talking about for this because it's kind of easier to interpret.

419
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:25,729
But, you know, the numbers still hold true just the same. So again, we have the I the pay of $1,000,000 over the ten year time horizon.

420
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:32,990
So our eyes are, you know, as you can see, they're kind of to the right of the status quo, meaning this is definitely a cost effective intervention.

421
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:40,100
And, you know, yeah, we're kind of happy with those results today, so.

422
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:47,390
Yeah. Thanks, Mark. And so moving right along to contextualize most of the stuff that we've done.

423
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:53,360
So we conducted a one way sensitivity analysis to better contextualize the changes

424
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,489
in our and our inputs over each successive year to that ten year time period.

425
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:05,030
But as well, we conducted this tornado diagram here to better visually understand the ranges between the low and high eyesores.

426
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:16,370
So the baseline is around 500,000, $304, the number of numerical value that mark showed the extra point four.

427
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,399
And so of the 22 inputs put together here on the screen, we see a very stark observation.

428
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,580
Again, kind of like what Mark was alluding to was that on unprotected bike lane injury rate,

429
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:36,290
absolutely massive, approximately a little under $6 million over the course of that ten year time span.

430
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:45,409
The most obvious change that we've seen throughout the tornado diagram is actually through the majority of those unprotected bike lane inputs.

431
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,170
And that'll be a recurring theme as we continue the presentation.

432
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:53,990
Conceptually, again, this makes sense because the fewer unprotected bike lanes that we have in the city,

433
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:03,140
the lower our injury rate and consequently medical costs that will be incurred to society will obviously be forthcoming.

434
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:11,900
Therefore, the most cut, the more cost effective it will become as we convert more of those unprotected bike lanes to protective.

435
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,220
Next, we'll take a look at some of the more impactful inputs.

436
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:30,370
And so as we can see here on the screen. In these four main inputs here are again related to predominantly those unprotected by lane and inputs.

437
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:38,020
So we have the bike lane injury rate, we have the bike injury requiring your visit as well as for hospitalization rate.

438
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:42,580
And as we can see with first variable, again relating to the injury rate,

439
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,969
we can see there's a massive difference between the low and high values compared to baseline with the others being fairly similar.

440
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,560
But then again as well with the population for those who bike, there's also a substantial difference as well.

441
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,049
And then for better visual context as well, we have a icer range as well.

442
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:08,950
So again, we can see the top four inputs but in a more because we like a better way to it compared to having all 22 as well.

443
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,670
And so again, we have the baseline value of roughly that 500,000 value.

444
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:23,410
And again, we can just see the amount of cost savings that potentially converting those unprotected bike lanes to protected bike lanes.

445
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,970
Those definitely save more money in the long run.

446
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,980
But with that said, we understand we have limitations to our study as well.

447
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,010
Again, like we said in the assumptions, there is limited data comparing protected and unprotected bike lanes.

448
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:45,940
Throughout the course of the literature, a major issue we also encountered with the various definitions of what is what constitutes a

449
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,709
protected versus unprotected bike lane is whether or not Detroit's lanes reflected with that.

450
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:55,240
So we made some leeway with that. As mentioned, our assumptions as well.

451
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:02,590
We pulled data from various non Detroit, Michigan studies. So that may not be as reflective or representative what we may see in Detroit actually.

452
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:10,690
And then additionally, our analysis neglected to factor in bike lane ridership or demand given the numbers of people who actually bike in Detroit.

453
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:19,270
Another limitation of our study is the fact that we failed to capture accurate short term differences in post actions for Qualys.

454
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,430
So most of these accidents, understandably, are not going to be occurring throughout the course of the year.

455
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:30,700
They may not. They may be like only a couple of months, but for the sake of our model and interpretation, we rounded up to count for the entire year.

456
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:36,130
And then lastly, we primarily focused on the direct health and economic benefits,

457
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:43,480
whereas in a lot of other studies there were discernable benefits to the built environment, environment and reductions in air and noise pollution.

458
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:48,520
But again, that's something that we neglected to include in scope of our model.

459
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,430
So I'm going to talk about the policy implications.

460
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:01,760
So as you can see from the sensitivity analysis, ridership really plays a large role in how cost effective,

461
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:06,580
you know, converting the unprotected to protected bike lanes are.

462
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,259
So while it is cost effective, you know,

463
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:15,620
it might be more cost effective to just focus on where ridership is high and just convert those lanes to begin with.

464
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:26,120
Another thing to consider that other studies did that ours did not was if you put in protected bike lanes, you might be increasing the ridership.

465
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,629
So you might be having benefits that way.

466
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,320
But we didn't we didn't look at how many how many more riders we would have with the protected bike lanes.

467
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,440
So that was included. But that's something that could be in the future.

468
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:46,250
And then the political fees about feasibility of this. So actually our construction costs came directly from Detroit.

469
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,950
So those are probably the most accurate costs for constructing bike lanes.

470
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,440
And so we found that this intervention would cost 31.5 million, which, as you can see,

471
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,430
is double what Detroit has been willing to spend in the past ten years on bike lanes.

472
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,380
So it's probably not very feasible to have them convert all of them.

473
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,990
But again, if you focus on where ridership tie or where injuries are more likely to be present on the interaction slide,

474
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,270
there was that heat map of where a lot of injuries occur.

475
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,370
So just making sure that those bike lanes were would be protected would make a bigger impact.

476
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,600
And then you're also kind of factoring in even those as a societal perspective.

477
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:27,830
We're factoring in the health system costs. So the estimated medical costs for only nonfatal injuries do not include fatal illness.

478
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:34,640
That required E.R. visits and hospitalizations for Detroit specifically is a little over half a million per year,

479
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:41,300
which isn't a huge, huge sum given that there's only 1200 people, really, that we're factoring into the population.

480
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,250
But it's still, you know, health systems and the medical costs that people incur.

481
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:52,520
You know, both would like to drive down costs anyway possible. So it's still something important to take into consideration.

482
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:59,360
Mark, we'll talk about street change. Yeah. So moving on to the future research here.

483
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,589
And you know, these a lot of these points have been tangentially touched on by others earlier.

484
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:11,299
But yeah, so kind of some further things to look out would be to incorporate environmental health and other economic benefits into the model.

485
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,740
So for example, like Abby was talking about, you know, others reduced pollution in terms of, you know,

486
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,840
air pollution and noise pollution also, which, you know, kind of have some effects on quality of life.

487
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,420
And then, you know, health benefits in terms of, you know, ridership is increasing or even if ridership is remaining stagnant.

488
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,229
But those people are biking. Same people are biking more. You know, they're really exercising more.

489
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:36,680
So that's going to have some some health benefits probably. And these are things that would be kind of measured over a longer time span, probably,

490
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:42,020
that you would see those those benefits accrue in other economic benefits, kind of like next, we're talking about terms of the built environment.

491
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,190
You know, there's some studies that, you know,

492
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:48,170
increasing it in cities for bikeable stuff kind of increases that kind of economic activity and things like that,

493
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:54,110
which are not necessarily factoring equalities. But that would definitely be something to consider from a societal perspective in terms of a city,

494
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,710
you know, trying to invest in those types of interventions.

495
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:02,299
And then another thing would be to further, you know, examined the bike riding population in Detroit.

496
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,070
And, you know, like I was saying, see what effect that would have on the ridership would, you know, in running a lot of projects.

497
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,000
But it's really increased. People are commuting to work or just riding in general or did not.

498
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,630
And some studies try to look at that. And the effects are a little mix of that probably worth looking into in the Detroit specific context.

499
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,239
And then yeah, you know, kind of that was coming up within that previous point as well, you know,

500
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,000
analyzing the effect of targeting more heavily trafficked areas, you know,

501
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,569
it kind of makes sense that there is going to be kind of more bang for your buck,

502
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,309
for lack of a better term, of, you know,

503
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:38,360
converting the downtown areas or areas where people are kind of avenues where people are going to be commuting to work more,

504
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:42,500
focusing on those first so that that's probably gonna make a certain amount of sense to focus on that.

505
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:49,160
And then rather than converting a whole city, so kind of looking at a more piecemeal approach would be useful as well.

506
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:59,000
And. I should say.

507
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,520
Yeah. So. So I actually have two questions.

508
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:08,350
So the first one is, if I remember correctly, the protected lanes are like way more expensive to implement.

509
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,859
What are the reasons for it being so much more expensive? Because just like from the pictures, obviously you have more buffer.

510
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,620
But I mean, it's just a lot of pain. I think I can address that.

511
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:23,739
So it kind of stems from like the issue that, like I said, there's differences between like what constitutes protected and not protected.

512
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,260
And so there are various types of protected.

513
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:35,140
So for some of them, as we saw at the beginning, there might just be like a like some would consider it to be like a slight barrier like this,

514
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,160
whereas some you'll have like a physical, like concrete divider, like you've seen in Ann Arbor.

515
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,080
And so those types, the ones with like the actual concrete are the ones that are going to be costing more.

516
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,670
Not to mention as well as like upfront construction cost to pay folks to the labor as well to get it done as well.

517
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,360
So that's also like one of the reasons why it cost so much. And then the second question is, it's kind of shown in the picture, too.

518
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,280
Do you think that some of the, you know, like,

519
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,700
I guess fatality rates are based on the protected ones being kind of in better areas like you see in that picture,

520
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:12,880
you know, like next to the park and then the unprotected ones kind of being in the more dangerous high traffic type areas.

521
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:20,860
Got I about this. But there was actually another study that University of Michigan students did that we use their data like crash analysis in Detroit.

522
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,410
And so they did a whole analysis on like the speed limits.

523
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,450
And so the high as you would expect, like probably roads like that where it's like more lanes,

524
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,410
people driving faster like 45 miles per hour have higher fatalities.

525
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,440
But they also like, you know, ten, 50 mile per hour is like that.

526
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,180
The next highest fatalities in like the middle zone did it.

527
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,280
And but there's it didn't look at whether they were looking only at miles per hour, not the type of bike lanes.

528
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:53,079
So I think like to your point. Yes, yes, there should be like this would be a reasonable one to make protected bike lane.

529
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,820
But there's even like kind of justification for it in different directions.

530
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,040
And we also like in our backyard research there is this news articles like this that isn't likely to be true.

531
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,339
And there's this narrative of this person who likes a lot.

532
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:11,620
And he was talking about how there was a lane like unprotected one and it's really heavily traffic area and then it just like disappeared.

533
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,740
And if you didn't know that it was coming, you would see like dumped into traffic.

534
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,360
And so I think that that's where you do like I think that is the big problem. Next.

535
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,860
I have a question. I think it's both for Dr. Hood and for you all.

536
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:32,090
But I know that it looks like you're looking at qualities lost after the person had gone through a nonfatal crash.

537
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,749
Did you consider using disability adjusted life years instead?

538
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:39,820
Or like what context would disability adjusted life years make sense here?

539
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:44,420
Would it apply here? I guess is my question. Yeah.

540
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:50,450
So. Well, do you want to answer that first? I think we use quality less because that's what the data.

541
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:57,530
Yeah. And yeah. But you're kind of mimicking a study that had been for New York City that something similar.

542
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,220
So the short answer and to clarify aren't that like kind of similar.

543
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,749
Yeah. I think, you know,

544
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:11,000
in some ways they're kind of flip side of the coin like qualities are much healthier gaining in the dailies or how much quality of life is lost.

545
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,040
And actually you did calculate qualities lost, which in some ways is very similar to how dailies are done.

546
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:26,660
Yeah, I mean, they're slightly related. But you know, one question for you is so your your main result was half a million dollars for quality.

547
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:36,860
And then but then on the quality, the plane you I think you your you had a threshold number at $1,000,000 per point.

548
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,510
I think you said that's because you multiplied by ten years or something. Can you explain that little bit earlier?

549
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:47,620
Let's go to the. Yeah.

550
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:56,790
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, because it's a hundred thousand per year and so over ten years that's four years, a million.

551
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,620
And so that's why we did that. We did it that way.

552
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,700
I mean, I guess I would argue your your cost that you calculated those are the total cost over ten years.

553
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:08,700
Right. And the quality, as you calculate, are qualities over ten years as well.

554
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:17,640
Right. So I guess I would argue you should still use $100,000 per quality as your as your threshold for what's cost effective,

555
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,890
because both the costs and the health benefits are being measured in a similar timeframe.

556
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,550
So if you scale that down to one year, you know, presumably those those costs would kind of scale for your case.

557
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,829
Not quite, because you have a capital cost in the beginning.

558
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:37,530
But but I think your in terms of the dollars you're spending per quality adjusted life, your gain,

559
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:42,540
I think you you really should be thinking about that in terms of, you know, $100,000 per quality.

560
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:48,749
There aren't some sort of magical quality, just like features that are missing from your analysis that you didn't kind of account

561
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,820
for that I think would would cause you to want to adjust your willingness to pay.

562
01:02:54,210 --> 01:03:01,080
You could argue we should pay million for quality. Maybe, but but I wouldn't make that argument based on a ten year time horizon.

563
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,780
You. Yeah.

564
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,530
And I thought it was a good point about the biking.

565
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:15,089
It's one thing to also consider like your sensitivity ounces, but another thing you could potentially consider is what if you did cheaper bike lane?

566
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:21,810
So maybe that bike lane that you showed the picture of costs a third or a quarter of of the expensive cost.

567
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:26,250
And what if you still got the same benefits? How might that change your your calculus?

568
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:31,980
You know, customer you know, construction costs are interesting for like they came straight out of Detroit like no.

569
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:35,490
Yeah, I guess there wasn't enough detail because I'd be curious to know too.

570
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,349
Like that's a picture of protected by things in and like that was the cost that Detroit's that it took

571
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:44,990
to create a protected bike lane so like they were they using multiple kinds can like I don't know.

572
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:51,540
Yeah and like you said they're probably different types are different, but there's the big platinum version and there's the copper version.

573
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:57,389
Yeah. Just so I live downtown.

574
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:04,620
So I have experienced the implementation of bike lanes and there's been a couple of weird things,

575
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,160
but like I just did not anticipate and not get to my question.

576
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:14,370
One that people do not understand drivers, people in cars do not understand bike lanes.

577
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:20,600
I've now seen multiple cars get stuck on that like some thing that like barricades.

578
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:24,299
This is great. And then the second thing is after they implement the bike lanes,

579
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,830
they had to then put signs up to explain Pete explain to bike riders how to

580
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:33,930
use bike lanes at intersections that use like pedestrian crosswalk signals,

581
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:40,860
not like the traffic signals. Um, so I guess I'm just curious if like basically when you were doing this literature,

582
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,610
like did you see these like knock on effects that were like you got,

583
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,879
maybe there's like you create these like protected bike lanes,

584
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,830
but you're like traffic fatalities increase because like people got stuck on the barrier, you know what I mean?

585
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,399
Like, they're these things that are you're like, not really. You're like, this is safe, this is better.

586
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,910
But you're like, actually, maybe there are some things we didn't anticipate and people like are even worse at using bike lanes when like,

587
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:06,010
they feel safer because like, then they're not really following the rules. Do you?

588
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,360
I mean, I mean, I think some of the articles, you know,

589
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:14,999
we had read through that was kind of mentioned kind of in the way you say more anecdotally and not really looked at super rigorously.

590
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,360
But that yeah, that something that there's a kind of user error issue for lack of a better term.

591
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:27,810
Sometimes there some adjustment period maybe that you know when it's basically new you know

592
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,150
facet of the city being in bikes and cars you get kind of confused and then it seems like,

593
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:38,820
I don't know, like if there are no bike lanes and you are commuting using a bike, you must be like a pretty competent cyclist.

594
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,469
But like once the lane go in,

595
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:47,310
like the less confident cyclists come into the commuter pool and like that's where you're like fatalities and stuff increase.

596
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:53,489
I don't know. I feel like there's these like for weird substitution kinds of effects that you can't really anticipate until you do it.

597
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:57,000
Not that I expect you to model it or whatever, but just super interesting stuff.

598
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,190
Yeah, I'm in Detroit too. Like they have. They had a whole education campaign about their bike lanes and they have a lot

599
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:07,139
of problems because you have their bike lanes in their parking really flipped. So that cause a lot of issues.

600
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,750
And so there wasn't anything talking about fatalities or injuries,

601
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,250
but just like in like just bike lanes being blocked because like the misunderstanding

602
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:17,639
and so like more like logistical problems rather than than injuries.

603
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:29,120
But they did encounter the same things. I think you guys had big plans for this concert.

604
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:47,570
Yeah. So I was going to say represents under certain circumstances, I was going to do it.

605
01:06:48,950 --> 01:07:00,260
That's just how it works. Like I asked you to do something different, and it's.

606
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:16,060
Yeah. If we can.

607
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:57,010
Not. Since last year so far, do you get a sense of the cost effectiveness of expanding Medicare substance use services?

608
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,000
So for gender, we have the introduction, methods, results and discussion.

609
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:11,409
So coverage for substance use disorder services or SCD are limited.

610
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:15,150
Under Medicare currently, only least the most intensive services are covered,

611
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:19,540
which leaves beneficiaries who need intermediate intermediate levels of care without services.

612
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,559
1.7 million Medicare beneficiaries have substance use disorder,

613
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:31,510
but only 11% receive treatment and substance use disorder as a growing public health threat among adults over the age of 65,

614
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:41,920
the opioid use disorder prevalence per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries increased significantly from 4.6 in 2013 to 15.7 in 2018.

615
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:50,740
And in 2016, only 13.8% of programs offered medication treatment for opioid use disorder to Medicare beneficiaries.

616
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:58,450
And among 1.2 million older adults diagnosed with use, less than 23% received any relevant treatment in 2019.

617
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:04,180
For example, in 2020, Medicare provided methadone for opioid use treatment specifically.

618
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:11,740
But that was not it. Overall, there's a growing need for substance use treatments as people do not receive treatment due to lack of coverage.

619
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,040
And now Medicare is paying more attention to this issue.

620
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,450
And the aim of our study was to provide guidance for next steps. So our question is,

621
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:25,810
what is the cost effectiveness of expanding Medicare substance use disorder coverage for residential counseling and outpatient services?

622
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:37,030
So for our methods, we are going to note that we define recovery as six months of absence of any disorder used during treatment,

623
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,990
and we take a health care and societal perspective,

624
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:53,260
and the incremental cost effectiveness is measured per year at the five year mark, at ten year mark and six months over ten years.

625
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:58,660
And we conducted a literature review where we got our cost and quality used to

626
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,860
calculate the incremental costs and incremental polys gained from our intervention.

627
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:07,840
But we did have to make a quality assumption for the counseling treatment.

628
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:22,649
So for the decision tree we have here, the decision is to expand a Saudi treatment or remain with the status quo,

629
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:31,200
which is currently only covering medicated assisted treatment and in-patient psychiatric treatment by adding the interventions intensive outpatient,

630
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,080
residential and counseling services. We see an overall call.

631
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:41,930
We see an overall improved quality of life. And even though there is a 50% chance of relapse and 50% chance of recovery, I'm done.

632
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:47,910
We will talk more about the inputs that we used for all the services specific to what we found in the literature review we conducted.

633
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:59,060
Here's the data and the data returns for the best analysis in sensitivity analysis.

634
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:04,520
We just we just we assume to expanding this service to this amount of population.

635
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:09,979
And we come up with this number based on the cost of paper we use in the cost paper, the measure.

636
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:14,660
And then that cost, which is a cost for expanding the coverage for this.

637
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:20,450
So service for this amount of population and minus the cost of saving for reduce the

638
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:26,960
incidence of comorbidity conditions and hospital spending associated with studies.

639
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:34,250
Which means if we provide if we provide this kind of service, we avoid potential medical expenditures.

640
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:45,200
And also for the relapse rate, although there is effective treatment for SVOD services, is very hard to measure if the treatment is successful or not.

641
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:53,360
So our study defined as UTI treatment as successful if patients do not relapse after six months of care.

642
01:11:53,660 --> 01:12:03,920
And we adopted 50% of that rate for this study, and also we applied six months periods of quality of life again to follow this treatment.

643
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:11,600
We can see from the patients who receive the residential treatment have the highest quality of life gained from the treatment.

644
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:17,510
And for the intensive outpatient service, you has the widest range for the quality of life,

645
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,460
for health related quality of life years again for the treatment.

646
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:29,870
And we made our assumptions for the counseling services. Here's a result for the base.

647
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:39,770
Analysis of our study shows it will cost a 73 hour $76,000 quality grant, which is cost effective.

648
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:50,960
And if we adopt this decision, you will help patients get more than four, 45, 47,000 quality colleagues over ten years.

649
01:12:53,550 --> 01:13:02,490
And also in our sensitivity analysis, the result shows the cost is the most sensitive, reliable cost to the cost effective ratio.

650
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:10,410
The net cost for ranged from -$100 million to positive $33 million.

651
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:15,360
And we can see from this growth, yes, the net costs increase that to the upper bound.

652
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:26,610
It will cost around it will cost more than $600,000 per quality, which is not was the money value.

653
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,230
And if we want to make this service to be cost effective, it will cost.

654
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:38,760
The net cost should be less than $7 million for make the treatment to be cost effective.

655
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:47,430
And in another condition, if the net cost is negative, which is the most favorable condition it will for,

656
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:55,110
it will cost a negative cost and produce more qualities.

657
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,990
Here's our tornado graph.

658
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:09,580
In this sensitivity and in this graph, we didn't include the cost variable because that is either more cost effective or to be dominant.

659
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:16,360
So but for all other parameters, we used a for sensitivity analysis.

660
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:25,180
It showed always in the 100 or 150,000 poor quality threshold, which means are all cost effective.

661
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:34,010
And the photograph we can see the most effective value to lower cost impacts ratio is called the quality of life years,

662
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:42,879
scanned from intensive outpatient services and expanding Medicare beneficiaries for receiving intensive outpatients and for most,

663
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:51,070
a sensitive arrival to increase the cost. Its ratio is expanding the Medicare beneficiaries for residential services.

664
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:03,610
Our study showed it will cost more than six more than $70,000 per call again for adding this services,

665
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:10,870
which is cost effective, however, compared to other cost of action studies which measure the quality of life,

666
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:20,050
which measure the opioid use disorder treatment in California, our study showed, are not our study is not that cost effective compared to their study.

667
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:24,400
So if we are deciding to adopt this policy,

668
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:32,680
we need to conduct more research and our sensitivity analysis give us more information about how to make the service more cost effective.

669
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:42,910
The sensitivity analysis showed cost is the most sensitive variables to decrease the to increase the cost of this ratio.

670
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:47,679
And previous studies suggest a timely acuity treatment decrease the cost by

671
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:54,160
reducing the incidence of potential medical of potential medical expenditures.

672
01:15:54,490 --> 01:16:02,740
So based on that, we suggest to provide timely treatment to avoid a potential medical use related to studies.

673
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:08,830
And the second residential service coverage is the second most sensitive,

674
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:20,170
sensitive variables for D for increase the cost of observational because in the residential settings the hospital fixed costs,

675
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:31,600
the cost for hospital use are fixed. But if we increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries, we will only increase the unit of business used.

676
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,840
Is that said, if we increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries for these services,

677
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,970
it will more likely to make this strategy to be more cost effective.

678
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,300
And in in of end of the service coverage and quality of life.

679
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:55,190
Again for the sensitivity, outpatient services is most likely to decrease.

680
01:16:55,190 --> 01:17:05,230
The cost effective ratio of this can be extend that this service is most demanded and most Medicaid beneficiaries are treated in this service.

681
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:11,350
However, the quality of life here scanned from this treatment has the widest range of

682
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:17,800
quality of life scanned from these services compared to the residential services.

683
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:29,890
People who are in the intensive outpatient service are less have more likely to get defined medication adherence in this settings

684
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:38,650
and have fewer of any behavioral change compared to console like service because console systems will fill up after the treatment.

685
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,110
So with this result, we suggest to improve the overall quality of life.

686
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,879
You're scanned from the service and stabilize the treatment effect, for example,

687
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,470
providing the combination of initial treatment and the follow up visits.

688
01:17:53,830 --> 01:18:01,479
And Katie will the further discussion. Oh, right.

689
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:07,210
So when we're thinking about how these results are useful in a more and a broader scope,

690
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:16,700
we have talked about in class how Medicare does not use cost effectiveness analysis, but we're not using the cost in this case to restrict services.

691
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:24,580
And we know that Medicare does not account for costs when deciding whether or not to cover something, whereas some payers might decide,

692
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:30,640
Oh, we need to cut back on this coverage, it's too expensive or it's costing too much on a particular program.

693
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:40,150
We we did discover a study that showed that by expanding these services, it would be a small cost increase for Medicare.

694
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:48,340
But a lot of that cost is offset by the reduction in costs from treating other conditions that could be caused by substance use disorder.

695
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:53,050
And Medicare would still be interested in knowing if a program is cost effective.

696
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:59,770
Never is cost effective, especially when it comes to advocating for a program expansion in the future.

697
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:07,570
And then this analysis can also serve as a model for other payers to expand their substance use services,

698
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:13,240
since it assesses costs and qualities of treatment in a in a more Broadway.

699
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:17,620
And then, for instance, if a payer had a restricted budget,

700
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:25,150
the results can indicate our results from our study do indicate that the residential treatment, as we were saying,

701
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:31,989
should be prioritized because it was determined to be the most cost effective and residential

702
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:37,090
treatment being the cheapest and most effective service based on our tornado analysis.

703
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:45,940
So in the future, it would be beneficial for to have more patients utilizing the residential treatment compared to outpatient services and counseling.

704
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:53,050
And these services as a standalone package do not show a strong improvement in quality of life on their own.

705
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:59,253
But when you start to address associated social determinants of health with these treatment services, the quality of life in.
