1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,160
Having examined the
structure and performance of

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,500
markets for health
insurance, hospital care,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,230
and pharmaceuticals,
we've seen the causes

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,560
and consequences of several
types of market failures.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,660
Many of these are situations

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,585
involving poor or
asymmetric information.

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:28,095
Others involve market power
or barriers to entry,

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,450
which sometimes are
themselves consequences of

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,540
policies intended to
achieve other objectives.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,480
In this unit, we will
describe and analyze

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,195
some of the attempts to
mitigate these market failures,

12
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:42,340
thereby improving
outcomes for consumers.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,480
These initiatives include better

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
informing consumers
about the price

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,910
and quality of care and
supporting market competition.

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,120
Will also explore several
approaches to reforming

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,995
the health care financing system

18
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:58,230
and ensuring financial
access to care.
