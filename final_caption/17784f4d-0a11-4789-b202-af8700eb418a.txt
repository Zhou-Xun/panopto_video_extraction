1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,940
So now we go to the last we were talking about some general introduction by biologic agents.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,840
So we'll go into the different category, biologic agents. Last week we also mentioned the viruses of a life.

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,480
But now here you see why we say the viruses are using agents.

4
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:37,920
So there's no bacteria or fungi that reproduce that is alive or well survive but virus loss,

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,350
Lewis said, it's not like really the lack of the criteria for being alive.

6
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,950
The criteria they can become online, they can reproduce themselves.

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:58,340
So reproduce, replicate, and then they also have the structures that separate them from members of the three basic criteria to be alive.

8
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:09,480
That virus does not very. How with all the criteria, because we have to rely on the the host host to revisit.

9
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,870
Really. So that's sort of life or they want to eyes payments of inheritance.

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:29,470
That is because the company produced after all, although they cannot really accept replication,

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:36,610
I think every book is almost as compelling using other agents to be able to reproduce

12
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,190
all the that here because they all can reproduce the records and even engines.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,999
So I'm not trying to confuse you by existence while we define how we define and think about tonight,

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,440
but also make a difference when we think about these agents,

15
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:09,770
if they can reproduce almost some of The Washington Post and then we can amplify from one to many of these particles, all the cells in the industry,

16
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,910
vehicles that also make a difference, make a difference in terms of how to control them, how to control the comparison.

17
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:26,739
The chemical agents, most of which we can replicate, they become a way to replicate either in the host.

18
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,500
All these problems become already replicated so or even on a host.

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:42,549
So a different approach to think about, different approach to control, to go with the new areas.

20
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,040
We'll talk about some of the evolution classification and also how can we choose

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,140
and control evolution change over the time within the use of our organism?

22
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,379
Again, I wanted to use some of this discourse to bring more all of you to the same page,

23
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,680
to have the best understanding of the balance aided organisms.

24
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:11,740
Some of you may have heard this already many times, but I want to everyone, if I'm not familiar with, just read the same page about this topic.

25
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,530
Okay? So that's reason I include like the evolution some ecology on this actually over the

26
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,060
life of the image of organisms that leads to the formation of the normal species.

27
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:30,190
Also a variation within us with a code which with SARS-CoV-2 we know this evolution, the virus gibberish all the time.

28
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,590
So and then the virus,

29
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:40,540
most of the time they are more prone to the mutation and more prone to generate the new variants because single strand is doing it.

30
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,140
If we think about it, that's again, this is a kind of history of this evolution of the life.

31
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,250
Six 4.5 billion is very harsh environment of the beginning on the earth.

32
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,910
Think about it. It's not like what we have right now, although we talk about climate change all the time, but in the time,

33
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,210
if you think about the history of the oldest life of the earth, the environmental conditions still harsh.

34
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,140
Okay. So. There's no life there. Okay.

35
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:23,930
No, not until we have made the most of the change of Zimbabwean conditions is really spicy, antibacterial.

36
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:33,770
It's not to produce oxygen, to produce ultimately the little bit and the formation like the oxygen on the earth.

37
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,260
But. We have a boost of the life on the on the earth.

38
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:48,010
So then we have these stars by three, four or five years beneath the stars of the life on the US.

39
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,670
And then this how this evolves. To the different species on this side.

40
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,680
So that's a long time off. So we're not going to the details how that evolution happens.

41
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,210
But that's just that was a concept we have right now. Okay.

42
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,850
The first organism develops 3.6 to 4 billion years old.

43
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,160
And I want to say here is really think about the biological agents.

44
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,720
When you think about one of the first, always the more fun.

45
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,610
If it follows the agents that we find about the biological agents, we'll probably will not be able to depend on the agents.

46
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,740
So we the definition, the biological agents that they all cause almost health impacts on the host.

47
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,419
That's called biological agents. In the beginning, there's no really human.

48
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,229
Yes. The host yet there's no real interaction.

49
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,320
So come out of it. You find with those agents a lot.

50
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,080
What happened in the revolution.

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:06:00,720
Again, that's the the the the the criteria for the life that they have this environment condition again, is very reduced,

52
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:10,650
able to feel very hushed or temperature but that's what our life stuff that's what else that so I don't know

53
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:21,570
whether you guys make the the hotpot we like the cuisine hotpot Chinese or BA so we try to mix everything together.

54
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,120
Okay. And they're cooking them and then hopefully will come out with some groupies.

55
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay. If that's that's what's going on. What's going on.

56
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,770
And they like the harsh environments or temperature.

57
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:50,340
Then the we start to have the small microparticles that produced by this reactions on this base.

58
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,120
And then we start to form this. Sugars. Amino acids.

59
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:06,230
Components for life. Computing for light and how we generated and then how this form is the first life as a force of life.

60
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:13,060
So, again, this is a start. Well, the new idea we have is really the first form of the idea.

61
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:23,220
Like their former designer, and then that they have the memories, the erroneous memories surrounding it, so separate from the outside world.

62
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,030
But then they have this idea they can self reproduce and then they can start to produce the protein and the importance of the unit.

63
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,370
So that's how we got this life. So not very long time gave a long time to produce this.

64
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,280
And that's how we started life. We separate particles, especially with the membrane, totally.

65
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,900
Almost like separate this particle with called and then the separate from outside.

66
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,830
Then we contained the hunger and the produced protein.

67
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,450
And then we can produce the DNA and start to we. That's the other life.

68
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:12,930
So on this planet first, people always see the origin of life as only one organism or one one cell.

69
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,450
But apparently with a new theory, it's not really the case.

70
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:28,489
Think about the counting system we have. In harmful effects.

71
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:41,510
You probably were generous. My poor steals four months of my personal life, whereas equalized on these values and then start to exchange.

72
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,920
Okay, now. Now becomes more important here.

73
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,200
As many as they can exchange the genetic material.

74
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,360
Okay, here you have these module sales.

75
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,070
So I started and then they can they will be able to exchange genetic materials.

76
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,850
And then they evolved to the three domains of the life.

77
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,979
One of the happiest moments in life. They have a gene test for managing drugs, so we can still exchange that.

78
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:24,410
You mentioned the to us. So basically what I mean is every now and now we will have these frequency changes to make them curious.

79
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,480
But it's interesting. If you sequence our genome.

80
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:44,040
Okay. So how would you know? We'll be able to find a lot of original virus technology and we will be able to find lot of biological marginal.

81
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,850
And to be able to find every kilogram during the height and width.

82
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay. So that's the first. I also.

83
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,870
If you came to us. Okay. We caught your vote on the microphone.

84
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:13,200
This is cool. You won't regret. So the strategy here is really think about the control of these biological agents.

85
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,060
Think about can we really eradicate the biological agents?

86
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:30,820
Can we really eradicate. Okay so Michael is including virus that exist much much earlier the US.

87
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:40,190
Okay. 3.5 billion years old. And then when we evolved as a human being on this planet.

88
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,250
We already have so many different levels of use of bacteria or virus.

89
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,490
So at that moment, we are exposed.

90
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:07,760
Oh, sorry. And in fact, during this process, this DNA from the virus, from all of us, including our original religion.

91
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,870
So that's how we guess. I would also you.

92
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:20,540
Okay. So obvious college stage. So eventually we may be able to find some virus.

93
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:33,350
Okay, so he's got a short term. So I mean, is it can my exposure to the Kobe right now exposed to the Kobe right now I give the infection.

94
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:44,060
Do you think I will have the virus being in my cells? LS it difficult to say when you do what you say?

95
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:57,190
So sometimes it takes time to detect that you need. For some of this, you may be able to fight the the hepatitis a, b, you'll be able to fight.

96
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,960
But how can you really trust that being the second generation, that's more complicated.

97
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,530
But for a lot of people, that's probably the case. So so this is what I'm thinking of.

98
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,840
Try to think about this in the in the long term.

99
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,160
The big picture here is really trying to eradicate all of these.

100
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,830
Organisms in my body may not be a good approach.

101
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:33,760
Great therapy group or what help exchange fruit because due to the evolution of the fruit and exchange of dimension materials between us,

102
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:40,320
a moss and other organisms, we get along units so are still very frequent.

103
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:48,430
Again, the first evidence of life. Talk about these foci, 3.5 billion years old.

104
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,639
And again this you can still see that living cyanobacteria. Now this one of the bacteria also finds this kind of living.

105
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:06,670
So metabolism the metabolism is also very important form of the life for the life there will be about to.

106
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,810
The nutrients for the biosciences. So what do we need for life?

107
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,770
What do we need for the life to make our life some money?

108
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,090
What do we need to make our life? And energy.

109
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,340
For first. Okay. That's what we need, right?

110
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,210
That's what we need in the Tel Aviv. We need energy. We need nutrients.

111
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,990
First of some of the food, also very for the nutrient, but also for the energy.

112
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,840
But. So, again, that's because. And a body then.

113
00:13:50,150 --> 00:14:00,139
We input the nutrients, improve energy for our water can enhance and at the same time we do the produces the

114
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,240
energy here and also have more of them produce energy for them for the activities,

115
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:17,120
transportation all these, but also for the energy for the obsolescence of nutrients.

116
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,670
And when these different type of meeting are also important to think about the biological agent,

117
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,110
how, if we want to control them, this is what they need.

118
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:33,310
But when you have issues, like when you have the energy to do so and we also need to have these.

119
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,620
During this process would be produce.

120
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:50,090
I love West Virginia West we two days of optimism so that's also why we have this memory here perseverance of life from the Iraq.

121
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:00,110
Okay. Otherwise it would be the same. Right. If we do become a separate assembly, then you will be free of all the things they don't like.

122
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:08,530
Okay. So here is really how somebody to have the selective transportation of people you travel outside of.

123
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,990
Okay. It's inside and outside. So that's the process.

124
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,440
That's the process. So now. Think about this control process.

125
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,450
If we can. We don't provide solutions.

126
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:31,430
If we cannot provide the food source or if we break down this in the cabin or if you break the membrane, for example, they would be able to.

127
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,960
Okay. So that's the the the the best for the for the life.

128
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,050
Again, this is very basic. But think about this.

129
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,630
The protein surface, when you have the protein synthesis, there's a lot of functions in our life.

130
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,979
So this is the DNA. We have first had the transcription.

131
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,160
We were able to do the transcription and then we do the translation.

132
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:07,120
If this is where this is the central dogma for the the life we have, the DNA,

133
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,880
everything so got out from the DNA and then we use the transcription to produce an MRI.

134
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:21,879
And then the MRI can also do the, the translation to produce a protein useful by that's process and can also have the reverse transcription.

135
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,050
So you can have that I you can reverse transcribe to the DNA.

136
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,060
But that's also one of the mechanism the virus use.

137
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,440
It is reverse transcription for a DNA to reproduce.

138
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:46,030
Okay. So again, this is the process of the life. So now if you find some agents, pharmaceuticals, you can print down this process and control the.

139
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,990
Okay. That's how we develop the new drugs. Pharmaceutical to do this.

140
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:04,680
So yeah is important to have this code your function of doing it reproduce and then the the the

141
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,660
the produced evidence the transcription of the crustaceans to the protein and then we separate.

142
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,700
But that's for the algorithms of the how to reproduce them.

143
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,640
So some want to devise a to.

144
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay. So that's the regeneration. So what are your needs?

145
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,800
All this process needs energy. Okay. We need energy for this.

146
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:35,510
So most of the energy in the biological system, which is ATP as energy vector, to bring the energy to the process.

147
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:51,590
So ATP become ATP. And then that's the the the become the the the how we can give energy of energy to produce energy ATP to store the energy.

148
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,170
And then we release at the first release energy for the biological reaction.

149
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,730
So ATP, we know that it is really the energy storage that we have involved in the cells.

150
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,860
But as a matter of fact, now in the higher system you overuse ATP, you can also use a single.

151
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:23,420
If you have a lot of ATP, it could be a problem with the signal for a contingency.

152
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,780
So for example, if you have a of the cut.

153
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:39,770
So we switched to sales. So ATP competition in the sales is 2 to 6 deliveries.

154
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,640
But all sides all sides just like to do one.

155
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,810
I you know, confusion of lung disease. So it's six all of different.

156
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,240
Six. All the difference. Now think about it. Think about it. So we have.

157
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,740
We need our AGP. Our skills to make our function.

158
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,160
But we don't really have that computing power ex the most space of just a little space.

159
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:17,480
So now we have suddenly you have the break of the seals, you see a flurry of ATP to extract extracellular space.

160
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,090
What I mean. What do you think? Something went wrong.

161
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:34,060
Right. Something went wrong. So that's kind of a signal. We have some editing because you have the sequence, all these sides information.

162
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,880
We do our work with this area as well. But again, remember, ATP is the.

163
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:48,870
Keith reckons we sales to maintain our life cycle need for the cycle of energy of life.

164
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,810
Now. How do we classify?

165
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,580
So this is kind of a cartoon job by a professionals.

166
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,970
Think about the form of the life with different form of the rights and how do we realize it?

167
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,500
How do you recognize it? How do we use that?

168
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,650
So. Four, four, four. A simple question for us.

169
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:21,670
So how do we record ourselves? Function is classified by function.

170
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,090
By function. I feel like that we all humans.

171
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:33,580
So how to regulate ourselves by nationality, sometimes nationalities.

172
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,040
Physical attributes. Physical attributes and appearance.

173
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,750
And sometimes you have the biological fingerprints. Right?

174
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:50,980
So we can differentiate ourselves by so by most of the I mean, here we can buy just buy a German.

175
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,530
Look at you. Oh, yeah. So then we can associate them with that.

176
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:02,510
Okay. Sometimes you have to use probably a deep cost to do this.

177
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,990
But now think about the microbes that become our microbes that don't really have this.

178
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,050
Of course, parents do have some of our focus.

179
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,610
We talk about how the way we classify them, how we classify them.

180
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,540
They use different ways to classify microbiomes, but taxonomy is assigned, so maybe organisms are grouped them into the local category.

181
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,880
That's what we do in the US early as the 1700s.

182
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,880
So it is Dr. Carlos. They use a binomial system of.

183
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,110
One of the few Latin names of all we use genus.

184
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,790
A group of close to all the species added to the genus name to identify which

185
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,100
one of the silver species within the genus specifically see the name of those.

186
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:08,780
So the classification system used to classify different organisms.

187
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,530
We use that genus and then we use.

188
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,940
Also the the the species them so presume that the give them the organisms so remember is will

189
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:34,970
always italicize the the limb of these species but always okay that's how we have this.

190
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:41,720
For example, for us, the Homo sapiens, this is to women.

191
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,950
Okay. So pay attention to this.

192
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,090
Okay. This is looks like simple, but a lot of times people forget about it.

193
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,390
Okay. So you need to categorize the first letter.

194
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:07,510
If you talk about the name of organisms that we use and then you italicize the name and then this is this is more letter the second use monitor.

195
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,770
Somehow we were shortening with age. That's the point that's important to.

196
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,490
So let's pay attention to this. Sometimes we write these names.

197
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,470
Some people forget about it. Okay. Okay. If we can already.

198
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,680
It's appendicitis. You have to online the limb or you some.

199
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:37,350
Okay, you have to do that. So with the classification we have the Domain Kingdoms, phylum, class, class or family genus species.

200
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,790
That's we, we, we, we.

201
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,240
How do we use this right now to classify all this organ?

202
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,530
We have domains, kingdom, phylum, class, or a family genus.

203
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,170
This is how we define. This is us human to give these realities of humans.

204
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:03,150
And that's different. That was the highest classification in the domains life domains.

205
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:15,030
Of course, treatment of the life giving it just mysterious really carries genetic information that we know in the 1950s.

206
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:23,700
We start to look to to do almost everything, a structure of these, the double helix structure of these miracles and the study.

207
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,570
Look at that. And then we know that you have all these to make information. Now.

208
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,260
I just mentioned Cameron.

209
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:38,040
It just based on the appearance of all the Ravens, especially, the smoke is too small to really differentiate them with that.

210
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,720
So what do we use?

211
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:50,339
We do need to contain genetic information so that we can use this to fight to differentiate them, and especially we use to survive them.

212
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:56,520
And they are getting pretty fresh organ and that's how we fight.

213
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,260
We probably strip them used to synthesize the protein.

214
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:09,570
Okay, so during the evolution, think about the who that if something is very essential of the life.

215
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:20,650
What's that mean? If there's a mutation generous introduced into the maracas like nitrate.

216
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,670
It would disappear because they effectively lacked sexual function.

217
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,750
So because of the patient comorbidity, the essential function means that.

218
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,120
All right, so for the right them, if the components go, that's essential for life.

219
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,780
So this is how the protein so is a very welcome zone.

220
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,610
And during the evolution, it's a very welcome result.

221
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,020
So we can use this information to, but it's still some variation introduced.

222
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,190
So we're concept, but still variation.

223
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,650
So we can use this approach to differentiate. We're always about, okay, that's how we do it.

224
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:08,100
So of course the problem I use this to classify Bhaskara is Professor Carlos.

225
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,519
I don't know any of you still remember his name? Carlos Karabakh.

226
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,580
His name? Professor Carlos. Okay.

227
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,850
No, he's the guy, you see. He is the first one.

228
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,350
We use the thinking as to rather the mind to define the street domain of life.

229
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,250
We used to have these five kingdoms of the life, but nothing is more really accurate.

230
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:47,620
Bacteria carrier. That's the common burden for the new dominant in the life of IKEA is IKEA as a new dominance of life.

231
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,890
So basically this is evolutionary route of the tree, the whole life stuff from here.

232
00:26:52,130 --> 00:27:01,280
And then to differentiate it to strip domains of the life one domains, bacteria or domains or domains, that's the domain of the three domains of life.

233
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,280
Okay. So this is pretty close to your past a few years ago.

234
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:16,069
The key that you make a lot of contribute in basic contributing to the life to

235
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,730
the to the biological sciences and also to understand evolution of the life.

236
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,150
Unfortunately. Unfortunately, he didn't win the Nobel Prize. He should win the Nobel Prize.

237
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,120
But during his lifetime, he did not win the Nobel Prize.

238
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,700
So when I was a postal almost 20 years ago, I took his class.

239
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:47,530
So at that time, he always every week was a week.

240
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:55,840
That's a discussion class. So without any PowerPoint, without any fruits, reading materials, nothing.

241
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,340
So what do we do every Tuesday evening from 7 to 9?

242
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:09,550
We just sit in classroom and discuss. So I would like to have a reading by the microwave comic book.

243
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,220
I forgot about the original The Knife.

244
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:24,600
So I have a discussion about it, and we have about my group of ten students, post-docs together in about 2 hours every week for.

245
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,809
And as always, think about I mean, there's a virtual discussion about this.

246
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:41,440
So I hope you are hedging. Okay. So because the origin of life, the theory of doing this, this, this time.

247
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,970
But he really defines it.

248
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:59,190
What would define the three domains? So the three domains of life, the three domains life is you carry out the acquire.

249
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,220
You carry the three domains of life. So now think about what's the major difference between the three domains of life.

250
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,060
Based on the genetic information. Yes. But then we can also based on the.

251
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:23,090
Biochemistry. The structure of the cells to differentiate three domains of the life.

252
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:29,370
Three domains of life. So what are you can see here? Rooms on the sides.

253
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,930
70 some days.

254
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:41,670
So basically, based on all these categories, you'll be able to see that they can differentiate them pretty distinctive in three domains away.

255
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,150
Okay. I'll not read the details about how they've chosen.

256
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:50,760
What you can see here, based on these property characteristics, you can define three domains of life.

257
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,190
You can do bacteriological and bacterial domains.

258
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,120
And we talk about biological agents in the different three domains of life.

259
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,720
Some lives in the anaerobic environments that don't really need action.

260
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:13,139
Think about the Al-Aqsa mosque. They have all these different volumes of them.

261
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:20,880
All those are Arabic. So biological agents and some of them could be anaerobic, would be awesome Arabic as well.

262
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,560
So some of the pages that these often sometimes in videos.

263
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,020
So that's the the bacterial command structure that's a typical.

264
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:45,270
Structure for bacteria. We have these different components cell membrane, cell wall.

265
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,690
And then we have these could be other forms of being in the cells.

266
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,840
And then we have the classmates doing some. Trust me, spotting it could be just from one side to the others here.

267
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,440
We'll have the rebels up for successes. But for the moment, how my phone used to move.

268
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,580
Most of Sam will have these idea for the DNA.

269
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,510
Okay. They can use them, have them to move around in the environment.

270
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,030
Okay. And then we also have the plan.

271
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:22,620
Sometimes the peanuts and nuts can be also have them to attach to some places and also exchange them information.

272
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:31,020
So because what you can see here for the microorganisms, for the bacteria, it's a separate entity.

273
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:39,570
Okay. To separate entities. They have the membrane still work to maintain the structure, the separate from the assembly environment.

274
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,380
And then we also have all these different similar components.

275
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,140
I have them to force the function that will move from one place to the other place flagella some of them.

276
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,750
They prefer to stay one place. I'm going to move around in a small environment there.

277
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:05,280
Okay. I have one. Interesting. We also have a different sensors on the several cell wall, different sensors attached here.

278
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,230
So we can think about the cell is tiny and the help cells what's going on you mean thing

279
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,790
they need directly into the environment so they have to safely back this thing up.

280
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,180
So they are all have all different type of sensors unstable so that we can see is was

281
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,590
evolving condition is evolving in the in the in the environment so that we can survive.

282
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:42,080
One of the one of the key things in the structure of the cell membrane we have this is a gram negative bacteria,

283
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,750
a miniature bacterial cytoplasmic membrane which a plasma membrane.

284
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,060
And then we also have the use of. Director Glass Garden area.

285
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,170
Okay. We also have the outer membrane.

286
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,490
So that's three layers and a three by three nails. So.

287
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:13,830
So what you have here, this is we maintain the fluidity of the structure of the cells, but then this peptidoglycan gives some strength.

288
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,810
And also and then we have the cell of our memory. We have our memory.

289
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,780
You can see a large polysaccharide attached to it.

290
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,920
And then is a protein could be other transporter and therefore also all this just the sensor that you with the conditions

291
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:36,959
and then we can make this some different type of pores so that we can selectively transport export compounds across them.

292
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,930
So that's the structure of the these bacteria. This is gram lecture for the gram close.

293
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,380
You know how many two layers of the outside, the plus membrane.

294
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:55,230
And then we have the typical glycan. They also get a sixth, have the glycan, they'll think about gram positive and gram negative.

295
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,910
But the because the cell wall structure are different, what different aspects are different?

296
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:08,430
And then you think about how can we tell them how to integrate them?

297
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,880
So we think about with gram, negative bacteria becomes a cell membrane structure, a cell wall structure different.

298
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,770
So how could use different approach for that? Gram negative, gram positive.

299
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:30,000
So that's all this based on study of this microorganism will help us to to to develop a different approach to control the.

300
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:47,220
Okay. So let's take a quick break and then we'll come back with you.

301
00:34:52,070 --> 00:35:43,930
It was pretty much a little bit more detail about what the pilot has become capitalizing on and what you're getting at some level of performance.

302
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:58,870
That is very early on, I was like, okay, I'm going to lose it.

303
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:07,510
It's not going to work. I was very supportive of the shooting and her duty.

304
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:29,530
She said, The only time I get that because it was like, Oh, she told me.

305
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:36,890
She was like, Oh.

306
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:49,160
And I said, I don't know that that's a possibility, but they all had nothing to hide.

307
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,560
So yeah, you're right, they did.

308
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:57,340
And I was like, Oh, that's because of that. Yeah. And, you know, very subtle things.

309
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:05,740
You might have to work outside your hours doing what you're doing that I don't think that was.

310
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:13,780
Yeah, I know. I thought that was part of the discomfort or something.

311
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:21,260
Just like you might have to work on your eyes, but you're on your own or whatever you are.

312
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,339
Well, but how does it work?

313
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:36,460
So the first time you were here, there's something really interesting about it.

314
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:44,290
And I'm like, What have you learned aggressively?

315
00:37:44,290 --> 00:38:04,010
So I can see that I'm not really for you wondering how are you going to do it?

316
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:27,140
By the time you take number five and seven heart rate for an extra day, it should be like, Yeah, let me give you a sense for someone else.

317
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,270
What's going on? There's no doubt about that.

318
00:38:33,860 --> 00:39:14,049
Yeah, I'm not doing this for this because, like, I work today, so I didn't really have time to do of the bacteria and working with them all day.

319
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,070
My favorite holiday years that she was on me from standing orders in your classes.

320
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:31,440
Okay. And animals and cells, just to name a few examples in that comment.

321
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:44,810
I think a little bit. I'm just trying to name a few examples of agents that would be impacted on me.

322
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,710
Before I started this,

323
00:39:51,750 --> 00:40:05,040
this maybe bacterium is hard to find agents that follow you all of your positive publicity of the disease equalize stuff of over

324
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:15,510
to the most serious of what is the reason because we're studying more about it so we know more politics has become a domain.

325
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:22,890
Okay, but there's more what in those more than a year.

326
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:32,390
So again, that's another element of the life of IKEA living in extreme environments.

327
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,850
If you go to Yellowstone, the house, we probably can find them here.

328
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:50,500
Okay. IKEA. Even in a similar vein, over the 200 attendee families to bear hug from the bottom of the ocean.

329
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,340
You can find that here. You can find that here.

330
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,070
We've in the most inhabitable environments on the earth.

331
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,100
That's called IQ. Interesting.

332
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:17,330
So we can also find that my team. In animals, for example, you could all go to the cows.

333
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:28,010
You may be able to identify some a killer. In the end, it does indicate how messy the report of the human gut is.

334
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,500
But in the animal, yes, if you have the report of that, so is inconclusive.

335
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:38,060
Okay. Inconclusive so far. Whether it's a key or biological agents.

336
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,220
Yeah, it's not coming out for that.

337
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:49,370
But it's not very conclusive yet to see whether we really see some Akin or presence.

338
00:41:51,470 --> 00:42:00,020
Okay. But if you want to find some IKEA, which is excuse me, you aren't going to be able to find a because amount.

339
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:09,160
So. Yes. If you find the key in the animals digestive tract in the gut.

340
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,550
But whether it's the logical agents, so it's inconclusive, we can all say yes or no.

341
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,840
The other domain of the life is the uterus and carrier domain.

342
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:29,680
They have different kingdoms for fungi, planta and ammonia.

343
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:41,020
Of the of the of the kingdom of seems to be the domain of the productive stuff we do find the biologic

344
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:52,810
agents in stuff that's pretty common is a most single cells carriers along together like individual cells.

345
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:02,650
The lump together you tell us. So in the process you start.

346
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,120
We have this algae from over slime mold.

347
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,160
That you can find the biological agents in all these domains.

348
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,980
Algae for them. The algae you can find in the algae, we can produce toxins.

349
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:30,900
We have it as opposed to the some of the idea of them as warm followed by agents they can you fix.

350
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:41,990
We can also have the sort of like the fungus like but is the most single most nuts also in the kingdom of stem.

351
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:52,620
So this is the lifecycle of the idea is a in the in the in the human body but also you do

352
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:03,360
vomit and it's pretty common life cycle of the of the idea here for example they can multiply

353
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,090
in the guts infecting the other can multiply and cause of damage to our house because the

354
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:15,720
infection and then when they need the environment they become the cyst that becomes this.

355
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:27,730
That becomes the reason we can survive. We can survive, although they will not be able to reproduce in the environment.

356
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:40,220
But we can persist in the environment. For example, they can contaminate the water, the food, hands, fomites, so they can contaminate.

357
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,460
And then when we ingest, they can start to reproduce where they start to reproduce.

358
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:56,140
Instead of reproducing, can reproduce and the form is different and this is different form of the life stage.

359
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,920
Okay, so that's the lifecycle for them. In these ballots you can think of.

360
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:12,820
So again, I understand the lifecycle of this ages will help us to control my children.

361
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:18,520
So most of the kids will not be direct person to person transmission.

362
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:25,840
The new environment. This is oral cavity, oral roots for which I just mentioned.

363
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,120
Okay. So that control the environment becomes very important.

364
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:40,640
To control the spread of these pharmaceuticals prevents water contamination from them, the superintendent said.

365
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:48,340
Key for this. That's one of the.

366
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:57,380
Example for this. I find that very common to find that very common.

367
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:02,460
You can see fungus multicellular non motile.

368
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:13,400
The form, the legwork. Of the multicellular filaments and then penetrate the environment.

369
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,169
The decompose became good to use all this organic material can find.

370
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,440
We can decompose within decompose.

371
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,899
They use a hybrid enzymes by just this organic matter.

372
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:35,490
So any any any anyone. Give the example this exterior of your life they like.

373
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,290
When you're focused more, it's the same old idea.

374
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:48,350
Yeah. Okay. Anyone anywhere has some flooding in the basement of your parent's house.

375
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,430
Are you okay? Yeah. So.

376
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,980
And when you keep the figure, I'm already outside for some time.

377
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,479
We are fine. So. Because they can use this and they can use it.

378
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,230
Just that it matters. They can use it.

379
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,330
But for discussion, it's a tick tock.

380
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:28,930
And there's those like Neil deGrasse Tyson saying that humans are, quote, more closely related to a guy and fungi is to create plants.

381
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,110
Really interesting. Like separated, I guess.

382
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,890
Okay. Okay. During this amusing.

383
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:47,200
If you look at his distance between the different audience, sometimes you'll be surprised by how close you are with it.

384
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:56,830
And the interesting also because, you know, we have sometimes we have more fun with them as well if we study more.

385
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:05,800
Although I'm not an expert in this area, it's not my research, but I may be able to find some fun by doing it because we expose them all the time.

386
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,790
So they may we may be able to find some voice, you know?

387
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,190
By some of the analysis that even make the need to have more close relations.

388
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:22,360
It is very likely to take it to a landing in our genome.

389
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:34,780
Although we each plan all the time. But in terms of these findings, the fact that it can be transferred to your unit for downtime to find them.

390
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,470
You. So.

391
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:46,880
The other one we have,

392
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:56,030
that's the fungus for the in terms of the agent you'll find these agents kill called this OGE energy and this effect is disease.

393
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,170
So they have different ways of referring reproduction and reproducing themselves.

394
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,720
Sexual reproduction. We have the spores, the fungus spoiled.

395
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:12,049
We can reproduce. By that way. They can also have the sexual reproduction of a high.

396
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,440
They have to find that can grow together. It tends to make them Cuba.

397
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,460
But in addition to a new school producing structure.

398
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:34,230
So it produces sports. And now what that means is, again, stress simply in the environment and also using environment.

399
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:43,890
Okay. So if you experience of you don't make money, your parents probably take care of this.

400
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:56,740
You have the moldy most basements and how quickly they can be met with you might be able to you really have the flow basements.

401
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:05,430
You may be able to see these more in the in the in the basement because you can do this at this spot,

402
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:13,500
produces for the spirit very quickly and then we have this moisture to you have a food source.

403
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:22,230
Sometimes I'm curious to see that in the basement and they just use that's pretty good.

404
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:30,900
I Effectuer is one of the pretty common, if you think about it.

405
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:38,880
How many of you use companies? Have you looked at this case for the complainants?

406
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,360
How do you resist? How do you create? Okay.

407
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,000
How can we have the solution? You have the solution.

408
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,490
Suppose you put these companies in the case. Then everything would take care of themselves.

409
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:07,810
But if you look at this, the case you use. Through the microscope, you'll see a surprising exhaust plate and also with contact lens as well.

410
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,670
And that's a source for things like Inception.

411
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:19,050
When the U.S. becomes the contamination of these countries.

412
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:27,880
I also ever will. And that is the feel in the soil and the surface of the soil probably is.

413
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,700
So that can be can sometimes damage through your heads.

414
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:42,360
We use. Okay. So fungi, for example, infection is another one.

415
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:53,140
Like agents belong to this fungi. Fungi is not only just the infection, but also the the allergic reaction we have.

416
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:57,970
So we have two moldy basements, for example, that can cause energy to this.

417
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:04,540
Okay. Another category virus probably.

418
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,350
Well, the pandemic. We hear a lot about the virus.

419
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:19,730
About the virus here. This is a. Simple life form, a simple form of an even a baseball ice single form.

420
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:31,800
So most of the viruses that the typical virus, how the sheer structure would have the envelope of protein and the milk.

421
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,410
But inside we have an ordinary okay idea.

422
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:45,020
So flu for the flu is on. It was also being a virus for most of this virus structure where they have they have

423
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:52,309
this envelope of shear structure that can capture being in with numerous or RNA

424
00:52:52,310 --> 00:53:00,500
in which your genetic material insights and then they can you fix this is a most

425
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,790
of these structure have very symmetric structure is very nice looks very nice.

426
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:19,950
Okay. So. Most have the hopes to replicate again.

427
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:25,940
It's not a life is movie ideas, but it's life is not a life.

428
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:35,959
So it's an even ages. So if you can stop all the you can just stop the reproduction of it for you.

429
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,570
They won't be able to enjoy it.

430
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:49,520
So and also make it a difficult effects for to develop the drugs to control the viral replication.

431
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:59,690
So think about it. Think about it. How do you the host without a host wisdom to reproduce?

432
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,710
So what happens if we use some drugs? Some drugs?

433
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,740
Try to stop the process of breaking process.

434
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:25,160
What are you going to expect to get prior to me to produce this Albuquerque?

435
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,280
So what's the common common things about the the anti-viral drugs?

436
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:44,350
It's not that they don't necessarily destroy the virus, control its replication virus.

437
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:50,490
Yeah. So. So they use our own machinery for this process.

438
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:57,550
Right. So we also uses machinery to reproduce this being in the system.

439
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,720
So one of the. One of the.

440
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,170
This quarantine we have developing viral anti-viral germs.

441
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:14,900
Is that a side effect? Especially because they try to stop the process.

442
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,680
It's almost own know. Okay.

443
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,830
Our Missouri early so there will impact our own.

444
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,700
So the function of most of these achievable goals.

445
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:40,760
So that's one of the reasons make it challenging. And also the side effect you have for these viral antiviral drugs becomes the process that we use.

446
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:51,140
We have to use the host. And then when you try to control them to end the drugs and make it more challenging to do that, I think.

447
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,700
So again, this is very similar structure in the different sector, but it's very good for structure.

448
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:08,550
But if you look at these viral typos, it's sheer proto envelopes.

449
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,610
This imagery, sometimes we use this as a as a ways to produce the fun of the night because it's

450
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:21,020
beautiful stroke to hit a baby for structure to how you feel put under the microscope.

451
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,629
We also have this bacteriophage that a virus can detect a bacterium.

452
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,560
So what's in the face? What different vision of phages and virus?

453
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,710
The virus that affects the women and the animals on that.

454
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,730
But if it infects the bacteria, the perfect. Okay.

455
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:46,720
Because I think and so we can put in the data into the host that they can reproduce in the field.

456
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,150
So this is one of the very beautiful structure of where of the face.

457
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:58,660
This is of five. Or they can attach to a cell membrane and then it and then that being injected into the

458
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:04,120
cells and they use it host bacterial host to reproduce what's called the bacteriophage.

459
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:12,340
And sometimes now we eventually we can use the bacteriophage to control the bacteria infection.

460
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:24,380
It's a new research topic and I try to use bacteriophage too because it bacteriophage normally they can already fit us good many famous people,

461
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,630
but they can effects the bacteria, bacterial cells,

462
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:36,549
and then they can use effective spacer bacteriophage to break down the cells as a control of the bacteria.

463
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:45,470
Ages of bacteria. This is how the authorities process.

464
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:53,120
So this is how the virus carriers fuze with this membrane they attach to the membrane, the fuze.

465
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:59,510
And then the pattern of this is that you get to take the material into some of the components.

466
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:05,200
So. Spike protein for the South Korean to.

467
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,380
They have to have a space property and they have to be respected.

468
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:18,060
But if you to put it as a plus, they believe that's a great place to be for the affection.

469
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:26,860
You think about this now. It's. They have attached the spike protein receptors attached.

470
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:39,920
So think about if you have a lot of spike protein and so receptive while the Coates SARS-CoV-2 is supposed to virus can be found you may always.

471
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:48,880
Why. Think about why we only have some upper respiratory virus and then not respond to the virus.

472
00:58:52,580 --> 00:59:02,930
What receptors? Okay. Receptors sometime which I guess we'll reach there sometime because most of the receptors.

473
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,990
On that you care. It's a memory. So that's the difference here is if you have a lot of receptors express.

474
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,800
And then make it prone to attach to it and then start to fuze.

475
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,700
And then so with the subsequent to for example.

476
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:25,490
And I've always expressed as receptive.

477
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:40,190
Okay. The experience on the cell surface and I will also surface with this they will be able to attend to virus will be tested and then they can

478
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:52,750
effects begin to look for some of the viral particle agents that will restrict the upper respiratory tract so there's only receptor that you.

479
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,780
Someone know they can get it if they don't have the simple.

480
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:09,820
Despite what White is very telling you because I try to be receptive to and that's expressed also this.

481
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:22,249
Okay. The two different ways virus reproduce or replicates of course the damage of the infection because the host cell to

482
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:31,670
first basically infect the reproduce and thus the host cells a symptom you may have quickly or similar caused damage.

483
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:43,390
Sometimes it's an echo response you have. It's caused by the fact that they use your machinery and then they burst the cells.

484
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:56,140
They could also become the party or the end device can be less static because they can it becomes difficult to keep your own genome contributing.

485
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:06,980
So that's also why some of the cells we have, we have the virus doing it, you know, cells because they can control some of the collateral.

486
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:14,760
They can also become the come out from your genome and then reproduce and then post your sales.

487
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:23,550
Okay. So that's the, the, the, the bacteria or the viral particles against the virus cause many infectious diseases.

488
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,950
Biological agents, probably well known less, but probably more common than practical.

489
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:38,550
However, we knew a lot about aging. I care about me. But if I have more agents in the viral.

490
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:48,080
Okay. Environmental review. Common cold and influenza.

491
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,670
So us is three elements. Okay.

492
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,299
Every year we surface every year.

493
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,890
Which separates us from most of the.

494
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,980
The viral. Viral. If you think about it.

495
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:16,030
Okay. So now the question to ask you is why the virus is so common.

496
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:25,770
So why is. And it's very difficult because.

497
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:33,950
Okay. Basically control. So viral particles.

498
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:46,760
Is small nanometers. I did not because initially it's very difficult to remove it.

499
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,370
Okay. And surely you take the taking also very you couldn't take them.

500
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,820
And then we'll be able to see huge numbers when they reproduce with their birth.

501
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:05,570
So from long pigeons, you effects because you think about how many particles we can produce via particles.

502
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:18,000
You won't see of that. So when you hear when you call your general M.E. the type of violent crimes.

503
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:36,250
They wanted to produce. That's the the obvious for the virus.

504
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:41,490
Here we have this virus with everything that's very common.

505
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:45,239
Look at this. That's the victim of the infection. Very common.

506
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:52,860
You have to do this. We have to get on to the viral category to our patients.

507
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,540
These are the ones, the agents that we get on easier.

508
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:11,100
Anyhow. The example we can come up. The company farms in the run the viral virus.

509
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:41,150
HPV. HPV? Sure. Because HPV, although some of this is amazing and some of the effects, all of those.

510
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,500
So let's look at these violent virus.

511
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:55,340
So the virus will will stay with us, will affect our life, will cause all of this, I suppose, outbreaks.

512
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:05,450
Okay, we just conclude the end of the pandemic has been going great and it could be how legs will.

513
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:12,450
The pandemic from virus. We don't know which one.

514
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:18,440
But we could have a next one. Pandemic.

515
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:25,729
So pandemic to see. How about this pandemic? Everything about the pandemic, the viral TikTok video can mix.

516
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,560
And then what's the capabilities to even have the whole who calls the pandemic?

517
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:41,370
We should be able to, in effect, photograph the building.

518
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,500
Okay. Your face rapidly spread rapidly.

519
01:05:48,300 --> 01:06:00,810
So what's the best approach to spreading rapidly in borne viruses, virus elbow, or how to avoid the most efficient way to spread?

520
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:08,910
And especially that's the that's the one way they can do it.

521
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:15,090
His place was album with one album called The Pandemic.

522
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:25,770
It's very, very difficult to do now because with the infrastructure we have, it's you will not be able to see a very busy and damaged epidemic,

523
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:38,550
actually some local areas if they don't have this the the infrastructure to have infrastructure like for the pandemic haven't been able.

524
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,390
As the album and the album came to the.

525
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:56,130
How are you doing with COVID?

526
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:03,030
They were really rough, so it was kind of like a quick touch of the vaccine.

527
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:10,800
So try to be patient. Most of the virus that had these characteristics, it became very quickly.

528
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,360
Every time we were together, we have a single splint on holding it.

529
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:25,740
Every time we request, kids will be able to get them. Now the immune response can't be too strong because the whole science was spreading.

530
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:32,370
Okay. So the virulence, I mean, that's another factor of the virus.

531
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,780
So the virus, if it's so rich and they cure the host.

532
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:44,990
And then there was Don Spring. So you can see the trends of the pandemic screens.

533
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:53,300
At the beginning they are quite crude retirement by then because with silver what we did is.

534
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:00,270
Die and then stop the transmission of transmission.

535
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:08,820
So in order to be able to do that, the engine has to be spread so quickly that it can be so quickly.

536
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:18,660
But it's not that we're. You could see consumers as also want to see that we see the trends in the EU.

537
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:23,220
The pandemic is ready to spread, becomes less widespread.

538
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,140
So that spreads. Well, that will what you said.

539
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:37,650
One of the one of the strengths of itself has to be to assess disappear is not really disappear.

540
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:45,990
I think they see the widespread consumer it we didn't see that to get into that.

541
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:59,810
Some of the questions about what agents? Agents.

542
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,740
How do you define the genic commensal to beneficial wounds?

543
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:15,060
Right. What kind of, I guess, are we talking about the specific definition of like a general?

544
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,030
In general. In general. General.

545
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:31,950
Is that generally defined by those based on the offense that they have and the organism that they think so was a different infection correlation?

546
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:43,290
Is the outcome whether it's good or bad to the host to on this definitely was the

547
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:50,160
end of the paper saying that inspection is its importance the use of quantization,

548
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,410
the actual accumulation of pathogens in your body.

549
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:07,160
So infection could just be like you come into contact with it or could be like you actually exhibiting symptoms listening to the thing.

550
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:18,720
So conservation would have been we we had caused so many different problems in my body that we're not part of the infection.

551
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:26,050
Localized infection due to the infection will cause damage to the follicles.

552
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:40,520
That's kind of a simple definition. They just they call us in our body, but they don't really cause damage to ourselves.

553
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:45,690
But. It was just so.

554
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:53,760
Pandemic. Pandemic caused the symptoms of the damage.

555
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:05,370
Okay. So your host organs, tissue, that's mostly because of the commensal.

556
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:14,760
Commensal. One organism benefits from the relationship and the other organism is kind of emotional.

557
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,450
Does it really? Yeah. Okay. So commensal.

558
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:32,530
Commensal means. Just that there was lot another clearly defined benefit for all of us in all we do know I mean,

559
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:40,150
the idea that for some reason we don't know whether this is good or bad and then the beneficiaries.

560
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,660
It's kind of like a they like.

561
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:52,390
I mean the example I would use and this kind of microbes that live in our gut,

562
01:11:52,690 --> 01:12:00,130
they are beneficial to us because whatever they produce it's good for us.

563
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,510
We like. So like, you know, if you don't have them, you've got a new sucker punch.

564
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:15,340
So the beneficial they can produce something to help you qualify as beneficial.

565
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:20,260
The beneficial vision they will be able to produce something we need.

566
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,530
Or help us to develop our immune system. These so called big fish.

567
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:36,540
Okay. So we have in terms of all of you to think about, we have a genuine commercial beneficial evidence.

568
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,620
If you look at almost the ages which have gone to.

569
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:48,139
Awesome. I like Target and see only the value.

570
01:12:48,140 --> 01:13:06,650
And how do we differentiate? It depends on sometimes where that area or packaging is found because SRS is naturally turning out to be fine for us.

571
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:19,340
Opportunities like this is often questioned why we quite often depend on your immune system and some people carry it.

572
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:24,500
I mean, Jim gave you the whole spectrum to be, but some people carry the same.

573
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:33,500
Agents in the body. They are fine. They call it damage to the to the all of your tissue.

574
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:37,880
But with immuno compromised people.

575
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:49,520
Nicodemus. Nicodemus. So that's in terms of dealing with the population, you know, we use population.

576
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:57,410
We need to take that into consideration as well as the host ages, environment and the ages.

577
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,670
So that's all factor you have to take into consideration, right? So some people are saying, I live here, I'm fine.

578
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:15,110
But the message that the other people find out what you think of the senior population and the risk factors of the aging population.

579
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:23,060
So the SARS-CoV-2 is a typical example of people dying because they hope that the 95,

580
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:32,870
95 would be keeping the older sites or parties that are infected, but with the younger generation, young people.

581
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,380
Okay. So. Yes. That's the way it is.

582
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:49,490
They come across groups of people depending on the immune system or the health of the host, the host of.

583
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:56,160
So now how do we our self regulates.

584
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,660
Presidents come back to fix things effectively.

585
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:12,090
How do our immune system records? So how do we define differentiate?

586
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:24,170
How do we differentiate the the the presence of any of this kind of different.

587
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:35,180
Immune system like antibodies. This is what I would say, like inside what's happening.

588
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:39,690
I can see in some other stuff, everything.

589
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:49,970
Like what's going on. Okay. Just kind of maintaining the population and make sure that there isn't anything that triggers the immune response.

590
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:57,810
And then it's kind of like, you know, the antibodies like to take care of that.

591
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:04,200
So anybody or anybody, you know, our system, our immune system.

592
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,030
So you try to recognize how they regulate them.

593
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:19,440
So the surface is is it's not really a black and white picture.

594
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:23,190
Okay. Think about this is not always a black or white picture.

595
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:27,720
Okay. But yes, with a common kind.

596
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:36,780
We have we have the patterns, microbial circles, associates having patterns on the surface that can be recognized.

597
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:51,850
By the end, they have the subject matter of revising and now the immune system really analysis of whose body we want to kill.

598
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:58,440
We want to control the passions, but we don't really want to kill the commensal.

599
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:04,080
We don't want to kill the beneficial ones. We have a system.

600
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,210
We'll have a whole session on this.

601
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:15,690
But what we're discovering about immune system and this is one of the decision by edge for this year to talk about immune system.

602
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:30,670
So we did this to regulations. Differentiate the president's again you probably with regard to removing.

603
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:37,150
Yeah. Remove them. And but. But this day now.

604
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:45,580
Whenever that comes, if I get my poems are out. Which ones are you missing or response to what happened?

605
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,339
He's this isn't working all the time, right?

606
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:55,150
Not by the time the whole reaction.

607
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,190
Okay. The overarching theme is a kind of battle in a war.

608
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:05,660
So if whatever comes, you fight.

609
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:11,630
And these like you fight, you use a bomb is a bomb.

610
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:17,750
All this is to control killing. So what happens that happens?

611
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:33,260
That is the whole body will respond to respond to it to the immediate threat information we know if we respond violently.

612
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:43,650
Okay. So I mentioned that during the evolution now we live with the ocean of organisms all the time.

613
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:48,460
At the time we exposed them.

614
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,160
So we do have the solution to protect us from this is promulgated.

615
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:58,060
But we have to fine tune the system.

616
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:03,830
Okay to fine tune the system so we don't really overreact.

617
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:15,990
But don't really overreact. So that's what's going on with with patients with colon cancer.

618
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:26,940
We're some of the coolest patient events with this coolest virus triggered the immune response.

619
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:31,590
First to go. Okay.

620
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:40,100
It's too strong. So it's own it. Not only try to remove this now when the crisis is activated.

621
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:48,430
Sometimes it's difficult to reverse. And that's what we have to figure out all this information.

622
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,510
But they you go beyond that.

623
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,990
You have damage to your own lungs, tissue from other tissue.

624
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:09,970
And then you die. Okay. So in terms of treatment now with treatments and for the treatments, you can reduce that response.

625
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:13,780
If you can wait, just able to reduce everything response.

626
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,990
You can also try to control the virus and kill the virus.

627
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:23,850
Either just kill the virus, control the complications, like when the patient's in the ICU as quote unquote.

628
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:33,950
Now you have to also reduce the immune response. Basically the import is really different now than is so strong so that they can sell.

629
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:41,850
Terms of. So think about the balance of agents here this week.

630
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,070
Think about it this way.

631
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:55,350
When we we expose to this always this is more like career definition define which want a spouse who's not going to have a issue with that.

632
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,110
Okay. I've already done very different to say this is about a lot of other people.

633
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:11,810
Okay. I want to use different ways and depend on status.

634
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:15,710
You can always so they will say what is really caused damage to us.

635
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:22,010
So in response the signal emissions they have for never they saw the damage of the tissue.

636
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,460
We release a mouth outsides mouth becomes more common.

637
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:35,719
That's a signal to us that they just want to fight. So one of the signal we use is ATP, okay, the ATP.

638
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,350
Because when a damaged our tissue, we release.

639
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:45,190
High coaches are ready to actually assemble a space that can activate our immune system.

640
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:57,360
Good luck to actor value muses. So one of the attributes you can use use a prism to remove the pieces that we don't really be that intensity.

641
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:03,630
Okay. So almost. There is always a balance.

642
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:14,790
Always a balance. There's not a clear cut in biological system in the size, but still there's a balance as well as the balance on the way.

643
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:26,550
And so with everyone with a defined following for ages, the damage was done to our house, to the host, as we define the biological agents.

644
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:32,670
But again, this is not a clear cut line.

645
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:39,690
So we have to keep the discretion of the agent, yourself and our practice.

646
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:47,200
Okay. That's an evening of stories.

647
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:51,490
Quite different. One on one nature to cover all this.

648
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:59,200
Yes, I tried to put it together for you guys by the time you have so many questions.

649
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:11,720
Now the question they have. You may realize, I mean, some of your particular microbiology has been taught.

650
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:18,830
So the way I'm teaching here is not really following the textbooks or the textbooks to do this.

651
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:22,370
I try to help you to understand what are you base.

652
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:27,169
Okay. We've been from class and no textbooks.

653
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,020
Really tell you how to put this together. I tried.

654
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:36,830
What I'm doing here is trying to help you to understand my roots as related to the biological agents.

655
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:41,630
And what did you learn about how we get on the same subject?

656
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:53,300
Okay, so feel free to ask any questions you may have, and I'd be happy to answer any question you have related to microbiology.

657
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,940
That's my favorite topic that we think about all the time.

658
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:06,530
And so in terms of the how can we protect the public health from this and not only the treatments, but also how to take the focus from.

659
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:11,030
Okay. Great. Thanks. Well, see you next week.

660
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:17,870
Oh, television. Do anything with your first 3 minutes of trust with these guys, okay.
