1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:18,860
This is not racist.

2
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,500
I mean, you know, when I mean racial discrimination.

3
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:55,090
I'm sorry that it has to be. I mean, you know, if you were going to give someone back to the other side of the world, so go somewhere.

4
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:02,300
Use the laser to try to go.

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,490
All right. Let's get started. It's very warm in this classroom.

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,030
It's very. And I hope none of you are tired because this is like nap time.

7
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,420
You're just super easy to fall asleep during this, so.

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,020
All right. Thank you for hopefully watching the lecture online on Thursday.

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,620
We're going to do a little bit of review and then go into the lecture for today, which I just posted.

10
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,970
I was a little late with that, but it is there now. So before I even start with that, does anybody want to ask any questions?

11
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:50,030
Okay. Well, ask as we go. So just a reminder, last Tuesday we were doing some exercises with the CRM.

12
00:01:50,040 --> 00:02:00,040
So it was your turn to like try to run it in R and there was a series of simulations I had you go through.

13
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:12,090
So at first it was like at first we ran 100 simulations and we saw some output and then we went through like, what if?

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,960
So a hundred simulations we would do or we really do a thousand, right?

15
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,230
If we were trying to figure out the operating characteristics of the crowd before we actually run the trial.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,569
Then I had you do like one patient at a time and this is what you would do during the

17
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,969
trial if you decided that these were that this was the skeleton you wanted to have,

18
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,580
this was the skill you decided on, the model, etc.

19
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,950
All right. You got one patient and you saw whether there was a DLT or not.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:53,100
Then you'd put in this information and this and this function as it shows you.

21
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,660
Right. I don't have it on slide show, I know. But because I'm going to do in a second thought.

22
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,979
Right. So this was saying we had one person, they didn't care. We enrolled two people.

23
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,660
They're each had dose one and they didn't have DL TS. And so we got this kind of output and it said, okay, now what dose do we assign next?

24
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,219
And so then we saw that actually I think you had potentially, depending on what your original simulation did or not,

25
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,930
it might have had some safety rules, so it might have just said the next dose.

26
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,140
But if you undid those safety rules, it would have recommended dose five.

27
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,319
And we said, well, let's only go up one dose.

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,979
So then we say, All right, put them on dose three, and then here's our data, rerun it again and it tells us what our next doses, etc.

29
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,180
So this was during the trial. How do you decide the next dose?

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,820
And then I said, okay, now try these things with different values of scale.

31
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:56,190
And I really kind of wanted you to go back to that hundred or 1000 simulations and then change the scale from like one point to 5.5, 1.5, five, etc.

32
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:06,660
So if any of you did that, do you remember what you saw, what the effect of changing the scale was in this simulation?

33
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:20,780
So here's, here's some of the output and I'm specifically flagging, for example,

34
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:31,130
when the scale is well and I'm showing you the doses, the proportion of all the simulated trials that shows each dose level, right?

35
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:40,700
So here I chose the example or the skeleton match, the truth, and then it says, okay, dose one was selected in 1% of those simulations.

36
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,450
Right. And dose five 72% and this is with the scale of one.

37
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:54,469
Okay. Now if I change the scale to like 0.25 right now, you can see when are these dose level selected?

38
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,360
0006 and a half, 90 to 1.5.

39
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:08,240
Right. That's a big, relatively big change from when the scale was one from when we selected the correct dose, the dose that hit our target.

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,200
Right. 72% of the time. So now 92% of the time.

41
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:19,370
And if I go in the opposite direction, if I make my scale much larger, like five here, right?

42
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,660
It goes down to selecting the correct dose 70% of the time.

43
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,830
So the scale. Right is somewhat putting on putting some weight on our skeleton.

44
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:38,120
Okay. How much do we trust this skeleton, these initial probabilities of toxicities that the clinician is providing us?

45
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,250
And if we really trust it, right.

46
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:48,680
We put a small scale, a small standard deviation around it so that our estimates are going to be more restricted around there.

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Right. And so our prior is going to take more weight.

48
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,230
The data is still going to talk, but the prior is going to take more weight.

49
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:04,730
So not surprisingly, I choose the AI in more simulations, I choose the correct MTD in this case because it's the truth.

50
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,309
Right. And I really trusted my prior. Now if my scale is really large, right, that's saying, you know,

51
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:18,260
I'm not I'm not so sure about this prior the skeleton I it might be right but I really want the accumulated

52
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:26,990
data to really take really take focus and choose the dose assignments and see what MTD we get.

53
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,060
And so you can imagine they're right, we're actually spending more patients at the lower doses,

54
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,840
we're finding the MTD less because we don't have as much certainty as we did with the smaller scale.

55
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:48,950
Okay. So that scale has some level of weight in terms of how much we trust that that initial skeleton.

56
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,880
So that's what I wanted you to see with the scale parameter and changing it.

57
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,070
Any questions? Okay.

58
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:07,680
So then let's go and do the poll everywhere from the the lecture six which you watched.

59
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:15,099
So remember lecture six that you watched was about extending the Phase one trial design.

60
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:22,030
So extending the CRM to type CRM or time to event continual reassessment method to allow for

61
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:31,510
partial weighting of whether we saw the Altis or not before the full DLT period is is over.

62
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,439
Okay. So the type CRM allows us to weight the data and we we give full weight to any DLT,

63
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,560
but we can partially weight any data of no DLT for that amount of time that we've observed it in the tight CRM.

64
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,430
So given that under which of the following scenarios is the tights part or the time to event part more critical?

65
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,880
So you want to think about accrual versus the DLT period in time?

66
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:38,690
Let's try to get, like 15 responses. See how much of a guest this is versus who did their homework.

67
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,010
Possibly. All right.

68
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,350
So great. So the majority of you are correct.

69
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:58,200
So the time to event piece right. Is much more important when we're accruing patients faster than we get to observe the delta period,

70
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,030
such that we want to be able to put that patient on a dose and we want to be able to use any amount of data that we already have,

71
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,149
but we want to be able to wait that data say, you know, well, I didn't expect a DLT in this period, so I don't want to wait.

72
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,870
I'm very much or there could have been some DLT is in this short period and so we

73
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,080
want to see the data the fact that they don't have any deal to use so when the.

74
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,490
The length of accrual is about the same or faster, right?

75
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,290
Recruiting patients faster than that. The period, the time to advance is really useful.

76
00:09:34,130 --> 00:10:05,810
Okay, how about this one? And it's useful to think about what the graph of these looks like, which I have on the next slide.

77
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,710
And I think if I go to the next slide, I'll keep your results, right?

78
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,770
So if you see this, you can make your decision potentially maybe it's more easy for the dotted is T over 28.

79
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:29,060
The solid black solid is two over 28 squared and the blue is two over 28 to the fourth.

80
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:40,920
We kept them. So if you want to change a. So the majority of you are correct here.

81
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,490
Right. We want that weight, that last weight to over 28 to the fourth.

82
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:53,610
So we say that the DLT window spans 28 days, but the toxicities are frequently not observed until the very end.

83
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,610
So that means we don't want to give a lot of weight to the data in our initial part of the DLT window.

84
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,860
We want to really give a lot of the weight to the data in that later part of the window.

85
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,630
And so you'll see with this curve here, right, the two over 22, the fourth that we're essentially giving weight of zero even up until two weeks.

86
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,130
Right. So what, you didn't have a DLT? I didn't expect you to have a DLT then.

87
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,080
So I don't want to give your data a lot of weight. Right.

88
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:32,340
If I gave that data a lot of weight, then I'd be more more willing to escalate the dose, because I believe that it's a safe dose.

89
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,830
Right. Even by 14 days. But I if I want to be conservative because I didn't expect DLT then.

90
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,830
Then I really only want to increase that weight as the DLT period goes on.

91
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,980
And so this curve, this bottom curve gives more weight to later days, which we would like.

92
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,280
Any questions? Okay.

93
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:17,580
About this one, true or false? Okay.

94
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,010
This is true that the weight should be non decreasing over time.

95
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:55,760
How about this one? Your boss. So this is false at the end of the deal period.

96
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,350
Everyone has to be given a weight of one right by the end of that period.

97
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,510
If they've had a deal to you beforehand, they get a weight of one whenever that deal occurs.

98
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,400
But for anyone who doesn't have a deal to by the end of that period, that's when they get the weight of one.

99
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,160
They didn't have a go here. We fully count their data.

100
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:22,610
All right, then talk a little bit about this other design walk or the escalation with overdose control.

101
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:31,979
And this essentially is just being very careful about not overdosing patients on the dose.

102
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,220
So we really want to make sure that the probability that we give them something that is too toxic is very, very low.

103
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,360
Okay. So it's just another way of thinking about how do we assign the next dose.

104
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,939
And so right we in the slides talks a little bit about parallels with that.

105
00:13:49,940 --> 00:14:03,019
And I, as you can remember with that and or calculating these probability intervals of whether we escalate, escalate or stay.

106
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,730
And in this walk design, we're calculating these intervals of.

107
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,750
Is this an overdose? Is it an under dose? Is it right close to the target dose?

108
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:22,490
Is it look like it's close to the end? And based on especially the probability of overdose, we can decide which treatment we want to give next.

109
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,559
So. Oh, let me say this before I go there.

110
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:39,980
Just to remind you again, my two years so that this GMAT is this pre-specified acceptable probability of overdose.

111
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,310
Okay. So that's going to be something that we probably the clinician decides on, right.

112
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:52,290
They have some idea about. Well, I really don't think it's acceptable to overdose.

113
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,470
In fact, the probability that we overdose a patient, I want that to be 20% or I want that to be 5%.

114
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,990
Okay. That's like this committee. So, given that was.

115
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,820
The GMAT is close to zero. What does that imply for the tolerance for overdose?

116
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,389
All right. 100%, yes. Right. So 0% probability of overdose.

117
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,260
We have very low tolerance, actually. No tolerance for overdose.

118
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:46,130
Okay. How about this one? This is thinking about the designs that we talked about for phase one, which.

119
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,180
Yes. Another 100% that three plus three that we initially talked about, that algorithmic design.

120
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:27,970
Right. Is the least likely to correctly identify the MTD and when we compare with these hybrid or model based designs.

121
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,310
Okay. How about this one? Comparing the A.I. versus the serum.

122
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,690
So my guess is we're going to see like two answers come through.

123
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,400
So B and C kind of split half and half.

124
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,079
So it definitely does depend on the prior model that you choose.

125
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:35,379
But once you choose that, right, then there's just too many possible iterations that it would it would just be totally

126
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,220
impractical to try to enumerate them all and to give that information to the physician.

127
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,810
So, I mean, both of these are correct, but you can imagine, right, once you do choose that model, you could potentially do this.

128
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:54,670
It would just be this ridiculous number of potential things that happen that it wouldn't be very helpful for a clinician.

129
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:02,709
They'd have tons of things to go through. I wouldn't be able to do it. So the serum works such that the data comes in, right?

130
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,240
And then as soon as the data comes in, the statistician is notified, they update the model,

131
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,620
then they send the dose assignment to the clinician before the next patient.

132
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,160
Right, right before the next patient needs to get on there. So it is in a real time dose assignment, trial design.

133
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:57,120
Okay. How about this one? Okay.

134
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,479
So suppose the most recent patient was assigned to dose level j.

135
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,900
The data from previous patients who are assigned to the next lowest level statistically impacts the next dose assignment.

136
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:16,030
So remember in the empty pi we only consider data from the people on dose j.

137
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:27,300
Okay, so this answer should be CRM only. The MTI is hybrid model design, but it's not sharing information across the dose levels.

138
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,020
So that's a very big difference between the MTI and the Sierra.

139
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,770
So to me, this is an example of probably a bad multiple choice question, right?

140
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:19,630
Because I would think that you could choose a couple of answers and then come to me and argue your way into the right answer.

141
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,210
Right. So let's see. So.

142
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:34,410
Right. For those of you who said the CRM only is because we did talk about how we in these models,

143
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,360
right we have this monitor tenacity and we can constrain the posteriors to get that in the MTBI,

144
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,110
we talked about how if we don't constrain the posteriors, we will not have this result.

145
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:56,160
However, when we constrain the posteriors, we require that we have this dose toxicity as dose increases, toxicity increases, right?

146
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,410
So if you constrain the priors of both of these, then this is true, right?

147
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,950
If you don't constrain the priors of either of these, then this would be false.

148
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:15,870
So there is lots of different answers here that there needs to either be more in this question or you could argue your way into your answer.

149
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,709
Most likely, yeah. Do you constrain the prior to the posterior?

150
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,120
Oh sorry. Posteriors constrain the posters on the CRM.

151
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,070
When you specify specific priors, that can automatically constrain the posteriors.

152
00:21:32,490 --> 00:22:04,580
Okay. How about this one? Okay.

153
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,059
So, um. Yeah, the last C is just like not should be an answer, right?

154
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,690
I wouldn't put that on a test. You, you'll get credit for that.

155
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,280
So yeah. Yes or no. So technically, yes, you can use integer values for your skeleton in a Sierra.

156
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,350
Now, is that a good idea? Probably not. Right.

157
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:32,389
We saw that. What we decide for the skeleton really defines this relationship between dose and toxicity.

158
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:40,780
And it sets up that how your doses are related to your initial probabilities of oh, so these are sorry.

159
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,160
Yeah. So the dose labels, right,

160
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:49,520
the dose labels can be these integers that's going to set up your relationship with the probability of toxicity that skeleton.

161
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:58,249
And so it doesn't usually make a lot of sense to have them be integers, but they could be the dose levels could be all right.

162
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,040
I think that was the end of it. Oh, yeah. So then I gave you this table that I said would be a good idea for you to fill in.

163
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:12,860
This is kind of like a nice little summary for you of the three plus three, which we talked about in lecture, the bias point,

164
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:23,600
which you did a fair amount of work on, on your first or second homework and the second homework and A.I. and CRM that we talked about in class.

165
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,550
And so I have posted some quick answers.

166
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:39,050
So this table now, if you're interested in comparing what you had written or had thoughts in your head to what I have written, it's there.

167
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,950
I suggest that again, you use this kind of as what to study from.

168
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,790
These are important.

169
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:56,839
I am interested in you also knowing some facts about the type CRM in that you are, but these kinds of things are helpful for your test.

170
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,990
So your test is in a couple of weeks. It's on phase one of these two.

171
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,459
It's multiple choice and short answer. And I'm not asking you to do any calculations or on any simulations during it.

172
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,480
However, you should know, like the higher level concepts and how to make decisions.

173
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,950
And if I gave you output, you could understand it and interpret it.

174
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,290
Okay. All right.

175
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:27,790
Any questions? Yeah. So we said generally, like when we run a phase one trial, we don't have enough participants to include any baseline covariance.

176
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,710
But in like a CRM, let's say we get half with the trial and we do have a decent number of covariates.

177
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,570
Could you then start incorporating baseline covariates into your CRM?

178
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,270
So. Right, since it's a model based design, you could potentially add more add cobras to it.

179
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,599
However, this year you chose your model based on your simulations.

180
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,679
So if you didn't think about that ahead of time,

181
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,050
you're going to not have any idea of the operating characteristics, which would make me feel uneasy in the trial.

182
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,670
So generally, we don't do that. You at least understand the marginal operating characteristics, right?

183
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:17,509
Yes. Because we're primarily in in phase one, really just interested in safety.

184
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:28,190
And usually the sample that we have is not necessarily that one that will we get into phase two or phase three.

185
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,890
We don't usually incorporate baseline covariance, but that's not to say that it couldn't necessarily be done.

186
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,950
I just don't usually see that. Any other questions?

187
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:48,100
Okay. So we're moving on to phase two.

188
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:55,060
So any remaining questions on phase one? All right.

189
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,350
So full month of talking about phase one.

190
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,770
And then you'll notice that we'll have a few lectures on phase two and then.

191
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,909
Not many on phase three. We kind of spend a lot of time at the beginning and then shorter time at the end on other phases.

192
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,260
And then a lot of your projects, there are two projects that are phase one, phase two,

193
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,629
but maybe two or three, but a lot of them are kind of more in the phase two, phase three space.

194
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,690
So you get more experience with those three projects.

195
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:26,969
All right.

196
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:36,720
So we're talking about phase two designs and today specifically and probably the little bit of Thursday, we're talking about sort of standard designs.

197
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,580
When I say standard, I usually mean one arm designs.

198
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,969
And so phase two designs can be one arm.

199
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,860
Meaning we're looking at that that dose level that we decided from phase one.

200
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,050
We're putting all the patients on the treatment.

201
00:26:53,070 --> 00:27:00,900
We'll talk about randomized designs or two arm designs, or they could be multi arm designs in a few lectures,

202
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,469
and that's where we could decide, okay, we don't want to just see the treatment.

203
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,830
We actually want to see have a concurrent control group as well.

204
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:16,590
And these one arm designs, we're assuming that we have pretty good data on what we would expect if they didn't get this treatment so that we have

205
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:24,120
good historical control data that we know what the outcome would be if they were on the standard of care or no treatment.

206
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:32,610
And we'll talk about how good that assumption may be or why we wouldn't why we would want to randomize or have a two arm trial as we move forward.

207
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:41,249
Okay. So today we're trying to understand how we can use Bayes rule to calculate success in the clinical trial drug development pipeline.

208
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,319
And you're going to have to do this for your homework, so it's good to come back to this lecture.

209
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,790
For that, we're going to identify the hypothesis of interest in these standard one arm designs and see how we

210
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:00,270
calculate the sample size for that and how that relates to the objective of the single arm phase two trial.

211
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,040
Well understand why a two stage phase two designs were developed.

212
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,820
So not to arm, but to phase or to stage.

213
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,999
Because what we're going to see is that we want the ability to potentially stop the trial early.

214
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,790
So I'll drew some patients will look at the data and then move on if it looks promising or we'll stop if it's not.

215
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:33,250
And then we'll specifically talk about the most commonly used standard phase two designs, which are called Simonds Mini Macs and Optimal Designs.

216
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,979
And if you look in the cancer oncology literature these days, most likely you'd see that these phase phase two designs used.

217
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:51,580
One of these Simon designs, either the minimax or optimal design or potentially another type of design that fits this and called inadmissible design.

218
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,790
So we'll talk about those today. Okay.

219
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:04,390
So I think I gave you as part of the reading a chapter from T.A. Dose E, this two dose e-book is totally available on our library.

220
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,830
And it's kind of what I think about as the clinical trials Bible.

221
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,709
It's used by statisticians and by clinicians. It's just really helpful and a nice resource.

222
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:21,010
If you do go into pharmaceutical companies or work on trials, I would definitely recommend buying this book.

223
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,270
It's a very good, very good reference.

224
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,320
And so she actually doesn't like the phase 1 to 3 terminology.

225
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:39,549
He argues that instead we should be referring to these as like what the purposes, because these phases kind of get muddied sometimes.

226
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:50,500
And so he says that we should be calling phase two trials middle development and that they're focused on both safety and activity.

227
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:58,030
So here in phase two, right, we have the dose that we're interested in from phase one that we think is safe.

228
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,010
Now we're going to put it into a few more patients. Right? We're going to have slightly bigger sample size.

229
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,969
We're still definitely interested in safety because now we've increased the sample size.

230
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:13,690
We can get more safety information and we're starting to look for evidence of activity or of efficacy.

231
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:22,180
However, we're not going to have a very we're not going to have a high amount of power to see a clinical difference.

232
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,910
Right. That's something that we will try to see in phase three.

233
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:35,080
But essentially, we're trying to we can potentially be fine tuning the dose or the feasibility of administering this treatment.

234
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:44,080
We're practicing for phase three and we're really just trying to figure out, is phase three a really big, expensive phase three study warranted?

235
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:50,649
Right. We want to weed out any treatments that are bad because they're either too toxic that we didn't realize in phase

236
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,760
one or they're really not going to be effective or efficacious and move on with some more promising treatments.

237
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:12,150
For most drugs. Often we go through this phase one, find the dose, move in into phase to make sure it's still safe and looks useful.

238
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,479
Right. Looks like there's a benefit and then go into phase three. However,

239
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,790
there are some times when phase two is skipped and so this table just tells us

240
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:27,590
when phase two should really occur versus when it could potentially be skipped.

241
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,350
So we want to use phase two and there are lots of different experimental therapies in the pipeline.

242
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:41,610
So if we're looking at a specific disease or specific target and there are a lot of potential options that are being developed,

243
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,370
we really want to make sure that we go through phase two as there were only taking those promising ones into phase three.

244
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:56,100
Of course, if we're pessimistic about this treatment actually being successful, we want to test it in phase two before we go forward to phase three.

245
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,749
For Phase two. We want a phase two trial to not take forever.

246
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:08,300
So phase three trials are very large. They usually take somewhere between three to 4 to 5 years.

247
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,190
Phase two trials, we want to be short, right? We want to get phase three.

248
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,790
And so we want to make sure that whatever outcome we're using in phase two can be measured in a short amount of time.

249
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,130
We'll talk about, I think later, we have a lecture about surrogate outcomes.

250
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,740
And so, for example, if in phase three, our ultimate outcome is actually survival, right?

251
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,820
This is often used in cancer trials. The time to death or time to event or not.

252
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,089
We don't usually use that same outcome in phase two because it just takes too long.

253
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,550
So we want to have a good outcome that is associated, that's related to that long term outcome.

254
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,969
But we can actually see in short and in a short amount of time.

255
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,940
So this is usually something in cancer that's like response.

256
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,440
Did did their tumor actually shrink or not?

257
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,780
Or it could be time to progression. So if their tumor progresses, right.

258
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,760
That's probably the faster it progresses, the faster they are to have that ultimate effect.

259
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,399
One is a highly prevalent disease and we have a big sample to choose from.

260
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,940
Right. It's not a big deal to go through these phases accordingly.

261
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:31,549
And because phase three trials are so resource intensive, if we want to make sure that we do our due diligence in phase two,

262
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:39,320
if the opportunity costs for a failed Phase three trial would be high, now we might think about skipping the phase two.

263
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:48,230
So either going from phase one into phase three or doing some sort of like phase one with some extended cohort going into phase three,

264
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,669
if there's not a lot of treatments for this disease.

265
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,510
Right, if we're trying to get this treatment to patients as soon as possible,

266
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:04,970
if we're really optimistic about the likelihood of success, maybe because similar treatment's been used in other diseases or something.

267
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,630
Right? We have or maybe we're testing we're using a treatment that's been used in adults and now testing it in kids.

268
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Right. We might think, oh, well, we have data that says this is going to be effective and it's not and it's safe.

269
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:29,370
So let's move into phase three. It's if we have the outcome for phase three and it can occur,

270
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:36,560
that outcome can also be used in phase two and as measured in a short amount of time and we feel pretty good about it.

271
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,209
Then we might not meet phase two in rare disease, sort of.

272
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:46,150
These phases are off the table, so we don't usually get the opportunity to go phase one, phase two, phase three,

273
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,740
because we have such a small number of patients, we can't we don't have enough patients to go through these phases.

274
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:58,540
They'd be the same patients. And so often in rare disease, there's not usually a phase one.

275
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:05,290
They take a high dose and they move forward and or there might be a very small dose finding and

276
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,660
a few patients moving on to either some sort of phase two or just straight to phase three.

277
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:25,709
So there are some reasons why phase two may be skipped and this is essentially why Peter Doherty says why are we calling them phase one,

278
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,640
phase two, phase three.

279
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,629
It seems like we have to march through these in order to get to the end, whereas really potentially sometimes we don't actually go through that.

280
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,320
This is the middle development and while it's often.

281
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,809
Done. It's not always required. Okay.

282
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,620
So here's the goal of phase two. So the goal is a phase two.

283
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,710
We're saying we have all these we have all these potential drugs.

284
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,660
Right. And there's likely just very few of them that are worthwhile.

285
00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:00,540
So w is worthwhile. That means that that drug is successful, it is efficacious and it's safe.

286
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,400
And this ws complement, right? W the C means that drug is not useful in any way.

287
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:14,780
And so we have this potential cloud of options and there's a lot of not worthwhile drugs out there.

288
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:23,700
So the goal of phase two is to say we want to keep that worthwhile drug in the in the mix and we want to eliminate a lot of the not worthwhile drugs.

289
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,240
But of course, we're willing to go forward with some of those not worthwhile drugs to hopefully be able to find that worthwhile one.

290
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,640
Okay. So we're essentially just trying to weed out a bunch of bad options in phase two.

291
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:47,960
So for example, this was some company they were showing all the drugs that they had.

292
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,360
And so phase zero here, you can imagine, is like animal research, like lab research.

293
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,280
They're showing right here all these drugs. We've done animal studies.

294
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,820
They looked promising. We took them in the humans in phase one.

295
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,860
And and actually, you know, a couple of these drugs just weren't safe.

296
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:13,100
Right. So usually we get often we get past phase one, sometimes we don't because the drug is too toxic.

297
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,700
But often we get past phase one. We find a drug to move forward with.

298
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:24,679
Right. So that happened majority of the time. Then we go into phase two with all these drugs and we weed out a ton of them because they don't

299
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,140
look either safe or most likely they didn't look like they were going to be efficacious.

300
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,360
And so we weeded out all these drugs. They're not actually useful.

301
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:46,520
So now we move into phase three with these five drugs and we test them and we see that only two of them are actually going

302
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:54,380
to phase for phase four as post-marketing is looking at the longer term and real world efficacy and safety of the drug.

303
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,600
So right, we go from phase one, only a few are dropped, phase two,

304
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,889
a lot are dropped and we go into phase three only with those outlooks most promising.

305
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,970
And then we find we have a better chance of finding those most promising treatments.

306
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,770
Okay. So how can we figure out this drug development pipeline in terms of numbers?

307
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:28,810
So what we're interested in is the we're going to let this PR underscore page two of W be the proportion of truly worthwhile drugs entering phase two.

308
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,270
Right. So this is the probability of truly worthwhile W drugs in phase two.

309
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,230
And we're going to let alpha and beta be our usual type one error and type two error.

310
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:49,580
And in the phase two space, we're going to let this s sub two indicate that a drug is selected in the phase two pipeline.

311
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,010
So it's like the drug was successful in phase two.

312
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:01,420
Right? And so now we want to be interested in what's the probability of a worthwhile drug.

313
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,270
The drug is actually worthwhile given we selected it or we thought it was worthwhile in phase two.

314
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,200
Right. So what's the probability that the drug is actually worthwhile?

315
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,280
You'd find that in phase three, given we selected it in phase two.

316
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,750
So we have this conditional probability. We know we can implement Bayes rule.

317
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:29,680
Right. So we switch the order of the condition and we multiply by the probability that it was truly worthwhile,

318
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,700
that it was truly worthwhile in phase two or entering phase two.

319
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,880
And then we have the sum of the options, right? It was either worthwhile or wasn't worthwhile as the denominator.

320
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:47,590
And so the probability that the treatment was selected in phase two given is given, it was worthwhile.

321
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,309
That's power, right? That's the same thing as power in this case.

322
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,880
And so we can just replace that with one minus beta.

323
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,370
And so you can see that's here right in the numerator and denominator.

324
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:06,080
And now the probability that we selected the drug in phase two, given it wasn't worthwhile.

325
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:12,380
That's our type one error, right? We made a bad choice there. And so we can replace that with Alpha.

326
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,819
So now we have this expression saying that the probability that the drug is truly worthwhile, given that was selected in phase two,

327
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:29,330
is dependent upon our type one error, our type two error, and the probability of having truly worthwhile drugs entering phase two.

328
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:39,589
So, for example, if 2% of our drugs entering phase two are truly worthwhile, so we have a ton of options, right?

329
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:50,900
And not many of those are useful. And we use our kind of standard benchmarks of 5% type one error and 20% type two error or 80% power.

330
00:40:51,320 --> 00:41:01,030
Then we can see that 25% percent of the drugs leaving phase two or going into phase three are truly worthwhile.

331
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,169
So, right, we're enriching the sample going into phase through phase three.

332
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,530
So we're saying coming into phase two, there are so many options and lots of them aren't actually worthwhile.

333
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,580
But moving into phase three, we have a much better chance, right.

334
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,090
Of of finding that worthwhile.

335
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,479
We're not wasting so many resources as we would have.

336
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:36,700
We just gone from phase one to phase three. Now, if 25% of our drugs entering phase three are truly worthwhile, right?

337
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:44,439
So if 2% were in phase two and now 25% are in phase three, now we have an 84% chance of the drugs leaving.

338
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,829
Phase three are truly worthwhile. Right.

339
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:53,649
So again, we're trying to enrich the enrich the sample,

340
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:59,979
which we're testing so that we really believe the findings that we have from our large phase three trials.

341
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,900
Right. The fact that it's not 100 is because we have type one error and type two error, right?

342
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:14,410
So we sometimes make bad choices. But going through this phase process says we have lower and lower probability of making bad

343
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:20,920
decisions because we're enriching the sample to find these truly worthwhile treatments.

344
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:31,270
This is going to come into if you look at your next homework, Walmart going four and four.

345
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:37,870
Yeah, right. I think this is part of I think I asked you to do some of this or maybe it's one of your homeworks coming up.

346
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:42,819
You're going to have to look back at the slides. So start the slide. It's either this homework or maybe it's the last homework.

347
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,830
I don't know. But it's going to come into play for calculations.

348
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:57,829
Okay. So just like I think I remember I showed you an example of phase one and that phase one B and I said, forget the B, right?

349
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,500
It's the same thing here in phase two.

350
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:06,920
When you read articles, you might see some of them might say like phase two A or phase two B, you can kind of ignore that letter.

351
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:14,899
The difference between A and B is really muddied. Phase two is supposed to be like any evidence of activity.

352
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,670
We kind of have lower thresholds.

353
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:25,100
There are almost always single arm and there are fewer patients, whereas phase two B are supposed to be have a higher threshold,

354
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,830
like you really want to see a high level of efficacy, but these letters aren't always used the right way.

355
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,050
People kind of think of them differently. And so you might see these letters occur, but they're not really that important, right?

356
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:46,460
Like you, you just want to think about all of this is under the the umbrella of phase two designs.

357
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,860
If you think about this differentiation, by the way that I put it here,

358
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,180
we're really talking about phase two studies today and we'll talk about phase two B later.

359
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,890
But like I said, don't worry about that. I'm not going to ask you to distinguish between A and B studies.

360
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:10,160
Okay. So we have a single arm study, meaning we take this recommended phase two dose or a maximum tolerated dose from phase one.

361
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,820
And that's what we're going to put all of our patients on in phase two.

362
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:23,810
So we're going to enroll all of our patients to this new therapy most of the time in phase two studies, particularly in cancer, our outcome is binary.

363
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,290
So it's. Did you respond to this treatment, yes or no? Right.

364
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,630
And our definition of response might differ depending upon what what the drug is.

365
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:41,450
But we'll just think about you responded yes or no. So this could be like tumor shrinkage of some amount.

366
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:49,610
It could be clinical improvement of symptoms that maybe we have like a baseline and a post baseline survey and we see the difference.

367
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:57,080
Whatever, whatever it is in phase two, it shouldn't take that long. So this should be an endpoint that's measured within a year most of the time,

368
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:04,490
so that this trial isn't going to take forever and we can move into phase three if that's what the the results say.

369
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:14,240
Okay. So we're going to focus on when we have a binary outcome and we're going to say P zero is the historical control rate of response.

370
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,459
So that is, given that these patients didn't get this new treatment right,

371
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,900
given that they got either the standard of care or no treatment, what is their response?

372
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:31,339
What's the probability response that we would expect that we're going to call P zero and then P one if we set up

373
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,910
our hypothesis is what kind of response do we need to see to say that this treatment is effective or efficacious?

374
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,349
I keep changing.

375
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:50,659
So technically we're looking for efficacy or efficacious drugs when we're comparing it to like a placebo or even potentially standard of care.

376
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:57,110
But once you compare active drugs, you start talking about effectiveness or how effective it is.

377
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:06,780
So subtle difference that again, I don't expect you to think of right now, but we're generally thinking about efficacy in these trials.

378
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:19,890
Okay. So our our null hypothesis is going to be that the probability of response is equal to some historical rate or expected without the treatment.

379
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:25,350
And our alternative hypothesis is that we actually see this better response from our new treatment.

380
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,899
Right. And so we're going to have to get the details for not from the literature,

381
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,450
from a clinician, their experience from past trials, from natural history studies.

382
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:44,580
And we want to get the information for P one from the clinician who says, I would only use this treatment, not just not just that clinician, right?

383
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,420
Any clinician, right. You want a broad number of investigators who say,

384
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:57,540
I would only use this treatment if it's going to result in like 15% better response rate or 10% or 20%.

385
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,480
And that's usually based on how many other possible treatments are there and how bad this disease is.

386
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,940
Okay. So a reminder, right? You all know this this table for type one and type two, error and power.

387
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:21,139
But just as a reminder, what essentially we're doing here in a phase two study is we're using a one sided hypothesis test.

388
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:30,980
We only want to move forward if we find that the response rate is greater than the in the normal response rate.

389
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:37,430
Right. And so we need to estimate this response rate that we actually see.

390
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:44,480
We observe, right. We estimate that with how many responses we see out of all the patients in the trial on that treatment.

391
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,700
So this big R is going to be the number of responses that we see or observe in our trial.

392
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:58,280
So he rejects the null is the number of responses we see out of all the patients is greater than some critical value.

393
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,120
Right that we set are over the number of patients in there.

394
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,899
So we have to figure out, well, what is this critical value?

395
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:11,600
Right. And obviously it's going to depend on what is our P, what is our type one error, what is our type two error?

396
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,840
So we got to figure out how many patients we actually require.

397
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,560
So we're going to even though we're working with binary outcomes, we know that in large samples, right?

398
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,690
Binary outcomes actually have a normal distribution.

399
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:31,670
So we'll take the log large numbers here and we'll think about the fact that our proportions are going to be normally distributed just for ease.

400
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:43,700
So consider that our observed proportion under the normal has some normal distribution with mean permanent and variance sigma not squared,

401
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:55,760
and our proportion under the alternative hypothesis has some normal distribution with mean p one and variance sigma one squared.

402
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:03,340
So here we just have the curves under the alternative, right?

403
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,930
It's a higher proportion than under the null.

404
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:13,969
And then we're trying to figure out where is this like critical value that we would make a decision that we actually live under the alternative?

405
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:21,680
Right. We're more likely to be under the alternative. So we could reject the null or that there's a greater area under the null.

406
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:33,649
And so we can't reject that null. So if we're interested in the difference between P one minus P odds, we can actually rewrite this as such, right?

407
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,360
We're essentially interested in like what's the areas under these curves?

408
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,020
And that's going to be depend on some factor of the standard deviation, right?

409
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:50,990
We can actually rewrite that in terms of some constant times, the standard deviation.

410
00:49:51,620 --> 00:50:02,060
Now, actually, I don't think this that's all that helpful, but you can go back actually if you picture, right, these normal curves.

411
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,209
We know that these depend these these areas under here under these curves,

412
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:14,360
given the setup of our null and alternative hypothesis, are actually related to the type one and type two error.

413
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,989
Right. So you learn this when you learned hypothesis testing that this area under the curve, right?

414
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:31,520
This is our type two error. We've made a mistake in deciding that we believe the alternative is correct when actually the null is true.

415
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:41,120
Right. Are this type one error where we made a mistake of not finding the difference or not believing in the that the alternative is true.

416
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,100
Right. And so we can actually rewrite this addition.

417
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:56,890
The constants has to do with the critical value, the critical z value of the power or the type two error.

418
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,390
The power. Sorry, the power or the type one error.

419
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:08,719
And so all what this comes down to is taking if we take the difference between P one and P, not right,

420
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:17,990
we can rewrite this in terms of our critical value or critical Z value for type one error error, the critical Z value from the type two error.

421
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:24,079
And we have those standard deviations which given a binary variable, right?

422
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:31,879
We know that the standard deviation is P over one minus P times one minus P over N, right.

423
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,870
So this is just given the distribution, we know the the standard deviation.

424
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:45,050
So we have that this difference is approximately equal to these critical values times the standard deviation.

425
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:53,870
And if we solve for n right you'd have to do some algebra here so we get that n is looks like this formula.

426
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:59,540
There should only be one plus here, right? That only looks like this formula here.

427
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:12,830
So if we want to figure out what sample size do we need for deciding if our observed response rate is greater than our historical control rate?

428
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,779
Right, then we need to know, well,

429
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:21,890
what's the what kind of response rate our expecting to see what response rate would we see under the historical control?

430
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,620
What's our type one error and what's our type two error?

431
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,430
So we make those guesses before the trial starts and then we can say, Okay, so now you need nine patients.

432
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,979
Okay. So I can write this in. Ah, right.

433
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,410
Such that if I ask the clinician. Okay, so you tell me, right, we're going to go into phase two.

434
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:50,999
You tell me what is the response rate you expect if they didn't get this treatment right on placebo or on the standard of care and they say,

435
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,630
oh, it's say, for example, 30%.

436
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:01,610
Right. And then you say, okay, now, how much better does this treatment have to be for you to want to move forward with it?

437
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:09,689
And they say, okay, well, p one, I guess they won't say P one, but they say, okay, well, I want to see that it's like 45%, right?

438
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:18,880
So from 30 to 45%. And then usually they say let's consider 5% type one error and 20% type two error.

439
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:24,360
80% power. So I could put those values in my function that I just created.

440
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:29,820
Right. And get information about now what the end should be for finding that difference.

441
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:41,180
So for example, right, I gave the example where we had 30%, 45, let's say it was 50%.

442
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:49,709
Right, 30% versus 50%. I need 35 individuals on this treatment to see that there's a difference.

443
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,430
Right. That their response rate is not 35%.

444
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:59,759
That's closer to the alternative. So Pinot is along the rows down here.

445
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,340
So this would be like what our expected probability of responses on placebo or onset of care.

446
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:12,690
And this is what we're hoping to see under the alternative or the fact that this treatment is efficacious.

447
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,079
And so you can see the number of individuals required.

448
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:22,799
And so if we look here, 10 to 20%, 20 to 30%, 30 to 40%, 40 to 50%.

449
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,240
Right. These numbers get pretty large. And usually phase two trials.

450
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:38,989
The it really it really depends. But often these are still relatively small trials that maybe have 100 patients but could have could have 20.

451
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:42,660
You could have 40, not any more than that.

452
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:52,530
And so I don't even put any lower comparisons like 10% versus 15% or 20% versus 25, because it's just not feasible to do a phase two trial.

453
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:59,309
It's going to take too long usually to accrue those patients. And you're getting too small of a difference that it's usually not worthwhile

454
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,330
to go forward with that new treatment unless there's really no other option,

455
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:15,679
in which case you might not be doing a phase two trial. You can actually see that kind of like this rule of thumb pops out that NW is proportional

456
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:24,500
to the difference in the to proportions of interests one over the different squared.

457
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,760
It's kind of like a a quick check.

458
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:36,020
Okay. So this formula right as we saw, was based on normally distributed data.

459
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:42,050
And we know that via the law of large numbers, this is true for binary outcomes.

460
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:47,090
However, if you're actually going to be ending up in that small space where you only need like 15,

461
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,600
20 people, you probably want to do an exact calculation.

462
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,460
And so exact sample size calculations do exist using the exact binomial distribution, and they'll differ a little bit, right?

463
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,500
They'll be similar, but they might be increased by a few participants.

464
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:17,600
And so this is a sort of a foray into sample size, but we're going to spend a lot longer talking about sample size in the phase three space.

465
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,680
But this is just like a little intro to where that sample size comes from.

466
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,540
Okay. So then the question is right, we can figure out the sample size, the total end required,

467
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,540
but how do we figure out what that critical value of are is such that we want to

468
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,219
compare big R the number of responses we get in the trial to this critical value,

469
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:48,230
this little R to say if we don't get, say, this critical value of little RS in our trial, then we don't move forward.

470
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:54,589
Right. We're comparing our number of responses to some critical value of responses required to say we have

471
00:56:54,590 --> 00:57:00,980
good probability that our treatment looks more efficacious than that if we didn't have this treatment.

472
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:09,470
Right. So we want to reject our null if our observed proportion of responses is greater than some critical value proportion.

473
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:21,590
And so right. We can think about say that we have 20% response under the normal distribution or under standard of care or placebo.

474
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:31,760
And we want to move forward. If our treatment is 50% response rate better, right, or 35%, don't we need 50 total patients?

475
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,550
So we expect to put 50 patients on our on our phase two trial.

476
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:49,339
And then now let's see what the probability of declaring success is under the null and alternative hypothesis.

477
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:59,840
Right? So here we have under the null hypothesis, what's the probability that we that our number of responses is greater than this critical value?

478
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,590
If the true rate of response is 20%,

479
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:12,170
versus what's the probability that our number of responses is greater than this critical rate if the true response rate is 35%?

480
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:21,890
So if we have a critical value of ten, right, what's the probability that we actually see 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, right.

481
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,800
Or more responses. If there's only a 20% response rate, it's there's only 42%.

482
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,600
Right. We're unlikely.

483
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:38,660
Relatively unlikely, but still a big amount of probability that we're going to see that ten responses are more than ten responses.

484
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:46,850
What's the probability that we see at least ten responses if the true response rate is 35% is really high?

485
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:54,410
Right. We're definitely going to see we're almost definitely going to see more than ten responses if the true response rate is 35%.

486
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,570
Now let's go down. Okay. So, for example, let's look at the form 14.

487
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,830
What's the probability that in our trial we observe more than 14 responses?

488
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,100
If the true probability response is 20%, it's low.

489
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:17,890
It's only 6%. Only 6% of the time when we actually observe 15 or more responses if the true response rate is 20%.

490
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:27,140
What's the probability that we observe 15 or more responses if the true response rate is 35%?

491
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:33,080
Well, it's 81%, right? It's pretty high. You're most likely going to see that many responses given that.

492
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,450
So what we're trying to do here is we're trying to pick this, ah, to maintain our type one and our type two.

493
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:50,270
Right. We're trying to pick this are such that this probability rate, the probability that we decide that we have a efficacious treatment.

494
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,440
Right, that we reject the null under the null is low.

495
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:06,450
Versus the probability that we have a lot of responses given that there is this higher response rate is high rate.

496
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:16,440
So ideally we want to find this little r this critical value where our first column or the second column has some level close to 5%,

497
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:25,080
the type one error rate. And our second column has some value close to 80% or our power or one minus our type two error.

498
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:31,920
So we're probably going to choose, right? We're going to choose either 14 or 15 here.

499
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:44,370
We want to be close to 5% and 80% so that we know that it's if we see like 15 or more or 16 or more responses.

500
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:50,340
Right. That's really unlikely under the normal distribution, under the fact that the really low response rate.

501
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:57,510
But it's pretty highly likely that we would see that given that we have the higher response rate under the alternative.

502
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:06,210
Now you'll notice that if we have actually 50 participants and we see, for example,

503
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:12,780
15 or 16 responses, this confidence interval is actually between 19% and 44%.

504
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:19,209
So again, like we saw with the three plus three design, we have really wide confidence intervals.

505
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:25,680
They're not as wide as the three plus three design. Right. We are 50 people here are not like six, but they're still really wide.

506
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:32,550
So we're still going to make that decision is in phase two, right? We're still going to take not worthwhile treatments in the phase three.

507
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,060
However, we're doing much better than we did in phase one. Okay.

508
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:48,370
I'm actually going to skip this example because it's not all that helpful.

509
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,990
It's a bad example of a phase two trial. So I'm not going to show you that.

510
01:01:53,290 --> 01:02:01,269
But what I'm going to move on to is the standard design which people first came up with and said, okay,

511
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:07,390
let's put everybody on this in this treatment and then let's decide if they've seen enough responses.

512
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,610
But then people started saying, Hey, based on probability, if I have already got,

513
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:19,839
say, like, you know, 15 people on the trial and I haven't seen any responses,

514
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,710
it's probably unlikely that I'm going to get to see the number of responses that I need with the rest of the people who are crude.

515
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:33,100
Right. And so maybe I can start making decisions earlier that this trial is not useful to continue.

516
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:38,890
And so it's possible to say, we need this.

517
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:45,790
We need to look at the data and maybe we should stock the data for futility, meaning that we stop because it's not going to be effective.

518
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,429
Right. We're not going to see that this treatment is efficacious.

519
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:54,399
We're going to stop for the fact that we would waste people if we went all the way through

520
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,050
everybody on the sample size and then made a decision that this wasn't a useful treatment.

521
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:09,389
So this interim analysis or this stopping and looking at the data is to say, hey,

522
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:12,870
if we already have a really good probability that we're not going to find something,

523
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:17,430
we might as well stop now and not use people and money to make that decision.

524
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:28,820
So for example, right, say that we go back to where we're really looking for a 35% response rate.

525
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,750
Right? That's our response rate under the alternative.

526
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:37,250
And that's what we want to find if we have observed zero responses after the first patient enrolled.

527
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,489
Right. Well, that's highly likely. Right. Is still low response rate.

528
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,340
It's unlikely that the first patient has a hazard response.

529
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:50,380
So we wouldn't want to stop then after two people enroll if we have zero responses, well, it's still pretty likely, right?

530
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:53,090
42% of the time we wouldn't see any responses.

531
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:01,630
But as we go on, right after seven patients, if we still haven't seen any responses, that's pretty unlikely, right?

532
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:08,270
Even with a 35% response rate, only 5% of the time will be of zero out of seven responses.

533
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,169
And so at this point, you might say this is not useful, right?

534
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:16,580
Here's my type one error. I'm okay with making a bad decision 5% of the time.

535
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:21,079
But because this is so unlikely, I want to stop this trial.

536
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,310
I don't want to use any more patients. I don't want to use any more money.

537
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,530
So this created the idea of this two stage design.

538
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:38,670
So again, right, tiptoeing off of somebody else's idea, oh, this one stage, this one kind of standard,

539
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,260
just put everybody on the treatment and make a decision at the end and said, let's make it earlier.

540
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:52,650
Right. And so he in 1961 developed the skin design or the two stage design that said, let's enroll some initial cohort of patients.

541
01:04:53,040 --> 01:05:01,410
Let's see how many responses we have. And based on that, we can decide either to go for the full sample size or we can stop the trial.

542
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:13,680
He was very specific actually in his initially and his first cohort of patients where he said you should make a decision after 14 patients.

543
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,480
And if you haven't seen any responses after 14 patients, you stop the trial.

544
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,110
If you've seen at least one response, you can go on.

545
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:33,690
And the reason why he was so specific is because he was using he was basing this on a 20% response rate actually being impressive.

546
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:41,340
And this was when chemotherapy started to being started being tested for cancer.

547
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,960
And so he said, actually, it's really great if we see a 20% response rate.

548
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,530
And so we want to move forward.

549
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,150
If we've seen any responses out of 14, but if we've seen zero, let's stop.

550
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:02,040
Now, the jeans design is actually a cohort of seven,

551
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:10,049
and that's because we expect at least 35% education that we want to see at least

552
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,340
35% response rate to move forward because the chemotherapies have gotten better.

553
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,180
And in fact, we don't actually use this question much often, to be honest.

554
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,010
We'll use what we see the silence either minimax or optimal or admissible designs,

555
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,970
because we have a little bit more flexibility in what this cohort number is.

556
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:41,030
So for example, if we did a one stage trial and we have these we have that sample size of 50 because we're trying to find

557
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:49,170
the difference between 20 and 35% response rates that we and we found that our critical R value was 14.

558
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:52,250
So we want to see at least 15 or more responses.

559
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,590
We can calculate our type one error that's like 6.1%.

560
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:01,250
Right? It goes back to this table. Here.

561
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:09,680
And our type two error or power we could calculate is 81%.

562
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,520
Now if instead we use a modified guidance design.

563
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:22,660
Right. So now we're going to say after the first seven patients.

564
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:29,879
Is that what I use? Yeah, after. After the first seven patients.

565
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:36,150
If there are any responses, we're going to move on. And if they're not, then we're going to stop.

566
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,610
Right now, we have to recount.

567
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:43,740
We have to figure out what's the new calculation for the type one error rate in our calculation for type one error says,

568
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:54,149
well, we didn't stop write this R1 depending on what R1 equals R1 is the number of responses.

569
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,220
Right. We require one or more in the first stage.

570
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:04,020
What is that versus how many total responses this big R is at the end of the trial and that has to be greater than this critical level.

571
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:10,260
And so this says, well, what's the probability that this R1 is?

572
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:24,200
Any number, right? Zero one, two, three, four, whatever, right up to seven times is probability that we decided that we reached this critical value.

573
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,480
And so we can now calculate our type one error and power of our DNA and design.

574
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,020
Right. Again, same setup. We have 50 patients.

575
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:40,340
We need 14 total responses or more than 14 responses at the end to say that this treatment looks worthwhile.

576
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:46,070
But now we're able to stop after seven patients if we haven't seen any responses.

577
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:54,590
So now if I calculate my type one error, I get 5.7% and my power is 78.5%.

578
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:59,540
So if I compare these right my one stage, everybody,

579
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:05,990
I don't make a decision until the end of 50 or I get to make a potential stop at seven patients or I move on.

580
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:10,340
Right. I can calculate my type one error, my power.

581
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:14,300
I can also calculate the probability of ending early. Obviously, I can't end early.

582
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:23,810
I don't have that stage right, but I can end early about 25, 21% of the time with the modified gives design, it's not very much right.

583
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:30,770
We're actually not ending early very much. However, if it's truly, truly, really bad, it will hopefully end early.

584
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:37,969
And because we end early 20% of the time, 21% of the time, we have a smaller expected overall sample size.

585
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:44,780
Right? It's 20%, 21% of time it's seven, whereas 80% of the time it's 50.

586
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,020
Right? So our sample size, expected sample size is slower.

587
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:57,379
So there's this tradeoff, right? If we want to go with the Gillan's design, we could potentially be enrolling less patients, right?

588
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:02,150
On average, reenroll nine less patients. In reality, we either enroll seven or 50.

589
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:16,190
Right? But there's this slight loss of power that we might not make the right choice to move on if the treatment is really affected.

590
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,070
Right. We might do that a little bit less than if we did the one stage design.

591
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,670
But as you can see. Right, the the the probability of actually stopping early is super low.

592
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,330
So then the next statistician comes along and says, well, we should change these rules.

593
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:41,580
We could actually make these rules stricter or less strict so that we can stop more often.

594
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:47,640
Right. Or we could stop less often. And depending upon what we might want to do, that depending upon the setting.

595
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,019
And so, again, like tiptoeing over what somebody else had done, we say, well,

596
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:57,059
let's modify the Keynes design and actually be able to choose different RS,

597
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:01,620
our ones and ones, the cohort size and the number of responses seen in that,

598
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:07,260
instead of just being more than none and seven or eight or more than nine and 14,

599
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:14,250
let's change those things and see how that affects the expected sample size and the probability of terminating early.

600
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:25,050
And so that's exactly what Simon did, which we'll see because they said, well, you're not stopping early a lot of the time.

601
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:33,680
And it's not like you're getting really great confidence intervals around these treatments.

602
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,520
And so we could potentially make some different decisions.

603
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:43,890
And in fact, if the drug has a true response rate of 5%,

604
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:53,490
there's still a 51% chance of obtaining at least one response in those first 14 patients and going to the second stage of accrual.

605
01:11:53,520 --> 01:12:00,300
Right. So his his decision rules are very lax.

606
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:05,760
Right. Like, even if this treatment seems really bad, we might still go into the second stage.

607
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:15,600
And so we can potentially modify these decision rules so that we're more often going to make a better decision either to stop or to move on.

608
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:25,200
Okay. So this is some code for looking at operating characteristics of a two stage trial in R.

609
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:34,410
And so the function here requires the number of responses that you need to see in phase in the stage one to move on to stage two.

610
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,820
So that's R one and the number of participants, right?

611
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:45,570
That cohort and the stage one that you need to see. So you see r one responses out of N1 individuals to move on to stage two.

612
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:54,120
And this R is the total number of responses you need in the full trial, and the PN is the total number of individuals in the full trial.

613
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:01,080
Okay. So it's not R1, N1, R2, N2, it's R1, N1, which are our subset, right?

614
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:10,080
Are nested within are an N and then P is our probability of response.

615
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:26,900
So for example, here this is saying what if we require two more than two out of ten responses in the first stage and overall,

616
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,250
we still require a 14 out of 50, right.

617
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:35,120
If the true response rate is 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,

618
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:43,370
40% or 45% is operating characteristics that we're interested in for phase two are how often are we going to end the trial?

619
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:47,330
Early, right? What's the probability that we stop after and learn patients?

620
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,110
What's the probability that we don't reject the null hypothesis?

621
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:54,110
What's the probability that we do reject the null hypothesis?

622
01:13:54,430 --> 01:14:00,800
What's the average sample size? So that's obviously highly dependent upon how often we stop, right?

623
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:11,809
So you can see that the more often we stop early, the lower the the expected sample size, because we're often saying we didn't reach this.

624
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:23,880
Right. And so we stopped the trial early. Now what if instead of being two out of ten?

625
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:30,380
So again, we're keeping this 40, not a 50 split instead of requiring two out of ten responses in the first stage,

626
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:33,640
what if we say, well, we want to see four out of 20, right?

627
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:37,410
Same, same proportion. Right.

628
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:42,110
20% response rate. However, requiring more individuals.

629
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:48,830
Right to make that decision. So now it happens. You can see that we actually stop less, right?

630
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:52,819
We stop less proportions and times.

631
01:14:52,820 --> 01:15:02,630
If you compare this column to this one and our expected number of individuals is higher because we're stopping less.

632
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,870
Right. But you can see that, right?

633
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,680
And you can see that these change such that we go from like 28% to 31%.

634
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,880
Right. This whole column gets the probability that we don't reject the all gets higher

635
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:23,270
and the probability that we do reject the null also gets higher as we move down.

636
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:30,870
Now it says, what if we go instead of to from 2 to 10 or 4 to 20?

637
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:37,680
What if we actually require seven of 30? Right. So now we're going to not even make our decision until after the first 30 patients.

638
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:43,260
Now, how does that resolve? Right. So now we're actually stopping earlier more.

639
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:50,880
Right. Although our expected average enrolled is higher because we're not making that decision until 30 patients.

640
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:57,240
Right. But the probability that we reject our null is getting really high.

641
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:02,130
Right. Much higher with higher probabilities of response.

642
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:10,820
And the probability that we don't reject our normal rate gets slightly higher from ops at the end.

643
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:22,049
With high probability of response. So you can see, right, we could play around with lots of different choices and figure out what do we actually like?

644
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:26,280
What do we expect is the true probability of response? What do we actually want to see?

645
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:30,450
Do we want to stop early most of the time? Do we want to make that decision really often?

646
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,600
How does that affect the probability, the choice that we make at the end?

647
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:40,620
And so you could do this trial and error over and over and over again to decide what's R one and what's N1 and what's our an end.

648
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,220
And this whole process was formalized by Richard Simon.

649
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:55,379
So Richard Simon said, Hey, we can do this in a an algorithmic way to try to figure out what are one and one are an

650
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:01,440
end should be so that we can satisfy Alpha and our type one error and our type two error.

651
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,860
Now, because this is there isn't just one route.

652
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:14,220
So there's lots of actually options that we could choose depending upon which operating characteristic we're trying to maximize or minimize.

653
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:21,840
And so there are lots of sets of are one and one are an end that lead to alpha and one minus beta.

654
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:26,790
And so the idea is how do we figure out which one we want to use and what's that what's

655
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,350
the operating characteristic that we're really trying to hone in on by choosing us?

656
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:36,870
So we'll start next time. By going over these Simon designs,

657
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:40,739
we're going to talk about the minimax design and optimal design and figure out

658
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:44,639
what's the difference between those and how those choose are one and one are.

659
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:52,170
And so we'll start on the slide 40 next time and then we'll move on to the next.

660
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:01,170
Oh, yeah. So we'll finish the slide and we'll we'll talk about some examples next time.

661
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:36,850
All right. So Thursday in San Francisco, what do you think this that something has happened?

662
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,620
I didn't know what I was like.

663
01:18:42,020 --> 01:19:07,920
Oh, so you don't have to do that, because I still think that's what I do best goes into extremes.

664
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:56,600
But I think what's interesting here is that I was like, oh, no, no, she was you know, she was going to say, no, no, no.

665
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:18,840
He should be allowed to make sure.

666
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,770
Is there anything in your. No, it's not.

667
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:41,460
Okay. What do you read from here? Well, you get a.

668
01:20:47,440 --> 01:21:08,030
So much sleep last night and still tired. Well.

669
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:23,490
Oh. Have you gone too far?

670
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,490
Randy Moore I don't. I didn't know what I mean.

671
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:35,470
Just ask me out. You know, we are actually going out there on Saturday.

672
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:39,800
Oh, so you are going to do something like that? Yes. Oh.

673
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:46,200
Uh oh.

674
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,610
Okay. Yeah. And. Yeah.

675
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:53,130
And then. Oh, right. Okay. So are you guys.

676
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:57,750
I'm just going over. See, I guess we're going to make dinner.

677
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:02,220
Oh, but I don't know if that's my.

678
01:22:02,670 --> 01:24:52,340
Yeah. What?
