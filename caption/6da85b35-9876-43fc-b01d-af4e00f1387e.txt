1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,310
Welcome, everyone. It is my pleasure to introduce today's speaker, Dr. Alexis Handel.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,460
Dr. Handel joined the Department of Epidemiology in 2019 as an associate professor.

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:30,930
Her areas of expertise include occupational and environmental epidemiology, reproductive epidemiology, social epidemiology and global health.

4
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:39,340
Her work examines the impact of large scale agricultural production on the health of workers and surrounding communities,

5
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,770
with a particular focus on the health of female workers and pregnant workers and their families.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,380
Over the past two decades,

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:55,870
Dr. Handle has worked in Ecuador studying the impact of export led flower production on maternal and child health and child development.

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,500
She currently leads and IHS funded birth cohort study examining the impact of fungicide,

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,800
oil exposure and other critical social stressors associated with the presence of the flower industry on pregnancy and subsequent infant health.

10
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,570
Together with Dr. Lizbeth Iglesias. RIOS She is also leading the Michigan Farmworker Project,

11
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,690
which is a community based participatory research program that examines the complex working and

12
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,209
living conditions of farm workers and their families in Michigan and the impact on farmworker,

13
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,170
health and well-being. Before I turn it over to Dr. Handel, I'd just like to remind those of you joining virtually.

14
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,430
So please put your questions in the Q&A and we will get to them after the talk.

15
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,620
All right, Alexis. Great.

16
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,400
Thank you so much for that nice introduction, Dr. Needham.

17
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,240
Before I start, I just want to apologize that I can't be there in person.

18
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:05,299
I had a situation that precluded my attendance, so I appreciate the flexibility to be able to present over Zoom.

19
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:12,680
And so thank you for those of you who are in person and all of you who are on Zoom for attending today.

20
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:22,260
So today I'm going to be talking about the Michigan Farm Worker Project and really going into kind of the development of

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,730
this project and some of the initial implementation and initial results that we have from the work that we've done so far.

22
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,370
Yeah. There we go.

23
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:49,190
All right. Okay. So. I want to first talk about this kind of general concept of work as a structural determinant of health.

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:57,710
And because this is really kind of what serves as the basis for the the work that we're doing with the Michigan Farmworker project.

25
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:08,150
So in general, when we look at research, employment, generally speaking, has a net benefit to the family and to and to workers.

26
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,410
So typically being employed means increased income.

27
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,750
It means more social support, you know, more access to social and health services, health care.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,190
And so, generally speaking, this is this is health benefiting.

29
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,270
And, you know, we see that in epidemiology. We talk about the healthy worker effect, for example, with some of our our research.

30
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,810
And so that is important to think about.

31
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:43,760
However, the experiences, the employment experiences and occupational experiences are not uniformly advantages for different occupational work groups.

32
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:52,130
And so there may be toxic exposures that certain work working populations face more than others.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,830
It could be chemical exposures. It could be psychosocial stressors.

34
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,730
There can be work overload, heavy demands, and very low control and low worker autonomy,

35
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,820
negative relationships with supervisors or with coworkers and even, you know, social withdrawal from communities or from family.

36
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,930
And so when we're thinking about work as a structural determinant of health,

37
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:24,380
we have to consider this differential and unequal impact of these occupational experiences and the broader labor structure

38
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,320
and how that impacts different worker populations in different ways in terms of their health within this broader context.

39
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:44,660
And so with with that background, I want to focus on the concepts of precarious work and labor exploitation specifically.

40
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,469
As you know, we're talking about work as a structural determinant of health.

41
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,520
And I will talk about this in the context of farmworkers in the United States.

42
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,299
So over the last 40 years or so, the impact of globalization,

43
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,410
neoliberal policies and free market capitalism have resulted in an increase in more flexible forms of employment,

44
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,710
including nonstandard employment that is typically characterized by high levels of job

45
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,510
insecurity and an overall erosion of workers working working conditions and benefits.

46
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,640
So, you know, more temporal jobs not having the ability to unionize, for example.

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,890
So farmworkers are a special workforce that has been historically defined by precarity and by labor exploitation,

48
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,370
which I'll address in a minute in terms of the historical aspect.

49
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:43,339
But these concepts have not necessarily been integrated in public health research and specifically in occupational epidemiology research as important

50
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:51,499
determinants of health as as more of the mainstream research that we see with farmworkers typically has focused on more individual level exposures,

51
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,049
specific exposures like injuries or exposure to toxic chemicals without really

52
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,970
understanding the complexity of of the labor structure and how that impacts worker health.

53
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,059
So, you know, in this conceptual model that we developed,

54
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,120
we represent precarity and labor exploitation as part of this continuum of working and social conditions

55
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,110
with labor trafficking or forced labor labor as really the most extreme form of exploitation.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,670
And in this continuum, we have this range of exposures which can all impact the health of workers and,

57
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,479
you know, may or may not entail labor violations.

58
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,900
And this is important to note, and I'll touch on this a little bit more in a minute.

59
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,940
For farmworkers, the conditions faced in their workplace are not necessarily violations,

60
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:47,270
labor violations or outside of the legal bounds, which makes it harder to assess labor exploitation in that way.

61
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,159
And so we proposed this public health approach and emphasized that the exploitative labor

62
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,960
practices really should be defined based on the harmful use of the workers vulnerability,

63
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,719
whether it's social, economic, legal, legal or physical vulnerability to obtain some benefit,

64
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,840
and where the consent of the worker under these exploitative conditions is irrelevant.

65
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,760
So this emphasis on the harmful use of an individual is important when we're talking about exploitation, because again,

66
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:29,000
the legal definitions and the processes that are available to enforce or to prosecute cases involving exploitation are often very complex,

67
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,520
they're often quite narrow, and cases of exploitation can take many years.

68
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,340
So where we're thinking about this beyond just that, that very narrow legal sense.

69
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,500
So we want to focus on. On precarious employment practices.

70
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:53,570
Specifically in this context, because these are often red flags for potential exploitative labor and both precarious employment.

71
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,990
And this idea of labor exploitation really could impact the health inequities that are faced by farm workers.

72
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,380
So now, you know, given that kind of that contextual background, I want to focus on, you know, the context of farmworkers in the United States.

73
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,850
So the U.S. Department of Labor conducts the National Agricultural Workers Survey,

74
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,780
which is an employment based random sample survey of hired crop workers.

75
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,630
And based on their most recent report,

76
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:35,150
these are just some of the facts about the were cultural workers in in the U.S. so the majority are from Mexico and

77
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:44,540
85% of those who are foreign born actually have been in the U.S. for at least ten years and 70% more than 15 years.

78
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,380
So that shows that these workers have been contributing and been an essential part of our economy for a long time.

79
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,069
About one in three farmworkers are female,

80
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:03,440
and that's important to know because often the focus has been on male farmworkers and not so much a focus on the experiences of female workers.

81
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:17,180
And there is quite a diversity in the range of age, with only about a third under the age of 35 and with almost 20%, actually 55 or older.

82
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:29,150
So that's that's also important to note. We want to to also highlight and to to to note and recognize that the inequities that we see that are

83
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,880
faced by farmworkers in this country are rooted in historical and structural racism in this country.

84
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,000
So the U.S. economy was built on slavery practices and explicit policies that supported

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,900
the exploitation and the occupational segregation of minoritized communities.

86
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:53,899
So, for example, the New Deal Fair Labor Standards Act was legislation that updated labor standards and

87
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,309
introduced a lot of really important protections for workers like the 40 hour workweek,

88
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,920
the federal minimum wage, overtime pay, abolition of child labor.

89
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,229
However, this act explicitly adopted racist exclusions of agricultural,

90
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,000
domestic and service or tipped workers as a way to deny workers of color core protections.

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,880
And then at that time, they were mainly black workers.

92
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,060
However, over time, Latino and other workers of color's workers of color have been impacted as well.

93
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,040
And another important thing to note is domestic and agricultural labor was really the cornerstone of the plantation system.

94
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:45,049
Right. And there was a concern by plantation owners that the these protections by the FLSA would impact their plantation based economies.

95
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,920
And so that's kind of the the history of where these exclusions really came from.

96
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,480
And while it's been slightly amended over the years,

97
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,190
agricultural workers and domestic workers really continue to be the least protected in the United States.

98
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,809
And these are occupations in which minoritized people are disproportionately represented.

99
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:13,070
And even now, most farmworkers lack basic protections like workers comp, health insurance or paid sick leave,

100
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:21,710
you know, disability insurance, etc. They also don't have the protection of labor unions and collective bargaining.

101
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,200
So farmworkers serve a vital role in the Michigan's agricultural industry.

102
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,820
And yet, despite their essential role, their conditions have not improved much over the years.

103
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:44,970
There are a series of reports from the Michigan Department of Civil Rights that speak to this continued area of areas of concern for this population.

104
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:52,140
So in 2010, the then DCR launched an investigation of the living in the working conditions of farmworkers.

105
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,310
And in that first report they concluded that in the past 45 years or so,

106
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,990
there had been very little change in the working and living conditions for farmworkers in Michigan.

107
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:09,090
And then since that 2010 report, there have been additional reports, kind of progress reports, updating on that.

108
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,290
And they continue to to show that there are areas of concern that have not improved over time.

109
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:25,890
For example, not having bilingual staff, not using enforcement as a deterrent, having issues around wage wages and child labor.

110
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,760
And so and you can actually go to them DCR website if you want to look at these different reports and kind of follow it over time.

111
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,790
But this was really an important motivation for us to develop the Michigan Farmworker project.

112
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,950
So this is comes from last enumeration study that was conducted 2013.

113
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:52,749
Just to give you a sense of where mainly the farm workers, you know, work and reside in state of Michigan.

114
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,530
So mainly on the on the west side of the lower peninsula.

115
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,510
So the IMF pier, the Mexican Farm Worker Project, was developed by myself and Dr. Lizbeth Iglesias.

116
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,390
Rios, who's a postdoctoral fellow here.

117
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:19,940
In 2018, we we developed this this collaboration to really better understand the working and the living conditions of farmworkers in Michigan.

118
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:28,280
And it was a project it is a project that has been guided by critical race theory and by community based participatory research approaches or CPR.

119
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:37,399
And it was really developed with kind of this mutual interest of collaboration from community partners and stakeholders,

120
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:47,750
as well as the academic team and really the shared vision of what needed to be done to in order to be able to conduct research to inform policies,

121
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,270
programs and interventions for farmworkers in the state.

122
00:13:50,810 --> 00:14:00,920
And it really did evolve fairly organically from the beginning with conversations that Dr. Ulises Rios had early on,

123
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,060
even before I joined speech in 2019. So I was still at my previous institution.

124
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,330
She and I were were speaking about the development of this project, and she was starting these conversations.

125
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,700
And so that's kind of how we started to develop the, you know, the seed for this project.

126
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,600
And so from the beginning, our core community partners have been the three that are listed here,

127
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,680
the Office of Migrant Affairs from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services,

128
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,190
Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and Farmworker Legal Services.

129
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:40,590
And they're essential to this project. So the study included different players engagement at different points in the research process.

130
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:49,630
And, you know, I could spend an entire hour presenting on just the process of developing this this project.

131
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,710
But I won't. We have actually this is real than I have.

132
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,860
And our community partners have a recent publication that just came out that really details the whole process of the development,

133
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,520
the theory behind our project and the challenges we face in implementation and some lessons learned.

134
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,719
And so if you're interested in that,

135
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,270
I encourage you to look at that publication because I can go much more into detail through that publication than I can do here in this talk today.

136
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,120
But just to highlight a few of the things.

137
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,910
One of the most important aspects of the development of the MFP was what we did before we even thought about doing research,

138
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,260
but even before we thought about collecting data. And those are what we are calling kind of the pre study activities.

139
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:42,069
These are activities that started early on with Dr. Necessarios having these conversations,

140
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,500
you know, visiting agricultural working sites and the agricultural housing sites,

141
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,430
having a lot of informal conversations with a variety of different people within the farmworker community.

142
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,399
You know, there's a picture of exactly this as we use talking with some of the migrant outreach

143
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,580
workers and the other folks out in the communities that she was talking with.

144
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,800
And, you know, attendance at state level committees, for example, with the Michigan Interagency Migrant Services Committee that I am seeing.

145
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,209
And, you know,

146
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:20,950
all of these activities were super important because it was when we were really listening as especially as the academic or the university side of it,

147
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:29,740
we were just listening and learning so that we could think about how best to move forward with our partners in the development of this project.

148
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:37,389
It also was work that was super important and helpful later, as we actually were developing our instruments, for example, in our questionnaires,

149
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:47,170
because we had had a lot of these conversations early on to really try to understand the context of the of the farmworker community in Michigan.

150
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,690
I will read to all of these,

151
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:57,590
but there were a lot of other kind of pre study activities that happened as well as activities that we've continue to maintain.

152
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,420
But a lot of the work that we did early on was because we were trying to develop,

153
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,490
you know, this is this had not been a collaboration that was present before.

154
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,159
So we were it was starting from from nothing really trying to build those that those

155
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,719
collaborations and that trust with farmworkers and with the farmworker community.

156
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,490
And we, we connected, you know, we're a very diverse team, were bilingual, you know, racially, ethnically.

157
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,280
And we, you know, diverse as well.

158
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:36,830
And so we were able to connect in that way, which really helped build that trust, because the farmworker community is very marginalized.

159
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,469
It's it's invisible in many ways, and it's a very vulnerable population.

160
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:51,020
So we had to build that trust. So Dr. Grocery has also volunteered in some of the migrant health clinics and attended different events.

161
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,920
And you know, then with the work with our community organizations, once we started, you know,

162
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:05,479
doing the research aspect of the study, you know, we had these ongoing discussions and partnerships.

163
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,309
We had collaboration with community partners to refer participants for services.

164
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,330
So if we found participants needed help with a legal issue,

165
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,909
we would be able to send them to our the legal partner or the our partners who had knowledge of the legal aspects.

166
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,840
So we were able to kind of help be referral for farmworkers too.

167
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,910
And that really also built a lot of trust. And then we're just always self reflecting on our own position as a researcher, as a species,

168
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,890
a very diverse research team with all of the different experiences that we bring to the table as well.

169
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,899
So for the first phase of this project, we kind of our study one in 2019,

170
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:51,719
this was a qualitative study and I want to just highlight that we really value the use of mixed methods and using qualitative work,

171
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,090
especially in a, in a, in a situation in a context such as this,

172
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:04,469
where we really need to learn and understand better the and understand deeper the context for, for this population.

173
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:12,810
So we started with a call to study and we interviewed 56 farm workers and stakeholders.

174
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:18,910
This was in the fall of 2019, and we had a semi-structured questionnaire, which,

175
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:26,370
based on some of the international labor organization indicators and other indicators of precarious employment and exploitation.

176
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:33,449
But it also was based, as I said, on on a lot of information we got from those pre study activities that that really

177
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,180
helped inform the way we were going to ask about the context for the farmworkers.

178
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,709
And in the counties that we worked were those that were identified by our partners as

179
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,120
kind of being important in the agricultural sector and where workers were located,

180
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,470
as well as the connection with the migrant outreach workers that that were working with us in in referrals.

181
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,610
The interviews lasted up to an hour and a half, and they were conducted by in person, by Dr. Ulises Reals.

182
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,079
And at the time that was pre-COVID.

183
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:14,670
So we were doing a lot of things in person and they were often done at night, late or the weekends when the workers had a bit of time.

184
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:24,660
And we. Are conducting actually still currently qualitative analysis following a very rigorous and analytic approach.

185
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,310
You know, we have a wealth of data with qualitative data. You get a lot.

186
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,020
And so it takes a little while to to analyze. But we are in that process.

187
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,200
We have a manuscript under review and are working on others.

188
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,910
So we hope that those will come out soon.

189
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:47,639
But the process and what I want to highlight is as we do analysis and as we were, you know, coding the transcripts,

190
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,170
we did that in partnership with our community partners, reading transcripts together, getting feedback from from everyone.

191
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,660
And it was really important in terms of our analysis and understanding the, the data that we have.

192
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:12,480
So these are some of the topics of discussion that kind of came out, as you know, as we were conducting these interviews and looking at the data.

193
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,180
Some were very specific just to stakeholders.

194
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:23,220
But in, you know, essentially they were about the same topics, but just from the different perspectives of the farm workers and other stakeholders.

195
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,500
And I just want to show a few photos that we have from some of those visits.

196
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:39,620
We study visits just to give you a sense of some of the conditions of some of the the areas where the the workers live and work.

197
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,980
So these are some some of the homes at the agricultural work sites.

198
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,209
This is a these are interesting photos that that we took of that actually this is real took that kind of show on

199
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:02,090
the on the left where you can see that the that the crops and the fields are very close to where people live.

200
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,339
Right. So that has implications for exposures and and those issues.

201
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,389
And you can imagine that has implications as well for for families if they're living

202
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,910
there with families and children where they play and exposures that they may have.

203
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:25,420
This is a trailer that that was a housing site for some of the workers.

204
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,280
This is some of the interior. So sometimes the bathrooms are inside.

205
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,830
Sometimes the bathrooms are outside and they're shared.

206
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,560
This is another example, the trailer.

207
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:48,480
And so you can see some of the you know, the conditions are obviously not ideal, you know, with with broken windows and things like that.

208
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:58,760
This is, you know, was a a bedroom example of the mattresses, sometimes the mattresses maybe on the floor.

209
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,300
It depends. There's just an example. So those are just some examples.

210
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,440
So I see the results so far because again, we are still in that process of analyzing the qualitative work.

211
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,860
So, you know, I'm going to present some of the trends and some of the highlights of the work so far.

212
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,650
So in general, the Sociodemographic demographic and economic characteristics are pretty similar to what's been seen,

213
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:31,390
for example, with the National Worker Agricultural Worker Survey and other national data for farm workers.

214
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:38,509
So, you know, a little over half of of the workers we interviewed were were female and they were mostly from Mexico.

215
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,219
And and I'm presenting because we're still in the process of analyzing the stakeholder data.

216
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm going to be talking specifically now of the results from the farmworker sample.

217
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,030
So most of them were born in Mexico, and we're all Spanish speakers.

218
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:05,980
And, you know, had a sixth grade or lower educational attainment and a fairly low family income for the stakeholders.

219
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:13,629
We had 20 plus years of experience among all of them working with this community and various

220
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:22,480
different areas of service that that that they represented in the farmworker community.

221
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,830
But again, I'm going to talk specifically about the farm worker data.

222
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,860
So in the next few slides and we can just present some of the emergent themes.

223
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,799
Again, a lot of this is what we're hoping to publish soon, and we'll be able to get into more detail on that.

224
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,940
But I just want to kind of highlight some some emergent themes from the analysis,

225
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,150
and then I am going to highlight some that were noted by female workers in particular or that were related to issues that female workers face.

226
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,550
Because again, we had a high proportion of female workers and their experiences are often distinct,

227
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,650
sometimes ignored compared to the male worker population.

228
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,960
So I want to highlight that, and then I'll read a few quotes to kind of represent the themes that we were seeing.

229
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:12,370
So in general, all workers really did speak to the hazardous and the demanding work conditions, you know, low wages and job insecurity.

230
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,080
You know, workers talked about working within a piece rate system, which is, you know,

231
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:26,610
working to to achieve a certain amount of of of harvest, for example, but not getting compensated fairly for that work.

232
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,029
And by law, workers actually should get a minimum wage when they're working under the piece rate system.

233
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,610
But often they reported that they did not receive that.

234
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,850
Workers discussed facing penalties for inappropriately picking crops, for example, picking apples.

235
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,599
If the fruit got a bruise, workers would get a warning.

236
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:56,829
And then after three warnings, they were fired. You know, having that insecurity of employment came up a lot for for women workers.

237
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,130
Reproductive health was a major concern for women in particular.

238
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,870
Specifically, participants noted safety and health concerns related to pregnancy.

239
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:14,350
They also talked about issues with menstruation. So women workers, for example, talked about hygiene and sanitation,

240
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:24,040
not having bathroom facilities or not having clean facilities to be able to to to use, especially if they were menstruating.

241
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:32,680
They talked about working under the that again, that peace rate system and talked about not necessarily going to the bathroom because they wanted to,

242
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,879
you know, earn as much money as possible so they wouldn't take any breaks.

243
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,460
And that actually wasn't just women, that was men as well.

244
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,799
They also spoke on the lack of access to medical care, particularly prenatal and post-natal care,

245
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,340
or not having time off or or not necessarily having clinics near where they work and having to take their own

246
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,610
personal time to to go to those appointments and also not being able to breastfeed once they have a baby.

247
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,780
So here are a few quotes to kind of highlight those themes.

248
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:13,160
So one migrant female field migrant farm worker stated When we were working in the field and sometimes we would go to one to another one farther away,

249
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,600
I would wait until the last minute and then I would quickly change referring to Sanitary Pad.

250
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,570
I would wait until everyone left and I would change. And she was referring to changing in the field.

251
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,430
Another noted No, no time to eat.

252
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,750
We do not have time to eat. Many people have gotten sick and since I have been working there, seven people have fainted and fallen horribly.

253
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,260
In terms of workplace interpersonal dynamics. All of the workers are really, in some way or another,

254
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:53,550
talks about issues of discrimination and racism and talked about this feeling of feeling like they're part of the equipment.

255
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,200
Right? This idea of dehumanization.

256
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,290
So feeling that they're not really human beings, that they're easily replaced, that they're just part of the machinery.

257
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:08,820
And in this kind of environment really contributes to a working environment that has this unequal power dynamics,

258
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,600
that has this lack of worker autonomy in that that was discussed.

259
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:20,640
And, you know, workers talked about the fear, you know, of of ice or a fear of being deported.

260
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:28,400
They talked about this idea of social isolation, which is important, and that lack of connectivity with communities where they live and work.

261
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,600
So, you know, the fact that they may only if they're living at the agricultural work site,

262
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,350
that they don't necessarily go into the community where they live maybe about once a week just to wash clothes or to send money or buy food.

263
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,640
So they don't have that connection with the community and they feel quite isolated.

264
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,560
Women in particular noted facing sexual harassment.

265
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,590
This was particularly noted for single women who are working and that they were

266
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,020
particularly vulnerable in terms of sexual harassment or inappropriate comments.

267
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,330
You know, pregnant workers talked about facing discrimination in hiring practices.

268
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,469
So like not being included or considered or being fired for being pregnant.

269
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:15,990
And so that idea of hiding a pregnancy, you know, was was an issue.

270
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:26,100
You know, many spoke about the double burden of being caretakers for the families, but also working, whether in the fields, in the packing plants.

271
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,130
They felt that they worked very long hours, that they were not able to properly care for their children,

272
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,890
that they felt that they were neglecting their children and that they were very you know, they couldn't find that balance.

273
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,030
And childcare was also a constant source of stress that was identified.

274
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,149
You know, who who's trustworthy enough to take care of the children?

275
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:53,480
Where can they find childcare? So here's a quote to represent that.

276
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,640
So one farm worker noted, I think they simply said there's no work for you.

277
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,180
And she was referring to being not being offered when she was seven months pregnant.

278
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,060
I do not know if I should complain or what to do, but I think that they did not give me the work because I was pregnant.

279
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:15,120
And then another male migrant worker noted, and this kind of gets to this concept of the dehumanization.

280
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,950
So, you know, when you're not useful to them, referring to the growers, they treat away like a banana peel because you're not useful to them.

281
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,720
He, referring to the grower wants as production that you do the work and if you are not one of the people that follows what they want, they fire you.

282
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:42,540
And then finally, in terms of kind of the living conditions which for this population are very closely linked to the working context.

283
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,230
So when you talk about the working conditions, you have to talk about the living conditions.

284
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:57,540
So most workers really spoke about a lot of these issues of having to share the housing units, having a lack of privacy, sharing amenities,

285
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,690
not having access to washing machines, talking about, you know, the, the,

286
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:09,030
the the types of the condition of the mattresses that they have to sleep on with their families.

287
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:18,750
And just this idea of of inappropriate living conditions for young children, particularly for those who are living at the agricultural work sites.

288
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,070
So this is just a quote. Kind of related to that.

289
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,230
For me, it's not okay, especially because of the children, but also you.

290
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,309
And it's sad. There are houses that don't have their bathroom.

291
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,370
It's outside. They have to bathe outside.

292
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,030
It's very it's dirty. It's very dirty. There are even bugs.

293
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:51,440
They don't value the people. So, you know, our study uses a again, a participatory research approach.

294
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,140
And this has been absolutely critical to be able to be successful in this in this work.

295
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,480
The community university partnership really helped us, you know,

296
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,910
facilitate that that exchange of resources and under, you know, knowledge and ideas and perspectives.

297
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,979
It helped us to anticipate potential issues, challenges and risks for farm workers,

298
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,610
ethical challenges, and really helped us overcome those challenges.

299
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:24,350
So the PR approach was really important. We did face a lot of challenges as as one does, especially in this type of work.

300
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,300
And I'm not going to read through all of these.

301
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:33,220
And a lot of this we talk about in that publication I noted before, but there's a couple that are kind of interesting.

302
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,670
One was around this issue of incentives that I think we have to think about when we're conducting research.

303
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,040
So we really face some major challenges with the distribution of incentives for our participants.

304
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,430
So really our only option at the time was to provide compensation cards from from the university,

305
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,800
and they would have to be mailed to participants and activated by the participants.

306
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,709
And from that beginning, we faced a lot of issues.

307
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,470
For example, the instructions that were mailed were not in Spanish because the vendor didn't have Spanish instruction.

308
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:13,490
So we had to translate all of them. We often had to help the participant talking to them over the phone to get help them activate the card.

309
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,190
Mailing issues were really a big deal, so where do we send it?

310
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,700
If the worker lives at a camp, you know, what's the address?

311
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,759
What if they move, which often happened?

312
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,270
What if they go back to their home country where the cards don't work, so how they just don't get their incentives?

313
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,830
So there was a lot of issues that that really were were very difficult for us.

314
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,380
And I do want to note that last year there actually was an effort that was launched by Apache to

315
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:48,830
push the university to to consider more equitable options for incentives and more low barriers,

316
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:56,150
low barriers, electronic cash transfer options. And early in that process, the NFP submitted our own statement.

317
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,850
In support of that, we were interviewed about it. I don't really know where that is at right now.

318
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,040
I haven't been in that stage, but I'm hopeful that that is something that will change at the university side,

319
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,970
because that really is an issue when we're doing this kind of research.

320
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,239
Just some other challenges. You know, the fact that the workers work very long hours, the interviews were very late in the evening or on the weekends.

321
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,100
There's really this culture of silence. There's a lot of fear.

322
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:32,390
So a lot of that is what really why it was so important to have a QPR approach and have those community partners working with us.

323
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:42,870
And there's also a very complex system of like agencies and state and community agencies, enforcement systems, policies, and it was very complicated.

324
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:48,560
It is complicated and our partners are just really essential for that, for understanding those processes.

325
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,260
Our study, that first study in 2018 focused on conditions pre-COVID,

326
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,950
and that was what we saw was, I guess, considered normal, if you want to call it that.

327
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:05,840
And when the pandemic started, we realized that we had to develop a set of recommendations based on those initial findings and based on what,

328
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,969
you know, as, quote, new normal conditions that we're going to most likely be exacerbated by the pandemic.

329
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,330
So we published this policy brief that we developed with our partners,

330
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,629
and it was shared pretty, pretty widely up and up to the governor's office as well,

331
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,420
and apparently influenced some decisions regarding some emergency protections for agricultural workers during the pandemic,

332
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,520
regarding testing and quarantine and PPE, use and and aid for the workers.

333
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:38,059
And, you know, we really wanted, you know, to make some impact at that point.

334
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,510
And so this came out in May of 2020.

335
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:48,620
And you can find this is a shorter schematic and we have a longer document both in English and in Spanish,

336
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,620
and it's on this website if you want to if you want to.

337
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:59,059
Look, we also, at the same time simultaneously published a commentary in the American Journal of Public Health.

338
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,670
And we also participated in an amicus brief with one of our partners regarding

339
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,200
a lawsuit to actually appeal those emergency orders to protect the farmworkers.

340
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,309
And so. After that study,

341
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,209
then we were approached by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights to conduct another

342
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:26,660
small study around the issue of fair housing during the pandemic for farmworkers.

343
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:35,990
And so we were approached by them. DCR They had a study or a grant from the CARES Act, which is a COVID related grant,

344
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:44,120
to really look at this issue of housing in relation to work, context and health during the pandemic.

345
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,350
And so we, we had two phases to this study.

346
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,510
The first phase was, again, a more qualitative phase with a smaller sample where we just wanted to ask about housing issues during the pandemic,

347
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:03,709
ask about, you know, the work situation during the pandemic. We just wanted to hear what was happening and get a better sense because again,

348
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:14,620
that was going to be very helpful for us to design our instrument for the quantitative phase, for the phone survey that we conducted afterwards.

349
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:23,629
And so again, the second phase was this quantitative phone survey, and we asked on a variety of different topics regarding housing,

350
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:29,660
quality, access, physical conditions, the work environment, as well as general health and COVID 19.

351
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:36,790
Related questions. And I just want to note that it was interesting because in this because it was during the pandemic,

352
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,330
the this study, we actually did all of our interviews over the phone and because we had to because of pandemic.

353
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,889
But it turned out that that actually was a really good way to do the interviews with the farmworkers.

354
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,610
They felt, I think, more comfortable doing that.

355
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:58,990
It was easier to coordinate because of their long hours and they could find a private place to talk.

356
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,440
And so it actually ended up working out well to do the phone interviews that we.

357
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,579
Just kind of briefly some of the results.

358
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,620
And we're still in the process of analyzing these data and writing up reports and manuscripts.

359
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,390
But, you know, again,

360
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:25,180
our social demographics are pretty in line with what we have seen at the national level of what we've seen in our previous work about,

361
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,860
you know, 67% or 70% of seasonal farmworkers and I haven't said this previously,

362
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,159
but so seasonal workers of those who either work the entire year in different

363
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,340
crops in Michigan or in agricultural or in specific seasons of certain crops,

364
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:49,249
but they're always here. Migrant workers come from other places, and then the H-2A workers are on a non immigrant work visa.

365
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,860
So that's what those those types refer to.

366
00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:02,930
We had about 60% of our sample were women again in the study and had the majority reported having children and having the children minor children,

367
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,840
so children over the age of 18 living with them in their current situation.

368
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,040
So more than a third of the farm workers in the study were classified as living in poverty.

369
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,840
And that's more than three times the official poverty rate of the general U.S. population.

370
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,190
Over a quarter of the farmworkers in the study were classified as having low or very low food security.

371
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:34,940
And we used the USDA, the validated USDA food security scale to assess this.

372
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:42,020
And this is more than double the than what we've seen at the general U.S. household level for 2020.

373
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:51,340
Over a quarter of the migrant and the seasonal farm workers reported that they had been denied housing when trying to find rental places in Michigan.

374
00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:00,080
You know, many of the reasons stated for denial of housing and there's a few examples that I've listed here on the

375
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,870
slide are really closely linked to the working conditions and the occupational situation of these workers.

376
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:13,730
So for example, workers who are undocumented or do not have a ID may face face these challenges in securing housing,

377
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,130
having an insecure job situation or a nonstandard working arrangement,

378
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:28,310
which means they may not have a steady flow of income, also can impact the ability to access rental housing.

379
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,829
The migratory and the temporal nature of their work also impacts women workers,

380
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:40,490
and those with families or with children also face these additional challenges of finding housing that accepts children.

381
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:53,220
You know, overall, we asked about physical characteristics of the home and overall they were considered by farm workers, but functional and adequate.

382
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,080
There were some aspects of the housing quality that are important to know from a health perspective.

383
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:05,820
So over a third of the farm workers reported using their sleeping room as a common living space by them and others,

384
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,360
which is a situation that can impact quality of sleep if they don't have privacy or they won't have a quiet space to rest.

385
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,530
More than half of participants indicated that their mattress was somewhat clean, but that they had issues of bedbugs or,

386
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:24,480
you know, having a mattress on the floor or having to use plastic covers on the mattresses.

387
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,950
And a little more than a third of participants reported that they don't have air conditioning.

388
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:34,410
And about a third reported having rips or tears in their in their screens or screens.

389
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:40,050
And these are important, you know, housing characteristics that can potentially be a health concern for farm workers,

390
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:48,900
given that their inability to be able to come home and cool down in their homes after working really long hours and long days in hot conditions.

391
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,430
So that can really increase the risk of heat related symptoms and illness.

392
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:03,360
And also not having functional screens is an issue in terms of keeping insects out and avoiding transmission of insect borne diseases.

393
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:10,019
And so, you know, sharing the sleeping rooms or lack of of clean or adequate mattresses on areas for

394
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,710
rest and the lack of air conditioning and functional functional screens are all,

395
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:23,280
you know, issues that definitely can have important health implications impacting farm worker health and the health of their families.

396
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:31,490
Another important area of concern for participants was related to exposure to residential environmental hazards.

397
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,900
So, you know, things like pesticide drift or fumes standing garbage or sewage or water outside their home was something that was mentioned.

398
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,640
And you know, about a quarter self-reported testing positive for COVID 19.

399
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,290
And all of those who tested who said that they tested positive said that they quarantined,

400
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,939
but they noted that they had a worsened economic situation because of quarantining,

401
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,210
because they didn't receive the economic compensation from their employer.

402
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,230
And so that's an important issue when we think of housing insecurity, because you don't have the income, right?

403
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,500
So that can affect whether you can pay rent and and pay for your your costs of living.

404
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:17,440
So kind of in sum, the fair housing access, affordability and quality are all important and very complicated issues,

405
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,440
and they have to be assessed within the context of employment and working

406
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,879
conditions for farmworkers and this broader socio economic and political context.

407
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:34,480
If we really want to understand how to to address housing issues, we actually have forthcoming a report that Dr. Iglesias,

408
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,690
Rios and I have developed that goes much more into detail of the findings from this housing study,

409
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:48,910
and hopefully that will be out soon to describe kind of more in detail the findings that we have.

410
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,000
So kind of to conclude, these are just some of the thoughts on this work so far.

411
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,700
You know, we're it's an ongoing research program, but we have some some thoughts so far.

412
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:08,880
So here's where conditions and labor exploitation are clearly an issue for farm workers in Michigan.

413
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,580
They have substandard living conditions that are intrinsically connected with employment.

414
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:20,130
So if we want to try to understand both the working conditions and the living conditions, we have to understand them together.

415
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:30,150
Farm workers have a very high dependency on employers, crew leaders, contractors and very low decision making, power or control.

416
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,079
And that's important because that lack of autonomy, coupled with precarious employment conditions,

417
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,120
can increase the vulnerability of these workers and has clear health implications.

418
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:50,009
Participatory research principles provided and provide a very theoretical and practical framework

419
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,350
for focusing on the voices and experience of participants and of the greater farmworker community.

420
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,680
And then finally, what we've reported so far, what we've found so far, you know,

421
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,660
the situation for farm workers in Michigan may potentially be worse than what we're reporting.

422
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:12,500
And I say this because this could be potential selection bias that we've had in these studies up to now.

423
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:19,290
Our studies have been coming in samples. They've been referrals of farm workers who connect with the migrant outreach workers.

424
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:26,490
And so they may have more access to health and social services in that respect, or at least be connected more.

425
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:32,640
And so we may be missing those that are more vulnerable and in worse situations.

426
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:41,520
And so, you know, moving forward, we are working to obtain funds to to develop a larger.

427
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:52,040
Study that will use a sampling approach that has been used with with more marginalized populations

428
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,410
to try to actually get a sample that's a bit more representative than than what we've done so far.

429
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,300
And so hopefully we will get that that those funding those funds to be able to do that.

430
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,370
And then maybe that might clear up this this potential situation of the selection bias.

431
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:17,700
And then I just want to highlight, you know, again, it's really important that we think of broader when we think about this this issue that, you know,

432
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,079
our our social and our immigration policies in this country have played and continue to play a very

433
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,330
critical role in shaping occupational health inequities with and with farmworkers in particular.

434
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,610
It's historical. It's current.

435
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:39,330
And, you know, there's there's this always this climate of fear that that we see it escalated in the previous administration, but it's still present.

436
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,370
There's empowerment of hate groups and anti immigrant and racist rhetoric.

437
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:52,500
And there's just this lack of agency American representation that really impacts this particular group of workers.

438
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,780
And so finally, just to conclude kind of full circle, back to that first slide, you know,

439
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:06,200
we know that generally work can be health benefiting, but employment experiences are just not uniformly advantageous.

440
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:13,099
And we and we need to think about that differential and that unequal impact of these experiences in certain worker populations.

441
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,950
So what are the differential effects of the conditions of poverty, of structural racism, of racial,

442
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:26,540
ethnic and gender subordination and discrimination, as well as the inequity that we see of these big global production systems?

443
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,670
Precarious employment and labor exploitation are definitely important drivers of

444
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,500
health inequities among worker populations and need to be understood better.

445
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:42,620
And then finally, there's a real complex relationship and dynamic between industry and government,

446
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:49,040
and it's often more pronounced in more unequal societies, which the U.S. falls into.

447
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:58,670
You know, agricultural production in particular drives economies of states like, you know, higher Michigan, the economies of countries.

448
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,500
And so that is where you see this complex relationship and the power dynamics between, you know, how do we protect our workers?

449
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,070
Do we protect the industry that is critical for an economy?

450
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:17,060
I would argue that by protecting the workers, you do protect the industry because you have healthier workforce.

451
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,960
However, that's not always looked at in that way.

452
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,880
You know, in the early stages of the pandemic, the food and agricultural industry here in the U.S. was what's considered an essential sector.

453
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,260
So farm workers were considered essential workers and worked through the pandemic,

454
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:42,230
and yet they didn't have the protections that they were afforded for because of their situation.

455
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,730
So, you know, I'll finish by saying that, you know,

456
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:51,620
occupational health and safety laws really have to protect all workers regardless of their immigration status,

457
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:57,920
regardless of what industry they're working in. You know, and until we address these kind of systematic issues and challenges,

458
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:05,570
we're going to continue to see poor working and living conditions for farmworkers and these continued health inequities.

459
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:13,690
So with that, I'll finish. I want to acknowledge all the participants and our partners who have been so important.

460
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:21,380
I want to acknowledge Doctor Elizabeth Rios as well, all of our other colleagues at Michigan.

461
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,720
And then I just wanted to show these are pictures that were sent to us by farm workers who participated in our study.

462
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:34,700
And we think they're beautiful pictures and we want to highlight them so you

463
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,230
can find more information about the project at this link that I have here.

464
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:50,220
And thank you so much for your attention. Thank you for a really great talk.

465
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,280
We've got just a couple of minutes for questions.

466
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,100
I see there's a couple from from people who were attending online, so I'm just going to pull that up.

467
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,970
So the first one is so that's great talk. This is from Marie O'Neil.

468
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,800
Wondering if you faced any issues with incentives having to provide Social Security number

469
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,080
or taxpayer ID or was the amount less than the amount that requires this reporting?

470
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,840
The initiative with the IRB is really important, and one of our projects with a vulnerable and marginalized population has had challenges around this.

471
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,700
Yeah. Yeah. So we didn't have those challenges of them having to provide.

472
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:38,670
Social Security number. But the big issues that we faced were just like getting them the cards and activating them,

473
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:47,070
especially with the kind of migratory nature of the of the workers and the jobs and those who lived on the on the camps,

474
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,930
you know, on the agricultural work sites. And I think that HPC initiative is really critical.

475
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,250
That's why we signed a statement for it. Again, I don't know where it's at right now.

476
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:07,000
I hope it's moving forward, but I think it's really critical to to change that that approach, to get,

477
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:13,450
you know, to be more equitable in the way we have, you know, include participants in our studies.

478
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:23,880
And then we have one other question from Jose Victor Zamora. Have you been able to interview farm employers and analyze their concerns?

479
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:31,590
Yeah. So. And I should say that Elizabeth Elizabeth is on the zoom.

480
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,050
So if she wants to answer or address this, I don't know if she can do that, but we haven't.

481
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,320
Specifically interviewed the employers.

482
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:48,930
So far, I think it's a conversation that is important to have.

483
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,790
We have participated in different kind of committees at the state level that include the Farm Bureau,

484
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:01,860
include those, you know, from the ag industry that are interested.

485
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,299
We've we've gotten kind of slowly, you know, to address this.

486
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:14,459
We do think it's important to hear that the perspectives from from all stakeholders.

487
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,440
And so we hope to do more of that.

488
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:26,550
We initially really wanted to kind of build this connection and trust with the the farm workers first and then kind of move forward from there.

489
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,240
We did interview crew leaders. Those are not employers.

490
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,950
Right. But they're more like supervisors.

491
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:41,700
And in that sense, we did get a bit more information from that aspect, but we didn't explicitly interview employers so far.

492
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:49,640
I can hear the next class waiting to come in. But if there's if there are any questions in the room.

493
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,480
Anybody want to ask a question? Okay?

494
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,280
Yeah. Meredith. Others.

495
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,360
I was thinking. You hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Yeah, that's working.

496
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:17,070
I was thinking about other seasonal workers in Michigan and if there were any similarities or parallels thinking about tourism.

497
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,020
I know Mackinac Island would bring in lots and lots of foreign workers.

498
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:28,590
And I just wonder if there's parallels that could be, you know, lessons learned that could be shared.

499
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,609
But I know you've got a lot of work to do. No, no.

500
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,839
And actually, we saw Marie Rosenberg, who is in nursing,

501
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:47,380
has focused quite a bit of her work on looking at these kind of these issues with low wage workers, domestic workers, hotel workers.

502
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,400
I'm not sure if she's on today, but yeah, I think she is.

503
00:53:51,970 --> 00:54:00,070
I see her on the list anyway. So she's she's done work and we've talked and kind of exchanged, you know, our perspectives.

504
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,970
And so I think that there definitely are a lot of parallels for sure.

505
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,990
And I think it is important to kind of join forces.

506
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,110
You know, there's there's different contexts, but in some respects, there are, you know, a lot of similarities.

507
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:25,000
So, yeah, we we have talked early also and VHS works with the nail salon workers.

508
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,200
So that's another area. And so there's a lot of parallels with with this kind of work.

509
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,300
Thank you, Dr. Handel. Thank you so much.
