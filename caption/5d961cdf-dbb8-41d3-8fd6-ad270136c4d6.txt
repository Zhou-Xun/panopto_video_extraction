1
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:09,495
Okay so, we're going to pick back up where we left off, talking about traumatic stress and collective trauma.

2
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:18,795
And I'm going to start by showing you this graph that was used to measure anxiety and depression

3
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:26,135
across different racial groups, following the killing of George Floyd.

4
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:32,715
And I just want to use this as a reminder of kind of what we were talking about when we left off.

5
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:42,045
The different people and different groups are going to be experiencing the same traumatic events differently.

6
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:47,535
And I want us to kind of keep in mind as we think about this, that,

7
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:53,485
I'll kind of use an extreme example, like in the same way that we wouldn't blame

8
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:58,825
people or children in Flint who weren't drinking clean water for the ways that their bodies reacted to that,

9
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:05,095
we wouldn't see that as them being weak or them having a problem.

10
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,335
I think we need to be really clear

11
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:12,415
when we're thinking about ourselves and other people and how they're affected by the trauma that's happening in the environment around them,

12
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:16,625
that these signs aren't about certain groups being stronger or weaker,

13
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:22,255
but these are natural reactions to the things that are happening in the world that

14
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:29,095
are harmful to their psychological system and often to their safety, in general.

15
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:36,935
So this is why even in the field of public health, racism has been described as a public issue.

16
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:44,145
And so this is a good opportunity to kind of think about not only how this affects you personally,

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,675
how this affects people that you care about, people in your communities,

18
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:55,975
but also to just even think about a little bit from your academic and professional lens,  and

19
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,695
as you go through the things that you're learning about,

20
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:06,535
sometimes you're going to be exposed to things that are vicariously traumatic, so you might be studying things

21
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:12,295
where you're learning about people having really difficult experiences and that can take some wear and tear on us,

22
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:22,575
just even learning about it. So knowing that it's normal, when we're learning about hard things and traumatic things, for it to bring up our own

23
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:27,215
feelings and we need to have places to talk about and take care of that.

24
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:33,085
But also, as we're studying different people and groups of people you want to keep in mind,

25
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:37,155
there are these variables that can be affecting them differently.

26
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:44,225
We want that to be a part of our professional lens, being kind of trauma informed,

27
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:48,725
social justice oriented can not only help you understand yourself in your own being better,

28
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:58,005
but it can help you understand really everything that you're learning about.

29
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:06,285
So we're gonna kind of revisit what we talked about at the very beginning. These are the different ways that trauma affects us

30
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:17,575
some of them at least. And now we're going to talk about based on that, how do we take care of ourselves?

31
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:23,885
How do we move through trauma as it's coming up in our lives?

32
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:30,895
The first step, and I really can't emphasize this one enough, is to get safe and grounded in our body.

33
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:42,385
Part of the reason why we see such big health disparities, is that racism and other forms of collective trauma take a huge toll on our bodies.

34
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:48,985
So often we immediately think about, oh, I'm stressed, I'm having some thoughts, I'm having some feelings about this,

35
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:55,135
but it's actually taking a toll on every major system in your body, your respiratory system,

36
00:03:55,135 --> 00:04:00,475
your heart and circulatory system, your digestive system, your immune system.

37
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:06,045
And so when we're experiencing traumatic things, it becomes hugely important,

38
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:12,885
that first and foremost, we if we're not in a place that's physically safe, that we try to get to wherever we can be the most physically safe.

39
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:18,185
Wherever we can safely eat, sleep, restore

40
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:26,455
ourselves. Where we can start to work on getting calm and settled again in our body.

41
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:34,815
And I want to talk a little bit about what this could look like. So if you're watching something on the news,

42
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:42,815
getting new information about something traumatic that's happened to somebody else or even experiencing something traumatic.

43
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,075
In the aftermath, you may notice kind of shakiness in your own system, and that's normal,

44
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:52,505
that's like, it's not only our fight or flight system getting activated,

45
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:59,625
but also trying to figure out how to separate itself, resettle itself and work through what just happened.

46
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:06,275
So often, anything that you can do to just get present and in your body and in the moment.

47
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:11,835
So some of the things, you see that top one with the feet, get grounded. You want to feel the ground underneath your feet.

48
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:19,225
And sometimes just moving your feet on the ground, pushing your feet into the ground can help you feel more supported and grounded.

49
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:27,495
Sometimes breathing, and I'll say to myself, sometimes breathe all the way down into your feet,

50
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:32,435
so that I'm pulling the air all the way through, holding it,

51
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:42,225
and then letting it go. Both of these things I would probably do for several minutes on repeat.

52
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,745
Sometimes just putting on, like, a soothing song in the background,

53
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:52,065
because then, when you do this for the duration of the song, it's probably about a half, two and a half minutes.

54
00:05:52,065 --> 00:06:01,225
And sometimes just even the familiarity of the song can kind of calm us. And the bottom, you see that look around.

55
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:07,645
Sometimes when I've seen really tragic things happening on the news, I have to almost remind my body, not my head,

56
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:12,305
my head kind of knows, but I need to remind my body that I'm not there.

57
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:19,415
I'm actually probably in my house, in my room, in a space that's relatively safe.

58
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:29,915
So just allowing yourself, and this may seem silly, but to scan the room and notice the windows and the doors and the light.

59
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:35,825
Notice maybe just textures, colors.

60
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:41,985
Kind of telling yourself, okay, there's a lot happening. But right now, I'm here and I'm okay.

61
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:54,015
An example of this for a lot of people watching the insurrection at the capital was very startling, unsettling, and that has an impact on all of us.

62
00:06:54,015 --> 00:07:00,435
But most of us were watching from home and were safe, and we kind of needed to remind our bodies in that moment,

63
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:04,805
I'm actually okay and safe in the space that I'm in right now. I can breathe,

64
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:16,145
I can ground, and then I can figure out what to do next. So you want to be taking deep breaths in, you want to be fully exhaling them.

65
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:20,885
You also want to just connect with support. We'll talk more about that.

66
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:26,045
Sometimes just even in our own body, take both of your hands, rest of them on your chests,

67
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:34,835
kind of feels a little bit like a weighted blanket. And sometimes that can just help us to even feel our breath a little bit more.

68
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:41,375
And sometimes, just kind of holding ourselves right now, I'll move my screen a little bit so that you can

69
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:48,745
see, just kind of sitting in the chair and rocking a little bit.

70
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:57,445
Slow tapping helps to activate what we call our parasympathetic nervous system.

71
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:04,455
Bring us back back down, out of fight or flight. So just really slow.

72
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:12,305
And we're letting the tapping, as we slow that down, we're also slowing down our breathing.

73
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:17,955
All of these are just kind of like the first aid, let me get settled

74
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:24,225
and safe back in my body. From there, you might start to think,

75
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:25,335
what are other things?

76
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:36,165
Sometimes our body might be feeling like I really want to go for a run, I really want to maybe clean the house just to get out a lot of energy.

77
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:42,895
But you want to just kind of figure out what sometimes, you know, just organizing makes us feel like, okay, I got out some energy,

78
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:49,165
I feel a little bit more settled and in control. But sometimes we need to rest,

79
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:56,085
sometimes we might want to dance, sometimes we might want to be somewhere where we can get in our car, put on some music and just kind of

80
00:08:56,085 --> 00:09:02,175
sing loudly, scream a little bit if you need to, but just we want to let ourselves move through our body.

81
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:07,935
What's going on? And you've seen these sentence starters,

82
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:16,095
in a previous module, but sometimes once we're a little bit more settled, checking in with ourselves,

83
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:26,175
and completing these sentences can help. I am. I feel. I want.

84
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:34,625
I need. I will. It's kind of just assessing, reminding ourselves sometimes who we are,

85
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,135
taking an assessment of what we feel,

86
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:45,965
need or want in the moment and then committing to kind of doing a thing or two to either sometimes address the problem that's happening,

87
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:55,455
if there's a piece that we can, and sometimes to just kind of take care of ourselves or commit to connecting with others.

88
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,055
So, again, that first step, we want to get safe and grounded in our body,

89
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:07,125
and I really can't emphasize enough how big of a part that is, and sometimes we're grounded for 15 minutes and then we got to go back.

90
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:14,925
So this, although it's an arrow going in one direction, you've got to go back or sometimes start all over again and go through the cycle.

91
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:22,695
That's perfectly normal and makes sense. The next step is connecting with caring community.

92
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:32,505
And if this is an individual trauma, connecting with people who will hear you, believe you, support you, help

93
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:37,515
take care of you for a time if you need. Sometimes just not being alone,

94
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:42,205
especially if you're dealing with fear and anxiety, can be really helpful.

95
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:54,085
If it's collective, sometimes, you know, for example, if you're feeling, if you're immunocompromised during COVID, seeing

96
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:58,325
who might be willing to drop off groceries for you or for some of us,

97
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:06,405
who have just gotten the vaccine, and for the next 48 hours aren't feeling so great. Who can take some of the things off of our plate?

98
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:17,195
If it's collective trauma that's racial or homophobic violence, often then being with community who are experiencing that and who get it,

99
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:25,795
so that we know that we're not alone, can be really important. Collective trauma isn't meant to be held and worked through individually.

100
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:32,295
It's meant to be held and processed in communities so that we know it's not just us, there's nothing wrong with us,

101
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:40,025
we matter, and we deserve better, and we need to be in community that helps us know that.

102
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:48,995
Once you're kind of safe in your body, connected with community, usually, then it feels safe enough to just feel all of your feelings.

103
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:52,835
This is one of those times where like being in your feelings makes complete sense,

104
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:57,065
and we actually need space and time to do that, so that those feelings don't get.

105
00:11:57,065 --> 00:12:07,295
stuck in us. Anger, rage, fear, anxiety, grief, all of those things just stuck in our body, take a toll on our physical health.

106
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,195
So we want places where we can communicate them, sometimes process them through art,

107
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:15,635
process them through music, process them through dancing,

108
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,155
singing, prayer, cooking.

109
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:28,335
Some people I know during COVID, we're baking and giving it away, because it was helping them stay busy, have something to do that

110
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:38,235
helped them kind of just, again, kind of that familiarity, that predictability. So make space to feel your feelings.

111
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:43,275
See what they're, often they're giving us information about what matters to us, what's not okay,

112
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:47,805
what we need. So we don't want to ignore anger because we think it's bad.

113
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:50,415
We don't want to ignore grief because it's intense.

114
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:57,695
We want to find, if we need, somebody to support us and hear us out with it so that we can move through it.

115
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:04,195
And again, these feelings may come up in waves and we may have to revisit this step.

116
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:14,005
The next step is reduced tasks and toxicity, so the toxicity is often coming from social media.

117
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:22,585
We are not wired to be on a 24 hour news cycle, so sometimes we need to unplug.

118
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:27,385
Sometimes when I do this, I will alert a friend, if anything big happens that I need to know,

119
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:33,455
send me a text. I'm not checking, I need 24 hours of a break.

120
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:38,355
Or set times when you're checking, maybe you check mid-day and then I wouldn't say quite at the end of the day, because

121
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:43,925
that's not a great way to go to sleep, but maybe there's two times a day where you kind of check-in and get updates.

122
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:52,265
But a lot of us end up on social media or just checking the news constantly, and it keeps our cortisol levels really high.

123
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,455
So you want to give yourself permission to tune out.

124
00:13:54,455 --> 00:14:06,135
You definitely don't want to be reading everybody's comments because honestly, people are just offloading a lot of opinions and that aren't helpful.

125
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:12,405
So unplug where you need to. Any non-essential tasks, anything that can wait.

126
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:17,295
Reducing the load of what you're carrying so that your body can manage moving through this.

127
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:21,195
This is another good example of sometimes taking the pause that we need.

128
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:29,475
While it might interrupt, our productivity for the moment, actually helps us to heal and move through the trauma better so that we can show up more effective

129
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:37,355
later, as opposed to getting stuck in the trauma in a way that

130
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:45,515
can keep us there for a really long time. We also want to use our agency and voice, remember how we talked about trauma

131
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:53,845
takes that away from us. So, in this step, a lot of what we're doing is thinking, okay, what can I do to take care of myself?

132
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,245
What can I do to take care of my community?

133
00:14:56,245 --> 00:15:05,185
What can I do to advocate for myself in systems or create change if I want to? A lot of times, especially with our grief and with our anger,

134
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:18,715
this is a great way to channel them that makes us feel more heard, seen and hopefully, is helping us achieve change over time.

135
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:24,015
And then the last one, and this is one to be careful with, this is one that I would say,

136
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:27,345
notice when you feel like your system may be coming online a little bit.

137
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:36,495
We don't want to rush or force ourself into hope, and joy, and practicing some kind of weird toxic positivity or pretending.

138
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:43,795
But sometimes, asking yourself, like, what's something that would give me a moment of joy?

139
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:51,385
What's something that's kind of like a little piece of gratitude or hope in a day that feels really difficult?

140
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:56,815
So connecting with those little glimmers sometimes saying, okay, for today,

141
00:15:56,815 --> 00:16:02,785
I'm not going to read about all of the horrible things happening in the world. And it's not that I'm shutting them out forever,

142
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:13,185
a lot of us feel the need to be tuned in. But I'm going to take a break and I'm going to treat myself like I matter.

143
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:17,955
I'm going to spend quality time with the people I care about and we're gonna laugh

144
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:22,365
and we're gonna do do some different things, and know that when we do that, again,

145
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:28,295
it's refueling us, it's helping us show up for the things that matter to us in a better way when we

146
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:33,775
reengage. But we need times to kind of pause, take a breath.

147
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:41,835
Remember that the difficult and traumatic things are happening,

148
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:51,495
usually, if we look back in history when people have been fixing those things, they're also kind of celebrating their humanity

149
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:56,065
in the midst of it as a way to motivate themselves and to get themselves through it.

150
00:16:56,065 --> 00:17:08,695
So we want to think about these different things and know that there are tools that we can kind of offer to people, if we are on the outside of the trauma,

151
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,625
but also if we're experiencing it, like when it's individual or collective,

152
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:24,705
these are steps that we can go to, to kind of help us through it. None of it is going to solve all of the trauma, but these are really about how we start to help ourself through it.
