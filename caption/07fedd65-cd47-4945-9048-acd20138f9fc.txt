00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,940
Hey, it's Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,440
In this lecture, we'll do

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,305
our first formal analysis
in the MPLS dataset.

4
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:20,340
We're going to use the
Paired t-test to perform

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,070
a hypothesis test for a change in

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,190
the test scores between the
fifth and eighth grade.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,830
We're also going to
see what happens if

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,155
you tried to analyze
the same data,

9
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,490
ignoring that within
student correlation.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,470
Our previous graphical analysis,

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,900
we created a spaghetti
plot that certainly

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,585
showed an apparent
increase in test scores.

13
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,940
But a formal hypothesis
test is required.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,870
A simple way to test for a
change in scores between

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,110
fifth and eighth grade is
to drop the scores from

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,705
sixth and seventh grade and
treat these is paid data.

17
00:00:56,705 --> 00:01:00,590
This is now the scenario
designed for the Paired t-test.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,990
Note that I said this is

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,465
a simple and valid
analysis technique,

20
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,430
but it certainly is not optimal.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,655
For one, we are now
ignoring half of the data,

22
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,855
which is obviously not ideal.

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:14,500
We are also dropping
students that do not have

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,065
both a fifth eighth
grade test score.

25
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:18,745
There are eight such students,

26
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,635
even in this simple example.

27
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,630
While the Paired t-test is not

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,690
the optimal analysis strategy,

29
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,015
it does provide some valuable
insight into analyzing

30
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,900
correlated outcome data and is

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,890
definitely worth
considering in more detail.

32
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,469
As a reminder, the Paired
t-test corresponds

33
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,665
to a null hypothesis
of Mu_diff equal to 0,

34
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,900
where Mu_diff is
the mean change in

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,025
student test score between
fifth and eighth grade.

36
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,385
A value of zero for Mu_diff,

37
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,445
would indicate that on average,

38
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:51,955
students scores do
not change over time.

39
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:55,430
We'll consider the two-sided
alternative hypothesis

40
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,680
that Mu-diff is not equal to 0,

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,125
corresponding to a
change in scores.

42
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,420
The Paired t-test is performed in

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,260
R using the t.test function.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,640
The parameters that
need to be passed to

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,400
t.test or the fifth
grade reading scores,

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,140
the eighth grade reading scores,

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,900
and we need to set the
paired option to true.

48
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,495
By default, this option
is set to false,

49
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,210
which would perform a
Two-sample t-test that

50
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,740
ignores the correlation between

51
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,540
scores on the same student.

52
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,085
Later in this video,

53
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,440
we will perform the
Two-sample t-test

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,315
on the same data
to see the effect.

55
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:35,020
Here's the output that R
returns for the Paired t-test.

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,690
We see that the test
statistic is negative

57
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,290
5.5 with degrees of
freedom equal to 13,

58
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,030
corresponding to a P value of

59
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,075
9.4 times 10 to the minus fifth.

60
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,780
That's a very small p-value
and strong evidence to reject

61
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,090
the null hypothesis
that test scores do

62
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,775
not change between the
fifth and eighth grades.

63
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,400
We now have a formal
statistical tests

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,335
confirming that
student reading scores

65
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,055
are changing over time.

66
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,880
Notice that the evidence
here is quite strong.

67
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,760
Even using only half the
data at our disposal,

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,175
just the fifth and
eighth grade test scores

69
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:12,320
and dropping several students
because of missing data.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,120
We did however account for

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,095
the correlation which you are
about to see is critical.

72
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:22,160
Now, let's imagine we tried
to analyze the same data

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,335
without accounting
for the correlation

74
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,765
between test scores
on the same student.

75
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:28,610
What would that analysis look

76
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,225
like and how would
the results differ?

77
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:33,740
Ignoring the
correlation means that

78
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,005
we are treating the
two sets of scores,

79
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:39,425
those from fifth and eighth
grades as independent,

80
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,260
and is intuitively like
dropping the lines that

81
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,815
connect measurements between
scores on the same students.

82
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,510
A more common way to

83
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,940
visualize independent
measurements collected

84
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,770
on two different groups would

85
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,160
be with side-by-side boxplots.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,540
We would analyze these data using

87
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,460
a Two-sample t-test for

88
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,345
difference in means
between the two groups.

89
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,350
The Two- sample test would be

90
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,830
the appropriate approach for
a cross-sectional design in

91
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,080
which reading test
scores were collected on

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,110
a different set of fifth
graders and eighth graders,

93
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,390
making all the
scores independent.

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,310
That's a very different scenario

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,660
than the repeated measure

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,935
longitudinal design that
actually exists in MPLS.

97
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:24,770
Let's push ahead with
the Two-sample t-test

98
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,554
and see what happens.

99
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:29,060
The only change to the code is

100
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,070
to switch the paired
option back to

101
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,405
true and the t.test function
in R. Here's the new output.

102
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:41,230
The test statistic
is now negative 1.9.

103
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,785
A big drop from the test
statistic of the Paired t-test.

104
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,640
The degrees of freedom increase
in the Two-sample t-tests

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,590
because it incorrectly
thinks we have

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,355
more independent data
than we actually have,

107
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:55,120
and the p-value is very

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,295
different for the
Two-sample t-tests.

109
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:00,820
We now have p equal to 0.065,

110
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,430
which is clearly less
evidence against the null.

111
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,965
That an alpha level
of five percent,

112
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:08,920
we would not reject the null
hypothesis of no change

113
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,040
in test scores.
What happened here?

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,140
We analyze the same data but

115
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,570
got to very different results.

116
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,070
While both the Paired t-test and

117
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,990
the Two-sample t-test see

118
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,755
a similar change in the
mean for test scores,

119
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,250
the two tests view

120
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,330
the variability in that
change very differently.

121
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,425
Variability plays a critical,

122
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:31,580
although somewhat under

123
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,450
appreciated role in
statistical inference.

124
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,960
The Two-sample t-test use

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,155
the fifth and eighth
grade test scores

126
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,720
as measurements from
two independent sets

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,490
of students and therefore,

128
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,270
accounts for variability
in both groups.

129
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,270
Remember, the Two-sample t-test
assumes all outcomes are

130
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,335
independent based on our
previous correlation analysis.

131
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,155
We know this is not true
for the reading scores.

132
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,120
Analyzing these data with

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,650
the Two-Sample t-test

134
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,050
violates the
independence assumption.

135
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,755
Alternatively, the
Paired t-test inherently

136
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,495
understands that these data

137
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,115
are actually two measurements,

138
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,880
each on just one set of students.

139
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,185
By acknowledging the correlation

140
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,645
and treating the
students as one group.

141
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,850
The test has only one source

142
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,785
of variability to account for.

143
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,240
The difference between

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,520
the Two-sample and
Paired t-test is subtle.

145
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,580
But the concept of
how they differ in

146
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,955
their treatment of
variability is important,

147
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:33,290
and as you saw in this example,

148
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,450
it can be the difference
between rejecting

149
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,640
the null hypothesis
when our assumptions

150
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,680
are valid versus failing

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,529
to reject when the
assumptions are violated.

152
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,025
That concludes our
first formal analysis

153
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,125
of the MPLS data.

154
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,970
The Paired t-test is

155
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,830
a statistical technique that

156
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,870
you might already
be acquainted with,

157
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,430
but you probably didn't

158
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,875
associate it with
longitudinal data.

159
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,690
Although it is rather simple,

160
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,210
the Paired t-test
explicitly accounts for

161
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,315
correlation between measurements
on the same sample,

162
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,130
which is exactly the scenario

163
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,475
presented in
longitudinal studies.

164
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,450
In the MPLS data.

165
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,130
The Paired t-test provided

166
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,310
a formal statistical hypothesis
test for a change in

167
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,950
test scores that we had
previously only been

168
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,390
able to address with plots

169
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,280
and descriptive and statistics.

170
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,680
This example highlights
the benefits

171
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,915
of repeated measures
study design,

172
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,970
emphasized the
importance of using

173
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,770
appropriate statistical methods

174
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,770
to analyze correlated data,

175
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,050
and showed how ignoring
correlation and assumptions of

176
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,459
independence can lead
to incorrect inference.
