1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,190
Everybody. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,440
So make sure, like we discussed on Tuesday, make sure you do watch the report.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:18,750
A lecture on drug nutrient interactions. It's not super long, but you will be responsible for that content.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,550
So if you watch the lecture and have questions, please reach out to me.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
But instead of having a specific class on that, I'll just have you watch it online.

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,210
So I'm going to let's get started so we can make sure we get through all of today's content.

7
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,910
So we're going to primarily talk about cystic fibrosis today.

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,980
But I do want to start just talking a little bit about COPD, because we do see these patients in the hospital.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,040
So chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, this is really considered an incurable condition.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,410
So by the time the lungs get to the point where this is diagnosed, it's not a anything that's reversible in terms of the damage to the tissue.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,590
So it is a condition that results in progressive obstruction and inflammation of the airways.

12
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:27,479
And usually COPD is caused by chronic bronchitis and or and so those are the two most common chronic conditions that then lead to this state,

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:37,050
which is which is diagnosis COPD. So it's really an umbrella term for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, emphysema and a range of other lung disorders.

14
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,780
So it results from airway obstruction and reduced inspiratory flow.

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:52,530
We'll get into much of the disease process, but essentially the lungs elastic recoil is reduced in airway resistance is increase.

16
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,440
So as this condition progresses, patients will have what we call an increased work of breathing.

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:08,040
So that takes a lot of of energy on behalf of the patient is on the lungs to have a normal kind of respiration.

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,990
So it increases 10 to 20 times that of a person with normal lung function.

19
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,599
Okay. So smoking is the leading cause of COPD.

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,480
And if you think about the underlying conditions that lead to COPD, especially emphysema,

21
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:36,010
smoking is kind of the main or the most common cause of death, so therefore it's most common cause of COPD.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,020
So medical treatments can slow the progression of COPD, but again, can't reverse the damage that's been done to the alveoli within that, within it.

23
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,730
So some treatments that patients may be on include oxygen therapy, so they may be on it what we call supplemental oxygen.

24
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,750
So they might be have a certain amount of oxygen at certain times of the day or some people might be had it pretty chronically.

25
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:11,350
So these are folks that might have an oxygen take with them for most hours of the day or sometimes just in certain types of space.

26
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:21,070
Also medication therapy. So these are some of these are inhaled, for example, dilator, so they can open up the lung passages.

27
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,840
Steroids also work to to lower inflammation in the lungs so they may be on steroids.

28
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,390
And then other agents, like new political agents, to help loosen up these mucus so they can expel it a little bit easier.

29
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,370
And some of this will kind of transfer into our discussion of sensitive and also maybe

30
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,379
potentially prone to more frequent infections because of their reduced lung capacity.

31
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:59,050
So they may be up into that. You'll hear about these patients going into the pulmonary rehab programs.

32
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:06,550
And so what that usually involves, it's kind of like comprehensive pulmonary care.

33
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:14,140
So if you see like referred to pulmonary rehab, that may include education sessions discussing breathing techniques.

34
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,300
So how to do techniques to maybe make that just the simple act of, you know,

35
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,729
breathing a little bit easier for these patients might include medication management,

36
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:34,360
oxygen therapy, different exercises they can do to help maintain lung function.

37
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,100
Also, nutrition education sessions I've done. This was years ago.

38
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,700
I was invited to speak to like a support group.

39
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,540
And we talked about nutrition for these these patients energy conservation techniques.

40
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,569
So also individualized sessions to go over test program recommendations, different exercises.

41
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,420
So you will see this like pulmonary rehab type of program for these patients.

42
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,649
And then for some patients, you know, surgery might be. Necessary or an option for them.

43
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,720
So it could be what's called a lung volume reduction surgery.

44
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:23,060
And this is a surgical procedure to remove disease or the ability of the part of the one that's had the most damage to the emphysema.

45
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,709
And this will reduce the size of an overinflated lung.

46
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,850
So the lungs tend to over inflate and because they can't then expel the air as well.

47
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,440
So the lung damage happens over inflation.

48
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,540
So it removes some of the overinflated lung and it allows expansion of the remaining more functional parts of the lung.

49
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,249
And then there's also potential for a lung transplant.

50
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,170
And we'll we'll, of course, discuss that in the upcoming slides when we talk about severe.

51
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,270
Okay. So why even discuss these patients? There is some nutritional risk in it.

52
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,999
Can I bring it up just because this is a chronic kind of comorbid conditions?

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,420
So we'll see a lot of patients with maybe other diseases that also have COPD, but they can impact various things repertoires of nutrition.

54
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:24,130
So some examples of food, of meaning, issues that these individuals may include, may experience, include like a lot of coughing,

55
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,469
and that can impair not only the pleasure but the ability to eat social interactions during meal times.

56
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,720
It's very difficult. Also, these patients can be has an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia.

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:47,240
It's they're they're coughing a lot during meals potentially an increased risk that small particles will get into the lungs, which we don't address.

58
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,370
They do have limited mobility onset fatigue type.

59
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,430
So impairing ability to shop, prepare foods.

60
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,250
You know, cooking can be really, really tiring for people.

61
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:09,550
So if you already have a reduced capacity for for non mobility and all that, that that's something to consider as well due to the shortness of breath.

62
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,979
When this becomes more progressive, we do see unintentional weight loss.

63
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,600
So these patients also have a sense of abdominal fullness because of that,

64
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:30,970
sometimes that over inflation can kind of press in the cavity and they feel all bloated and that can affect their ability to eat well.

65
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:41,049
Also, a disinterest in eating due to the shortness of breath experiencing some patients experience dysphagia or dyspepsia.

66
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:48,490
That's just perhaps it's just indigestion. Another word for indigestion, of course, dysphagia affects your ability to swallow.

67
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,170
So a lot of this can just become kind of multifactorial. Also kind of tying into what we talked about a little bit on Tuesday,

68
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:03,879
patients are more prone to dental disease and dry mouth, secondary to those breathing treatments, inadequate salivary flow.

69
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,620
All the medications are on. People that are prone to dental caries can then have mouth pain.

70
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,620
All this kind of takes time to get to this point, but that's a consideration as well in these patients.

71
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,650
So in terms of energy needs, energy needs may be either increased or decreased in the in these patients,

72
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,510
depending on on what kind of their overall picture looks like.

73
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,950
So factors that would influence them. Either way, an increased worker breathing could increase their energy needs.

74
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,400
Chronic infections, test, physical therapy, pulmonary rehab program.

75
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:53,040
All of these would probably increase their energy needs. There can be altered metabolism that may elevate or even lower their energy needs.

76
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,130
That's what kind of the the discordant effect can happen there.

77
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,250
So some of these patients are overweight and sedentary.

78
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,510
So that would be maybe a situation that there there need to be decreased.

79
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,020
But as this disease progresses and they become sick or we can see that they can start losing weight,

80
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,470
become this in their needs, may be a little bit higher.

81
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:29,760
Also, they are prone to be on steroid therapy, which can make their needs a little bit less because they can become more routine fluid.

82
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,620
Some people gain weight on steroids because of appetite increases.

83
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,340
Blood sugar control can be difficult. So lots of kind of divergent things going on potentially in these patients.

84
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,970
So what does our nutrition intervention look like, really? Is maintaining or restoring optimal nutrition status?

85
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,810
So this is usually these patients can be maintained on oral intake or supplemental nutrition,

86
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,450
not necessarily enteral or parenteral nutrition unless they're really,

87
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:09,769
really having difficulty consuming food by mouth, but preventing continued weight loss if they are losing weight even in our overweight patients.

88
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,050
So maintaining their weight, maintaining body mass is the priority.

89
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:25,240
So just some nutrition intervention strategies that we can do in the hospital setting, expanding their diet order.

90
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,440
Removing restrictions to help encourage oral intake.

91
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,890
Individualized meal plans to meet their specific energy and nutrition needs, of course, may be important.

92
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,540
Talk about this a lot that a lot of patient populations do benefit from small, frequent mini meals and snacks.

93
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,950
So this is especially true for this population where they do have shortness of breath.

94
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,490
So a large meal can be very tiring.

95
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,819
And also, if they're already experiencing abdominal fullness, that's going to be even more uncomfortable for small frequent meals.

96
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:06,100
It's usually much better tolerated. Food choices that are easy to chew and swallow can also be beneficial,

97
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:13,239
especially if they have really significant shortness of breath or dental issues.

98
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,830
All of that can be can help. So sometimes things that are easy to prepare, so that can be helpful.

99
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,350
Patients are always looking for those types of tips. Sometimes that's not always an easy thing.

100
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,260
I know myself as a dietitian, when patients ask for meal plans, that's like my least favorite thing to do.

101
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:41,450
But a lot of times it's really helpful to try and provide practical tips on what they actually should be eating that maybe they're.

102
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,780
Some parents will rely on nutrient dense nourishment or food supplements to help optimize their energy and protein intake,

103
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,880
as well as vitamins and minerals.

104
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:05,430
Sometimes they will need to be on supplements for vitamin and mineral deficit and can be some medication interactions with the steroids.

105
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:17,290
That's especially true with calcium and vitamin D, so bone density, but also with blood sugar control, especially if they have comorbid diabetes.

106
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,460
That can really complicate the picture as well if they're on steroids.

107
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,859
Other things that may come up, not necessarily with the dietitian, of course, we can discuss that.

108
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:35,250
But in pulmonary rehab is proper sitting posture, sequencing of sequencing of their breathing and swallowing for eating to prevent aspiration.

109
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:43,740
That's the important component. And then oxygen therapy, how do they stay on their oxygen and still eat well?

110
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,389
Sometimes that can be a challenge as well. So this is a really kind of an integer, as it should be for all of our patients,

111
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,630
but really interdisciplinary care for patients with really progressive pulmonary disease.

112
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:05,700
So not a whole lot on that in terms of anything else we need to discuss specifically.

113
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,770
But I just, you know, we're going to see more and more COPD as patients get older.

114
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,940
This this is just a condition I want you all to be aware of.

115
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:23,309
And there may be a role for dietitians there, but I spend most of our time today on talking about cystic fibrosis.

116
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,880
Is nobody familiar at all with cystic fibrosis?

117
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:35,040
Yes, a little bit at least heard of it. So I used to cover the adult patients in the hospital.

118
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:43,440
That was one of my services and this was a long time ago, 2010 ish.

119
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:52,320
So a lot has changed with CF. I'm always amazed when I give this lecture how different it is now compared to when I was practicing.

120
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,770
So we'll talk a little bit about that. So cystic fibrosis or CF,

121
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:05,309
as I'll probably refer to it most often is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that affects the lungs and the digestive system.

122
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,180
So there are some patients that may not have high growth involvement.

123
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,209
So it might just be lung, but usually it's both.

124
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,650
And I've seen maybe two patients where they did not have any lung involvement.

125
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,770
They just had digestive infiltration of C that is not common.

126
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,149
Usually it affects the lungs and the digestive system. Predominantly this is found in our patient population.

127
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:42,090
You can see some of the the epidemiology here. So survival has really significantly improved over the last few decades.

128
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,489
And I would say even like when I was practicing, medicine increased significantly.

129
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:55,830
So we had advances in diagnosis of much more widespread infant screening is done with faceoff in

130
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,150
there are new drugs and that's probably one of the things that's really helped with survival.

131
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,860
So now the predicted median age of survival is over 48 years.

132
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:15,839
I even saw a figure that's now it's closer to 50. And that's that's really significant in terms of how that has shifted with some subgroups on that.

133
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,390
But we do have effective newborn screening programs in place to identify CRF very early.

134
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:31,469
So every states CF newborn screening program begins with the blood test from the baby to check levels of a chemical made by the pancreas.

135
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,500
So this is called immuno reactive trypsin agent or an IRP.

136
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,680
And usually this is like the hill blood test that kills one infants.

137
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,790
So it's a pretty effective screening.

138
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,510
So there is a test used to confirm, does anybody know what we do, how we confirm a diagnosis?

139
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,969
So anyone hurt? Yeah. So it does it does have to do with sodium.

140
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:10,110
So it's called a sweat chloride test. So essentially that let's say there's a positive screening or they're kind of on the differential diagnosis,

141
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,120
they'll tell on the patch of the skin of the child, usually a baby.

142
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:25,620
They'll put a small amount of a substance that produces sweat and they'll send like a little bit of electrodes to the small patch to produce sweat,

143
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,150
and then they will test the amount of chloride in that sweat.

144
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:39,990
So a high level of chloride in the sweat confirms, and this will not tell us how mild or severe this condition will be,

145
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,400
but that can at least provide a pretty accurate diagnosis.

146
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,590
I want to say youth. So in the past, most patients were diagnosed after presenting with symptoms.

147
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,829
So that can lead to a delayed diagnosis. And we'll talk about the disease process.

148
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,670
We'll probably understand why that could be problematic if it's not caught early.

149
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,389
So the PSA test is for young children. They haven't yet developed the symptoms, just kind of potentially.

150
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,340
Yeah. So now that we have really the screening done during infancy, if they screened positive,

151
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:26,290
then they would probably go to that sweat for a test to either rule in or rule out irritable because their parents it is it's also more recessive.

152
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:33,340
So it's a genetic condition, but the survival is much better.

153
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,730
I say, okay, so let's look at the median predicted survival of patients with CF.

154
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:51,490
So this is based on data from 2019 and you can see children born that year with C F are predicted to live until 48 or so.

155
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,000
I know that's still really young, but that is a really remarkable achievement.

156
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:07,510
So that used to be you could see long time ago it was very, very low to childhood and it was very progressive disease.

157
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:17,440
So I think when I was kind of the main time when I was seeing these patients, you know, let's see, under 35.

158
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,090
And of course, the patients I saw were adults. You have patients in the hospital.

159
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:30,040
So these were this was a much different population. But I think most of my patients early twenties and I would see them really frequently.

160
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,649
It's really difficult population to work with because I would see them very often.

161
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:45,639
So developing that kind of relationship and I saw most of my main patients passed away at some point and they were very,

162
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,000
very young, so very difficult population to work with in that sense, but one that's really kind of dear to my heart.

163
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:04,810
So this is really quite incredible to see this picture from 2000 to 2000, 2015 to nearly ten, 15 years of life expectancy.

164
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,070
That's mostly due to a drug that I'll briefly explain.

165
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,900
All right, so what what's happening? This.

166
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Yeah, this is caused by a mutation in a gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

167
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,170
So the CFT RG there is a mutation in this gene and because of that,

168
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:38,920
the product of this gene is a chloride ion channel that's important in creating sweat, digestive juices and mucus.

169
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:46,150
So the de facto the mutation in this gene causes this mucus to be very thick and sticky.

170
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:58,210
So why is that problematic? Well, chronic cough and frequent infections can arise because of this really stiff Mukasey.

171
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,840
They're this really thick, sticky mucous. So in the GI tract, the mucus blocks the movement of digestive enzymes into the duodenum.

172
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,070
So that's a problem. These patients have malabsorption.

173
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,940
We'll talk about pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which they will be on.

174
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:25,180
So they can't digest food well, because of this mucus blocking those pancreatic enzymes, getting into the duodenum.

175
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,870
When the thick mucus is in the lungs, they can't clear infections.

176
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:41,320
It almost like traps, microorganisms that then they can't really expel because it's just kind of in there, kind of like glue.

177
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:52,299
So they have really frequent infections in the lung, very serious infections, a lot of respiratory issues, a lot of antibiotic resistance.

178
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,780
So these patients are in the hospital quite often.

179
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,890
Yes. So it's just the consistency of antibiotics?

180
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:11,170
I don't think so. I think it's really has to do with that resistance, but it's so significant that it's not able to function properly.

181
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:21,870
Okay. As I mentioned, chronic cough and frequent infections are the most common respiratory symptoms.

182
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,380
So the lungs of individuals with CF almost always become colonized and infected by bacteria.

183
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,600
This is from an early age, so these patients early on have lung infections.

184
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,870
These bacteria can spread among individuals with severe where they thrive in the biscuits, mucus in the airways, in the lungs.

185
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,140
So sometimes you'll hear like. We don't want S.F. patients to be hanging out with each other.

186
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,970
It's really it's sad because you want that camaraderie.

187
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:01,490
Camaraderie. I had a lot of patients that because they were in the hospital, like they would date each other.

188
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,670
And that's really, really dangerous for these patients because they will trade infection very, very easily.

189
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,020
So you'll see different protocols where they try to keep S.F. patients,

190
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,420
fortunately separate from each other just because they are such a risk to each other because of the infection.

191
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,700
So this thick mucus encourages the development of bacterial bacterial microenvironment.

192
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,750
So and these are difficult for immune cells and antibiotics to penetrate.

193
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,520
So they they colonize. They're difficult to clear in.

194
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,899
And it's it's really unfortunate.

195
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:45,469
This is the main cause for why we have patients in in other hospitals, because they have what we call a exacerbation.

196
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,560
And usually that's due to an infection. Okay.

197
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,470
So in the digestive tract we talked about, this mucus blocks the movement of digestive enzymes into the duodenum.

198
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:06,510
So insufficient production of the pancreatic enzymes is often referred to as pancreatic insufficiency.

199
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:15,360
So that's the term you'll see often in terms of CRF with pancreatic insufficiency.

200
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,160
Most patients will have that.

201
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:25,290
There are some that this is maybe a little bit more mild for some, but most will have this because of the lack of digestive enzymes.

202
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,420
So due to that, they'll have difficulties absorbing fat soluble vitamins.

203
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:41,550
So is Ada. So Ada and K, they will be on supplementation and we usually give them a water mrpl form of these vitamins for better absorption.

204
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,799
We'll talk about that a little bit more. Okay.

205
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,030
So pancreatic function tends to decline with age as well.

206
00:23:51,030 --> 00:24:00,390
So across all age groups, approximately 9% of patients with CF will have pretty market pancreatic insufficiency.

207
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,960
So the vast majority will. So we'll get into that a little bit more.

208
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:15,230
There's also in terms of other digestive issues. So there is a condition like this called gladiolus.

209
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,270
So this is distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, obstruction syndrome,

210
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,770
and this is characterized by thickened feces blocking the intestinal epithelial sickle cell.

211
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,160
So it's really thick feces that is essentially not moving.

212
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:38,210
So really significant constipation, very uncomfortable, obviously, but also nutritionally at risk patients.

213
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:45,770
This really affects appetite. So this is something we always have to be aware of in this patient population.

214
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,460
And we talk about doing bowel habits a lot because of the malabsorption.

215
00:24:52,820 --> 00:25:01,580
So that's one way we kind of detect if they are still experiencing malabsorption is what their stool looks like and how often they're going.

216
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,150
Yeah, I was also affected.

217
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,530
You? Yeah, I don't think, actually.

218
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,600
Well, that's a good question.

219
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:22,909
I can't say for sure if the gallbladder is it shouldn't be affected by the disease process, but the bile acid movement, maybe so.

220
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,530
Maybe not the organ itself, but the bile acid that you're saying,

221
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:41,299
like the mechanism for just providing that soluble vitamins are really if you think about the pancreas releasing and we'll talk about I think it might

222
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:49,280
connect a little bit more when we talk about the pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy because we dose it according to the amount of light piece,

223
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:01,520
which is the enzyme that helps break down fat. So that's impacted and that will then affect the ability to utilize fat soluble vitamins.

224
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:11,030
Yeah. In the stuff that bile salts like it's not as efficiently utilized.

225
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:20,600
Yeah. So I don't think it has maybe do with the secondary ability, but then the ability to use that bile acid in those salts is effective.

226
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,830
Yeah. So what's the difference between the stool and that is like how do you tell the difference?

227
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,090
Okay, so let's,

228
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:38,749
let's talk a little bit about fat in the stool and the science of because this is something we will talk about with our when I saw my S.F. patients,

229
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,600
they knew the question was coming, what do your stools look like? So Seattle, here is something we're looking for.

230
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,250
Evidence of fat malabsorption in the stool usually.

231
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,670
And I know we've talked about this briefly earlier in the semester.

232
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,479
Usually you can actually see evidence of fat.

233
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,790
So it might have an oily appearance in in the in the toilet.

234
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,410
Sometimes it's yellow in color and sometimes it'll float because there's a high amount of fat.

235
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,659
So we'll ask we'll ask them, is it sinking or floating?

236
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,320
What what color is it? Can you see evidence of oil?

237
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,380
And there is a very distinctive smell for for fat malabsorption in the stool.

238
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:36,800
Any nurse can tell you that it has its its own odor so that we know that that can be problematic versus mucus in the stool.

239
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,750
That's highly subjective. I get so many patients with food intolerances that talk about mucus in the stool.

240
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,850
So I think it's much more variable. It can look maybe similar in terms of.

241
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:59,680
Maybe potentially floating or streaking the stool, but the fat would be usually yellow.

242
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,860
Or you could see a presence of oil and it tends to float.

243
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,110
Okay. This I only have one slide on c f for diabetes.

244
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,519
We can have a whole session on this.

245
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:19,839
But, you know, we think about this pancreatic insufficiency, the role of the pancreas will get much more into next semester.

246
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,060
So not only digestive enzymes, but insulin release, right?

247
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,360
So the pancreas plays a role in insulin.

248
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,390
So patients can develop what we call C.F. related diabetes.

249
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,690
So this is C, R, D, this is different than it's not just like type one diabetes.

250
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:47,380
They may have both, but this is its own kind of diagnosis and it has features of type one and type two.

251
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,510
So damage of the pancreas can lead to a loss of the islet cells.

252
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,330
Those are the cells that will secrete insulin.

253
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,570
So less damage to those cells, which can lead to a relative insulin deficiency.

254
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,560
So the pancreas is not producing insulin adequately.

255
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,049
Does anybody know what that kind of represents? Type one and type two, there's an insulin deficiency type one, right?

256
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,410
So you're not producing insulin in healthy cells with that, the other cells.

257
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:31,000
Yep. Yes. So in terms of type two diabetes, they can also over time develop insulin resistance.

258
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,590
So it's kind of a mixed, mixed picture of insulin deficiency.

259
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:43,030
And then insulin resistance compounded on the fact that a lot of times these patients are on systemic steroids that treat lung infections,

260
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,350
that makes the glucose metabolism more difficult to control.

261
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:58,050
Okay. So it shares type one and type two characteristics and is one of the principal non pulmonary complications of C.

262
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:08,550
Okay. So let's see. So sometimes if they have C.F. related diabetes, they will have to be on insulin.

263
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:19,499
And that complicates this picture because these patients are on so many medications, treatments, nutritional supplements, vitamins, enzymes.

264
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:28,290
So then we add insulin to the picture. It's a lot to manage, so that can really complicate the picture for them.

265
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:37,889
And I would say one thing I'll say development of C.F. related diabetes is associated with worsening lung function,

266
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,280
poor nutritional status and more chest infections.

267
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:49,079
And when we look at longitudinal studies of patients with C, f, r t have decreased survival,

268
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,950
which is like six fold compared to patients that don't develop diabetes.

269
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,490
So significant increases in mortality.

270
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,720
Yes, there is a point of age as we develop more support of this different you know, that's a good question.

271
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,889
I think it could be different for everybody.

272
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:19,890
I would maybe lean more towards later in life just because it is kind of like progressive in terms of the continued damage to the pancreas.

273
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,290
With that insulin deficiency, the insulin resistance develops more over time.

274
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:35,550
So we've seen kids with that. Have it worked with C up in kids, but I would say maybe more in the adult years is where I would expect to see it.

275
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:44,910
And so it's beside itself or like what, what, what sort of like lifestyle.

276
00:31:45,570 --> 00:32:00,270
I mean, yeah, potentially if they just were, I would say it's probably related more to the severity of their disease, but different lifestyle.

277
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:09,480
My experience with this population is there is a lot going on and sometimes because this is a tends to be a younger population

278
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:18,210
compliance is but their medication treatments that rate I don't want to generalize that was like the patients I would see often.

279
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,459
We had huge compliance issues because they were just overwhelmed or just tired

280
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,360
of always feeling terrible and they could sick with with their treatment.

281
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,890
So that could probably make more severe disease that may then encourage this a little bit more.

282
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:43,920
Maybe there are some genetic susceptibility to getting this versus not that, but it probably has to do with severity of the disease.

283
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah.

284
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:56,150
So what percent of patients do you see with this like is this pretty common for people to develop or is it something that like as you get older with?

285
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,680
CF Yeah. Or patients, I tend to see it more.

286
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,550
As they get older, they might be more likely to be diagnosed.

287
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,590
How common usually have some epidemiology data here?

288
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:19,829
I don't know. I could find out, though, what the latest numbers are on what like what is the prevalence of cf r d among patients?

289
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:29,330
I can find that out for us. That would be good to know. Okay.

290
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:39,499
So I want to talk a little bit about medical treatment. So nowadays, I would say probably most patients should or would undergo what's called C.F.

291
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:49,790
TR So that's that gene genotyping to determine if they carry a mutation that makes them eligible for this CFR modulator therapy.

292
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,820
Okay, so this is like the newer medication. That's why you've seen so much improvement in survival.

293
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,750
These are new class of drugs. I think we can still call it know, but that by improving production,

294
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:11,060
intracellular processing and or a function of that defective gene protein, the protein on that gene.

295
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:17,749
So I think they have to kind of meet criteria that they would benefit from this particular drug.

296
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,920
But it's it's been really kind of a significant change in terms of how we can change.

297
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,670
The other treatment really begins with airway clearance.

298
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:37,079
So a lot of patients in the hospital, they'll be inhaled airway clearance agents.

299
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,220
So things that they're inhaling to help break up that mucus so that they can expel it a little bit easier.

300
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:53,480
There's also something called. So this post, you're all drainage and percussion.

301
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:02,420
This is interesting. I would go in and talk to my patients and they'd be on their side and the the physical therapist would be in there,

302
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:11,880
you know, pounding on their back, trying to break up that lupus so they can do it with like an old RPG that will do that.

303
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,469
Or sometimes they can even wear like a vest that will do it for them.

304
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:22,310
And it's really just kind of basically tapping on the the back and near the lungs to break up that mucus.

305
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,260
Antibiotics are often on antibiotics.

306
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:34,790
So this is to help prevent loss of lung function when a pulmonary exacerbation is expected, suspected, and that's really an infection.

307
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:44,959
So an exacerbation is characterized by a decline in lung function, increased cough and or sputum production and decreased appetite and weight loss.

308
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,040
And that's a lot of times almost every time a patient was admitted to the hospital.

309
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,010
The chief reason, our chief complaint, they would write F exacerbation.

310
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,049
So it's not just one thing, it's just kind of like an overall decline in their current setting.

311
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:06,410
They come in, maybe need some nutrition support, I.V. antibiotics in use.

312
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:12,250
They get a culture of the sputum to to look at the pathogen and try and select that the best.

313
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:18,739
A lot of a lot of the pathogens are antibiotic resistant because these patients are always on antibiotics.

314
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,680
So that's why they're often can't be hospitalized very, very often.

315
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,190
Okay. All right.

316
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:39,240
So lung transplant. So that will become necessary for individuals with CF as lung function to decline.

317
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,970
So many, many patients, I don't have the exact percentage I can find out.

318
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:52,070
In my experience, the vast majority, because I saw maybe the sicker population, if they were eligible,

319
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,180
eligible would reach a point where they'd have to be considered for a double lung transplant.

320
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,160
So it often becomes necessary as their lung function decline.

321
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,330
So usually it requires a double lung transplant.

322
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,389
Although a single lung transplant is possible and other diseases individuals with CF usually have to have both

323
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:20,020
ones replaced because the remaining lung could contain bacteria that would infect them that transplant as lung.

324
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,100
So often it does require a double lung transplant.

325
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:29,950
So on rare occasions, patients may also go a pancreatic or liver transplant, sometimes at the same time,

326
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,650
and that can alleviate the liver disease and diabetes that they may also experience.

327
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:44,470
So I've seen a couple of patients that have kind of the whole the whole deal, their double lung and liver transplant at the same time.

328
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,520
So you can imagine how big of an operation that is.

329
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:57,549
Usually when they get to a point that you require that you're not in great shape so that these patients are very high risk,

330
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:05,410
so nutritionally and otherwise, but they do a double lung transplants are pretty successful.

331
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,739
They do improve life expectancy, as we know.

332
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,950
Eventually those lungs will also become damaged due to the C.

333
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,180
So the CF doesn't go away, but it does by the survival time.

334
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,560
That may be your question. How long does it last with genetic ones?

335
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:31,750
Still, eventually, yes, but their survival can greatly improve with the lung transplant.

336
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:42,010
Okay. Let's see. So a lot of patients in the hospital setting, if you ever get to work with these patients,

337
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,950
sometimes they're in their hospitals until once they become available like they're that sick, they can't go home.

338
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:54,620
They have to wait for the on the transplant list until they get the call and they can go in for their transplant.

339
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,500
So often those patients are on until attrition as we're awaiting that big surgery.

340
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:09,849
All right. Okay. Let's talk about nutritional issues. There are a lot there is a combination, of course, of malabsorption.

341
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,990
We see there's increased energy needs, potential for reduced appetite.

342
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:22,060
So increased entry requirements, why increase worker breathing and frequent infections?

343
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,140
Both of these things will raise their their energy needs.

344
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:32,920
These are highly catabolic patients. And I'm talking more of like our sicker patients that we'll see in the hospital.

345
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,000
Very high energy. There's malabsorption.

346
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,049
Remember, more than 90% of our patients have pancreatic insufficiency that can result in chronic nutrient inversion.

347
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:51,250
So they in addition to having very increased nutrient requirements, they also have pretty significant degree of malabsorption.

348
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,379
These are sick patients. They feel terrible. They do not want to eat.

349
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,560
They don't have an appetite. Their energy is really low and usually there's GI issues, maybe they're constipated.

350
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,170
Coughing constantly makes eating very difficult.

351
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:19,179
So it's kind of like this really difficult trifecta and we're constantly pushing them to eat, like just always pushing food, fat, all this.

352
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,100
And patients get really fatigued on that, like always having to eat.

353
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,840
So a lot of patients have told me that like they just it's hard.

354
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,740
They feel like we do three meals, three snacks a day. They feel like they're always eating.

355
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,280
They're so full, like it's it's really complicated.

356
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:45,460
And then so they are also at increased risk for bone disease. So this is characterized by decreased mineral density, increased fracture rates,

357
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,560
kyphosis, which is just like a an excessive outward curvature of the spine.

358
00:40:50,620 --> 00:41:00,329
This can cause hunching of the back. So part of their risk for bone disease comes from difficulty absorbing vitamin D, but also the chronic steroids.

359
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:06,280
So a lot of patients are on steroids between open and interfere with calcium and vitamin D absorption.

360
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,020
It makes it at risk for that too.

361
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,920
Sure. Yeah, I'm a transported into the. Yeah.

362
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,800
That's also part of supply, so. Sure. Okay.

363
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,650
So energy needs calorie requirements.

364
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,910
If you look in the literature increased by 120 to 150%.

365
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:40,030
In my experience, in real world, it's much higher. I mean, we would be giving these patients so many calories and they still lose weight.

366
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:52,930
So I would say this these may be a good place to start, but for what I've seen, it can be much, much higher, especially for our young adult males.

367
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,890
They just said we over £50 per kg and we haven't seen any weight maintenance there.

368
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,320
So often these patients will have to have feeding tubes in place for supplemental nutrition.

369
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,559
So we may give them at night so they can just run their two feedings at night and

370
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,170
then they'll be free during the day to eat and go about their other therapies,

371
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,760
or even more commonly do what's called a bolus feeding.

372
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:27,999
So often these patients will have a permanent feeding tube, which we'll talk about next, next semester,

373
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,200
where they have like a port in their belly and they can deliver their their nutrition and then kind of be done with it for the time.

374
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:45,220
So we'll have them eat their meal as normal and then they'll kind of bolus like basically rapidly infuse like a can of formula after their meal.

375
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,649
And we'll do that three or four times a day. Some patients prefer that as opposed to running that open.

376
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,920
I feel just like now I'll just always set four times a day.

377
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,310
I'll figure it out. So we won't get into the nitty gritty of today.

378
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,990
We'll do that next semester, but we use it to work weekends.

379
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:13,340
Formula Why would that be beneficial in a population that's like this that's probably eating as well?

380
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,760
We want a formula with the most calories and the smallest amount of volume.

381
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:30,730
Right? So we'll use that not to be an example, but like, hey, if we can get 500 calories in through eight ounces like a cup,

382
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,150
that's going to be better than something that's like 200 calories per cup.

383
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:41,049
So calorically dense formulas not necessary to use the same elemental formula.

384
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:48,760
I may not know what that even is referring to, but we have different enteral formulas that are partially broken down.

385
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,799
So the proteins are hydrolyzed, so they make absorption a little bit easier.

386
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,950
If you think about patients with pancreatic insufficiency,

387
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:04,000
they're not utilizing the protease, the like base of amylase as well to break down nutrients.

388
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,440
So you would think maybe a formula is partially broken that would be better.

389
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:17,770
We really don't see that that makes a difference. As long as we're properly dosing their pancreatic enzymes, they can use just a standard formula.

390
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,960
Yeah. So do you see a difference in the stool with the semi elemental formula?

391
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:30,580
Um, there may be, there is a rule for this.

392
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:39,670
So if they're still having continuous signs of malabsorption, even if we max up their enzymes, then we might switch to something like that.

393
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,980
Or if they're continuing to lose weight, we'd say, let's try a semi elemental or meal as we work to try it.

394
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:55,570
You see improvement there. So sometimes, sometimes more, sometimes the patients are so eating we want them to maintain eating.

395
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,450
So this is supplemental. So you might not see as big of a change.

396
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,610
There's always some subtle changes when somebody starts on on actual nutrition, definitely.

397
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,889
But usually that self corrects. Okay.

398
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:17,219
So there is a positive correlation between BMI and something we call the CB one.

399
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,590
So this is the force inspiratory volume.

400
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:29,060
And one second, it's just kind of a measure of, of lung function, lung capacity, especially in adults with CFS.

401
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,510
So the higher the BMI, the better their CV one.

402
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,820
So we'll look at a couple of grass back. Okay.

403
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,149
So you can see here, this is in young children and young adults.

404
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,210
So this is their 51 over here.

405
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,050
And there'll be a high percentiles on kids. We use BMI percentile.

406
00:45:50,470 --> 00:46:03,010
And you can see as they get to that 50th percentile, their 51 is is improved and then it tends to get even better with higher.

407
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,120
But that would be kind of like the sweet spot if we could get them near that 50 percentile.

408
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:15,579
That can be really, really hard to do. Potentially better as well might be better, but are being the eyes of kids.

409
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,790
But that could be potentially a lofty goal.

410
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,810
But that's that's a good goal because then we see improvement in their lung function.

411
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,350
So if we look at adults, so this is their B one versus BMI for males and females.

412
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:37,839
So the goal for a female is a BMI of 22 is where we see significant benefit.

413
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,920
So that's always a goal for males. It's a BMI 23.

414
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:52,660
In my experience, almost all my adult patients were less than 18 and very for our sickest patients, this was very difficult.

415
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,260
And I think it's probably much better now, again, even over the last 10 to 15 years.

416
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,530
But we do have those specific numbers. So ideal for females is about 20 to 23.

417
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:14,740
For males, we see improved survival, quality of life, just overall, overall improvement in their lung function.

418
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:24,650
Okay. This is looking at median nutritional outcomes and in terms of nutritional outcomes, in referring to BMI, height and weight.

419
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:34,879
In patients with CF over time. So you can see how we have seen a pretty good improvement over time in different

420
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,820
outcomes with regard to just kind of weight based measurement anthropometric here.

421
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:48,980
So we've had significant progress in people with CF. So this is something to kind of keep in mind,

422
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:59,210
not going to bring that up a little bit later where as now we might have some issues with excessive intake

423
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:06,110
like overfeeding these patients because they are they are driving a little bit better than in years past.

424
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:14,590
Okay. So we want to talk about this pancreatic insufficiency cause that the dietician will be involved in this.

425
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,730
So these patients that have pancreatic insufficiency, remember, this is like 94,

426
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,979
90% or so of our population need to be on supplemental pancreatic time.

427
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,300
So they're going to take enzyme replacement at all meals and snacks.

428
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,780
There are two things. We dose them to their two feedings as well. So how do we do this?

429
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,260
So I want you guys, when you're doing your C.F. case study,

430
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,870
there's going to be a question about you're going to look at this patient's current enzyme regimen,

431
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:51,140
look at what the patient is experiencing and see if they would benefit from maybe an adjustment there.

432
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:59,870
So how we have two methods on dosing. Take this enzyme so we can use like light pace of units of light pace.

433
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:08,660
That's how these are dosed. We'll look at some examples per kilogram of body weight per meal and units of light pace per gram of fat.

434
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,030
Which one do you think is better is more often used?

435
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:22,280
Yeah, but weight base. Right. So because if we're dosing per gram effective soon, we have to know how much fat.

436
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:30,870
So where would this be helpful? I heard it, yes, the third time.

437
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,090
So we know we know how much fat we're delivering.

438
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:41,710
So we can we can then dose it per gram of fat and getting them to be the most appropriate to use this is paise per kilogram per meal.

439
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:49,060
So the normal range is 500 to 2000 units of lipids per kilogram per meal.

440
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,840
There is a maximum dose that's kind of an asterisk.

441
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,670
We often don't exceed that maybe times four that is necessary.

442
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,990
There are some potential risks if we go too high.

443
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:08,290
So we often don't exceed 2500 units of pace per kilogram per meal or for if we're doing per gram of fat,

444
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,970
we do 500 to 4000 units of paise per gram of that.

445
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,410
Again, this is helpful for patients on two feedings.

446
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:23,940
Typically we give them 3 to 4 times a day, so we have a dose for each meal snack supplement it use of bit.

447
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,400
Just give a half dose of whatever we recommend at that time.

448
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,280
So very high doses can cause damage to the intestines.

449
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,560
So we have these kind of benchmarks of where we try not to exceed, but there may be maybe some wiggle room there.

450
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,980
So I know this is very small on your slides. I kind of tried to trim it down.

451
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,860
These are some examples of pancreatic enzyme replacements.

452
00:50:50,860 --> 00:51:00,700
So different brands I think needs to have created some pep in the hospital is also file case this one to be crushed and pushed through a feeding tube.

453
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:11,109
But you'll see these are just the different brands. So the number next to it is referring to the number of units of pace in that capsule.

454
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:16,510
So like the Korean 12 has 12,000 units of space per capsule.

455
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,679
Okay. So that's that's just kind of how it's it's labeled there.

456
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,120
So it is dose based on the units of like pace in the capsule.

457
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,640
Yes. If someone first diagnosed top ten.

458
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,470
To reveal that these are actually three criminals, that 30,000.

459
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,000
Yes, exactly. So that's what that will lead us into.

460
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,870
How do we recommend dosing for these patients?

461
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:53,690
Let's do an example. Let's say our patient was 45 kilograms.

462
00:51:54,140 --> 00:52:00,020
They've been prescribed Creon 24. So this provides 24 units of pace per capsule.

463
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:06,230
This patient has been maintained on 1500 units of pace per kilogram per meal.

464
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,280
Remember, if we go back, this is kind of our typical range.

465
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:18,020
Sometimes we start low and we work our way up. So this patient right now is 1500 units of pace per meal.

466
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:29,480
So if we multiply that times the weight of 45 kilograms, that gives us the same 60, almost 68,000 units of pace per meal.

467
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:39,410
Because everybody understand where that number comes from. It's just the dose that we're starting with, which is 1500 units per kilogram per meal.

468
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,770
So the 1500 units multiplied by their weight.

469
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:52,040
So we know how much we need and we're going to use Xn 24, which provides 24,000 units of space per capsule.

470
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:58,159
So we just divide what we think they need per meal divided by that 24,000.

471
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,010
So we know how many capsules they need at each meal. So that comes up to 2.8.

472
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,340
So we're going to say they need three capsules of Xn 24 with each meal.

473
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:13,070
Usually we do half at snacks, but I'll say we'll just go with two, three with meals, two with sex.

474
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,459
Does that make sense how we got to the number of capsules? Okay.

475
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:28,820
So keep in mind, these patients are on usually antibiotics, breathing treatments, oral medications, insulin.

476
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:35,150
They're on their multivitamin preparation. It's best to limit the number of capsules.

477
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:39,110
Okay. So we could do xn 12, right?

478
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:46,120
How many would they have to take? We just do, like, a rough estimate for doing three of 20 fours.

479
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:54,920
It has to take six. So if we can limit and condense the number of capsules, that helps improve compliance.

480
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:59,360
So imagine taking three pills instead of six number.

481
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:06,230
They're doing this at each meal and snap. So compliance can sometimes be better if we limit the number of pills.

482
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:19,340
So the patient leaves. You use the weight that you already agreed to give them or they've lost weight.

483
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:26,090
And now I that's a good question. Like let's say they've lost £10 in the past two weeks.

484
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:33,379
And if this is like a pretty acute weight loss and they've been at a stable weight,

485
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:40,280
I think you can make a case for dosing based on their usual weight, but most often I use their current week.

486
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,540
So they're actually if we going to make the adjustments in the hospital.

487
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,240
Okay. So best to limit the number of pills when feasible.

488
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,340
And the timing of the dosing is important. So they need to take them with their meals and snacks.

489
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:04,860
So it's not like they can just take them in the morning, you know, they have to take them with their meals and snacks.

490
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,280
So I always ask them, are you taking your enzymes?

491
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:17,370
Sometimes because they have so much going on, that is something that maybe gets put aside that they kind of just think of do.

492
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:24,610
And usually patients can be pretty on it's like maybe two out of the three meals I take them consistently, so that's important to ask.

493
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:30,510
So instead of just dosing, we need to ask are they actually taking them and what is the timing?

494
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:39,330
Are they taking them with their meals or at other times so that they see.

495
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,960
How might we think? I asked this in a later slide here.

496
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,480
We always want to know if this is like working or is there an effective dose?

497
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,790
What might tell us that it is not effective or maybe some adjustment?

498
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,710
What can you guys think of? Yeah. So, yeah.

499
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,170
So if there are let's say they've been maintained on the three packs with all meals

500
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:16,890
and into snacks for two years and you talk to them and there's been no adjustment.

501
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:25,740
If they're telling you they still have evidence of cereal like fat malabsorption, that might mean that they need an adjustment.

502
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,210
So evidence of continuing malabsorption and stools. What else might we look at?

503
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,900
If we were thinking they might need an adjustment. Yeah.

504
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:43,130
Right. Yeah. I'd say if they're continuing to lose weight now.

505
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,979
Weight loss. Granted, these are very sick patients. The weight loss is really multifactorial.

506
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:54,320
But if they're on a regimen and they're continuing to lose weight, that might be something they look at too.

507
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,700
Like, Can we optimize your enzyme replacement to see if we can help with absorption?

508
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:05,690
Yes, we have one answer. That's really why I want to look at this and have a website that you can put in,

509
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:10,370
how many like what the weight is, and then it gives you how much they should be having.

510
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,570
Okay. But I try to do it besides that.

511
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:20,060
And they only give you the case study. They only gave that she's taking 10,000.

512
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,850
That's a total. Correct. So daily should be taking that.

513
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:34,680
And that's a case study. It says that tell her to read thousand, but she's taking six capsules per meal and three capsules with every snack.

514
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,779
But that's 10,000 doesn't excuse it's probably 10,000 per capsule.

515
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:49,010
If she's on Zen pep, top ten or Korean ten, that's 10,000 per capsule, which would if she's taking six, that would be 60,000 at each meal.

516
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,190
So hopefully that's not unclear. But if it's if it's worded here, I'll take a look at it.

517
00:57:55,190 --> 00:58:00,050
But it's probably it'll be 10,000, perhaps also not total.

518
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:08,360
Okay. So yes, go ahead. Do they ever do like a couple of 10,000, something like a five to get?

519
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,250
Very good question.

520
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:21,230
I think it's usually the same cause they're going to have them. That would require two different prescriptions and that could get complicated for

521
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,490
so maybe for some really motivated patients that really want that could work.

522
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,180
And this is an estimate like this. It's 2.8.

523
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,540
Well, we're going to round up to three. So it's never going to be like, perfect.

524
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,100
Yeah, I've heard that doctor.

525
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,300
The doctor prescribed this diet ever.

526
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,460
Yes. Yeah, I know. Five patients have really good coordination.

527
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,520
Yes. So in my experience, again, I would round with the team.

528
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,700
So I would be there. We would go see all of our patients and talk about them as a group like physicians and

529
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,120
nurses and our discharge planner that the therapist and they will prescribe them.

530
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:12,200
But I mean, so, you know, I was talking to them. They've been on the same regimen for six months.

531
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,829
And they're still telling me they're having, you know, signs of fat and they're still they're continuing to lose weight.

532
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,340
I think we should bump up their so usually. Sure.

533
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,860
Like they'll sign off on that. So how we would adjust would be correct.

534
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,600
Yes, go ahead. How quickly do you go with sex?

535
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,700
That's a good question.

536
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:42,530
We would give it some time, I'd say a couple of weeks to make sure that and again, as long as they're taking them as prescribed this population,

537
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,240
that's not always easier given taking them as prescribed, I would say,

538
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,469
given how complex the whole condition is, we want to give them a little bit of time.

539
00:59:51,470 --> 01:00:03,740
So I'd say a couple of weeks might be fair, and sometimes the diet is wildly variable too, so that can be difficult to have a really high fat meal.

540
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,710
It's kind of just an overall global picture. It's over a couple of weeks.

541
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,830
It seems to be healthy. Yes.

542
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,580
So with this limitation, do you also do putting that through?

543
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,570
And so, yeah, sometimes.

544
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,990
So they'll be eating, they'll be on their enzymes and they'll be on to something.

545
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:30,440
We have to dose enzymes for the chickpeas as well. So if we are going to make a change.

546
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:43,520
Yes. Okay. I'm just confused. So, like, you don't we don't want to exceed 2500 units of like base, but per kilogram per meal.

547
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:53,530
Okay. Okay. That might be it's it's it's that's for if you're doing it by will, if you're doing it weight based.

548
01:00:53,540 --> 01:01:01,850
So it's based on their weight but also base like as a per kg that they weigh per meal is how we kind of think of this.

549
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,540
Okay. So this is you have like a 60 kilogram patient.

550
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:11,270
You know, that's there's you could do the math and you could see that it's a much,

551
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,850
much higher allowance because we're doing trying not to exceed 2500 units per kilogram per.

552
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:27,510
Just curious. When is too much? You're going to want to break down your own personal the risk of excessive.

553
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,379
I think it can have some scarring effect in the colon.

554
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,170
I think that's very rare. But it can happen.

555
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:44,379
It's like like they get this dose or they're taking like maybe they were on ten and were switched to twenties and now we're taking the same amount.

556
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,470
So and I think it has to be over long period of time.

557
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:53,620
Some patients have side effects with enzymes, or at least they report that.

558
01:01:53,620 --> 01:02:02,770
But it's pretty safe. You know, if we think about we're just replacing what they can't utilize in the body essentially or trying to.

559
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,569
So when we're adjusting a dose, let's say we're trying to go up,

560
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:14,890
I would start at the low end and go by go up by about 500 units of light pace per kilogram per meal as a starting point.

561
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:24,580
So if they were at 1500 and we're still thinking they if they could use more, we would go up to 2000 as a starting place.

562
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:33,160
Does that make sense? So maybe by like 500 as a starting price, and that's units per kilogram per meal.

563
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:44,720
Okay. And your practices with your study will determine if it needs to be adjustment.

564
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,579
Okay. So they will likely balance or fat soluble vitamins.

565
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:59,450
We talked about that. So back in the day when I was practicing, we just automatically gave them what will what we call a D that's twice a day.

566
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,790
Now, I think we it's more based on annual assessment.

567
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:14,990
So serum levels will be checked and we'll evaluate what they what they need more individualized as opposed to just dosing twice a day.

568
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:23,630
This population's actually at risk for excessive intake potentially, especially with vitamin K.

569
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,450
So they are at risk for deficiency.

570
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:38,299
But we've actually seen cases of vitamin D toxicity because we're just giving lots of water, miserable vitamin A and not monitoring it as we should.

571
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,200
And so there can be rare occurrences of toxicity.

572
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:49,940
So we want to base it more on the patient and frequent monitoring of these labs as opposed to just like a blanket recommendation.

573
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:51,510
Yeah.

574
01:03:51,840 --> 01:04:00,160
And I know we normally just assume people are deficient in vitamin D, but checking in like a more severe patient, we do that to know how severe or.

575
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:10,260
Yeah. I think if we're if we're questioning if their vitamin D supplementation is adequate, we could check like a 25 HD.

576
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,250
Especially if we go up on their supplementation to see how they respond.

577
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,050
We could then check that 25 HD and see how they're responding to supplementation.

578
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,830
How often do you check? Yeah, so let's talk about that.

579
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:29,100
So these are just giving you some serum level of vitamin K can be indirectly assessed

580
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:36,240
by a painting which is like a blood clotting test or this tip CO two is a newer lab.

581
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:40,020
I think I crossed it out in your case because it wasn't used as much.

582
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:46,589
Now I think we do use that. It's more of a direct assessment of vitamin K status is don't really have to worry about that much.

583
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:53,250
You have heard of that, but you could look that up that this is an example of like the aqueducts that we have.

584
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:59,610
So this is a the fat soluble vitamins in a water visible formulation.

585
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,440
So let's talk a little bit about how other.

586
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:17,880
So depending on their age, this will be the intake recommendations for CRF and then annual measurements of those that will look at license plate see.

587
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,610
But you can see these are the ranges that we likely have to give to them.

588
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,340
And so sometimes those multivitamins are much higher.

589
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,920
So that's why for just giving them twice a day they can and let's say they're eating really well too.

590
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:37,469
There can be risk for giving them too much, actually. Okay.

591
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:41,310
Vitamin D, these patients will need to be on vitamin D.

592
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:50,790
And you can see how we might have to increase, depending on how they're responding to their their replacement.

593
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:55,170
And that would probably be based on your 25 HD levels that we could watch.

594
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,890
If we can maintain them above 30, that's great.

595
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:05,280
So we might have to go up. You can see like maintenance for most is around 800 to 4000.

596
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,370
So you might start there. That's probably not enough for these patients.

597
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:15,990
So maybe we're up to 6000 here today. You can see usually the maximum of 10,000 units of T3 a day.

598
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:20,600
But we want to be monitoring the 2018 level.

599
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,569
Okay. A quick word on zinc.

600
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:33,840
A lot of times those attacks will also include zinc. This is especially important for young kids.

601
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:43,110
So our pediatric patients will see, at least mention that if they're not growing well, despite what we consider adequate energy intake,

602
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:51,740
taking their pancreatic supplementation, sometimes an impure child of zinc supplementation will be recommended.

603
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,090
So zinc affects normal growth and development.

604
01:06:54,090 --> 01:07:02,280
So in our kiddos that are seemingly eating well, taking their enzymes and still not growing, they may started the supplementation.

605
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:20,040
Okay. Let's see how much time. Okay. So, M.A., in the past, a long time ago, they used to restrict fat and see it because there's fat malabsorption.

606
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:25,420
So they're like, we we want to limit that. That's a very long time ago, like in the fifties.

607
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,860
Now, we we have no dietary restrictions for these patients.

608
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:37,360
So it's high calorie, high protein, high fat in order to get the calories in and not overwhelm that.

609
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,720
I mean, these patients feel like they have such a large volume of food to eat anyways.

610
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:47,890
They need a very high fat diet. Is this a population that we're worried about developing cardiovascular disease?

611
01:07:49,370 --> 01:08:00,320
No. Unfortunately they are not living long enough to develop heart disease due to fat intake so that we push back our pediatric.

612
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:06,439
I think she retired and she did the pediatric C F for years and as interns we'd always rotate

613
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,290
with her and it was just her delivering to the patients and their families was talking about,

614
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:18,530
you know, you spread butter on both sides of the bread like she would have all these things like how they get the calories in.

615
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:26,240
Like anything that's made with milk, you make it with cream like that is huge to get to get adequate calories.

616
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:34,579
So high calorie, high fat, high protein. Also, we want, you know, vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables, fiber.

617
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:39,709
But those foods can be low in terms of core density.

618
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:45,380
So we need to kind of doctor those up so that they can take it that often these patients will be

619
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:51,300
on either supplemental nutrition or they'll be drinking nutritional supplements between meals.

620
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,890
So this is one we use a lot of foods, very high calorie.

621
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,390
It's like ounces. So it's a cup and it provides 530 calories.

622
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:06,780
So if you think that that's pretty calorically dense, the patients don't love it.

623
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,409
It's very thick, very sweet, but it can get the job done.

624
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:16,320
So if you think two of those a day between meals, that's an additional thousand calories, that can really make a big difference.

625
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:24,770
These are some commercially available supplements that we often use and see us just looking at this.

626
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:35,800
Which ones might we choose for this population? If you look over here, we'll spend a lot of time on on the next semester.

627
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,830
Yeah, the skinny shape gives us 2.5 to 1 skinny shape.

628
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,930
Right. You're going to get the most bang for your buck in terms of volume, lots of nutrition.

629
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:57,620
So we use these skinny shakes in the hospital, feel like they haven't been as available lately, but that's like a standard for a lot of our patients.

630
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,420
So very high calorie delivery there.

631
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:10,390
So we'd probably not do like a regular boost to one cal for about 250 calories.

632
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,640
Even a boost plus would be better. Something with that's more calorically dense.

633
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,720
It contains partially hydrogenated.

634
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:25,420
To flavor this one. Yeah, that's.

635
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:33,330
That's like. Well, yeah, that's interesting.

636
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,450
This isn't that old. They just kind of added this sort of.

637
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:42,510
Look at that. Okay, Supplemental Nutrition, just briefly.

638
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,940
Usually it's 32, which is a gastric two. That's more of a permanent two.

639
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:53,910
There are some health systems where pediatric patients place their own feeding tube in tonight.

640
01:10:53,910 --> 01:11:01,530
So they do a nasal gastric tube and then they take it out in the morning so that they don't you know, they can go on with life, go to school.

641
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:06,870
Don't think we do that at U of M, but that is something that's done.

642
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:15,030
So they'd rather just place it each night, run their two feedings, take it out, and not have to commit to.

643
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:23,310
So the schedule will be really individualized based on the patient's activities and other therapies at home going to school.

644
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:28,710
Sometimes they can get them just overnight or they'll do like that bolus feeding after meals.

645
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,169
If they're in the hospital not feeling well, we might run them slower and more around the clock,

646
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:41,999
which would be like a continuous flow drip of their nutrition, like the accommodation to sometimes patients.

647
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,890
Like any way to get support. Like I say, you have to get four cans of formula and they don't care how you do it.

648
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:54,209
They'll find a way to do it. So no one class of formula has been shown to be superior.

649
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:59,460
So even those that are broken down for better absorption don't necessarily have better outcomes.

650
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,420
We do want to do a more concentrated okay to calories.

651
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,100
That way they can get more in with the smaller volume because we still want them to be eating.

652
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:15,960
We don't want this to take over their ability to eat and they will have to be on enzyme replacement for their actual nutrition as well.

653
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:29,610
Okay. So nutrition intervention, increased calorie and fat intake, maintenance of lean body mass and hopefully getting them at a healthy BMI.

654
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:35,940
We do need adequate supplementation and monitoring of their vitamins and minerals, especially those fat soluble vitamins.

655
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,620
We talked about assessment and management of your pancreas, enzyme replacement therapy.

656
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:46,709
That may be the role of the dietician. So we talked about how can we tell if enzyme growth may need adjustment.

657
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:54,240
I take continued weight loss and evidence of of fat absorption in the stools would be the two kind of first things I would look at.

658
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:59,320
And then we do need to assess they're kind of stealing just in general number these

659
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,590
some patients are prone to really significant constipation that's not always that's

660
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:08,370
right you might ask them like why haven't gone in a week and maybe that's why they're

661
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,709
not eating like so we've got to keep things moving in terms of their problem.

662
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:15,710
But. Okay.

663
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:21,340
So what are we? Some general principles. Three meals and two or three snacks per day.

664
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,570
Can these patients feel like they're always eating? Can be very tiring.

665
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:31,170
They need pancreatic enzyme, a vitamin supplementation, a very unrestricted diet.

666
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:38,729
So these patients should not have any restriction. Even our patients with deactivated diabetes, we do not restrict their carbohydrate intake.

667
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:43,830
We just dose their insulin. So they're going to eat 200 grams of carbs.

668
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,160
That meal, that's okay. We'll just adjust their insulin. So it's a in most cases, it is an unrestricted diet.

669
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,530
We still want to, you know, encourage whole grains, fruits, vegetables,

670
01:13:55,530 --> 01:14:01,050
a healthy diet as well, but they need to consider that nutrient density as well.

671
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,450
We've talked about supplements, ideas for calorie boosters.

672
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:10,530
That's a lot of what we do is how can we optimize their intake.

673
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,700
Also, these patients do need extra salt, especially in the summer months.

674
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:21,210
So to replace sex assault that's excreted in sweat or if they're having a fever.

675
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,040
So there are some alterations there. So their salt needs are unrestricted, essentially.

676
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,800
Then ensure adequate, healthy vitamin D, vitamin K. So you talked about for bone health.

677
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:40,399
And I will say, you know, in my experience, like, you can never get enough calories in patients and their BMI as were always so low.

678
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,920
But now that we're seeing such improvements in survival, we do need to watch for excessive weight gain.

679
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:50,059
I think that's that's fair. That hasn't been my experience.

680
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:56,840
But I think that's probably something that we need to consider, that we would have to have a very individualized approach to these patients.

681
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:10,070
Yes. So now that people are living longer or have a higher quality of life, being more active, earning a lot of calories, does that mean anything?

682
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:18,920
Calorie? Yeah. So if they can be physically active, which we would encourage and we have some that definitely are active,

683
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,850
that's going to increase their calorie protein needs in addition.

684
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:28,340
But they're probably if they are able to be active, they're probably healthy enough to sit.

685
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:37,820
That could be accommodated. Yeah. Usually that after we send them home and how often the customers schedule.

686
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:45,290
So I know in pediatrics they have very close follow up in the outpatient setting.

687
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,700
I don't know if that's as good an adult that's outpatient care.

688
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:55,640
Take twice the week. You're seeing the children. I don't know how frequent it is, the S.F. Clinic.

689
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:04,370
I don't think it would be weekly necessarily. If they're coming in weekly, they probably would need to be inpatient, but it is more regular.

690
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:11,230
But sometimes adults get lost through the cracks and then they just end up repeatedly coming to the hospital.

691
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,710
So yeah, they really have questions on staff.

692
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:20,749
If you get a chance during your internship, I would say trying to a rotation with these patients,

693
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:25,070
whether pediatric per adult, really interesting dietitian is highly involved.

694
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,860
It's just a really special group of patients in my experience. So I would really encourage that.

695
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:37,370
Okay, let's stop there and we'll do one more session on Tuesday.

696
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:44,550
We'll talk about food allergies and intolerances because you will see that the food.
