1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:24,430
And Mary, you folks have had the same. Okay.

2
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,240
I can. As a Republican.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,560
You know, I try to do that.

4
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:53,810
I think that's the whole point that I love so much.

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,560
And I was like, oh, he should be gone.

6
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,500
It's okay. I know. Yeah.

7
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:18,890
I mean, I think, you know, I don't really I am really lucky.

8
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:27,050
I mean, I like the way I look at things.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:42,740
When I was little, I think it was a therapy dog.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:02:04,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,350
I got it yesterday. Really? Oh, no.

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Okay. Yeah.

13
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,340
Yeah, it's kind of like.

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:48,980
I have to admit, I felt the need to take it for it.

15
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,830
Felt like it was killing things.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,050
Okay, let's figure out how to.

17
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:23,900
And think about that because it's better, especially the thing about whether it's because I just think they're like,

18
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:35,799
well, you know, you're by the bar and there's no no, that's just like humble, ridiculous terms.

19
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,480
Like, like, like the like and. Yeah, that's true.

20
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,190
Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:03:46,510 --> 00:04:20,320
Basically what I'm saying is, you know, it could be an excellent start catalog and yeah, I mean, I can't even look at some miles to my car.

22
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:51,040
I guess one is I think that one significance to us that we don't know about right now is really I went through the previous assignment,

23
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
but I have not gone through again a chapter consistency.

24
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:03,120
So I will get it back to you in the next day or two. I'm basically through, you know, giants general things.

25
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,080
You know, some people are besides certain aspects of the speech more than others, etc.

26
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,010
But I don't have any major. Everybody got this confused on this type of feedback.

27
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,370
I would put this one I've got more comments on than most.

28
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,940
So if you read it and you once it comes back and you know, questions pre-scripted reach out to me.

29
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,370
For today obviously we're going to talk about warnings were going to talk about Prop 65.

30
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:40,870
We're going to talk about lots of different kinds of labels. This is this class that's most directly related to the Alaska side.

31
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,020
If you haven't had a chance to look at it, you foreshadow what I ask you do for the last assignment, which is do.

32
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,229
I'd say either the Thursday or Friday after the last class.

33
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,140
I don't remember. I think it's Thursday.

34
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:18,690
That is, to analyze the impacts of a recently implemented law related to labeling of what used to be referred to as GMO free products.

35
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,220
But this law now describes them as bioengineered.

36
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,350
So this law went into effect in January of 2022.

37
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,810
It has specific guidelines for what should be labeled as bioengineered versus not.

38
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:45,420
It says nothing about labels that say GMO free or free of a bioengineered product.

39
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,030
What I ask you to do on this assignment is essentially analyze the implications of

40
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,930
the verifications of a label that all three of the most part people are afraid of.

41
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,320
How do you think you will guide behavior and to some degree bring in a normative

42
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,059
perspective in a sense of if you think the law is doing good things you want to say.

43
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,570
So if you think the law is doing counterproductive things, make people afraid and they don't need to be making like whatever.

44
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:30,200
Let's talk about that, too. And then I'll also ask you to stay on the question of these kinds of free limits that you think they should be required.

45
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:40,120
Do you think they should people should be allowed to use them at producer's discretion, which is basically where we are now, etc.

46
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,559
So today's discussion is going to set a lot of the tone for that day.

47
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,350
We're going to get into the question of what happens when we label things or do we choose to label?

48
00:07:50,350 --> 00:08:01,180
How are they labeled? We wish the labels were different than what they are, etc., etc. Of the top 65 stuff is as an example.

49
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,810
But I want us to think expansively like it's not inappropriate for this discussion to range into, for example.

50
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,759
Fat free labels or organic labels or all the other things that the words that

51
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,809
we attach to things that have meaning that may or may not be seen as risk.

52
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,800
But sometimes we feel free to take this discussion to wherever it, you know,

53
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:34,790
whatever examples in your mind about labels that either influence us in good ways or insulting to us in good ways,

54
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:42,570
and sort of wrestle with that for all of today. To start us off.

55
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:51,780
I am always. You were talking in your views about mercury and mercury and fish.

56
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,290
So there's a good anchor point of the risk that we have or something about.

57
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,429
And what do we how do we label that? How do we talk about it in the context of shaping people's behavior?

58
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:13,350
And so I thought that was a good place to start. Today's discussion is not every ten years.

59
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:23,420
I mean, every day hasn't. But despite being around that much, so much ink poisoning in life,

60
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:33,480
not to mention the other health policy, that not likely to happen, not even if you have a lot of.

61
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,590
Okay. So I wanted to start with this domain because I want each of us to reflect on what do you know or think about these?

62
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:52,020
Are we century and fish? Have you seen communications about it?

63
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:03,410
What format have those taken as if they had a warning label say warning this has this product has may have certain amounts of mercury.

64
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,270
Is it labels that categorize fish into different types.

65
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,770
But if you're an experience has been I don't my experience has been but I'm curious what your experiences.

66
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:31,280
What have you learned about. You say heard about it officially or through word of mouth either.

67
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:44,040
So what I'm interested here is this is a risk. We know scientifically that there can be harm when someone consumes a large amount of mercury.

68
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,730
You're an interesting audience in the sense that we are interested in public health issues.

69
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,260
We will pay attention to messages like, I'm curious sort of like how have we?

70
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,510
What is your current state of thinking about mercury?

71
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Is this something you think about every time you order fish?

72
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:12,209
Is this something you notice labels on for you wish that somebody would label and or is it something that gets talked about amongst friends,

73
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,790
amongst family and said or not?

74
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,899
Because that's really what today is about is like what are the things that we talk about and what are the things that we don't talk about?

75
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,370
What are the things that we label as, Hey, this is dangerous or the things that we don't do that to?

76
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,020
Well, this is a directly related to mercury with fish.

77
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,190
I've heard several times that word of mouth and I've never actually looked it up myself.

78
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,609
Or I guess the reason why. But I've heard that eating a lot is, is like the equivalent of smoking cigarets.

79
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,530
And I don't know where that comes from. Why, but apparently tilapia because it's from raised.

80
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,740
I guess it's artificial fish. It's something's wrong with it.

81
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,250
I don't I'm not sure if it's because of mercury, but that's just fish dangerous.

82
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,260
So different fish. Notice, by the way, that our leap here is other fish.

83
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,270
And just before I continue this. So you were talking about.

84
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:20,630
Fish purchasing behavior in Japan that had a similar kind of do you focus on narrowly or do you think on a larger scale?

85
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,240
What do you mean by nearly. Well, so if I remember what you wrote your music and I don't always remember this perfectly.

86
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:35,690
You were talking about how it was your parents reactions to a warning about buying

87
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,430
salmon in Japan versus your reaction and then sort of a different level of reaction.

88
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:49,220
Yeah. So I think back in 2020 they said like there's a leak in like some part of the ocean in Japan.

89
00:12:49,490 --> 00:13:00,890
So like my parents, like my parents understanding for that like particular news is we should not buy any but products that come in from the ocean.

90
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:08,000
That's how my parent perceived it. But how I perceive it is like maybe we can like.

91
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:21,010
Okay. Just pause for not purchasing or consume salmon because they detected mercury leak specifically to the area that usually salmon.

92
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,080
So the reason I wanted to bring up Sylvia's example is notice the question of generalization, like if the warning is.

93
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,100
These say I might have been identified as having high levels of mercury.

94
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,400
But the behavior is, oh, we shouldn't buy any fish.

95
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,340
That's a mental bottles issue. Like, that's somebody over and over generalizing from a specific information that was provided.

96
00:13:52,450 --> 00:14:00,970
And that might be a good thing if it's truly the case that most of the fish are also being contaminated by Murphy.

97
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:10,510
And it may be a bad thing if what that means is that someone stops consuming fish, which has real health benefits.

98
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,270
And there is, in fact, not a level of contamination there.

99
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,999
So we could have overgeneralization in ways that actually harm itself because somebody is modifying

100
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,880
their diet in a way that isn't actually making them safer and maybe helping them avoid things.

101
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:35,330
I mean, you know, Emma's example is another variant of this, like, okay, so you have thoughts about one fish.

102
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,530
Does that generalize? What do we attribute those to and how does that then translate into what can be?

103
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,030
This is a broad topic today, but I want to start here because I think it's an example that we're all familiar with.

104
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,230
What I have heard in the space of Mercury is that it matters who you are, for example,

105
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:05,510
that the potential risks associated with mercury exposure are higher for.

106
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:16,690
Human who might be trying to get pregnant than it is for people like me who are male, who are older from pregnancy is not an issue.

107
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,780
That difference changes my reactions to American versus somebody else's.

108
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,240
Does the label say anything about that? No. So.

109
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,770
I happened to pay attention to this stuff. So I think about it based upon other knowledge that I've gotten.

110
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:48,720
But if I look at the messages I've seen about Mercury, the most salient one that I remember was when I was visiting, I think it was in Chicago.

111
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,220
I honestly don't remember where I was.

112
00:15:50,230 --> 00:16:00,250
I was visiting an aquarium somewhere and I got a handout about different kinds of seafood and different levels of mercury.

113
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:07,390
It basically was a categorization like so there was no numerical data.

114
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:15,130
It was just these fish are high mercury, these fish are moderate mercury, these fish are low mercury type of stuff.

115
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,580
So I guess we're back to the evaluative label stuff that we talked about earlier in this course label only, no data.

116
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,129
I have no idea what the concentrations are, but what I got from that is, okay,

117
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:33,190
so these fish are likely to have more mercury because they saying higher up the food chain and eating

118
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,870
lots of other fish and accumulating it and these fish are not are likely to have lower mercury.

119
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:50,740
Okay. But I also note that when I go to the seafood counter, there are no labels like that.

120
00:16:52,090 --> 00:17:02,170
It would be. So there are. Why are we not labeling that society?

121
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,900
Interesting question. We have all other things.

122
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,870
So this is the kind of conversation I want us to be having.

123
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,399
And by the way, another thing I want to anchor out here is we've touched upon this in a couple of ways during the semester,

124
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,340
but today it's going to be really saying. There are two distinct kinds of risks that we sometimes provide levels for.

125
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,710
One kind is like mercury. And the cumulative risk.

126
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,930
Like. There's a little bit of mercury and then there's more mercury and then there's more mercury.

127
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:48,350
And we we have our beliefs about associations of harm with the level of mercury that somebody has is exposed to.

128
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:56,910
It's not that if you eat one tiny little bit of mercury, all of a sudden you have a chance of killing all kinds of.

129
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:08,420
And then there are the probabilistic risks. Where there's no dosage, it's just a chance.

130
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,490
Think about things like product failure risk. It's not that there's actually an accumulation of something.

131
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,270
It's that there is a chance that something might happen.

132
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,250
Driving crash risks fall into this category.

133
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:41,520
It's not like literally that every mile I drive is incurring harm, meaning that every mile I drive is another moment when an accident might happen.

134
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,270
And it may never happen and I may go through all of my life, drive and never get into an accident.

135
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,110
Or I may drive a little bit and be unlucky and get multiple accidents.

136
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,150
It's probabilistic. It's not accumulative. So Mercury falls into that first pot.

137
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,270
What are some other accumulative types of risks?

138
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,940
And we think about where that first exposure probably has no impact,

139
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:25,370
but an accumulation of that chemical exposure, etc. The nation certainly falls into that basket.

140
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,700
Yeah, smoking is a little bit of nicotine and other chemicals that in that very,

141
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,750
very first cigaret that somebody smokes, none of that is likely to have any substantial permanent health damage.

142
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,250
The accumulation of all of that over years of smoking. Absolutely.

143
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:53,120
Which is why, by the way, we look at decision making about lung cancer screening for smokers.

144
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,590
It is driven off of a calculation of cost years.

145
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,360
You calculate how many packs per day, how many years of smoking?

146
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,640
And the larger that number gets, essentially it's predicting the likelihood of cancer, and that's used to guide screening decisions.

147
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:26,400
But that's a very different thing than, say, how we might think about warnings related to.

148
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,120
Chances of being shot by an electrical system.

149
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,810
Updates on accumulation of the electoral system is justified by our view and for the warning of for.

150
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,920
All right? Yeah. Chlorine. Yeah.

151
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,009
We put in it for too long.

152
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,190
Like, if you like. It's not like the chemicals in your skin.

153
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,450
Yeah. Dry skin out. Yeah. And there are many things.

154
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:10,819
We have this conversation about fluoride and drinking water. Like you get fluoride poisoning if you get too much concentration.

155
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:17,000
But it has benefits. Which is why we. We included the water treatment.

156
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:27,410
So there's many things like that where it's like food poisoning from, like a like a bacteria found like a meat.

157
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,969
Is that a probabilistic one? I tend to think of it more like that.

158
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,270
It's not like you are accumulating some volume of bacteria and then eventually it's going to make you sick.

159
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,460
It's that it might be present. It might not.

160
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:49,350
And when it is, it will make you sick. So if we think about. Let's take a look.

161
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,670
Not every cattle of romaine lettuce is contaminated, but some vast majority are not.

162
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:07,020
And yet we know it is possible. And hence we warn people to wash their produce as a way of reducing that risk.

163
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:14,190
We put out notices when there are few calls for inclusion, etc.

164
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,870
So this is the question like so. Let's just run with that one.

165
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:34,930
Why don't we have labels on salad bars? You know, every year there are food contamination incidents from raw produce.

166
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,460
People get sick, people get hospitalized, people die. Why are there no labels on salad bars?

167
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:53,490
Yeah. And she just flipped us around. There are labels on sushi on my house.

168
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,959
You go to a restaurant, you will see warning, you know, consuming, undercooked food may cause I forget the exact wording.

169
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:10,160
But you guys have seen these labels. So we've got something there for raw eggs and we've got something there for sushi if we don't sell it.

170
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,330
Why? I think the immediate concern for salads,

171
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,079
like the immediate harm for salads isn't like seen versus like you could really actually get sick from the sushi in that moment.

172
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,070
And then people are going to reflect back on the restaurant and they didn't say like, oh.

173
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,600
So to some degree that's true.

174
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:42,440
But honestly, the, the the physical contaminations of, you know, E coli contamination in lettuce and salmonella or I'll call it a contamination,

175
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,520
we're not actually talking about that different of an experience. You get food poisoning or food poisoning.

176
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,820
But there is a key difference here.

177
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,080
One of them is I expect my lettuce to be raw.

178
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,530
That is the way it's supposed to be. There'll be crooks there.

179
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:10,719
Let us. When I talk more about this and next class when we get into paternalism.

180
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,180
But but there is a distinction like what do we expect to be risky and what do we not get?

181
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,730
You could also argue that it's the mental model of vegetables that's going to be healthy.

182
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:30,250
Right. So I don't want to know. And it could be risky versus having heard for most of your life, if you're our age,

183
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:38,740
it is a risk to have raw fish that you don't go into a sushi restaurant thinking the same, okay, I am going to be healthy.

184
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,490
I'm having sushi versus look, I'm having a salad. That's a healthy thing to do.

185
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:52,179
Well, and let me push this a little bit further, because we have had the conversation about, at least in American culture, about sushi for decades.

186
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,050
And it's certainly been part of our, you know, available food item.

187
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,660
But. Raw meat exists in different forms in many cultures.

188
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:13,250
And. Whether or not the risks that would be associated with it are seen as something that's worthy of a warning or not.

189
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:20,170
Is it a cultural thing? I want all out.

190
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:32,740
Or. Other kinds of our tar meat that is much less common in the United States than it is in some other countries.

191
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,700
And yet I think your point is important in the sense that what we might choose to say, Hey, I need to label this.

192
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,610
This is a risk that I think people need to be warned about. It's going to be a function of, are we already expecting that?

193
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,650
Is this something that is seen as normal and healthy itself? Yeah.

194
00:25:51,200 --> 00:26:02,269
I also wonder if there is any public health initiative to not put warning labels on things that are typically perceived as a healthy choice,

195
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:08,480
because we already have, I guess, an issue, a nationwide issue of like.

196
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,840
The affects of poor dietary choices.

197
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:22,410
So if you start putting risk labels now on healthy, healthier food items, then what will the public believe choose?

198
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:31,020
So now we're getting into the ethics here, which is part of the today's purpose, which you're saying is,

199
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm going to oversimplify and I want a label that I'm oversimplifying in order to bring this to the surface.

200
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,090
Because there are health benefits of this action.

201
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,270
We don't need to tell people about the risks of that patient.

202
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,830
I mean, we're hand-waving and I'm oversimplifying, but there is an element of that, like eating that salad has risks associated with it.

203
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,830
It also has health benefits associated with it. Absolutely.

204
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:13,280
And we as communicators, as public health experts, might choose to say in that this is a behavior we want to encourage.

205
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:21,049
Therefore, our communications will emphasize the benefits and we will minimize the risks that we

206
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,240
run into some challenges when we then have things like recalls that we get to say,

207
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,670
okay, yes, we want you to eat. Let us. But not that. Let us.

208
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,490
But it's not the case that there is no risk.

209
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,870
But even when there isn't. Even when there's no recall.

210
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,780
Unless it might be that we just haven't found any.

211
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,570
It might be that the lettuce that I take off the shelf today will turn out to be contaminated,

212
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,490
and that will be a start of some outbreak and we will have to deal.

213
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,820
There is a risk there. We don't label.

214
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:05,430
Why not? I mean, literally every single thing you do in a day has some component of risk.

215
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,020
And if you are constantly bombarded, you would never do anything like think about your shower.

216
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,550
Like, does your shower come with a warning that says if you don't have a bath that you could slip and die?

217
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,089
Like, no, because that would just be over the top.

218
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,360
Ridiculous. Like, think about it. But it's a true risk. It's there.

219
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,060
They just don't label it well.

220
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:28,890
So if we extend that logic, which several of you wrote about in your music, which is why I wanted to make sure you get here.

221
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,890
Everything has chemicals and.

222
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:41,720
There are and there are certainly chemicals that have traces of things that we just can't get rid of completely like we'd like to get rid of,

223
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:51,050
but we can't do that. There are certainly other things for which they're fine at some concentrations and they're dangerous at larger concentrations.

224
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,980
I mean, let's be extreme here. You can be seriously poisoned from vitamin D.

225
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,430
From water. You can kill yourself by drinking too much water.

226
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,810
In fact, I distinctly remember this is a total tender, but I distinctly remember eight years ago,

227
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:19,950
some idiot radio deejay in Florida dared somebody basically to drink.

228
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,630
Was it? No, it was it was like 24.

229
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,129
It was some ridiculously long amount of time and a lot of a lot of water.

230
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,370
And the person wiped out their kidneys and died from.

231
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,000
And there was a lawsuit against him for it. Like, yes, water from Italy.

232
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,890
And I don't even mean, like, boiling water. Just water.

233
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:57,200
So your point, which by the way, the Prop 65 is a good point, too, to bring in Prop 65, Prop 65 labels, lots and lots and lots and lots of stuff.

234
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,240
So as having chemicals known to the state of California to be associated with cancer or whatever,

235
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,440
the exact specific wording is that you get exposed to.

236
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,259
Let's talk about that. A couple of you wrote about it in specific.

237
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,520
I want to make I want to make it up. Actually, it wasn't.

238
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:29,670
Early on here, I was talking about how about 65?

239
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,760
But Max, I know you were talking about proximity and this sort of like how much is too much?

240
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,850
So what motivated you to raise that issue?

241
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:47,510
Yeah, like when I was reading through, I realized that one article you put up there was like an argument for and against.

242
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,810
Because, like, again, like, I. I can understand both sides. It's easy to argue bulls.

243
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,889
I just like the example I said my music was I was looking at like camping

244
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:04,600
equipment and like kitchen cutlery and there was a Prop 65 warning with no X,

245
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,620
there was no explanation as to why it was there. So I had to go and research it myself.

246
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:15,650
Like, turns out really the only issue is when you're like it's like sharpening this equipment like,

247
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,910
like file this the original inhalant and that's why the warning is there.

248
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,870
But like it's like super specific and I like West that there was some sort of in

249
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,010
definitely more in explanation but like I've seen that before too that it's like it just.

250
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,270
It's just kind of there like like I can't tell that's actually beneficial.

251
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,430
So these warnings are all over the place.

252
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,190
Both the articles you read and several of you mused about it like.

253
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,760
How much attention to him hate those kinds of audience, especially when they're on like something you don't associate.

254
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,090
I mean, like, yes, okay. A piece of kitchen cutlery, you know, might cut you, but you're not really thinking about, you know,

255
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:10,830
what are the chemicals that went into making it like it's a knife, it's a backpack,

256
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:17,220
it's a and but don't get me wrong, like, let's unpack this on the opposite side.

257
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:27,210
It's a backpack. Let's say it's made of various types of plastic that may have, you know, volatile gases that are coming from them.

258
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:32,130
You're going to be in that tent, breathing the air that has those chemicals in it.

259
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:38,810
I can't imagine circumstances under which there would be real risk that we would want to, you know, have people be worried about.

260
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:46,170
I can also imagine situations in which that label does absolutely nothing to change behavior because I need a tent.

261
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,780
And I'm not going to not go get the tent. And so it becomes not actually a very productive thing to be labeling.

262
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,560
Yeah. I thought it was interesting that these were suggesting a changed proposal.

263
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,950
65% spent, like at least on the wording it was listed.

264
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,120
It was just at least one chemical by name.

265
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,140
I like why it has this warning that even that would be a little more useful.

266
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
So at least you could look that up more effectively.

267
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:22,549
To know what it is, I don't know. So let's imagine you did have labels where you could look it up and you could say,

268
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,830
okay, so because this contains this chemical and that's why this label is on it.

269
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:37,050
What would your behavior be as a result? Would you avoid ever purchasing something that contained that chemical?

270
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,550
Yeah,

271
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,690
I think I've had a similar experience at coming across a label that didn't have any explanation and it didn't it wasn't like hyperlinked or anything.

272
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:54,749
So as they didn't go try to figure out what the issue was and I wonder if there was a chemical name there that I recognized or that seemed scary,

273
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:01,230
if I would be more if it would be more motivation to like go seek further information about what that risk would be.

274
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,700
So it's like my question is, if we follow this design, we're going to put chemical bans on thing.

275
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:16,860
And I would be curious to see after we put those labels on your coffee, how many of you would be comfortable drinking coffee?

276
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,730
I would be curious to see how many of you would like.

277
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:27,960
There are lots of things in our daily life that we can that have chemicals, in fact, that have chemicals that are known to cause cancer.

278
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,910
Like barbecuing is dangerous stuff if you really want to get into that pathway.

279
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,030
So, you know, you want to get some barbecue sandwich.

280
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:46,320
It's going to have a label on it that talks about the cancer causing chemicals that are generated by the barbecuing, etc., etc.

281
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:56,190
There's one big problem here. How much?

282
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,120
So how many of you? I am not an epidemiologist, but or environmental health sciences person.

283
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,760
But anybody. What's the basic rule of toxicology?

284
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,810
The dose makes the poison. Let's not get any of these labels.

285
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,340
Not dose. How much of this?

286
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:36,200
Are you kidding? Why I started with the Mercury conversation is you're right, if you're eating tuna every single day.

287
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:44,070
You accumulate a lot of mercury over time. If you're having a bowl of coke once a month.

288
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,790
That's a different thing from a toxicology standpoint.

289
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,500
Both of them would get the same label. If all we're doing is labeling the presence of the potential hazard.

290
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,870
So Prop 65 for right and wrong has no dose information.

291
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,340
Not only does it not label the specific thing, but it does tell you anything about concentrations.

292
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:25,780
So let me be provocative. Do you think Prop 65, as you've read it, is helping or probably public health in the aggregate?

293
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,790
And if it is helping, how is it helping, helping to reduce behavior level of the system level?

294
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,810
You think it's harming? How do you think it's to. My own opinions, but.

295
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,860
I'm curious what you think. There's no simple answer to this one.

296
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:56,120
This could easily be argued from multiple sides. Yeah.

297
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:06,050
I think in some respects it's helping in the from the stance of keeping companies responsible for what they put into their products.

298
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:14,240
But I do think it's harming in the sense of putting the public who may not have the proper context

299
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,360
and the proper level of education to really understand what these warning labels are saying.

300
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,739
I don't think putting that responsibility on the public is the right choice,

301
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,500
but I do think that having those labels and having that accountability present is essential.

302
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,350
So embers bring up a really important distinction that we all need to pay attention to.

303
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,630
Forcing labels. Has effects both on producers and on consumers.

304
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:53,120
No producer wants to have to put a label on something saying it has that chemical that no producer wants to have a Prop 65 warning on their product.

305
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,990
Even if they believe that there's no real underlying risk, even if the dose is really trivial, nobody wants that.

306
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:11,040
So there is a strong incentive when we have labeling laws to have producers reformulate their products to avoid having those labels.

307
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,720
They game the system. And that's part of the reason why these labels labeling laws exist is to push producers.

308
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,309
If you can build your product this way and it will have a label and that way they don't have the label.

309
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:29,530
They go to this, they go down the pathway with no label. That's a good step.

310
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:39,310
And by the way, a similar kind of effect of this in the nutrition space has been about trans fats.

311
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,810
That trans fats became something that was labeled.

312
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:51,590
In food products, companies rapidly reformulated their products that to include trans fats.

313
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,340
And that has a system level impact on the character of the food that we consume.

314
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,540
But we don't know that it's a good trade off because I think about like the switch from sugar to the sugar alternative.

315
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,190
And there is this a lot of evidence now that the sugar alternatives are even worse than regular sugar.

316
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,800
So you can't say that it's necessarily a good thing to reformulate.

317
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,480
Correct. You can't. What I'm saying is.

318
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,870
Labeling laws operate at multiple levels.

319
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,140
So if we're going to talk about them, we have to think about both the producer level changes that may occur on the individual level, changes made.

320
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,320
But you're absolutely right that that says nothing about whether those changes are beneficial impacts to health or harmful to it.

321
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:48,140
It does, however, mean that if we have situations like the prior 65 where many consumers are just numb

322
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,859
and they're not actually changing their behavior when they see the label on the label,

323
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,860
etc., that doesn't mean that there's no impact on society.

324
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,490
Because there could be an impact on society, good or bad, through the producer.

325
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:11,110
TAPPER Yeah. I mean, I think that seems like an issue with the law that's more about how it's enforced rather than the actual,

326
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,629
like, warning the risk communication side of it, like the idea that the precautionary principle makes sense.

327
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:23,110
We should make people prove that what they're doing is safe rather than making them by allowing them to make us prove it's dangerous.

328
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,709
But because we're enforcing it through these individual lawsuits,

329
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,090
it becomes a really cumbersome process to make a just widget, then you to start a new lawsuit with something.

330
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:37,090
So to talk about that idea that you brought up about.

331
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:44,780
A world in which there's an assumption that you have to prove something is safe before you can bring it to market.

332
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,920
Let me start by acknowledging USC is far away from that in terms of the way it manages risk.

333
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,170
There are other countries in which there are regulatory systems are much closer to that.

334
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,940
But I also need to acknowledge how do you prove safety?

335
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:13,610
I don't know that you can. In the example that comes to mind is the Tide pods like before.

336
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,880
A few years ago, nobody ever would have thought that you would need to have a warning label on Tide Pods that said, Don't eat this.

337
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,069
Like they they were like, oh, it's like a perfectly safe product for use in your laundry.

338
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,850
But people started eating them and.

339
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:36,780
So my favorite example of this. I haven't had one of these for a long time.

340
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:47,130
My kids are grown now, but when I had small kids, we purchased something which at the time was called an extra saucer.

341
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:56,790
This is this was a plastic. So it was designed for for kids who can't get walk.

342
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,470
It's got a seat in the middle. It's got a circular tray around the kid.

343
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,830
The kid can turn within it so they can put stuff around the planet.

344
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:10,140
And the whole thing sits on a plastic face.

345
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,839
That is. At least ours was a little bit curved.

346
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:21,290
So the whole thing will rock a little bit from side to side. You put your kid in it, you give them some toys they can play by themselves.

347
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,260
They can't go anywhere.

348
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:36,380
I distinctly remember getting it and looking at the instructions and reading a warning label that said, and I quote, do not use as a sled.

349
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:47,430
I'm thinking who in their right mind put a six month old kid in one of those things and pushed them down a snow covered hill?

350
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,110
But obviously somebody did, and that's why that label was there.

351
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:01,970
I think a toy that was not a toy, but something that's really starting to have warning labels for kids, like water beads.

352
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:09,800
Yeah, it's like a sensory toy that is supposed to help kids, but actually not put them in their mouth.

353
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:20,520
But like one water beach could. Like. So much is because they like expand once they reach water so they can expand and stop their breathing.

354
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:28,319
So there's one whole space of this product safety world in which which we're talking about now,

355
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,400
which is what is our obligation to provide warnings for.

356
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,670
People engaging with products in ways that they were not designed to be done.

357
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,229
But you could do it like that.

358
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,410
You swallow things, you shoot the swallow, you use things in ways you shouldn't be using, and there is risk associated with that.

359
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,460
And as we're describing, like, we can't imagine every crazy thing that somebody might consider doing.

360
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:07,970
And yet there is some obligation like so we have very strict rules in this country about products designed for infants and for kids called cribs.

361
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:17,090
And if you place structures like that for good reasons, because adults are really lousy at figuring out what kids are will likely to do to stuff.

362
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:25,460
And so we got to practice, we got to think about this stuff, how hard what what might do something and how that might put them in danger because of.

363
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,510
The same, by the way, is true of adults. We just don't tend to label it or protect people that much.

364
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,120
People use all kinds of products for stupid things.

365
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:45,040
But I and my favorite example of this is the number of people who die every year from falling vending machines.

366
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:56,030
Where's my talk? Where's my chips? [INAUDIBLE]! About half a dozen people die every year from.

367
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,299
Thanks. Okay. I'm not going to put a label. Actually, I think that.

368
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,370
But I have seen the vending machine.

369
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:09,360
Little label says Please do not shake danger, etc., because they had to put the label on it because people were doing that.

370
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:21,840
So I but I just think there's a distinction between that and then labeling things that, you know, the way they are going to be used,

371
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,460
like labeling something you're going to put in food that you think might accumulate in a bathroom.

372
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,930
And that's why we want to make sure to draw this distinction.

373
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,170
So there is the what is our obligation as communicators to deal with the crazy things they do.

374
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,130
Some of them we need to label on, maybe some of them we're just going to say, you know, we can't label everything.

375
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,810
Then there's the okay. Even if you're using this in the way you should be.

376
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,410
So I'm consuming pork. I know I'm consuming tuna.

377
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,400
The tuna has mercury, and that's part of why I'm eating it.

378
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,560
There is to agree that there's risk associated with that. We might think about labeling if.

379
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:05,800
You know, some of you wrote about the lawsuit from a couple of years ago, about 1000 hot coffee.

380
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,550
Like, Okay, I expect coffee to be hot.

381
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,340
Now there's some questions about do I need to label how hot it's going to be?

382
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,780
But it's not that I'm I'm shocked at the idea that the coffee is hot.

383
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:33,490
I would be upset if my coffee was cold. There are risks that come with behaviors that we don't necessarily want, but that we need to know exist.

384
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,590
Your gas tank and gas station. You're going to get exposed to some fumes.

385
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,610
Those fumes are not good for you. We do things to try and minimize that.

386
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:58,229
But you know, there are some labels there about, you know, don't breathe the fumes don't fill the gas tank on the back of your car,

387
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,470
put the gas down on the ground, because lo and behold,

388
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,080
we know that there is a shock risk and there are real dangers there if you behave one way or another.

389
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,700
So we try and minimize those risks for the ones.

390
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:27,060
Yeah. It's just like a perfect question. If I like a lot of vegetables at, like, the farmer's market.

391
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,389
So the question here is, how do these how does our thinking change by the producer?

392
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,820
Like, how should we be thinking about what Kraft should be doing, what, you know,

393
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,360
a major producer of kids play equipment should be doing versus a local craftsman at a local farm, etc.

394
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,590
It's another trade off. We have.

395
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:03,240
Expectations. I'm just going to rattle off some examples just as food for thought.

396
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:11,340
I would want to know, and I think it's not inappropriate for me to know whether the apple cider or this farmstand is selling well, pasteurized or not.

397
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:25,379
Or the sheets that they're selling, because we know that there are risks there and most products take certain steps to protect against them.

398
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:32,250
And if those steps have not been taken by this little local farmer, then maybe we would expect that you'll be at least disclosing of that.

399
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,400
This is unpasteurized cheese from unpasteurized milk.

400
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,860
It might have more risk associated with it, etc.

401
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:49,090
But you're right, there's we imposed lots of labeling requirements on only major producers and not on others.

402
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,469
So that doesn't mean that everything is safe.

403
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,830
It just means that some people are required to tell us it's not safe and other people aren't.

404
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,790
So I want to. I mean, we could go on and on about examples all day long.

405
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,160
But I want to explore a specific question that I think is at the heart of this.

406
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,050
And I'll try and set it up. Why do we have labels at all?

407
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:33,020
Like, why was Prop 65 put in place? Why is it not okay to just be in ignorance of what's in our products?

408
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,870
Right. Well, I think we have a belief that we have the right to information that affects us as a society.

409
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,250
Like information, transparency is kind of like a big aspect.

410
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,970
So we have this idea of a right to know.

411
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:03,730
Wow. I'm really annoying for the next minute or so because I'm going to keep saying why while we really push this one.

412
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:15,780
I think past situations where people have unknowingly had some risks and have had really detrimental health effects from that,

413
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,230
like being exposed to certain compounds in the workplace.

414
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:27,000
Warning. I think it has heavy implications for people who never had the choice to either take that risk or not.

415
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:37,560
But you still have the part. So running with this that would suggest that our right to know, especially in those kinds of situations,

416
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:49,470
is in order for that knowledge to enable us to either change those environments so that they are no longer risky or minimize the risk.

417
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:57,440
And or give people choice about which risks they choose to take or not.

418
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:07,870
So if the communication is not accomplishing, facilitating choice or changing the environment, it's not yet serving that needs.

419
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,980
I want to link the question of what is the information to why?

420
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,540
What are we going to get from it? That's a problem. I want to minimize the problem to huge problem.

421
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,640
But part of the reason why we have things like occupational safety.

422
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:31,340
So people need to work in safe places and they need to be able to encourage companies to make safe workplaces.

423
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:36,900
Right. But let's link the communications to that purpose.

424
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,050
What else? If you have your hand up. Oh, no.

425
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:47,130
But. Okay. Okay. Let's go back.

426
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,389
Yeah. I was like, is it also kind of like an aspect of, like,

427
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:58,860
TV accountability for particularly like for producers, like, because, like that they had to be forward.

428
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,729
Like what? Like you like the degrees that they use in their process, like what they can do.

429
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,719
And and that's also like for the public to know that that would be violate that trust.

430
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:16,890
So they could be. So notice that that framing of the right to know is not actually meaning that an individual consumer needs to know.

431
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:25,200
What we're saying is society needs to know somebody needs to be paying attention to what's in this product.

432
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:34,180
And that we hope that as a whole there will be some kind of monitoring and feedback loop to minimize risk as a result.

433
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,940
But the individual consumer, we're not actually asking the individual consumer to know every last chemical.

434
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,550
You're not actually asking the consumer to know and know their personal risk.

435
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:50,740
We're using that communication to achieve a larger societal goal of monitoring producers,

436
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,950
having to reduce the amount of risk that comes from their products.

437
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:58,990
And so that's fine. But let's be clear here.

438
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:07,540
What is it we mean when we say, I have a right to know? Do I have a right to know every last chemical?

439
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:18,210
In this. I have no idea what this green rubbery stuff is.

440
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:27,089
Absolutely not. And whatever it is, even though it looks the same, it's different than this stuff and it's different than the glass that's in here.

441
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,100
And I'm presuming that this is glass that is reasonably safe for me to be drinking from,

442
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:38,910
but I have no actual knowledge about whether or not there is light in this glass or anything else that might have are for me.

443
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:48,010
And yet I'm drinking water from it. What is our right to know?

444
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,209
They're not denying that there is something here.

445
00:53:53,210 --> 00:54:01,940
But if we're going to talk about men, should we be warning labels when we should be giving people warnings, labeling products, etc.?

446
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:18,160
It's wrapped up in this question of what is my right? So I don't want to find out, say, after years of using this.

447
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,170
Then it's leaching some chemical that's probably having a problem for me.

448
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:34,090
But I will use this as a personal example.

449
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:42,380
I have a whole bunch of those. Plastic containers that restaurants use to give you soup.

450
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,950
Like there's tons of them.

451
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:51,190
We use them for leftovers. I stick them in the microwave.

452
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,890
Is that healthy? Probably not, yes.

453
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,090
Do you want to do it anyway? Yeah. Do I worry about it?

454
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,450
Yeah. Should I have a label on it? I don't know.

455
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,590
But, you know, this is the kind of situations we're talking about here.

456
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:19,780
Like I'm taking a product and using it not in a crazy way, but not in not for its originally intended purpose.

457
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:28,220
And it is scientifically plausible that that's reasonably safe and it is scientifically plausible that that

458
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:33,720
is causing me to be exposed to chemicals that I would not otherwise be exposed to that would have harmful.

459
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:43,170
She's a real blond. Do not put it in the microwave. We have other things that we say don't put in the microwave for.

460
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:51,260
I have bugs that say don't put in the microwave. Those I tend to pay attention to because the few times I forget I burned my hand on them.

461
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,680
Yeah. Example I just thought of are those like cup noodles?

462
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,370
Yeah. They're like, are advertised through the advertise for everybody,

463
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,180
but like they're kind of advertised by college students who only really have access to a microwave.

464
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:17,940
So we put them in the microwave, but it clearly says on the top of it, don't put it the microwave because like the Styrofoam and it so it's like how.

465
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,550
Those are actually dangerous. Only because that can exclude that you.

466
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,600
But like, how do you advertise something to like a population with it's like.

467
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:39,879
Well, and that's an interesting example from my perspective because because there are multiple possible risks that we could be talking about.

468
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,100
So one risk is the physical risk of if you put Styrofoam in a microwave, it melts.

469
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,370
It causes a massive burning hot liquid all over the place.

470
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:55,170
That's one kind of risk. But at least you can see that. You can know that you have had the bad thing happen to.

471
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:05,660
Then there is the thing like. Odorless, tasteless chemicals that you have no ideal sensory terms of your senses as to whether you've been exposed,

472
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,960
which would find the farmers coming from.

473
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:18,870
So we might legitimately think differently about what we need to warning people about for things where what they will know,

474
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:23,640
when the bad thing happens versus things when they will have no idea when the bad thing is happening.

475
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:35,670
I think I have a simple answer, but the ethics here is also very salient in the sense of we might want a regulation that says,

476
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,490
Well, why are you bringing this product and marketing this product?

477
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:46,140
We are it's time our users can't use it in the way it's supposed to be used.

478
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,250
Microwaving is a good example of that, but there are clearly otherwise in which you like.

479
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,870
One person is going to be able to actually.

480
00:57:53,990 --> 00:58:02,250
Actually, my favorite one of that is things which really look like they should be able to be microwaved, but which clearly they do not like.

481
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,459
Not the container, but the food itself, because it's not fully cooked.

482
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:18,470
And so people are concerned about it won't be fully safe to consume as a, if you like, something along those lines that I encountered.

483
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,979
I don't know what I think about this earlier, but the California morning I was moving into my apartment.

484
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,910
I was like, I need dishes. So I go to go buy dishes.

485
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:38,510
And I found this beautiful scent. But then I started reading and there was a label that said, like, all these this that are known to contain linen.

486
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:45,920
And I'm like, Whoa, why would you create a product that I'm supposed to eat off of and microwave and all these other different things?

487
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,429
That's more so meant to be a decorative set.

488
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:57,290
It wasn't meant to be eaten off of. And that to me was confusing because it's dishes specifically to just decorate,

489
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,600
I guess maybe a plate or two to put it on a little shelf, but not to eat off just an entire set.

490
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:09,770
So I thought that was interesting and I made the choice to take that back and then get a porcelain set of dishes.

491
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:21,150
And then that's the context in which. Well, in an ideal world, what would we want that label to say?

492
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:35,240
Look, the. I would envision a label that would say something like, It's not about what's in it.

493
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:43,820
It's about its use. So if there was a label that says for display purposes only, do not use to eat off of or something like that.

494
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:49,650
I don't actually need to know what it is that's in this play that makes it not safe to eat.

495
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,430
That's actually accomplishing by behavioral. It's very clear to me.

496
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:01,410
This is for this purpose. It's not for that purpose. If if the label instead says contains lead.

497
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:08,400
Now I have to do something because I have this thought processes to figure out, oh wait, that means I should eat off of it.

498
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,790
So even if the Prop 65 warning had said the specific chemicals in that product.

499
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:20,300
That's not necessarily achieving our goal in giving up the label in the first place.

500
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,260
Yeah. I was just like, with that, like, resistance. Just like in the kitchen section.

501
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:31,510
Like. Like if I were to see a plate that said, like, contains a lot, but it's in the dishes section I probably like.

502
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,719
Well, it's probably safer. They wouldn't be able to put this here.

503
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,070
Right. Like, I feel like of course there is no control over where they put something right.

504
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:45,390
So it's like, well, I would probably be like, well, I trust like people in like higher officials.

505
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:48,700
I'd be like, this must be fine, but like it should it, but I don't know better.

506
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:55,469
So it's crazy that they would put that there. But again, this is one of the things I want to highlight here,

507
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:00,450
which is what we're getting into is labels that have many different characteristics to the right.

508
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:08,520
You can label that there is a risk. You can label what is present in something.

509
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:17,350
You can label an instruction in the sense of do not use for this purpose, do not eat, do not put in microwave,

510
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:29,830
you know, cook to whatever temperature, etc. Each of those labels has a different relationship to my behavior.

511
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:35,710
It also has a different relationship to producer behavior. So.

512
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:44,750
You might think that producers would be more or less influenced by requirements to label.

513
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:55,780
Things that say it contains something that causes cancer versus labels that simply say it contains this particular chemical name.

514
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,330
Versus labels that say don't don't use for a particular purpose.

515
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:14,530
There's no simple answer to this one. Like, I don't think I was on my own value structure.

516
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,470
I'm not going to make an assumption.

517
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:23,690
But I don't I don't see lots of value in a society that has zero labels for many of the reasons we've talked about.

518
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:32,120
I mean, the first example is a good one. You know, there are situations in which I don't I would be upset to learn post-hoc that I

519
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,640
had been exposed to something really dangerous that I could have learned about.

520
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,310
Nor do I want to be live in a world in which every last thing has labels slapped all over it.

521
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:48,100
And and, you know, half the package is labels.

522
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:55,530
Which, by the way, was tiger kill you were talking about.

523
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,620
Let's talk about cigaret labels for a second.

524
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:06,540
Yeah, I was talking about how I went to Europe a couple years ago and I was in England and I was at a party,

525
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:12,900
and there was this box of Cigarets on the table and it had like a picture of an amputee on it.

526
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:18,300
And I was just like, Oh, wow, that's a really different warning label than what you see in the United States.

527
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:23,040
And I had asked people about it, and they were just like, Oh, yeah, this is like what they are.

528
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,180
Like, it was just so normalized that like you would think, like to me it was jarring because like,

529
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,960
I have never seen that before on our like cigaret boxes or anything like that.

530
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,660
But it just become so normalized that it didn't really have that impact.

531
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:41,750
And the U.S. has been wrestling with the question of potentially doing something like that for I don't know, and years now.

532
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:47,549
Long time. But the key thing actually I want to pick up on is obviously there's the question

533
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:53,580
of sort of the emotional play versus a much more descriptive are textual,

534
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,390
you know, smoking cigarets can cause harm type of label.

535
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,760
But the thing I want to pull up most from your story is exactly what you said about normalization.

536
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,870
That's a graphic label. It shocked you the first time you were exposed to it.

537
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,040
But it wasn't having any of that emotional response in most of the people who were seeing it on a daily basis,

538
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,940
precisely because they're seeing it on a daily basis.

539
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,050
Warning this. This is signal detection theory.

540
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:37,780
This is like underlying psychology. Warnings work best when they are new and different.

541
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:42,040
They. They're surprising. If.

542
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:49,080
We acclimate to things, and the more we acclimate to them, the less we behave differently as a result of them.

543
01:04:49,770 --> 01:05:03,270
My favorite example of this, which is getting me out of the way, and that is after September 11th, 2001,

544
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:16,770
was traveling in the U.S. You would hear lots of notices about the I forget the way they call, but it was basically a sort of terrorism threat level.

545
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:24,780
It was a color coded scheme of green, yellow, orange, red, etc.

546
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,639
And I guess in theory,

547
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:35,460
it was supposed to represent something that where we were supposed to be paying more attention when we're in airports kind of a thing.

548
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,929
But it stayed at yellow or orange.

549
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:46,290
I don't remember which one. Basically on for years and after about the first couple of months,

550
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:50,610
nobody paid any attention to it whatsoever because it didn't matter what it was saying.

551
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:54,690
There was no signal there. There was no it was different.

552
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:00,750
And as a result, it lost all meaning, which is essentially what you're talking about with the cigaret labels.

553
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:04,350
It lost all unique meaning because it was there and it was omnipresent.

554
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:12,900
About 65 labels have similar issues, like the first time the product started getting label, people paid some attention to help out.

555
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:19,460
Not so much. So when we talk about design and communications.

556
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:24,940
Especially warnings. That's another one of the things that we have to pay attention to here.

557
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:43,820
When? I have a label that is only on certain products or only given to me under certain situations I'm far more likely to pay attention to.

558
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:53,740
And if I see it everywhere. And yet.

559
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,620
I'm going to see things over and over every time I go to the grocery store,

560
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,740
every time I go to the doctor's office, every time I buy camping equipment.

561
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:06,969
Every time the thing comes back over and over again.

562
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:10,420
Because we live our lives not one moment at a time, but accumulation.

563
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:23,340
So if the Coke restaurant has a warning and says, you know, a warning that I'm just going to make this up.

564
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:30,330
One tuna is known to be a fish that has higher than, you know, relatively high levels of mercury.

565
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:39,809
Please, you know, try to reduce your full exposure or some kind of a warning that says that the first time I see that,

566
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,750
I'm probably going to be motivated to not order the tuna.

567
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:52,800
The 50th time I see that, I guess I'm probably going to be chowing down on some tuna because it's just not going to have that much impact on me.

568
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,590
So. Now here's the really hard question.

569
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:04,910
So does that mean we should have the label at all? If we know.

570
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,470
That because I'm going to get exposed to it over and over again. I'm going to stop paying attention to it.

571
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:23,440
Why are we doing it in the first place? So I feel like the distinction we made earlier between us and Chris, I feel like.

572
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:30,610
So I kind of talked about this amusing but like with cumulative risk in terms of like

573
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:39,820
it's like what amount of thought like kind of potential risky thing will cause harm.

574
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:48,200
I feel like that kind of ties into to the question of like to what extent do you label that?

575
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:54,770
Because like even with like 65, it's like different.

576
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:59,990
It's, it's, it kind of deviates from like the FDA standards of labeling, right?

577
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,229
And like even when we did like the test result communication.

578
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:07,010
So I'm felt like that was like for like drinking water.

579
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:13,969
There is still a level of like lead contaminant that is still safe even though like

580
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:19,730
zero is like there's still like certain standards where like zero is not possible.

581
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:25,730
So like you can't really do anything about it anyway. So and those safety standards are like place.

582
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:33,200
So I guess like when it comes to the question of like what do you label when it, when something has a cumulative risk.

583
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,400
I wonder if like going according to.

584
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,180
Because I mean, that's what the FDA has in place.

585
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:51,260
And it kind of follows and like sets the guidelines. But then like when it comes to more specific.

586
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:56,870
Like cases. Yeah. So you brought up the lead example.

587
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:01,490
Reporter I think it's an interesting one to think about. No.

588
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:11,600
There is no desired level of luck. In an ideal world, no one would have let of any amount in their traits in what we don't.

589
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,570
This is not a vitamin establishment. We don't want it.

590
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:20,640
There are practical limitations to how little one can actually get that level in the real world.

591
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:29,250
So we set standards that basically say we're going to be okay with let under this level.

592
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,939
But that's not because we like it. It's not because it's good.

593
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,900
It's just because that's as low as we're willing to go, given all that would be involved in doing that.

594
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:43,559
What's worth driving with this, though, and I think this is a nice transition,

595
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:56,010
is remember the impact of something like land or mercury or a lot of environmental contaminants that are accumulative depends on who you are.

596
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:05,390
We worry about lead paint and kids, in part because kids will put everything in their mouth,

597
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:13,020
but in part because the same dose will do nothing to me but might have a really substantial impact on a one year old because a one year old.

598
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:19,710
Whereas a 10th of what I do. And if we're talking about concentrations that matters.

599
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:30,329
So notice that certain types of labels and these are really good labels are ones which are less about

600
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:35,490
the presence of the thing and more about guiding the behavior of the people who are most affected.

601
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:40,550
So. You have things about cumulative LED exposure in kids.

602
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,600
You have more people who might become pregnant because of concern about their fetuses.

603
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:54,010
You have. Of loopholes that highlight those who are likely to be uniquely affected by whatever the thing is.

604
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,870
Those are, again, behavioral or to use it as an environmental exposure.

605
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:04,540
Example, if we haven't talked about this risk, but think about noise.

606
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:14,120
A warning for noise loss. Well, there's both there, a sort of absolute level,

607
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:19,020
like even a small amount of exposure and certain levels can be harmful, but a lot of it is about cumulative exposure.

608
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:24,270
So what are the good labels look like for noise?

609
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:29,070
Well, I'll tell you. Minimize your exposure.

610
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,120
It will tell you to engage in protective behaviors like wearing where you're in the

611
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,110
protection in certain environments or certain contacts that will tell you about,

612
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:45,299
you know, your you know, your volume on your headphones is high enough that it might be causing damage to

613
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,650
have you modify that so that you can have longer exposures and be less at risk,

614
01:12:49,650 --> 01:13:00,300
etc. So it's connecting. It's not just loud noises might harm you, it's what behaviors are likely to be able to minimize this risk, etc.

615
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:10,590
And if you have any question about that, like the labels that we grow accustomed to, it seems like some of them there's value in them being there,

616
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:14,730
even if they're not changing each individual choice in that they have changed our knowledge.

617
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:21,840
Sure. So like the cigaret packet, there is not a widespread connection between lung damage and cigarets.

618
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:25,280
And you know, initially there was skepticism around that.

619
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:31,260
So even if you're not looking at it and making that choice, if you're then thinking later about your lungs, like there's that connection for you.

620
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:37,979
And I think of that like the systemic for producer level stuff, like we're not necessarily changing an individual's behavior at a given moment,

621
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,840
but we are changing the world in which we're thinking about this.

622
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:46,709
And we can think about food, we can think about product safety are many things that fall into that space.

623
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:53,300
And we're. Oh, yeah. I want to think about how much fish I am consuming is not crazy idea.

624
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,469
That's different than the. I'm going to stress out about how much mercury is in my fish and order.

625
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:03,030
A different thing today because of that particular week.

626
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:12,829
Yeah. What you just said reminded me. So, like on vapes, like on the outside coverage.

627
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:22,120
Yeah. There's got like, oh, like warning this this product contains like nicotine, which is a highly addictive drug.

628
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:30,549
And I think like last year, one of my friends had like a sticker on his laptop and it was literally that label,

629
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:38,380
but it was like so funny because I begged and it was like very like she was like, it costs like, you know, like it's very desensitizing.

630
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:43,299
It's just telling you, like, this product is this risky thing.

631
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:50,510
It's in this product, but it does it like, you know, it's not like a very like moving label.

632
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:58,990
It's up to you. Well, I think that's about that context is you already knew it had nicotine because that's why you're buying it in the first place.

633
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,520
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So there's a difference when we're thinking about labels that are, you know,

634
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,919
telling you things that are inherent to the product or the action versus labels

635
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,640
which are telling you about something you would not have otherwise anticipated. Last night.

636
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:19,010
I just, you know, like vapes. And when they first became popular, a lot of people didn't know they had nicotine in them.

637
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:23,209
And there were a lot of so I mean, I think there's an element of like for many of us, but, you know,

638
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,730
if you think about what is the risk that we're actually dealing with here,

639
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,290
and the risk is like if people don't know they have nicotine in it, they become addicted to it.

640
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:35,389
I mean, little kids using them to learn. So I think that we could go on and on and on and on.

641
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:38,390
Label warnings and labels are a fascinating topic.

642
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:44,870
And I want to wrap today up before I break this up and have you sort of wrestle with where do you think this is landing us?

643
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,180
Notice that with the exception of the dose question.

644
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:56,730
This is not a quantitative space. For the most part, we are talking about the presence of something.

645
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,049
The possibility of something.

646
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:08,350
So either the presence of acute chemical or exposure that you might accumulate, or the possibility of something alien or a negative event occurring.

647
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,500
Raising our awareness of that. There's been monitoring for.

648
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:21,510
Obviously there are times in which having information allows us to make our lives safer.

649
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:28,920
There are also trade offs. And so what I want us to wrestle with at the end here is.

650
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:41,390
Think about our society as a whole. Are you feeling like we live in a society with not enough things being labeled, with too many things being level?

651
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:48,470
Or maybe it's a mix that we certain things we're getting labels that are stupid that should be taken off and other things we need to be labeling,

652
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:54,350
but we're not like take stock of of our society right now.

653
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:01,440
What do you think should change? In terms of the way in which we communicate about these types of risks.

654
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,729
Just talk to your groups, wrestle with that question.

655
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:16,400
We'll come back to it on Tuesday. Oh, my God.

656
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:25,500
Oh, my God. This is where it depends on someone else.

657
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:31,960
I saw my little dog on the difference from here.

658
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,880
Yeah. Yeah.

659
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:42,360
Not everything has to be, like, to get numb to warnings for several reasons.

660
01:17:42,370 --> 01:18:05,040
Does that mean you don't get that but as you get into the morning, or do we just, like, have the chance to learn about what you want to do?

661
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,909
That is really stupid.

662
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:12,120
Things are just like that. No.

663
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:19,320
Yeah. I don't think nobody is going to be on their credit card.

664
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:28,250
Yeah, it's always sort of warning.

665
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:51,510
Yeah. Yeah. Like I was sitting here waiting for my sister, and I was like, I mean, and I just thought it was like how I see her,

666
01:18:53,460 --> 01:19:13,580
but I was just like, I don't know, I it's like, oh, I'm so like, you know, yeah.

667
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:31,340
Like, I like this part of the way by saying I feel like it's okay, cause I was just, like, I didn't do the right thing to.

668
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:48,450
But Donald Trump is looking like a really good looking guy.

669
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:56,580
I really don't know.

670
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,979
I think it's more just different, though.

671
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:08,980
Like, it's not like we're like.

672
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:19,230
That's right. Like 40 different seasons. It feels like someone has to regulate this whole thing because we're, like, regulate the same thing.

673
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:28,720
Well, let's wait and see.

674
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:35,729
Just like, I can't, like, organic. Yeah, I tell you what.

675
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:55,980
That might be something in there that might not necessarily represent your life as well as you engage with the final assignment.

676
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,870
Three issues we talk about today. Come up. You want to bounce ideas off me?

677
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,050
Please feel free to do so. We will continue this discussion on Tuesday.

678
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,980
Shifting focus is the labeling question. The issues of paternalism.

679
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,770
When when do we push? When do we exhibit things?

680
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:29,070
And when you have that on Tuesday, when you do that and I don't know.

681
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,890
I don't like I think it's wrong actually.

682
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,430
I you know.
