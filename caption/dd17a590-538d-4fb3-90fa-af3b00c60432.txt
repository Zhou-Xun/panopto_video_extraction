1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:17,580
It was to okay, guys get started.

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,760
So these fuel actors, they are a lot of you guys probably have already.

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,440
I have the same feeling that this couple actress has called actors.

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,490
They are especially tricky compared to other actors.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,150
So let me talk about somebody. They're like my billionaire Russian that the composition of someone of squares.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:56,700
This is first of all it's a little confusing, especially with the different ways of imposing small squares inside of the way.

7
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,030
I would talk about this equation and especially like this is a line of what the focus has to be,

8
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,740
has to be broken up, obviously, to make sequential and in the particle testing.

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:21,230
And also there are lots of and a lot of time we run over a lot of things that were new to us, interpret all these numbers to the numbers.

10
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,919
So I guess then there is this one.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,240
That's the reason why we slow down a little bit and we had an expressive open over the output.

12
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:48,950
So I think you're a good way to understand as well as visual from this, but especially here,

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:02:00,390
you have to spend enough time to spend some time with actors very carefully over which number we have to make sure that you understand,

14
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,900
you know, what exactly each number represents.

15
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:13,079
And because at the end of the day, it's going was black.

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,299
Whether your own research with children who are in the exam.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:27,180
Right so you know in that you know, the fact that they turn the exam, you are going to see how I ask about interpreting these numbers.

18
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,330
It's important to know how to do what exactly is number at me.

19
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,690
Okay. So that's the only I think this this is the slide of where we are from last last time.

20
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,220
So where we stopped the times three that this sort of particle,

21
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:56,850
the particles on the squares and then let's let's move on, let's finish this example before we move on to the next model.

22
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,560
We have another model which will become slightly easier than this one.

23
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:12,250
But when we come to categorical error and then things will become because this line of some squares, this is a little bit abstract here.

24
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,420
So I made a robot see more and more example.

25
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,120
This is just that this whole slide here, melody, this is trying to look at the sort of an abstract way.

26
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,009
So what are some squares are and how they can be applied?

27
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,930
You can see, obviously, but because we have got to like squeeze every single example in from this module for

28
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,970
later on as we see more and more topics like categorical variable and interactions,

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,979
we're going to have a better hopefully have a better picture better not a better

30
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,970
idea how this composition of some squares can be applied to different scenario,

31
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,400
or especially the rationale why we're talking about all these.

32
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:09,720
But for now, I really need to focus. I'm not sort of in the abstract and we so now we want to see using the sum of squares to calculate

33
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,340
how much our square increase in age is adding to a model that already content a birthweight.

34
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,700
Now we'll calculate the increase in our squares.

35
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,200
Now, first, we need to be clear what our square means. Our square is actually.

36
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:51,060
Our square is defined as an SSR divided by SS one, right through random sample square divided by the total sample square.

37
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,200
And so in this case, then.

38
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,080
For the model, that only content means you double.

39
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,460
So if we're for. Let's say. Model contends.

40
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:18,670
BWT my birth weight along. Then ask where is is equal to SS.

41
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,120
It's almost where's beta zero and beta be right now and then divided by it as that's my.

42
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,150
And for the model that it contains the birth weight and age.

43
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,750
That is, by adding page into the model, R-squared becomes 3 to 0.

44
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,780
They have B and beta h divided by ss y.

45
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,510
And we'll want to see how much our square change by adding age into a model that ATA has.

46
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,080
So then that event will be on the computer and so we will. All corners of those are one, I'll call this our truth, right?

47
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:22,230
So then the difference becomes R2, a square minus R1 square, that is the denominator is always has a lot of small square.

48
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,440
But numerator becomes the difference between the two new rules of difference using our notation

49
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:47,940
that is adding page into the model that already has an intercept and in the birthweight.

50
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:57,040
So this is the number that we are looking at and we are looking for it so that the increasing our square and then at four feet in the model,

51
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,219
now we are able to calculate this number. So here we are fitting this model.

52
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,550
So we are feeding first with the model with both birth weight and H, right.

53
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,370
And then this is a sequential model. So if you look at that,

54
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:22,719
how much what is the add for some of the square by area age into a model Bella Ana has

55
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,760
birth weight and this is number we are looking for right this is you know how long.

56
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:36,220
So this is adding Bella age into a model that Ana has been have intercept and the birth weight.

57
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,310
So again, this is because this is a a sequential sample square.

58
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,560
So then first we added a graph waiting for the model, and then we added a tree into the model.

59
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,780
Then our task and wait. And then.

60
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,280
Well, so this is the numerator we are looking for.

61
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,120
So this is the numerator here. We're looking for a denominator.

62
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,450
That's as. As why? Well, we can simply calculate that says Y.

63
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,900
That's why. I mean, he's. Is back here and this this line of art comment.

64
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,390
This is simply taking the sun and taking the sun of this column.

65
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,860
And this is this is essence, life, the thinking of some of these all these three numbers throughout this six, 670.

66
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:48,290
Or you can calculate this Dracula by using the formula as well as as wise is some essays Y is some Y minus y bar square.

67
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,480
You can you can come with this yourself or I mean, you can simply take the sum of the three.

68
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:03,110
Because these sequential sum of squares decompose the total sum of squares into the sum of squares.

69
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:15,080
Even by adding birth weight into the model and a keeping by adding age in addition to the model that Ana has birth weight and the rest,

70
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,990
that is the error. So almost glitter. So. So here you come. Hold the total sum of square into those three components.

71
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,500
Now, if you add this up, you again just put in some square as well.

72
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:36,240
And then if you divide this, this, this number here by the total sum squares, that is the increase is our square.

73
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:47,360
By adding h into the most that has birth weight and that's this example or this this question.

74
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:56,070
Okay. You know, we can we can verify in the next slide that is just to verify this by directly calculating the our one square,

75
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,070
our actual square, and then taking the difference, we see that it will get exactly the same number.

76
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,840
So here, for example, if you find this model that has both birth weight and age, if you again are square, that's this number.

77
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,030
And if you look at it, the model that has birth weight along is we get our square that's in this number.

78
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:21,290
And if you look at the difference, that's this number which is exactly the same as number one, just calculated.

79
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:32,530
They have to be equal because I mean, because mathematically they have to be equal because the first way was was just while we just actually

80
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,119
got this number from the another table and then we kind of wish for the size of the weight was we first

81
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,309
calculate this and then all of this and couple of difference but we know that there's two there we are

82
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:51,740
again very examine the same thing because because this is the difference and this is the difference.

83
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,160
So that that is the example. Any questions?

84
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,050
Right.

85
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:29,000
And then when we use the actress, almost word passed whether whether Birthweight is associated with SBP, the blood hijra, not accounting for age.

86
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:39,130
Not a kind of rage. So here I mean, we have now we have two sets of outputs, if you recall.

87
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:47,930
We have too many output. So I'm not sure if you guys can this is here is very important tool to actually

88
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,330
spend some time to go over all these outputs to see how they are interconnected.

89
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,400
But we have two sets of outputs.

90
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:04,120
One side is the if you look at this output here, this is based on a sequential part of a square sequential sample squares.

91
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:13,050
So both tables we have seen so we first at page and then as are at a birthweight and then H right.

92
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,940
And based on here, if you look at the birthweight,

93
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,709
this is this number here where this like here it it means that adding the

94
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,120
birthweight into a model that has a only intercept because this is sequential,

95
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,690
right? So adding birthweight to a model that has only intercept.

96
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,900
And then if you look at this P value here, you look at this P-value here,

97
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
that is quite a significant write, very small, much smaller than positive five.

98
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,960
But if you look at this P value alone, you would have say, oh,

99
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:55,780
not accounting for age and even the birth weight seems to have a significant impact on blood pressure.

100
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,850
However, if you fit another model now, this model has only birth weight.

101
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,490
There's no age added at all, just the birth weight of.

102
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:14,370
And then if you look at the p value, well then you as native birth weight, you ask me a p plus p value that becomes 108.

103
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,100
So this is larger than 25 13.1.

104
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,149
And then based on this p value, then we would not reject a model as is.

105
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:29,500
We would say that a birth weight is not the demand associated with that SBP.

106
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,550
So recall that here.

107
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:40,750
The hypothesis we are casting is always good to keep in mind what happens when it has a linear casting, whether it be is equal to zero or not.

108
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,340
This is the evolution of America and where it hasn't made it.

109
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,760
Not accounting for age. Not accounting for age.

110
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,530
And based on the first set of our report, it seems now that we will reject this novel business.

111
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,750
But based on a second set of output, it seems that we will not have a lot of losers either.

112
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,340
Why do we have this difference? We actually have experience and a better beginning of this example.

113
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,020
So we saw this discrepancy as seemingly a contradiction.

114
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:27,500
The reason is that, okay, so when you finish this model, you look at this more similar results where we calculate this P value.

115
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,790
You are actually comparing the mean square to this guy, to this residual and this residual.

116
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,709
It is the residual, the sample square, the area somewhat square in the larger model.

117
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:48,600
In the full model. Now, the full model that has both birth weight and age across all the other words, this inquiry is almost where it fits.

118
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,160
A model that is SBP equal to better zero plus better.

119
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,570
Being a birth weight plus Veda.

120
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,090
Hey, Ange. This is the model that illustrated you.

121
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,540
So this at a hospital that corresponds to that is based on this model on.

122
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:26,050
It's just that it's just that this line, when you look at the PTW, this line, this birth weight, this is the sum of square.

123
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,460
You haven't you haven't added this edge into the model yet.

124
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:45,130
However, when you look at the residuals, some of the square that as I see that I is based on this lager model.

125
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,260
So this is the so-called I mean, this F here, this is the so-called.

126
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,050
Yeah. So that has to result not an F star. This is the F statistic.

127
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,460
So that's why you have this this P value here. But if you look at this model, if you look at this model,

128
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,740
this model is purely a model that has the t w birth weight, although it has nothing to do with age.

129
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,299
You've never seen this model, never consider it just like you didn't even know that if your dataset had age, this variable, right?

130
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,600
Just. Just look at a model that has a big birth weight and then you fitted this model.

131
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:40,310
Then on the if you look at the the Sigma Square or the at the end for the MSI, that means for error, it's actually 38.6 36.

132
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,040
That's a lot larger than the new squared error given by the previous model.

133
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:54,410
So recall call that a we explained from the very beginning now because the new square error this is Sigma Square and

134
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:01,700
it got reduced by a large if you consider an H and then the corresponding center error becomes too much smaller.

135
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:17,209
So then you have a significant p value. So this is I mean, this is this leaves me this may sound quite a confusing it's not a really it's not a yes.

136
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,360
It's probably not a great slide to to include here.

137
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:29,749
But anyway, so the point is that now this line of code and this line of code, we are looking at two different models.

138
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,990
So here we are just looking at SBP.

139
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:49,740
So here we're just looking at it as BP with dependance on BW has nothing to do with age.

140
00:17:51,240 --> 00:18:00,120
So then the MSI, based on this model, the amassing based on this model is going to be a lot larger than Hamasaki based on the first model.

141
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,870
Because age is a significant predictor of species.

142
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,850
So age explained a lot of the variation in SBP.

143
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,390
So then the resulting sea square is much smaller as a short meter.

144
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:28,500
This is much smaller than the sea, much square for the SAG in the models and the rest of us, very smaller than the center area is much smaller.

145
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,220
So we have the P-value much smaller.

146
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
So that's that's the reason. Now when we come back to this question.

147
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:47,700
So because we have kind of covered the ocean. So if you go back to the question now, suppose we didn't say if we didn't look at this result.

148
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,100
If I just ask you directly whether B, B, B, D, W is associated with as we do not accounting for h.

149
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:05,290
I think I think most people would simply look at the second model here because you're not looking for a proven ideal,

150
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,590
just simply fit a model that has no age at all.

151
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,180
I just do not consider age at all.

152
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:20,690
I just I would just take this list model and then see whether BW is associated with the SBP that is without accounting for age.

153
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:30,430
So this and so. So this should be that the model, that model based on which we answer this question, not accounting for age.

154
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:40,240
Because the first one actually although the first line the first line that is while the first line does not involve age,

155
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,990
by the way, you calculate the residual when calculate that the mistake were error.

156
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,950
Now it is after adjusting for age or.

157
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,590
So yeah, I just want to point out this very, very clear.

158
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,490
So to answer this question alone, to answer this question alone,

159
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,459
you do not need to even think about when you do consider the first model just neutral.

160
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:11,540
Fair to the second model can answer that question. What I mean, here we put all these two models.

161
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,790
How different is tomorrow on the same slide? A person.

162
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:24,280
I think in some confusion, however, I mean, if you follow very closely, then you will see the difference between those two.

163
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Hopefully you'll see the difference between those two.

164
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:37,750
So that actually helps explain or help to have a better understanding of what different sets of output mean based on based on art.

165
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:46,870
So again, the difference is because by adding age, we substantially reduce the a square error.

166
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:56,350
Yes. So in our sequential testing scenario, we still want to use the one that accounts for age, correct?

167
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,340
Yeah. In our. Okay.

168
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:11,340
So this is a good question of whether you this is what you do or not is really depends on what what our region model you're feeding.

169
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:18,850
So let's say that in your dataset, let's say that you have both birthweight and age.

170
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:29,559
I'm not sure if I can explain this well at this stage because, I mean, this is really I mean, you probably have a you have a much,

171
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,220
much better understanding as you see more and more examples, like with accumulating to experiencing this in linear regression.

172
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,710
But let me try to explain this a little bit. So suppose in the dataset you have two variables birth, weight and age.

173
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,530
Suppose that at the beginning, very beginning, you want to build a larger model that includes both.

174
00:21:49,500 --> 00:22:00,280
And while that it becomes the first model over here, you're building this model of an event and then you get to this output,

175
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,670
then the number while then of course, the residuals are calculated by, by educated by having data in the model.

176
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,620
Although I mean, the first line here, if you look at this line, I mean, it's it's this line alone.

177
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:21,130
It doesn't involve age. Right. However, I mean, if you switched the order, if I am a the first in the model and then I add the birth weight second,

178
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,450
then of course, the birth weight line that will involve age as well.

179
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:33,560
So that's that's one scenario. Another scenario is, okay, even if you had age in the model have those are in the dataset.

180
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:42,370
Let's say you're not interested in age at all for some reason for some reason that you you don't you don't want to include ahead in the model.

181
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,080
You just want to include birth weight. And then you're that means your feeding a side in the model.

182
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,880
If you are feeding a of the model, then there's no such output at all.

183
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,659
Right. So there's no first sound because you're not feeding the first model.

184
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,830
So you're just going to get the second, second output here.

185
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,410
So everything now does not involve age at all.

186
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:17,700
So so the difference essentially, it comes from what model you're feeding from from the beginning at the beginning of what model you're interested in.

187
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:29,370
And that is driven, usually driven not purely by mathematics, but by scientific knowledge and by the interest of the investigator.

188
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
So this is early on.

189
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,160
Yeah. So based on a combination of story,

190
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:46,260
knowledge and a baseline might become an area of knowledge and some degree of knowledge so that you decide what models you like to set.

191
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,930
And then based on that amount that you've carried out subsequent of all this has to.

192
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,370
Okay. Any other already has.

193
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,430
An event. That's why I asked you what are the key tasks in this model?

194
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:31,249
So this is the typical coalition table we see from our output by fitting such a model.

195
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,160
So you is the parameter asthma is center error, key value and the p value, right.

196
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,840
And then for a social model, well,

197
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:50,690
of course this is each asthma estimate or each five out of that is after adjusting for the other variable in that in a data stage.

198
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,810
So all these results here they are, they're partial there.

199
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:04,220
They're there for example, here this is if you look at this p value and this birthweight this this value, this is less than polo five.

200
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,160
While this well, first of all, we need to clear that this is again testing whether better be is equal to zero.

201
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,900
We are not testing this equal to zero or not.

202
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,010
But in this case, this is testing this after adjusting for age.

203
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,060
After adjusting for age because we have included age in the models.

204
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:31,230
So this is of so this listed has they are part of their after adjusting for age.

205
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,180
And a similar if we look at of age this is casting.

206
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Age equal to zero versus age, not equal to zero based on age, not equal to zero.

207
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,230
And again, this is very small p values based on which we will reject the null hypothesis.

208
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,950
But again, this is after adjusting for birth weight, after adjusting for perfectly.

209
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,840
So this table here, such coalition table, this is always partial.

210
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,649
Like once you once you fit a model that has all the covariates.

211
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,830
I mean, this coalition table, this is always partial.

212
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:18,730
So the sequential results that is in the ANOVA table, read this.

213
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,550
This is this table is a what table?

214
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,309
This this this table. This is a normal table.

215
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:32,950
This is a decomposition of sample squares. ANOVA table is a decomposition of some squares.

216
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,870
So it has some squares from each variable in the sum of squares from the residual decomposition and some squares.

217
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,800
And when we look at decomposition, you have some squares.

218
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,090
You have the you know, the sequential sum of squares. We're part of some squared.

219
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,660
We're going to help us see what are some sort of examples. Where is there?

220
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,440
You know, the partial or sequential become more relevant because we have different ways of decomposing the sum of squares.

221
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,140
But this table here, this is the coefficient table.

222
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:15,340
This is the clover table. Now, for clover, a table is always partial, is always cardinal.

223
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,350
It's always after adjusting all the other variables. Cocoa varies, including the model.

224
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:30,470
There is no there's no sequential interpretation of the clover, because, again,

225
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,890
the partial or sequential is more relevant to to decomposition of some of squares.

226
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:51,970
And. And we can name a business to verify the.

227
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,670
Well I want to verify that it has partial result.

228
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,620
It's the same is the same conversion table before.

229
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:10,690
Now if you look at the the key values and these are the scenarios for each of the ruling coalitions.

230
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,100
And then if we square these, we will get you know, we'll get these numbers and we'll get these numbers.

231
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,550
So by. By by taking a square right by by table.

232
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,940
The square. By taking the square of these numbers, we'll get these numbers.

233
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:39,120
So and then if we look at a normal table and this type of three, this means, well, now we are looking at a partial sum of squares.

234
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:50,580
So if we look at part of the sum of squares from the normal table, we will see that we have the same sum of squares, and that's from previous.

235
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:57,330
We had a under table. Yeah, that's from here and that's from here.

236
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,090
So previously we we didn't show this table. This is partial sum of squares.

237
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:08,880
If you look at this f value for this column value, we have, for example, well known 139 1374.

238
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:17,070
So this f3f values, if you look at those three values, they are they're exactly the same as well.

239
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,900
They are these values of they are they are exactly the same as the t square.

240
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,990
So this is just another way to verify that it's not squares.

241
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,090
Sorry, but the key value in p values here in the commission table.

242
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,379
This is part of some square list. This is based on partial signs.

243
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:50,240
Where. So, yeah, I think maybe I should just emphasize this again.

244
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,960
If we look at the center output, if you look at a center, this is a typical output from R if you feed,

245
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,530
etc., such a linear regression model, if you use summary, you will get a summarized r a summarized tables.

246
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,390
A one table is called the coefficients luminance.

247
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,260
This table is, as we mentioned, this is the table that only look at a partial.

248
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:24,810
So if you look at all the results here, each line is after adjusting for the other variables, including the model.

249
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:35,720
So this is a table. But if you look out to the is a table called ANOVA, right?

250
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:42,030
If you use a normal analysis of Vera's table, there's no other tables for this ANOVA table.

251
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,990
Well, depending on how you how this feels by it.

252
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:59,480
So you get you are you can call SAS or R language whether you want a sequential table or whether you want a partial paper appraisal.

253
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,650
This is this is a sequential table with type one.

254
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:13,380
And then we we have seen the type three have three visits are part of the sample square, this ANOVA, this are normal table.

255
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:24,600
This is the partial sum of any portions.

256
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,290
So any questions? I think I know that we are finding a lot of things to you guys.

257
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,690
I mean, glad they are out here. We have seen quite a few tables.

258
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:51,759
These tables are. First of all, let's be clear. All this tables, they are interconnected because they are based on the same datasets by fitting,

259
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,650
you know, linear regression models resolved by feeding models with birth, weight and age.

260
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:05,950
So all these table, they are interconnected. But it is just that while we have this many different ways of presenting the results,

261
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,870
whether we are presenting them using the inclusion table or the partial

262
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,560
decomposition of the some square or similar to the conversation of some square.

263
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,190
So there are different ways of presenting this results and of this partial and a sequential,

264
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:29,350
which one is preferred as it depends on whether we want to carry out a sequential test or partial test part of the test.

265
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:41,169
So I think it's very important we spent enough time to understand the interconnection between all these outputs because these numbers,

266
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,120
they are connected. They're not. Yeah, they are.

267
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:55,300
They are old related. So hopefully after going over this all this output based on this particular example,

268
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:01,690
now we have a good idea what what did these numbers mean and how they are.

269
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,710
So that's that's what I was trying to to show you guys like how these numbers are are connected all these outputs on connected.

270
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,170
Okay. So that's that's a very heavy example.

271
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:27,660
So again, so I hope you guys ever have enough time to look over this example to see how the numbers are connected.

272
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:36,690
So now let's I think we all move on to the next module in module H.

273
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,500
So moderate is about a categorical covariates. Of.

274
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,950
This is a very commonly seen type of covariates we have covered.

275
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,749
But while we have seen this but although we although previously we did an explicit report out,

276
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,340
oh, this is categorical variable in how how we should deal with those variables.

277
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,960
Now this module is about categorical about how we should deal with a categorical.

278
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:39,209
So there are two major types of covariates when we do the analysis.

279
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,480
One is the so-called quantitative.

280
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:59,510
On the other hand, this means that like, for example, age, height, birth weight, BMI, all these you have actual contrary numbers.

281
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:06,950
These are called quantitative, while this is called variables or covariates, and another one is qualitative.

282
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,270
So there's no actual number. It's just a few category.

283
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,049
For example, different countries the U.S., Canada and Mexico, for example,

284
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,430
three countries where the earned the model of the car as well were different.

285
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:32,390
Different race or different gender. So you have this different categories, but there's no like number, actual value attached to each category.

286
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,410
So this is the so-called community covariate.

287
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,780
So so far we have mainly been dealing with.

288
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,780
You know, the quality of heat and the weight and so forth.

289
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,240
But categorical predictions are also of interest and qualitative.

290
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:02,870
So, for example, like, well, when we talk about race and we have different race and we have gender like different gender,

291
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:11,510
and we have we have a if you talk about a geography, you have different countries, different nations, different different states.

292
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:18,860
So these, for example, if you consider Canada, U.S. and Mexico, it's well there no actual value at all.

293
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,900
It's just with three categories how we feel with such a variable.

294
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,830
Well, we try to fail linear regression model of.

295
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,139
So that's that's one one type of categorical variable.

296
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:41,959
Another type of categorical variable is that sometimes even if we have a continuous variable, let's say H, H is a quantitative variable.

297
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,880
So ageless is measured in years.

298
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:53,670
Of course, we have you know, in previous in all the previous examples, well, we included in the model, we just included itself.

299
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,980
So that interpretation would be, oh,

300
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:04,110
for one year increase in age while we see on average we see this much change in the in the mean of Y arriving through response y.

301
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:13,410
So but sometimes we're oftentimes people are are would break age into different categories when when the

302
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:21,650
fair tomorrow so they bring age into for example below 50 and about 50 or between 20 or 30 and 30 and 40,

303
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,720
30, 40 and 50. Right. A few categories.

304
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:32,609
And sometimes this is easier to interpret and easier to communicate with the public about the results.

305
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:39,089
For example, rather than saying, oh, for one year increase in age, I see this much on average of this this much century.

306
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:46,530
What now the interpretation would be if you just look at below 15, about 50, then the interpretation would be,

307
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,389
oh, for people who are older than 50 or about 50, and what are their requirements?

308
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,660
How much their response differs from the people who are below it.

309
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:04,680
So this is another another scenario where we would consider categorical variables, so we break the continuous variable into different categories.

310
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,600
And another one is to do a moral diagnosis, which we will talk about later.

311
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,350
Let's not worry too much about that now. Now let's consider one example.

312
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,850
This make things easier. So consider now we have an experiment or we have investigation.

313
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:30,540
These are to compare out-of-pocket health care expenditures among farmers.

314
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:40,110
So this is how the data are collected. So we take a random sample of four farmers from each of the three states.

315
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:49,710
So again, these are three states Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin, four states within each state we will take for.

316
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,630
Farmers run, run, run low paid for farmers.

317
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,120
And this is kind of hypothetical but very oversimplified example, but what we take for bombers from each of the three states.

318
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,170
So in total we have 12 farmers. So our sample size is 12.

319
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:12,490
And we want to see how. The health care cost.

320
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,270
This is how the care costs. This is our one response.

321
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:23,920
Why healthcare? Of course, health care costs differ across the three states.

322
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,150
And so our state is the state and this is the variable x.

323
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,390
Want to see how healthcare cost depends on the threat or marital problems of three states,

324
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:41,200
or whether the mean health care cost of the three states are the same or whether there is any difference.

325
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:47,830
So. So then what the outcome is as to how their health care costs.

326
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,300
That's not why. And we have 12 funds.

327
00:39:52,510 --> 00:40:01,640
So then for each farmer, we have their health care cost. And then the predictor this this is x this is the state I.

328
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,450
So for the four ads, we have three states, Michigan and Wisconsin.

329
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,510
So now we have a comparative X that have three categories.

330
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,240
And in the three categories there's no numerical value attached to not just three states.

331
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:31,380
So how do we deal with this from the states? So we included this coverage for for not only for media Russia, but for Russia.

332
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,700
The way to include a sort of combat role is to define the so-called deliverables.

333
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,700
So dummy variables are variables that we.

334
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:50,040
So the three states are not numerical, so that the variables is that we put a value on this.

335
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:59,779
You know, this is category with error. So we have in total we have let's say this is talking about in general.

336
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,410
So let's say we have a variable that has categories.

337
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,130
Okay. In our case, X equals three. We have three states for three categories.

338
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:17,609
Let's say in general, we have categories and the category goes from zero to came out as what he does is rather arbitrary while

339
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,950
the category you if you're not like you could let the category go from one to okay so we don't matter.

340
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:29,940
So these stars in indexes for instance work for this K categories.

341
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,219
So let's say we have a category zero or category one and then category up two came out as long

342
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:42,000
as we don't know how categories and then we will construct a K minus one dummy variables.

343
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:51,140
Okay, let's one double nervous. To indicate this divert attention.

344
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,570
So it's one this damn variable. This is an indicator for category one.

345
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:06,650
Indicator a category one. So if the subject if we look at each Sunday, even the subject is from category one, then X one is equal to one.

346
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,330
Otherwise xx1 is equal to zero.

347
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:24,410
And a similar thing with event x two extra is equal to one if the sovereign is in category two and then zero otherwise.

348
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:33,150
And then we divide this up to know the K minus one for the omega category.

349
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:42,470
So after defining those K minus one dummy variables, the omega category for category zero is the reference group.

350
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,450
So now let's take a look at a concrete example. Take a look at our example.

351
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:53,820
This helps you see. Informed that in the original data.

352
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,750
So let's say I give you listed as ADD. I have y and x.

353
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:03,870
Y is the health care cost and x is the state result.

354
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:10,380
For X, I have Michigan. So for example, fever crows are different subjects.

355
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,420
So the first time of day, let's say, is from the first farmer from Michigan and a second farmer,

356
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,780
let's say, from North Carolina and a third farmer, let's say, from Wisconsin.

357
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:28,620
And then the first one, let's say from North Carolina and then another one from Wisconsin, and I may be another one from Michigan and so forth.

358
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,800
Yep. And these are their Y values. So these are different individuals.

359
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,730
And then what would be better was what would you have done?

360
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:50,450
Variables. Jagger I mean, here, of course, one but let's talk about it came out as what undeniable nerve.

361
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,960
But let let's let's let's forget about that for a minute.

362
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,309
Let's say we have three categories. Actually, we are able to define three dimensions.

363
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:04,700
So let's say I have the variable X one, x two and x three.

364
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:11,620
So we have three categories. And this is the innovator.

365
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,010
Well, this is the innovator. Whether equal to what?

366
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:22,090
Whether somebody is from Michigan. And this is the innovator, whether the somebody is from from Wisconsin.

367
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,260
And this is an innovator. Somebody is from North Carolina.

368
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:33,640
I can define the three young variables, and then I just look out for each subject.

369
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,520
I just look at it very let's have it be strong.

370
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:44,410
I mean, for somebody who's from Michigan, who is from Michigan, then by any you know, from Michigan is is equal to what?

371
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,000
But am I an innovator from Wisconsin for Wisconsin, North Carolina?

372
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,890
These are zeros. These are zeros.

373
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,930
And and for North Carolina now, the sound of somebody from North Carolina.

374
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,820
Right. So then my any dinner for Michigan, that's equal to zero because somebody is not from Michigan.

375
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,410
But it might be that Wisconsin, the indicator is also equal to zero.

376
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,400
They're also equal to zero. But then for North Carolina, this is equal to what?

377
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,239
Rather than I have a Wisconsin from a from a somebody from Wisconsin.

378
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,660
Then then the negative from Michigan.

379
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,670
This is zero for Wisconsin. This is one. And for North Carolina, this is if it was you.

380
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:35,470
And you can you can similarity. You'll find value for the the other subjects in the summaries or the summary in it is at SUNY.

381
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,320
On the worse you can define these, you have three categories.

382
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:50,150
Then you can be three down the variables to indicate like which are you good of which category the subject fall into.

383
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,310
So then each subject if you look at each subject.

384
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:05,930
If you look at it a subject, the subject can only take a valid one for one category because the subject only from one category or the other.

385
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,470
There was the zero and the first one here.

386
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,790
This this is just a general way of saying that.

387
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:20,400
So if you have K categories in general speaking, you can define K dominant variables.

388
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,620
I think here this is why it is asked to construct.

389
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:30,990
It came out as one of the variables. The reason is that what we include on the R in the model, we just need to include this one.

390
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,450
We will we'll have to leave one out because that one will serve as the reference category.

391
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,980
But I will agree to go there. But we can definitely create k down variables.

392
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,660
So the K down variables, they are the indicator just indicating whether something is from category one,

393
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:58,020
whether somebody is from category two and whether somebody is from category ten minus one like in a four for category zero.

394
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,930
Of course you can create an x zero that is not variable for category zero.

395
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,330
It's just not one we feel model. We did not include terrible in the model.

396
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:18,040
We'll see that later on. But this this is how we create vulnerable in our time in our example.

397
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,920
So originally you're given a data set that has only this two columns.

398
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:31,710
Oh has X and Y. But based on the x value, we are able to create a mystery that merits.

399
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:39,160
Sometimes you are given the whole dataset and somebody already created the thought variables for you, and they have done a whole dataset.

400
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:46,160
Okay. Any questions so far?

401
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:56,670
Okay. So after we print up the interview, let's say now what we.

402
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:05,880
Well, now we're going to model. I'll build a model. So we have three deliverables for for Michigan, for North Carolina and for Wisconsin.

403
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,470
But when we build a model, we need to leave one category out that serve as the reference category.

404
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,170
So later, we're going to see why we have to do that.

405
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:23,910
But for now, let's say here, if we look at this model, this model does not include unforgettable work in Wisconsin.

406
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,140
Nothing is more critical because posing as a reference category.

407
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,070
We just include Michigan and North Carolina.

408
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,510
And then let's try to make an interpretation of this.

409
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:52,630
Of this of this violence because we have three bayonets. Right. Let's see how these Spartans are connected to that or how to interpret this data.

410
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,419
So now let's look at the three things.

411
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:05,920
First, let's look at a Wisconsin now Wisconsin for some age or for the state of Wisconsin, that means that any good information needs to be zero.

412
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:11,500
And in a year, four for North Carolina needs to close because we're looking at Wisconsin.

413
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,299
So both any others are two. Now, when both are zero, there is no this guy.

414
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,690
No, this guy. What is left is just it has zero.

415
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:31,790
But no is the average worker for me, health care cost for Wisconsin that is below zero.

416
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:37,580
So the mean cost for Wisconsin, that is massive. But.

417
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:44,049
So that's for Wisconsin, not for Michigan. For Michigan.

418
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:51,550
Not for Michigan. The indicator for Michigan is equal to one, but a indicator for for North Carolina this year.

419
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,270
So for Michigan now. But Michigan, this any good or is equal to what?

420
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,680
Well, this is equal to zero. So there is no this guy anymore.

421
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:13,690
So we have not we have better zero plus better one. That is the mean cost, median health care cost for farmers in Michigan.

422
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:27,680
That's been a zero plus measurement. And then if you look at North Carolina now for North Carolina, for farmers from North Carolina,

423
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,270
of course, but you know, you get over North Carolina, this is equal to one thing.

424
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,070
You get over Michigan, this is equal to zero. And so then.

425
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,580
Then there's no this guy anymore.

426
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:47,460
And so what is left is better, zero plus better to invest the money in health care records for North Carolina.

427
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:56,620
Those better, zero plus better. So this is sort of what are the mean?

428
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,950
Costs are how they are related to these matters.

429
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:06,670
Now, based on this, we have the information for verbatim.

430
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,800
Now, if you look at a beta zero that's here.

431
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,370
And this has been a zero. But, Peter, zero is the mean.

432
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,170
The mean cost, how much? I just try to simplify things.

433
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:32,229
I was simply right. I mean cost rather than mean health care cost is the same two words by 2 seconds for running things down.

434
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:38,860
So the mean cost for for farmers in Wisconsin.

435
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,300
In Wisconsin. For Wisconsin.

436
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,620
So that's that's what a beta zero means.

437
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,770
And then if you look at a beta one, beta one appears here.

438
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:02,550
So that's the then that's the difference between while there's difference between view Michigan Intermediate with causal,

439
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,600
this is equal to new Michigan minus MU Wisconsin.

440
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:18,580
So in other words, this is naturally the. The difference in mean cost.

441
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:25,560
The difference in cost. Compare which to which while comparing.

442
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,930
Comparing. Michigan.

443
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,230
To Wisconsin. Right.

444
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,320
So. Well, compared to Michigan, Wisconsin. I mean the difference in.

445
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:59,650
Because that's part of what. A similar to Bennett, who is here, and Bennett who is new North Carolina minus new Wisconsin zero zero.

446
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:07,520
That is the difference. You mean cost?

447
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:17,850
Comparing North Carolina to Wisconsin.

448
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,240
Okay. So this gives us the interpretation of each single data in the model.

449
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:45,890
So now we see that the bay has. There were graphic locations, these tornadoes, these tornadoes.

450
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:54,140
These are interpreted as the difference when we compare the corresponding category to the reference category.

451
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,310
The reference category is the one that is not included in the model that is Wisconsin.

452
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:05,810
And what we compare each either the Michigan or North Carolina to Wisconsin for the reference category.

453
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:10,940
So the beta one represents the differs in that for that comparison.

454
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:20,659
And then the better zero is a represents the mean for the reference category.

455
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,410
That's for Wisconsin. So that's the mean cost for Wisconsin.

456
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,050
So these are the this is the interpretation for this three three bears.

457
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:45,370
And this. Way of making or including the variable, including the dummy variables into the model.

458
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:54,880
This is called a reference cell code, so that no argument about this will come back to this later when we see another alternative way of code.

459
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,990
Okay, so let's take a five minute break and then we will come back.

460
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,529
So well done variables with categorical variables and variables defined.

461
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,280
Here we are again. We are looking to carry out a hypothesis testing,

462
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:38,710
moving out or looking at this month as all we were treating Wisconsin as the reference category now we want to ask this question so is

463
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:49,030
expanding to different across the states and that's answer the original question we are being asked so is the examiner different states.

464
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,100
So now have others. This says that while there is no difference across the three states.

465
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:00,330
But in terms of the patents, now we have to express the hypothesis.

466
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,320
We have to address that in terms of the way to translate that, how this is such an important way,

467
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,880
how others express this in every way to know to to to have a positive view expressing towards our readers.

468
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:20,460
Now, in terms of balance, we just incorporated the oldest for evaders.

469
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,190
Now we saw that a beta one beta.

470
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:34,110
This represents the difference between, you know, Michigan and Wisconsin and I'm sorry, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin.

471
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:42,120
So there is no difference. That means both beta one and beta two.

472
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:53,630
Our. That is when there is no difference across this respect and versus now.

473
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:04,170
If there is any difference, that means either beta one is not equal to zero or theta to not zero is one of these is not a zero.

474
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,749
So this is the now we try to you know,

475
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:21,290
we translate the the novelas into Y in terms of our base and then we are able to construct past the statistic based on people that act from somewhere.

476
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:34,589
And so here the test statistic would be an F statistic that in the numerator is the actual sample squares by adding theta one,

477
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:39,480
beta two or this to the variables into a model that has.

478
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:43,970
Intercept along and then.

479
00:57:47,210 --> 00:58:00,660
Divided by the corresponding the word freedom, which is true in this case because we are testing to beat us is to and then divided by.

480
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,050
The denominator that is seen as I see for the more.

481
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:14,490
Now it's been a zero beta one beta two that is divided by the degree of freedom.

482
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,860
That's armadas p minus three.

483
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:28,440
In this case we have three data in the form on and this is the F statistic that we use in testing that our hypothesis

484
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:37,650
and then under the message this will fall out as fusion with 20 were freed on an amount of three D worth and.

485
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,830
This is how we test this novel business.

486
00:58:50,870 --> 00:59:00,070
This is the test, the standards. Okay.

487
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,920
So then as we mentioned, now we have three categories.

488
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,090
So we are able to create the three dummy variables, right?

489
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:17,560
One for each of the three states. And also because we have create a three time interval.

490
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,650
So why didn't we include all three comparables in the model?

491
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:26,640
So why we left? We left with all we left of this one out, right?

492
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,710
We left the Wisconsin out in front of the body.

493
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:36,879
So why didn't we include Wisconsin as well? So that we have you know, remember, we have created three different intervals.

494
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:46,780
We produce all three markets. Now, the reason is that let's take a look at the design matrix if we include all three.

495
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:51,010
So first look, first column, this is this corresponds to the intercept.

496
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,790
So here we have 12 rows because we have all farmers, you have 12 groups.

497
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:09,490
But first column this corresponds to the intercept. So this is the interesting and then the seventh column, this is the memorable,

498
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:21,760
let's say for measuring container for our mission and then for four or more per month and then for Wisconsin making this really necessary.

499
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:33,470
So far for Michigan, we look around and Wisconsin and over here, of course, I reorder I kind of reorder the subjects in the dataset.

500
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:38,919
So back to, you know, the first four farmers there from Michigan, the next for farmers,

501
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:43,090
they're from North America and then last for farmers, they're from Wisconsin.

502
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:49,240
I can always tell by the water that their roles I've changed the order of the rows so that this is the case.

503
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,990
But this is non-essential. This is just easier for us to see.

504
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,750
So now I have these three deliverables and I have the intercept.

505
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:07,630
This is my damages. So now do you notice anything that is.

506
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:19,730
No. Those seem to be right for this piece on Matrix. Yes.

507
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,860
In three lose when you're independent. Yeah, exactly.

508
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:28,420
We lose linear in the numbers, right.

509
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,480
Yeah. The wrap chorizo here. I mean, this these are matrix.

510
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,520
These are these are told by four metrics currently is a 12 by four leverage.

511
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,240
But if you look at Iraq, Iraq is just three.

512
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:45,620
The reason is that, for example, we've got the last three columns.

513
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,640
If you take the sum of the last three columns, you get the first column.

514
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:54,430
Ah. You were young. First column. So in other words, the wreck.

515
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:11,520
Of X that's equal to three out of four, but but an x but x for the dimension of x x is one but an x for x.

516
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,300
This is called by forth. These are metrics.

517
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:25,060
Numbers X is how full rank? The problem of x not a beautiful rag.

518
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,219
Is that. Well, mathematical offers.

519
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:33,360
Let's look at mathematically what happens. Recall that there is a better.

520
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,920
When we talk about linear regression around the variance of beta,

521
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,260
that there is a beta having a seamless workups and Trimble transport in some sense inverse.

522
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,900
It was. No, because actually it's not a full rack.

523
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:56,770
So that's first of all, it's times X. Well, although this is a four by four matrix.

524
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,550
So this is a four by four matrix. But it is rack is only three.

525
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,460
So this matrix is not a vertical. It's not a vertical.

526
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:16,240
It's a single reference. So in other words. If you try to emerge this matrix bottleneck, you will get error.

527
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,710
It's just not a vertical. So there is no mathematical.

528
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,280
A perspective now from another mathematical perspective.

529
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:36,520
So by including all three down variables. Together with The Intercept.

530
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,070
This moto has too many projects. You are not able to identify all these parameters.

531
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:53,619
Your data is not well. So basically you just your moto is to tell you this is not even is not only too complex, but it is actually in crack model.

532
01:03:53,620 --> 01:04:00,570
You are you are throwing many parameters and models but in the end, finally, you are not able to identify all these parameters.

533
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,559
So so this the reasons why when we film,

534
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:16,540
although we are able to define three deliverables but we include this DOM variables into the model, we leave one out as the reference.

535
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:22,150
So in our previous example, we left was custom about as our reference category.

536
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:31,930
So that that is our major. So that means we, we, we didn't have this column in a previous example.

537
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:41,200
So then we have a but x matrix is told by three which is four x and then we are able to identify all the previous.

538
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:49,430
Of course, this is not a unique that you could choose to leave this one out north here in that country,

539
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,519
or you could choose to leave Michigan out as the reference and doesn't matter done the trilogy.

540
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,580
You will get the same results in the end or same conclusion.

541
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:05,880
I be radically different numerical values because you are looking at your photos but you will get the same conclusion in the happen.

542
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:16,270
So that's the reason why we need to leave one out when we include the model

543
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:22,300
done in our way in the model that is the so-called clear reference SAL coding.

544
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:29,110
That means we have one cell retreat treated as the reference for the reference and encoding.

545
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:39,560
And if there is another way of including doppelgangers, that is the so called a cell mean coding.

546
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:47,250
That is. Together, we're going to have a dangerous act.

547
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:55,060
So we do not include intercept in the model. You can see that involved in this in this model here.

548
01:05:55,270 --> 01:06:04,570
Now, if we get rid of the Intersect now again, but we have three betas, but now the three betas are for the three governors.

549
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:12,970
That means more for the design matrix. We do not have this column anymore and there is no intercepts in this model.

550
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:18,610
And then again, we have a 12 by three matrix, which is a full ref.

551
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,190
So we can definitely proceed and fit this model and estimate all the bonus.

552
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:35,870
So that is the so-called. Sell me, including that is by getting rid of the first column of interest.

553
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,890
You can see that now adds becomes the three columns that corresponding to the three dummy variables.

554
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:50,970
So but the thing is and now with the three vetoes, the interpretations are different from the previous year.

555
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,720
Let us take a look at one of these three vetoes. How they interpret the three May has now been a one.

556
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:06,610
To interpret data one. We learned North Carolina equal to zero and Wisconsin equal to zero.

557
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,560
And so then we get rid of this two terms.

558
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:20,590
That means we're looking out at a farmer in Michigan. For farmers of Michigan, then this is equal to zero and this is equal to zero.

559
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:27,849
So we're looking at a farmer in Michigan. And then if we look at a farmer, Michigan, so there is no such term anymore.

560
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,800
And Michigan, this is equal to one. This in you get a see what was a better one.

561
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:40,480
So this is actually the median cost for farmers in Michigan.

562
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,940
Right. And a similar, if you will, have been a tool.

563
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:55,050
The beta tool is the mean cost. For.

564
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,640
Farmers in. North Carolina.

565
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:17,550
And Beta three is the mean cost. For farmers in Wisconsin.

566
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:31,620
Or as Wisconsin. These are now the interpretations of the three bailouts.

567
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:41,969
So this is the well, sort of the reason why we call it a sell me call is because now each bailout represents the mean of the correspondents,

568
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:48,890
our correspondent category. I know this is not a difference where previously the Spartans smiled,

569
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:58,260
but then the beta zero beta line better to these are interpreted as indifference in the new cause by comparing one category to the reference category.

570
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,330
And now these are simply the mean of each corresponding category.

571
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:09,990
Well, this is the cell being coding now for cell mean coding.

572
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:16,260
If we think of such a model and there's cell being coded, there's no Intersect, no longer intersecting in the model.

573
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,090
Now let's look at the same scientific question, the same significance.

574
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,930
So is expenditure different across this sense?

575
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:36,800
Now we need to translate this question into a hypothesis that that is really true for our babies.

576
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,300
Lucy There is no difference in expenditure across the three states now because the means are represented by the three meters.

577
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:52,760
So the novelist means that one is equal to better two is equal to beta three.

578
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:58,800
Only three means. There are the same. So then there is no. Which means there is no.

579
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:05,250
No difference across the three states. An alternative is that.

580
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:08,840
Well, at least one beta is different from the other two.

581
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:14,630
Right. Here you can again.

582
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:24,640
But I way not a little bit of the war but I was not able to get a three or better two is not able to get a three.

583
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,920
So essentially it means that at least a lot better is not equal to the other two bands.

584
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:44,220
But for some I have others know about this is we have a new rule talk about how to test it because all our previous hypotheses that we look at,

585
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:51,030
they are they are formulated as some some beta beta 1000200 and things like that.

586
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:58,980
Right. But here we are saying that none of these is necessarily equal to zero, but are there so when these details are equal.

587
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:05,460
So we so far, we don't have a test for this, but we will talk about psychopaths later in the visual audience.

588
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:13,320
But this is how to connect to this question of the interest to this is in the model.

589
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:32,620
Okay. So that's one major way of dealing categorical variables, that is to define dummy measurables.

590
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,600
And the dummy variables does indicators indicating each category.

591
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:46,770
If you have key categories, you could define key dummy variables, but why you included the some variables into the model?

592
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:56,020
You can either use the reference source coding that is to include K minus one of variables and leave one out as a reference.

593
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,759
Or you can use the mean reference.

594
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:07,300
Meaning the means. I just called the cell mean coding result.

595
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:12,999
Then you can of a yellow ball you get rid of intercept.

596
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:20,670
But they include of occasion the code on the variables. So that's one major way of dealing categorically.

597
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:29,450
Another major way is to assign some numerical values to these different categories within the categories.

598
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:37,480
So here now, because we talking about that example, let's just use our example as the example.

599
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:41,749
This is not a good example at all of that slide.

600
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:46,820
We're going to see a better example. But but because we are using the example, so let's,

601
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:55,010
let's just illustrated another way of dealing with a categorical variable is to assign numerical values.

602
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:07,490
So for an example, I have three states, but I will just sign this one, two, three, this numbers into this well, to this three categories.

603
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:13,210
And after a signing of this numerical values, what I have,

604
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:19,310
let's say I call this variable X as equal to one means, which means measurement as equal to two.

605
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:22,300
It means North Carolina, three, who is Wisconsin?

606
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:34,660
And now I have a variable that has three numerical values, and then I can feel tomorrow that has this s just equals s 11 and so on.

607
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:45,970
And I go ahead and fit this model. But you guys probably can already tell that this is really a bad approach for this particular example.

608
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:49,240
In this particular case, there are many problems.

609
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:56,979
Like one major problem is that, well, originally, I mean, there's three states, there's really no powder at all, right?

610
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:03,910
So it's just three states. But by assigning this numerical values, now you're seeing that.

611
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,400
Okay, you're seeing that.

612
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:16,870
The difference between Wisconsin and Michigan that is as larger than the difference between North Carolina analysts and and Michigan.

613
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:26,130
Right. That's that's that's actually one implication was by assigning this three numerical balance,

614
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:34,620
you're seeing that the difference between Wisconsin and Michigan that is larger than the difference between North Carolina and Michigan.

615
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,220
So that's one major problem of this thing.

616
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:45,060
So, I mean, this is is definitely not reasonable because there's no knowledge, no sorry information, all.

617
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,830
Oh. And the 7 million.

618
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,240
Like, why would you single someone to three? Why can't I assign 1 to 5?

619
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:02,720
Why can't I or someone four or six, for example?

620
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,680
So why do I have to assign 1 to 3? This is another.

621
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,780
A problem. Right. This is because of the assignment of this numerical value.

622
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:16,430
It could be very arbitrary. Why do I have to say two, one, two, three.

623
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,310
So there's another problem.

624
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:32,240
And another problem is by assigning this, you are actually imposing order upon the three states border among the three states.

625
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:39,470
So you are saying that, you know, North Carolina must be between Michigan and Wisconsin.

626
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:49,130
So either either there is an increasing order in terms of that, in terms of the cost for or or there is a decreasing order.

627
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:54,560
There is a vigorous order in terms of cost. But anyway, so you are saying that North Carolina is in the middle.

628
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,510
So you see that look,

629
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:06,320
there's there are also lots of problems associated with assigning a numerical value in this particular for this particular problem.

630
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:09,950
So here we are listening to some of them.

631
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:20,390
So, for example, like your law enforcement order in all these four states and also the spacing kind of like when you assign 1 to 3,

632
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:25,400
why not have one for six? These could all be very arbitrary.

633
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:35,330
So this is really, really bad idea. When you are dealing with categorical categories that have no order at the moment.

634
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:44,530
So. So, in other words, this is a. A poor example work.

635
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:52,710
Now, let's look at another example for which I mean, this idea is is okay, is not is not a great idea, but it is okay.

636
01:16:54,660 --> 01:17:00,990
That is. Now suppose we look at another covariate is not a state anymore.

637
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,610
That is a corporate income level, not income level.

638
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:16,580
Especially when you send out a survey asking people's income, you are that we do not ask or the questionnaire does not ask what exact number,

639
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:24,740
what are exact like, how much exactly you are but you like, but you try to provide several categories.

640
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:31,940
So whether your income is below, you know, 50,000 between this album and not his album and the movie about.

641
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,249
So so similar here so let's say we have the income level has three categories

642
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:43,280
low income median income and high income depending on what the exact income is.

643
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,840
And of course, this is a categorical variable. Our three categories low, medium and high.

644
01:17:51,970 --> 01:18:01,540
But there is a natural order. So we know that the low must be lower than medium, which it must be lower than high.

645
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:09,929
So there is a natural order and the first such of this variables are called of ordinal categorical variables.

646
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:16,290
So there is a natural order. So this is on ordinal categorical variables.

647
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,590
So for such categorical variables, of course, we could do different on the variables as before.

648
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:29,010
There's, there's that that is still a legitimate way of dealing with categorical there.

649
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:36,350
But alternative is to assign numerical values is assigned numerical values.

650
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:44,790
So for example, we work on one, two, three, four. There's three categories of four.

651
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:50,160
I mean, well, again, this could be rather arbitrary. You could assign 1 to 5 categories.

652
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:58,900
But typically, I mean, because this is so arbitrary, people will oftentimes they just simply assign 1 to 3 else.

653
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,920
There is strong reason to believe that. Okay.

654
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,900
So if you want to represent the the magnitude of the difference in the magnitude,

655
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:13,620
then you might consider like assigning different other values to reflect the difference in the magnitude.

656
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:21,510
But otherwise people might simply just assign one or three to reflect the order of these different categories.

657
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,030
Because indeed, there is an order. Right. So now I can assign 1 to 3 to reflect the other.

658
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:38,730
So. So then after doing this, I actually, instead of having a variable that have three categories like low,

659
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:43,960
medium, high, now I have a variable s that is numerical.

660
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:53,250
We just treat it as previously when we treat treated age, for example, or age has numerical values and hide has none of values, for example.

661
01:19:53,700 --> 01:20:00,600
Now, when we include it in the model, we just include the state of S in our model.

662
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:08,100
Of course, again, this is not ideal because there is arbitrariness in assigning numerical values,

663
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:13,800
but at least now the values reflect an order of the different categories.

664
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:21,540
And this is it turns out that this is a common and seen technique.

665
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:31,440
Well, people do this quite often, although, I mean, there are many problems, but people do this quite often for two purposes to meet, over, resist.

666
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:35,910
One is this is a way to learn very quickly.

667
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:40,830
If there is a trend, if there's a trend for four, why?

668
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:49,350
How wide? Depends on income. Because by feeding this model, I just look at a sign of bear.

669
01:20:49,620 --> 01:21:02,790
So if I just look at the sun a bit, a little bit of one apology, then it means, okay, so my Y actually increases as X as S increases.

670
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:10,680
And so that means as the income becomes higher, then I am going to see a higher Y.

671
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:21,180
So there is a trend. And if if beta y is negative, then I am going to see that there is a decrease in trend interdependence.

672
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:26,220
Of course, this does not tell us the, you know, the magnitude of the dependance,

673
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:31,830
but at least we have an idea of the trip, whether it increasing trend or decreasing trend.

674
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:41,370
Is there a reason why we don't combine almost combine this approach with what we were doing with dummy variables where you

675
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:49,080
have like a complete the first category and then like one one for the second category and then 111 for the third category.

676
01:21:49,470 --> 01:22:01,650
Does that make sense? Like instead of assigning a dummy variable with all other zeros, have it just be one for that category,

677
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:05,160
but also one for the categories below it for an order variable like this.

678
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:11,340
Oh, you mean like 100110111?

679
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:24,490
I'm thinking. Mathematically, I think that's probably okay mathematically.

680
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:29,660
However, I don't think many people do that.

681
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:37,209
Actually, I haven't seen people do that. The reason is that mathematically there are numerous ways of of coding this variable you can go

682
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:43,450
to as long as your design matrix is not a single so that you're okay or feeling like a model.

683
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:48,490
I got you. You got to define 100010001.

684
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:53,800
Or you could define just like one who's out of 100110111.

685
01:22:53,990 --> 01:23:01,000
So then in AB and or matrix is not is still a4x and you can still mathematically you can still feel that model.

686
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:11,770
So there are there are then there there are numerical are numerous different ways of coding the variables and each way mathematically is valid,

687
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:20,500
isn't legitimate. However, then the interpretation of the status is going to vary depending on how you exactly coded different variables.

688
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:30,669
And we have to have a, you know, like a sort of a uniform way, like a unified way of doing things so, so.

689
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:40,830
Dom variable like defining the indicators. That's, that's what people, you know, most people work for or maybe, oh yeah.

690
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:45,220
Or most people actually think about or agree to.

691
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:53,080
Well, that's a that's a good way. So so the way you just described it mathematically, I think is valid,

692
01:23:53,170 --> 01:24:02,770
but it's just I don't think that people do that in practice just as an approach for the order variables as opposed to the others.

693
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:11,710
Um, no, I think they still different because here we are simply defining one variable.

694
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:16,180
Yes. But the way you describe, identify three variables.

695
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:25,270
Right. Right. So in a way, you I mean, that's I think that's equivalent to defining three government areas is just how you go through that.

696
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:33,730
You introduce three new variables and there is a 1 to 1 transformation between the variables and the variable you just described.

697
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:41,410
So they are equivalent mathematically that are equivalent, but they are neither one is equivalent to this.

698
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:56,210
Okay. So yeah, so one way, one advantage of assigning a numerical amount of weight.

699
01:24:56,210 --> 01:25:00,710
As we mentioned, this is very a way of tracking if there is a there is a trend.

700
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,860
So if I'm just looking at my finger in this model, I'm looking at about the size of beta one and see if there is a trend.

701
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,830
Oh, yeah.

702
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:21,340
Well, we can actually test whether beta one is equal to zero or not, and to claim marginally and to test whether there's a linear trend or not.

703
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:28,870
Because if beta one is not what is significantly different from from zero and there again,

704
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:36,490
there seems to be a V or trend of dependance of white on this income variable.

705
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:48,680
So this is what advantage? Okay.

706
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:03,420
Yeah, that's right. Okay. So this is this is the major advantage of of of of coding available in this way, assigning numerical values.

707
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:10,890
So, again, it's nice to look at the trend and to see whether trend is linear and oftentimes.

708
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:23,410
Even though people believe that this is not an ideal file because again, because it would be rather arbitrary.

709
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:29,360
This is not ideal, but we will still have a preliminary data analysis.

710
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:38,750
Then I still do this just to see. Well, again, this is to see if there is a trend in the data and also if the trend is linear.

711
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:42,770
This is very quickly. Of course, there are many other ways of testing.

712
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:49,100
If there is a trend and we find this linear, but this is one easy way there, very easy way to do this.

713
01:26:53,810 --> 01:27:00,050
Well, again, this this this is a more sensible example because compared to the previous one,

714
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:05,120
previous one, the three states, there's no order at all among the three states.

715
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:09,710
So in this case, assigning numerical balance is really a bad idea.

716
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:15,710
But when there is a natural order in this case, when there is natural order,

717
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:22,160
then then you could actually assign some numerical balance to reflect the natural order.

718
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:28,760
And also you could assign numerical values to even refer to the magnitude of the difference.

719
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:35,300
If you have strong reason to believe that this is a better reflection of the.

720
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,050
I'm the manager in the different categories.

721
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:49,759
Right. Oh. But here, while we have to be very careful about this approach as well,

722
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:59,090
because the interpretation now depends on how you assign this value or the numerical value of this will change, depends on how you assign this value.

723
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:19,370
Okay. So that's a, you know, a comparison across groups when we have categorical variables.

724
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:26,030
Now, in practice, of course, the data has both categorical variable and a continuous variable.

725
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:31,640
Well, hopefully tomorrow we will need to include all polls have variable in the model.

726
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:43,760
So this is an example, let's say in the days that we have age, in addition to the three states, the state variables, we have farmers age as well.

727
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:51,140
And then we see the model we want to adjust for farmers age when we started their health care cost.

728
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,720
So in called agreement model as well.

729
01:28:53,960 --> 01:29:02,930
And then we include the two variables into the models and this sort of model is called and coma analysis of covariance.

730
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:19,540
So the previous model where we. Well, we include only the dummy gerbils.

731
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:24,070
That's the so-called ANOVA analysis of variance.

732
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:31,870
But when we include chameleons variable, that's called a coma and some covariance, this is just a normal ANOVA.

733
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:36,580
And coworkers then used to be a huge thing in foster hosts.

734
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:45,040
You know, there there used to be a single course exception, of course, just talking about analysis of the variance and the covariance.

735
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,860
But now we're divided by the linear regression model. I mean, you get a regression model can cover both.

736
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:55,600
Both, I mean, can be, I mean can be, can be.

737
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,670
To be treated as federal cases of linear regression marked by introducing dividing variables.

738
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:10,640
So. So now we do not need to really to have separate causes for analysis of variance analysis, of course,

739
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:21,740
but sometimes people still use the nets like this two terminologies analysis of various ANOVA that is linear regression model with only categorical,

740
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:26,330
there is only one categorical an nasal covariance.

741
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:38,750
And now some covariates. This is a linear regression model with both a categorical and a continuous error.

742
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:48,390
Okay. Oh, and then for this model, let's look at Beta three.

743
01:30:49,020 --> 01:31:02,850
The introduction of beta three. This is the age. But even in fact, now when we try to interpret it age, in fact, we recall that this is adjusting for.

744
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:09,260
The stage variable. We've included the two variables for states.

745
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:17,080
So this is after adjusting for set of error. So then the interpretation of beta three, the any fact it's very similar to before.

746
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:33,350
So this is the mean change in y the mean change in health care cost per y year increase in h for y you're increase in h adjusting for state.

747
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,560
Draws in first date. But what does it mean by adjusting for a state?

748
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:42,760
That means by looking at a farmers within the same state.

749
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:50,919
It doesn't matter which say they are looking at whether you are looking at a farmers within Michigan, farmers in Wisconsin,

750
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:58,090
farmers in North Carolina, no matter which state you're looking at as well as you're looking at the farmers in the same states.

751
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,960
That's adjusting for the state. As long as you're looking at farmer from the same state.

752
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:10,260
Then Beta three is the mean trend in healthcare for one year increase in age.

753
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:23,570
Okay. So this is what? Oriana was this.

754
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,300
This last sentence. This is equivalent to.

755
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:48,320
Previously said adjusting for state but it's just a more concrete a more a more specific a way of saying a closet

756
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,940
or state what I mean by just for a saint that is to look at farmers or to compare farmers in the same state.

757
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:12,410
And then we can afford this model and cobalt for including both categorical and continuous variables.

758
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:19,610
We are able to look at what again, we are able to look at.

759
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:26,480
The question then, is there any difference in the cost across the states?

760
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:32,270
But now after adjusting for age. After adjusting for age.

761
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:42,300
So in terms of betas. Again, we are looking at if there is any differences across the states.

762
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:48,030
And so, again, it has to whether beta one is equal to beta zero is equal to zero.

763
01:33:55,420 --> 01:34:07,290
Oh. An alternative is that at least one or maybe better one not able to zero or better two is not able to.

764
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:22,090
Right. And for pass the statistic.

765
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:27,310
Okay, so what?

766
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:35,750
I'm sure that has started to look like. So anybody have a look?

767
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,120
Let's give it a try. Like what? What Alfred looks like in this case.

768
01:34:53,010 --> 01:35:06,360
I just imagine this to be a midterm exam question and we will likely see several classroom measurements of this numerous revising committees.

769
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:15,990
So most of people want to give an introductory one and cover two.

770
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:26,320
Zero Anniversary year uncovered terms and divided by 20 by welcome and reserve denominated

771
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:41,270
under reserve in SLC of 04.13.2 investment of ten divided by one minus four in minus four.

772
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:48,380
I'm so pleased to be asked to answer those moments for.

773
01:35:49,400 --> 01:36:00,200
Okay. Excellent. Yeah. So that's exactly the kind of statistics that we we should use to test this, not have a disease.

774
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:10,669
So we are to test this null hypothesis. I mean, we should look at how much the sample squared change by adding by adding,

775
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:14,960
you know, this student marbles into the model that has already h in it.

776
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:21,860
Now so that's the sample square by adding this tool into a model that has already been examined age

777
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:29,660
divided by true because here we are testing to pass it and again the numerator as are the denominator,

778
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:33,980
that's the error sample square for the full model.

779
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:44,500
The full model includes four betas as well, so is divided by minus four from denominator this.

780
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:50,890
So this is the test statistic. We should use some that model this.

781
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:08,200
Okay. And as we mentioned, for a continuous variable, like even for age,

782
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:17,920
oftentimes people prefer breaking age into different categories rather than just drag it through an age into the model as a as just a single,

783
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,220
continuous, terrible. There are some advantages of doing this.

784
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,760
There are drawbacks and advantages. We're going to talk about a little later.

785
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:30,610
But now let's let's see one example of how to break age into different categories.

786
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:34,120
So let's say that the age older people have age.

787
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,630
For older people are older than 25 years old.

788
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,790
Right. And then we just break age in the USA.

789
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:48,670
I mean, this particular data analyst was a little break age already, Matthew, the oldest age into this.

790
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:57,400
The following different categories are aged between 2029, 32, 39, 40, 49, 50, 59 and about 60.

791
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:06,930
There's two categories. And then let's say we want to take the oldest group as the reference category,

792
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:19,800
but then the model will include the dummy variables for the first four categories you can view and all the variables depending on which subject,

793
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,270
depending on where somebody fall into which category. Then you decide what to will have one.

794
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,010
When you go to a category, then you get are able to one or the other is equal to zero.

795
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:34,590
And then you include these as now become dummy variables.

796
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:37,690
This is these are all dummy variables.

797
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:46,920
These are just indicators that indicate whether a line has been to the corresponding falls into the corresponding range.

798
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:53,250
So we have this word on the variables that was going into the four categories.

799
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:01,320
But if we leave the last one, like for people who are older than 60 years old, we treat them as the reference category.

800
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:06,570
You see that in this model does not exclude that the indicator for that category.

801
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:10,200
Right. So, so we define a five variable splitting.

802
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:15,500
We include a four in and we leave one out as the reference similarity.

803
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:20,130
I mean, while this is the same four state result we leave, we define three dummy variables,

804
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:25,950
but we only include two relief which calls it out as the reference.

805
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:41,710
And then the interpretation of Peter three. Beta three is the is inclusion for age group one and a double interval for group one equivalent.

806
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:48,130
And now the interpretation is we are going to interpret it as three interpreted beta

807
01:39:48,130 --> 01:40:02,620
three So first this beta three is the in fact of the first age group for the four age.

808
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:09,370
We are treating the last age group as people older than six years old, about six years old.

809
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:17,200
We are treating them as the rats so that the beta three is actually the difference.

810
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:22,680
The difference. In health care costs.

811
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:31,210
You mean health care costs? Comparing this particular age category, that's category one to the reference age category.

812
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:42,010
So so in other words, the beta three. This is the mean difference in cost me differences in cost comparing.

813
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,510
I mean, what business here does it say? Excellent. So the median cost.

814
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:52,990
Now you're comparing. Age group.

815
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:56,650
One two age group.

816
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:11,970
The reference category were, in other words, comparing people for between 20 and 29 years to people who are from 60 years old, like somebody.

817
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:20,030
So this is not of course. Don't forget that this is after adjustment for state.

818
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:28,150
After adjustment for state. Well, just on the first day that we mean that we look at the farmers from the same stage.

819
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:38,140
It matter whether you're looking at farmers in Wisconsin, in Michigan or in North Carolina, as long as your farmers live in the same state.

820
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,610
No, but it really represents the mean difference.

821
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:49,810
Comparing the first indicator for the last indicator to the reference category.

822
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:55,020
Okay. So this is not the interpretation of three.

823
01:41:55,870 --> 01:42:01,990
And a similarity. The similarity you are able to interpret better for better 5 to 6.

824
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:09,020
Right. And also similar to you are able to determine how best versus no.

825
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:12,250
All these can be interpreted in that in a similar fashion.

826
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:24,029
Now what about of being a zero? So the other way they can be interpreted in a similar way as Peter three.

827
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:28,050
But what I what about a better zero. Okay.

828
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:31,560
So that's. Yeah. So we're out of time, but let's, let's, let's finish this very quickly.

829
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:37,770
So, Peter zero, that is when all the other variables are equal to zero.

830
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:42,690
That's one of the variables. Our goal in the model. That's nothing zero.

831
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:47,070
Right. But what does mean what all the other variables there is?

832
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:54,270
You know, for a state, the two variable for a state are equal to zero means.

833
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:58,050
We're looking at data from the state and that is that is Wisconsin.

834
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:06,150
And and for all these four age variables equal to zero, that means we're moving out of the reference age group.

835
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,670
That is the people who are older than six years old.

836
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:16,680
Right. So about 60 years. So then that answer gives us the meaning of interpretation.

837
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:28,800
So this is the mean cost for farmers in the referencing which is Wisconsin.

838
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:40,920
Yeah. And before for, you know about six years old.

839
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:55,850
And that's the interpretation of because if you say okay so we yeah we will stop here in the United Futures.
