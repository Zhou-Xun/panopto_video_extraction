1
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,853
After we have done a thorough
review of the issue and

2
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:15,397
the problem, and
then clarified our goal, and

3
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:20,509
identified who can actually
help advance that goal,

4
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:28,484
it's very important to learn the process
through which that goal can be achieved.

5
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:32,246
What I'm talking about
here is the question of,

6
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,737
is this a legislative process?

7
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:37,882
Is it a regulatory process?

8
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:44,437
How exactly will the decision be made
that will help you achieve your goal?

9
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:48,881
A thorough understanding of
each step in that process,

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,391
will reveal opportunities for influence.

11
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:57,782
For example, a legislative
process will include hearings.

12
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:01,215
The beauty of hearings in our democracy,

13
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:05,824
is that most of the time
particularly here in Michigan,

14
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:10,825
to include your views as part
of the open record of a hearing,

15
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:16,827
all you have to do is learn of the hearing
and attend, and fill out a card.

16
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,128
And then the floor is yours.

17
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:25,998
So that's a fabulous opportunity for
influencing the debate around a topic.

18
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:32,499
Being aware of the timing is so
important, when will votes occur?

19
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:37,535
What exactly is happening along
the way until that decision is made?

20
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,901
And then equally important is
to learn the etiquette and

21
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:45,419
protocol around the schedule,
the legislative schedule, for example.

22
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,791
So going back to the smoke-free workplace,

23
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:53,849
case study that I mentioned earlier,
we were able to participate in

24
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,106
several hearings while the discussion
of the proposal was underway.

25
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:05,025
And, as I mentioned earlier, we were
able to place our bed strategically,

26
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:10,865
knowing of the timing of both the votes
and the consideration on the floor.

27
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:17,483
So we were able to identify opportunities
for influence along the way.

28
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:24,605
Our next step focuses on building
out our messengers around our goal.

29
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:30,244
So the question we ask ourselves is who
can actually help us accomplish the goal?

30
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:34,969
A critical point in the process
is the identification and

31
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,929
cultivation of a policy champion.

32
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,984
So what is a champion?

33
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:45,231
A champion is someone on the inside
internally to the process,

34
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,904
whether that's a legislator,

35
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:52,864
whether that's a senior staff
person in the legislature.

36
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:58,133
Someone who will be there as
the decision is being made.

37
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,829
Someone who is so
committed to you advancing your goal and

38
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,295
achieving your goal.

39
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:07,864
That they will be there in the middle of
the night when the legislation is being

40
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:10,692
sliced and diced and
decisions are being made.

41
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,296
Someone internal to the process
who's really moving,

42
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:17,760
moving things along for
you when you can't be there.

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,585
The second and
more nuanced point of why it is so

44
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:27,288
important to have a champion,
is that that person is also your mole.

45
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:32,682
That's the person who during the
smoke-free workplace legislation debate,

46
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:37,673
was able to call me and say, Jen,
the Michigan restaurant association is

47
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:40,672
planning a rally on
the lawn of the Capitol.

48
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,249
And there will be people here
from bars and restaurants and

49
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:46,443
workplaces from across the state.

50
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,777
You all need to be here too.

51
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:53,228
So that's the person who's
giving you the intel, and

52
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:57,407
allowing you to anticipate
what is coming up next.

53
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:03,008
So having a champion is critically
important as we're advancing the goal.

54
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:08,067
And similarly the ability
to build out the number of

55
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:15,607
people an organization's stakeholders
who are also advancing your goal.

56
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:19,167
So think about how to
build out a coalition, so

57
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:25,011
you really you're increasing the capacity,
the number of people sort of,

58
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:29,415
singing off the same song
sheet is the term that's used.

59
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,543
So how do you do that?

60
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:38,668
How do you identify stakeholders who you
think might help you advance your goal?

61
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,916
And there are a couple of nuances here.

62
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:47,269
The most easily sort of accessible
way to do this in my opinion,

63
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,723
is going back to the etiquette and
thinking about building those

64
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:58,189
relationships that I mentioned
in the beginning of the module.

65
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:03,235
So what I advise, is when you're
attending a conference on a topic,

66
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:08,455
are there other people who would share
a goal that may not be intuitive,

67
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:13,327
who you might say, would you have
a few minutes to talk with me about

68
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:17,431
this upcoming advocacy
strategy that we are engaging?

69
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:22,076
Would you have a few minutes to look
over some materials I'm thinking about

70
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:22,895
promoting?

71
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:25,841
It's the same skill set that students and

72
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:31,147
professionals use as they're building
out their professional network,

73
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:36,048
and thinking about job changes and
looking at other opportunities.

74
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:42,870
It's that relationship building that is so
important in this advocacy world.

75
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,140
So building out that coalition and
including grassroots efforts,

76
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,855
often the term grassroots is used and
misunderstood, and so

77
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:56,378
I'd like to include what
I think that means.

78
00:05:56,378 --> 00:06:00,236
Grassroots efforts are so
important because it

79
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:04,777
builds out your coalition
across a geographical area.

80
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:09,939
So that then when a proposal is pending,
in a legislature

81
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,759
even in a city council,
in the Congress, whatever the body is.

82
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,982
The grass roots allows us to
call on constituents from

83
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:26,797
various key legislator's
districts to advance our goal.

84
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:32,853
So it's very important to
identify a champion and

85
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:38,774
build out a coalition as
allies in this process.

86
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:43,824
Our next step is thinking about
messaging which is so very important.

87
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:49,419
The language that we use in describing
our proposal are advocacy goal is so

88
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,761
critically important
particularly in partisan times.

89
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:58,998
So understanding what will
resonate with the decision maker.

90
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:03,986
Often, some of these proposals boil
down to the economic impact, or

91
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,314
the tax impact, really money.

92
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:14,376
And so knowing that will allow us to use
language that will reframe our points,

93
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:20,864
in a way that is attractive to
various specific policy makers.

94
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:27,083
So for example, when we were thinking
about enactment of the Medicaid expansion

95
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:32,302
in Michigan, we re-framed that
debate around healthy Michigan.

96
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:36,020
And we talked about
personal responsibility and

97
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,199
accountability as ways of
building in these changes.

98
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,030
So understanding that different terms,
words,

99
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:52,515
messages will resonate with different
audiences is critically important.

100
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:56,898
I strongly advise any
advocate to prepare talking

101
00:07:56,898 --> 00:08:01,697
points prior to a conversation
with decision makers,

102
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:06,078
which again allows us as
the advocate to refine and

103
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:10,802
hone in on the words that we
want to be sure that we use.

104
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:14,745
So the preparation here
is critically important.

105
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:20,359
And going back to the point that I
mentioned in the beginning of the module,

106
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:25,350
being able to include arguments in
our own arguments that actually

107
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,649
refute the opposition is
a nuance that's often missed.

108
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:34,701
But allows us to arm the staff or
arm the decision maker

109
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:41,225
with the responses to that opposition's
argument In our own pitch.

110
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:46,699
And finally understanding the political
context to some of these debates,

111
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:52,601
it's critically important, and realizing
that there may be some limitations,

112
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,179
and some issues related to timing.

113
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,093
So It's not just the substance.

114
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:04,444
It's the relationships and the political
context for these conversations.
