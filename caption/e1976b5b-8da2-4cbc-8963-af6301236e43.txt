1
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,910
That was a lot of important content. I know I find myself returning to Dr. Peoples' six principles of anti-racist teaching frequently.

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,390
It's such a great framework to grow my teaching. Yeah, I agree.

3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:45,570
And the article by Kyoko Kishimoto. I think about that one a lot to remind me that anti-racist teaching is about three things: course content, teaching

4
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,800
approach, and organizing for equity in our institutions and communities.

5
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,190
Yeah, and so many other foundational things from this module.

6
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,570
It feels really important that we continue to return to that content to recenter

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,680
ourselves and recommit ourselves to the work and journey towards anti-racist teaching.

8
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,450
It's so easy to lose sight of the big picture when we're in the daily grind of teaching life.

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,440
Yeah, that's so true. And I think that's what we've been able to do for each other,

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,810
be that sounding board for teaching and remind each other of some of these foundations when we're struggling.

11
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,420
Absolutely. I think having that critical friend or network of people is so crucial for this journey.

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,270
Agreed. All right. Let's keep moving. Let's go.
