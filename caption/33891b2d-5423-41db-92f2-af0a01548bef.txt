1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:18,470
And she spoke to me and I said to the parents, are they going to introduce me today?

2
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,430
You. Yeah. Completely useless.

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,070
I don't know why this is so much requested.

4
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:53,400
I don't know. Think it seems as though it's not highly unusual.

5
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,290
And then. Then I. You should. If I did and didn't have it yet.

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,930
You're getting worse. Yes, I know for yourself.

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,520
Conceivable, I am sure.

8
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,470
And I don't know if you are. All right, let's get started.

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:24,000
I on canvas some things in this page about 12, six and 12, eight.

10
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,560
So on Tuesday, we're going to discuss projects one, seven, eight and six in that order.

11
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,940
That's why it's not increasing.

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,060
So this is like the phase one, phase one, two, and then the Emulex debate.

13
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,129
And then on Thursday, we're going to do the other projects which are the smart factorial stepped wedge.

14
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:57,000
And this other thing is real stuff like patient reference design.

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:11,009
So on. I'm going to come prepared with some discussion questions, but I also want the groups that presented to be here to talk about what they did,

16
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:17,190
what they had, etc. and for others to be here to ask questions so that it is a learning experience.

17
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,280
And everybody's thinking about what these designs are because it's still part of the class, still part of what I want you to get from it.

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,150
All of your projects were due today. They should be on Yellow Day.

19
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,880
I haven't watched or graded any, so for some weird reason, it's telling you that it's graded.

20
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,760
It's not. Don't worry. I will. I will grade them.

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,730
But I'm going to be watching them from now until Tuesday and Thursday.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,780
And I'm also going to be including. So in your final grade for your project is going to be my grade for you.

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,680
It's going to also include your peer review grades for you.

24
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,410
But it's a weighted average where mine is more because everybody usually is way too nice to other groups.

25
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,030
And then it also includes like some information about your within group reviews and how those were.

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:17,519
So if there are that there are groups that were really not doing very well and that's clear and you should be honest in that right.

27
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,170
Is going to I'm going to write comments about that and in your in feedback about the group,

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,840
it's usually pretty obvious before I even see the within group reviews from the videos about it.

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,620
So groups are working well together, so you will get a grade, but it likely will not be until the end of next week in that section.

30
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,700
Any questions? All right.

31
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,160
So today I wanted to just do a little overview of the projects.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,350
So all of these projects I took actually, all except for two, I guess I took from things that I directly worked on.

33
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,679
So they are either trials that I have designed and have in the field and or designed and went in for

34
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,350
a grant a grant proposal and either didn't get funded and or I bailed out of for other reasons.

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,780
So there is the first one is a phase two, a phase one with two treatments.

36
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,250
And then we had a factorial design step to edge patient preference design.

37
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,290
Smart Design six is a little different. So those in six were actually thinking about a new design.

38
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,780
It was there was a trial that occurred and it went to the FDA to try to get approval of the drug.

39
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,090
And then there was an advisory committee,

40
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,180
and the advisory committee had feedback about whether they thought it was appropriate to approve that drug or not.

41
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,450
And the FDA had feedback about it. They agreed with the advisory board.

42
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,560
And of course, the companies submitting it had their own opinion.

43
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,309
And so it's just a really interesting case of like real world,

44
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,190
how drugs can get approved and or how there can be controversies of controversial aspects about it.

45
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,750
And there is even after I wrote this, there was an update about this trial.

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,860
So just really interesting and very current. And then there are two projects which were phase one.

47
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,670
Phase two projects which were maybe most similar to what we've done in class.

48
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,950
But otherwise, these were all really new, new things.

49
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,930
And the goal was to get you to learn new areas, to apply what you've done, to share with all of our classmates what we've done.

50
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:40,780
But there is not necessarily like one right answer. So I'm going to go over some ideas here, but they're not necessarily like the best.

51
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,880
I think hopefully you're learning and statistics that there's a lot of art and a lot of options in it.

52
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,180
And you try to think about what is the best for that setting.

53
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,349
And because you weren't able to talk with the investigator.

54
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,390
Right. You had to take some some guesses at times and do what you just thought was best.

55
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,040
Okay. So this first one I want to talk about is a phase one design.

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,610
So we're interested in dose finding, but we have two treatments for which both dose levels could differ.

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,910
And so when we talked about dose finding and phase one designs,

58
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,720
we put up this graph which shows that our main assumption is that as dose level increases,

59
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,030
toxicity increases and as dose level increases, efficacy increases.

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,970
And so we assumed this monotonic pattern between dose and toxicity and efficacy.

61
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,700
Now that's relatively easy to assume when we have one treatment, right?

62
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,830
But now if we have two treatments for which both dose levels can change,

63
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:54,020
we might go up in one dose of one treatment and stay at the same for another dose level, or go up in that one or go down.

64
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:01,370
And we don't actually know. Right. We might not know if that's still monotonic that as we go across, I'll show you a table.

65
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:11,630
Right. Like if we have three dose levels of drug, one and four of dose, two of drug, two for dose levels of dose two.

66
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,030
Right. This C1 one is a combination of these two drug C1 two combination, combination.

67
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,070
And so it's not clear, right? If we just go across the rows, is this the model?

68
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:31,490
Is this how we would determine, well, okay, I guess this is less toxic than this one and this one than this one, except for it's using dose level one.

69
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,240
Right. How do we decide where the monotonic relationship is?

70
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:42,560
And so this becomes a more complicated problem because we can't necessarily just plug this into our serum three plus three,

71
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,370
you know, type of phase one designs that we learned about.

72
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,690
So this combination and the model tenacity assumption are potentially.

73
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,920
At heads with each other. So there are a bunch of different options for how you can address this problem.

74
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,229
So one of which is if you can actually get the investigator to say, Oh, I can specify which of these combinations,

75
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:18,270
like I can write out the order such that as we go from here to here to here to here to here, in these combinations, the toxicity increases.

76
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,030
And so somehow, if they could list C, one, one through C four, three in order, right?

77
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,190
We could just apply all those methods that we had.

78
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:38,970
Alternatively, there are other designs which have been made to try to address this to treatment combination issue.

79
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,240
So one is a Bayesian optimal interval design, and this kind of is like a hybrid of addressing this issue.

80
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:56,430
So this says, well, if we can fix one dose level, then we can fix one dose and assume tenacity when the other drug level increases.

81
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:03,950
Right. So in this way, we can define use what we call admissible set of doses for which we can escalate and de-escalate.

82
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,890
And usually what it means is that, like, if we have a table like this, we could say, well, I know the relationship here, right?

83
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,280
And I know the relationship here, but I don't know what happens if we go on a diagonal.

84
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,770
But if I can just put some of these admissible sets together,

85
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:30,540
then perhaps I can use this bivariate isotonic regression and allow for escalation across rows or down columns, but just not go diagonally.

86
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,180
So this is like one option to do this. If you go to there's an amazing website called Trial Design dot org by MD Anderson.

87
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,610
They had a really big grant at one point to put this website together and then they maintained it

88
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:51,810
because they have really great infrastructure there and they have amazing documentation and software,

89
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:00,840
standalone software for lots of different phase one and phase two trial designs, one of which is using this Bayesian optimal interval designer point.

90
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,250
There's also something called the partially ordered CRM.

91
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,870
And so this is sort of a more maybe natural or what we would expect to see to try

92
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,679
to deal with this in terms of if we have a CRM and now we have two treatments,

93
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,710
how do we deal with it?

94
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:28,770
We can use this p o CRM design, and this was an extension of the CRM such that if we know the ordering for some of the combinations,

95
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,799
we can reduce this table to some matrix of vectors where we know that while this dose has lower toxicity than this one.

96
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,380
Than this one. Right? Well, this one has lower toxicity than this one. Than this one.

97
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,170
And so we can get this like listing of orders that we know exist.

98
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,580
Right. And they can be across the columns or diagonals or whatever.

99
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:58,710
We just know that that these are the orders that make sense, that we can put a prior on how likely we think each of those orders are.

100
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,820
And then we can calculate the posterior distributions given what we see in the patients and the skeleton.

101
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:12,240
And we can assign a patient to the dose closest to the toxic target toxicity rate according to the chosen ordering.

102
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,830
So there's like two levels here. It's like what's the toxicity of the dose and which ordering of this dose combination are we in?

103
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,370
And I'm not going into a lot of detail here because I'm hoping that the projects address some of these.

104
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,120
So that's why you might be like, what? But what I am doing is I'm giving you resources and I'm also hopefully like.

105
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,180
Tempting you to watch the projects to see if they talk about these or if they discuss these.

106
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:47,200
Anyway, like I said, there's this trial design talk website and if you ever if you decide to go into anything,

107
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:56,080
any industry or research position where you're ever doing phase one, phase two research, you should always think about this website and go back to it.

108
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,620
Some of it provides. I think it's I think it's really all standalone software.

109
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,150
So it's not like you have to have are, but there are also are packages which can do the same thing.

110
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:21,640
So they have this point package and and website and there has been a extension so that it can deal with multiple, multiple drugs as well.

111
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,030
Then there's a type. So if you would need a time to event CRM, not just a CRM, there is a time to event.

112
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:37,600
And Boyne however, so far it's not you can't deal with multiple drugs, so it's not totally appropriate for this setting, but it might be for others.

113
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:45,639
And then there's this CRM which has an R package that could be used in a setting, and there might be other options too.

114
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,720
But I'm just suggesting a few. We might see that the groups decided to do something else.

115
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,670
This project was inspired by a breast cancer trial that I've worked on.

116
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:02,559
I was actually able to get the the bless you, the investigator to specify a specific ordering.

117
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,120
And we just used type zero. So it was a lot simpler than any of these methods.

118
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,550
But if you can't get someone to do that, then you need to think about about these.

119
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:23,600
Okay. And here are some of the some of the resources if you're interested in learning more particularly about the or or this one, the point.

120
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay. So the next project is a factorial design and so this is a factual design is related

121
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,090
to sometimes confused with the crossover are also related to smart designs.

122
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,440
And so that's why on the second day we'll do factorial and then smarts and I'll show you a comparison in one of these slides.

123
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:53,480
So Factorial design generally has two or more intervention comparisons that are carried out at once within the same trial.

124
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,260
The most common factorial design is what we call a two by two design.

125
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,139
So that means that there's two factors, each with two levels.

126
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:09,320
So it's like, I'm interested in testing treatment A versus treatment B, but I could have a or a placebo or B or placebo.

127
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:17,510
That's one option. Or like I worked on a factorial design where they're interested in different levels of text messaging.

128
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,660
So it was like daily text messaging or weekly text messaging,

129
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:29,570
and then there was other levels of they got a they had assistance in scheduling doctor's appointments versus they didn't.

130
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,169
Right.

131
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:39,260
So there are two levels to these two different factors and we're interested in how these things work in terms of of their effect on the outcome.

132
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,110
The goal of a factorial design is generally to achieve two trials for the price of one, right?

133
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,060
So we have these two factors. We're interested in their effects and we can do it all within this one trial.

134
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,340
Now we see you when I show you the little plot of a two by two design.

135
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,290
There are individuals who are assigned here. Let me show you right off this this treatment, A, yes or no.

136
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,540
B, yes or no. Individuals get randomized to being in one of these table cells.

137
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,010
So they either get both placebo only A, only B or both A and B.

138
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,510
So because we actually have some groups that have both A and B, right. We could potentially look into the interaction of A and B.

139
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,049
Now most factorial designs actually assume that there is no interaction.

140
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,630
And the reason why they do that is because then we get more bang for our buck.

141
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,680
We're fully powered for this comparison of A versus nothing, B versus nothing.

142
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,520
Sometimes we might specifically be interested in this interaction and we can power a factorial design for that.

143
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,460
However, we're now going to require more participants so that we could have.

144
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,059
It's not like we're saving as much in terms of resources by doing this all in one trial.

145
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,160
But we are asking it or answering a question for which we couldn't if we did separate trials.

146
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,540
So our main interest is generally in looking at what we call the main effects.

147
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,600
So the effect of a and the effects of B separately.

148
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,800
And we do that essentially by averaging over anyone who got four.

149
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,550
So for B, we average over anyone who got B and for A, we average over anyone who got a.

150
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,700
So we consider both those who had A and B in both groups.

151
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,750
We can also estimate the interactions between them and we can we can try to see the interaction

152
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,560
and how that compares to just the effect of B alone or just the effect of A alone.

153
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:44,200
So in order to use a factorial design, they're relatively underused, I would say, in the literature.

154
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,090
But part of that reasoning is because you really have to think about these considerations before applying it.

155
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,390
So the treatments must be able to be administered in combination.

156
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,920
Obviously, you couldn't do a factorial design if you couldn't give these two treatments simultaneously.

157
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:05,770
If that somehow had a harmful effect or like I don't know, just weren't able to be tolerated together.

158
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,010
And you can't change the the dosage of the amount you would give if it was just given alone.

159
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,420
Right. You have to keep those the same. It also must be acceptable to not administer the individual treatments.

160
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,410
Right. If you're going to have like a versus placebo. Then you have to be able to give placebo and not be ethical or B versus placebo.

161
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,880
So there has to be some equipoise across all of the treatments and no treatment and or control has to differ.

162
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,570
Even though you might not necessarily have power for the interaction,

163
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,340
you need to be scientifically interested in those because otherwise you should just run separate trials, right?

164
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,630
Why would you do this? You shouldn't do it just to try to save resources.

165
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,660
And then, of course, as in any other trial, the therapeutic questions must be chosen appropriately.

166
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,960
And we want to think about usually factorial designs or testing treatments that have different mechanisms of action.

167
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,520
And so we're interested in which one is is more effective.

168
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,790
There's also what it's called fractional factorial design.

169
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,679
So the reason why it's two by two factorial designs are the most common is because we have four cells,

170
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,120
and that's logistically and realistically feasible in terms of accrual and randomization.

171
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:36,520
If you start getting more than two by two. So for example, you have four factors with each of which have two level plus or minus, right?

172
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:44,450
All now you have 16 potential combinations and running a trial where you're randomizing to essentially 16 different arms.

173
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:52,850
Right. That's likely going to take a lot of patients, even if you are reducing this to a question of a the main effects of ABC and D

174
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:59,240
but you so usually what happens is if there are a lot of factors of interest,

175
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,540
we usually use a fractional factorial design as opposed to a full factorial design where we can write out all the options,

176
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,880
but then we essentially cross out or exclude any of those combinations for which we're not actually interested in.

177
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,840
And so it might be the fact that, well, we never use this combination or this combination somebody couldn't tolerate or this

178
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,549
combination is realistic or we wouldn't be interested in applying that afterwards.

179
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:32,000
So this, you know, 16 potential level design ended up being an eight level design because we could eliminate these combos,

180
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:43,780
which we were not interested in. So the advantages of a factorial design are that they eliminate confounding between study calendar time and factors

181
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,930
because we're studying two effects within one study and they can be really efficient when there is no interaction.

182
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,209
The disadvantage is that if there does happen to be an interaction,

183
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:02,950
particularly like a an antagonism of the treatments such that one treatment reduces the effect of the other,

184
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,940
then we can actually have reduced power for testing effects of our treatment.

185
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:16,209
And so we have to, again, be somewhat careful if there is an interaction of what that if it's synergy, it's okay in terms of power.

186
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,280
But if it's not there, we have an issue.

187
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,760
So like I said, sometimes these get confused with crossover designs and they also can look like a parallel design, right?

188
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,929
Essentially it is a parallel design, but of of all the factor combinations.

189
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,240
So parallel design, right. Would be randomizing to like A versus B versus C versus control.

190
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,379
A crossover design is where you randomize to the sequence, right?

191
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,270
Which sequence of these treatments do you get?

192
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:52,990
Even if you're just interested in A versus B, we can see, well, we want to eliminate the confounding by using the same person, right?

193
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:04,150
We give you A and B or even a plus you and a factorial design would randomize you to one of the combinations in that two by two table.

194
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,250
All right. The next one is a stepped wedge design to.

195
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,960
And so. Oh, and also the factorial design.

196
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,240
I forget. What was the zenith? Did anybody do this project? What was the setting?

197
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,870
A food alcohol use disorder known as opioids.

198
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,060
What was it? Opioid. Opioid? Yes. That also came from a real design that I worked on.

199
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:49,420
I believe that that design is currently accruing and is from investigators in psychiatry so that that trial is underway right now.

200
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,600
Accruing patients. Okay. Stepped wedge design.

201
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:02,800
So this is a design that is somewhat more novel, has been coming, has literature, has come out in like the last ten years, I'd say, in this area.

202
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:13,120
And I think a lot of clinical investigators are really excited about this design because it seems like,

203
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,090
you know, they can write a grant and they can say, oh, we're using this innovative design.

204
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,560
The more I've been involved in stepped wedge design, statistically, I think they're kind of a nightmare.

205
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,629
So I think there's a lot of area for statistical methods to be developed to help

206
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,520
because there's so many so much room for bias in these designs is really the problem.

207
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,759
So a stuffed wedge design, the first thing that you have to realize is that for most of the designs that we talked about in this class,

208
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,270
it was all about individual randomization, right where we were randomizing the patient to which treatment they were receiving.

209
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,899
A stepped wedge design is not using individual randomization.

210
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,920
Rather it's using it's using cluster randomized randomization.

211
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,750
So we're randomizing a group of individuals as opposed to the actual individuals.

212
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,780
And usually this is like we're in a like we're randomizing clinics or hospitals sites.

213
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:13,479
It might be counties. I worked on a cluster randomized design where it was, yeah, I guess counties.

214
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,560
It was in Africa for malaria prevention.

215
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,010
And we're interested in essentially randomizing towns to different methods of malaria prevention.

216
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:31,209
That was not a set wedge. But so you you don't have to cluster innovation doesn't exist just for stepwise designs, right?

217
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:37,480
You can use cluster randomization and any type of design in a parallel design, a crossover design, whatever.

218
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,900
But I'm introducing it here in the step wedge design. When we use cluster randomization, right?

219
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:52,510
We randomize the site, the clinic, the county, whatever. They all get that same intervention and anyone in that cluster.

220
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,700
Right, is going to be more similar to each other usually than anyone from somebody in some other cluster.

221
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,870
Right. Because they're all going to the same hospital or they're all the same county.

222
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,750
And so we have to account for that correlation between individuals within a cluster.

223
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,470
And one of the ways in which we do this is by this is what we call the intra cluster correlation coefficient,

224
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:22,960
and we have to have an estimate of this intra cluster or correlation coefficient in order to size a trial that's going to use cluster randomize.

225
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:33,809
It's going to have a cluster randomized design. So a stuffed wedge design is generally used to evaluate a health service delivery intervention or

226
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:41,590
some implementation of an intervention in what we call a more real world or pragmatic setting.

227
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,160
So another buzzword in clinical trials in the last decade or so has been pragmatic designs,

228
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,450
and that is to mean that we're trying to get more at the real world settings.

229
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:59,370
So we know that most clinical trials are these like gold standards where everything is very it's specified, right?

230
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:05,939
It's, it's highly looking after the people and contacting them.

231
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,160
And so this is a little bit more like, well, we'll tell the clinic to do this, but then, right,

232
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,770
we're going to see what happens and we're going to see how that actually moves into and changes patient outcomes.

233
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,170
So even though most you most generally in cluster randomized trials,

234
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:30,270
we're still interested in individual level outcomes most of the time in a stepped wedge design.

235
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,350
These are what we can call a one way cross-over design.

236
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:42,120
So all of the clusters randomized would start and control and then cross over to an intervention at different times.

237
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,860
And they will never cross back.

238
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:50,579
Once they get the intervention, they stay in that intervention and that time of the crossover or time of receiving the intervention.

239
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:58,139
That's the part that's randomized. There is efficiency gains here because all these clusters are going to act as their own control.

240
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,920
We're going to have control information, then we're going to have intervention information on them.

241
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,899
And there is a logistic or feasibility advantage such that we don't have to say, okay,

242
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,390
this group of clusters get this intervention, this one gets this one and we're rolling them out right now to all of them.

243
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:21,900
Right? It's like, okay, that wouldn't that wouldn't be feasible because we'd have to train all the people at the different clinics.

244
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,420
So instead now we've randomized which time they start and we can do this rolling out a little bit easier.

245
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,170
So this is a figure of what a stepped wedge design looks like.

246
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,299
And so there's you can see why it's called a step wedge design.

247
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:47,370
Now we can see these steps. There's some set of time periods for which we're going to look at the outcomes in those clusters.

248
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:55,530
Usually within the individuals. These might be, you know, months, three months, it might be four weeks, it might be six months.

249
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,800
It's usually not as long as a year because as you can see. Right, that would take a really long time to get through all the steps.

250
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,299
So everybody has some time in which they're all within the control.

251
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,520
No one's gotten the intervention. We're just looking at the outcomes then the clusters.

252
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,180
So for example, there are eight clusters, eight clinics randomize here and they're randomized to when the intervention starts.

253
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:26,370
So upfront before this trial happens, we have to know all the clusters involved, all the clinics, all the sites that are going to be in this trial.

254
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,120
And we randomize that site to the time at which the intervention starts.

255
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:37,680
So here every step, two clusters or two sites receive the intervention,

256
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:43,440
and that differs right by so this step these together and then this step these

257
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,509
get it and as we go down so that every site eventually gets this intervention.

258
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,650
And that's another advantage of this design. It's a way in which we can help.

259
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,669
Accrue the sites to the trial. We can say like, hey, we have this trial, we want to test this thing, this is versus this thing.

260
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,909
And you will definitely get this intervention by the end of the trial.

261
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,590
Right. Because even though they're supposed to be equipoise, usually everybody's excited about the new intervention.

262
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,260
So they think, oh, great, I'm going to get it. Let's let me get it in this.

263
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:21,520
Individuals that we're looking at within these steps, they can either be the same individuals followed over time or they might be new individuals.

264
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,829
So like they came into the hospital and we saw what their outcomes were in that time and then they go away and new patients

265
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,830
and these come into the hospital and we see what their outcomes are so they can be what's called cohort or cross sectional.

266
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,000
There can potentially be transition periods in between time periods if they're needed to like,

267
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,650
you know, set up what's happening or wash out the control or whatever.

268
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:52,000
But often it's a little bit more seamless. So like I said, the individuals that we're collecting information from,

269
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:58,500
they might be the same participants followed throughout the whole time or they might be new participants.

270
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:06,370
So there are different types of these stepped wedge designs. So I mentioned these advantages.

271
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,250
All the clusters receive the interventions so it makes it easier to recruit.

272
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,670
Usually this requires fewer clusters than if you did a parallel cluster randomized trial.

273
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,270
But that's not necessarily the case. If the intra cluster correlation is small and the cluster period sizes are small as well.

274
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,060
So it's always good to look at alternative designs.

275
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:38,689
And if you plan on running a stepped wedge design to show, well, this is this is more efficient potentially than a parallel design.

276
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,599
And or if it's not, maybe you should go with a parallel design. The delivery of intervention can be spread out over time.

277
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:51,050
This is logistically just easier often than when you're rolling out these health services interventions or implementation science.

278
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,170
And it can provide data to examine differential treatment effects across the clusters.

279
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,330
Okay. But then I have like three slides of disadvantages. So you know my bias on these designs.

280
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:10,490
These can be difficult. So these designs make it incredibly difficult to separate the intervention effects from secular trends.

281
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,850
So, right. The the intervention is getting turned on at different times for different clusters.

282
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,760
And so it can be really difficult to figure out, is it actually the intervention or is it fact that something changed over time?

283
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,680
And that wouldn't be difficult if it was always like the same people considered.

284
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,030
Right. But it's actually new clusters, so it could be something specific about people in those sites.

285
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,810
With that time, obviously you can add time to your model, which can help with this.

286
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:45,740
But still, this can be a difficult confounding for what you're trying to disentangle in the analysis of the design.

287
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,760
All the clusters have to be recruited upfront. And this is still a large number of clusters.

288
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,350
And so this can be an issue for when you can actually get this started and also can be an issue if something

289
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:06,690
happens such that these clusters are these sites are no longer interested and or no longer exist.

290
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:15,750
So I've been involved in. I guess personally two stepped wedge designs and I've consulted across a number of them.

291
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,019
And almost always there are these clusters that are like, you know, they're saying they're going to do this.

292
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,149
And then all of a sudden the cluster included a few, a few clinicians who all of a sudden now don't work there.

293
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:33,810
They moved away. So now they can no longer be a cluster. Or like that site says, no thank you after a while when it finally gets started.

294
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,389
And so now you have you're starting the trial almost right with like missing data, which is an issue.

295
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:47,370
And because your cluster is really even though you're looking at individual data, right, there is correlation there.

296
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,170
And so the cluster is is a very important unit of sample size.

297
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,860
And if you're minimizing that, also that that's a problem.

298
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:07,999
They can also be. While it's an advantage to roll this out over time, we always overestimate the time in which it takes to do these things.

299
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,160
And so often the steps get off track and this can add to the difficulty in the compounding with time.

300
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,889
It can also take longer to complete the study and the other doing the steps

301
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:28,730
instead of randomizing to intervention versus control in a parallel design.

302
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:35,839
And once you add on more time to a study, now you've given more opportunity for dropout, more opportunity for contamination.

303
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,800
So like the later slides, even though they're not supposed to have the intervention,

304
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:47,990
they might it might trickle down ahead of the time that the intervention is supposed to start and things might be changing before that time.

305
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:58,669
And obviously, things can change outside of the trial, which could have an effect as well on this can also increase data collection burden.

306
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,420
So instead of you're just collecting data more often,

307
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,709
you have and this is one of the reasons why it can this designed to be more efficient because

308
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,460
essentially you just have more repeated measures than you would for like a parallel design.

309
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,989
It's definitely more complicated to analyze and interpret the results.

310
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,770
However, it's not like it's so it's just it requires mixed models, right?

311
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,929
So you can just do like a simple linear regression, but it's not like this is rocket science analysis.

312
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,140
You all are well equipped after this program to do this analysis.

313
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,390
It's just that you have to then be able to explain that to clinicians who aren't necessarily as well equipped.

314
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,709
But that shouldn't really stop you from doing this. The intervention can change.

315
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,090
So there has to be right a description of the intervention which is being implemented.

316
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,239
But what happens is because we're doing this over time, we're learning from it.

317
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,940
Right. And so like you implemented it and that's like, oh, which on it that way, even though I thought it was really good, right?

318
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,649
And then all of a sudden it could be changing.

319
00:33:53,650 --> 00:34:00,309
And so now the treatment effects might be because the treatment changed and or you might not see the treatment

320
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,630
effect because it was only really strong at the end and not at the beginning when you started implementing it.

321
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:14,440
And then this is also very difficult to include to have if you have more than one intervention,

322
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,649
it's it's more difficult and complex to do one of these designed.

323
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,220
So they're primarily used when you have one intervention for what you're rolling out,

324
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:27,490
although there is there have been some methods to discuss variations with more than 200 regimens.

325
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,919
Going back to our initial discussions about ethical concerns and clinical trials,

326
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,400
there's been some papers talking about the ethics with stepped wedge designs,

327
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,180
so all clusters receive the intervention, which is thought to be an advantage, right?

328
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,269
We get everybody involved because they want this intervention. However, we don't know that this intervention is beneficial, right?

329
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,740
That's why we're doing the trial.

330
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:58,930
And so this sort of throws out the the equipoise that we're supposed to have, because now all of a sudden we're saying,

331
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,040
well, everybody should get this, but we don't actually know if if that's true.

332
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,240
And if we do believe that that's true, then why are we still giving control for so long?

333
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,980
So you can see that there's, like, this weird circular argument of, like, is this a good idea?

334
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,120
But yet we also use this for an advantage for why we want to choose this design.

335
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,270
So again, I think this is I think always thinking about the ethics of trials is very interesting.

336
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:30,370
And I think it would be awesome to talk to a medical ethicist about these different designs and their takes on it.

337
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:40,780
Because while we're supposed to go into every trial with equipoise, some of these designs really, really push that that assumption.

338
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:51,850
And so there is, like I said, a lot of of opportunities for bias in a stepped wedge design,

339
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,850
much more than a parallel design, not parallel design or any other trial design also has opportunity for bias, for sure.

340
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:09,489
But because we're we're doing this over time, there's more ability for the issue of secular trends or issues of confounding.

341
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:15,010
By time, there can be issues with more complex within cluster correlations.

342
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,149
So often, if you all think about your mixed models class, right?

343
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,100
A lot of times we, we assume these really simple correlation structures like compound symmetry.

344
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,399
It's the same over time, right? Or auto regressive.

345
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:36,400
It decays in this very similar proportional fashion over time, but it could be very different and much more complex in these stepped wedge designs.

346
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,360
And whether we have the power to use those more complex correlation structures is is not clear.

347
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,660
There can be these identification and recruitment biases. There are potential within cluster contamination.

348
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,690
There can be a chance imbalance.

349
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,950
So a lot of these stuffed wedge designs have very small numbers of clusters, even though we would prefer that they had more.

350
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,970
And so once you have small numbers of clusters, you can have these imbalances of when they're randomized to start.

351
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,350
And it might actually be those characteristics that are associated with the effect of the

352
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:21,070
treatment as opposed to the timing of the treatment that or the treatment effect itself.

353
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,870
And so there's, you know, there's a lot of interest in using these stopwatch designs because they seem cool.

354
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:35,650
There's definitely some advantages to them. You can save some sample size, but there are certainly alternatives.

355
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,189
So the first obvious alternative is, well, if we have these clusters, we randomized this, it's like parallel, right?

356
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,090
You randomize the set to control in this set to the intervention.

357
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:56,350
That would be the most obvious straightforward alternative is though the real concern is that you can't implement these things.

358
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:03,800
In all clusters concurrently or over the time in which these clusters would come into the trial quickly.

359
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,180
Then you can do what's called a wait list or a staggered cluster randomized design,

360
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,400
and you can see that then instead of following everybody throughout the entire setup process,

361
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,690
right, you will get some control period for these clusters.

362
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,959
And then you look at some intervention period for these clusters.

363
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,870
However, you always keep some cluster at control throughout the entire time or at both time

364
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:32,510
points in which you look at them or some clusters so that you can get a better idea.

365
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:39,680
But this allows you to not have to turn on the intervention in all clusters at the same time in a parallel design.

366
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:49,309
And so there's been a lot of literature in about stuffed wedge designs,

367
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:57,170
and this is a really good one from 2020 that says if you're going to choose to implement a software design, you need to have reasons to do so.

368
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:06,739
And basically, like as one of these as arguments for each of these increase, the more the more it's appropriate to use a stopwatch design.

369
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,549
So a stepwise design provides a means to conduct a randomized evaluation which would otherwise be impossible.

370
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,330
So if you couldn't do this to individuals, right,

371
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:24,410
and you can't randomize individually and you couldn't do a parallel cluster randomized design because for whatever reason,

372
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,919
right then this is the only way in which we can study this.

373
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:35,990
Then it makes sense. Stepwise design facilitates cluster recruitment as it enhances the acceptability of randomized evaluation,

374
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,079
either to the cluster gatekeepers or to other stakeholders.

375
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:47,210
So again, if we're somehow able to get more clusters or more generalizable clusters because they're going to get that treatment eventually,

376
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,300
then I guess it makes sense than doing something else.

377
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:59,330
If this is really only the feasible, does only the only feasible design because of some more pragmatic or logistical constraints,

378
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:09,680
then it makes sense to move forward this. And if it does have increased statistical power over other studies study designs, then it makes sense.

379
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,860
So you want to see if somebody is going to try to have a stepped wedge design.

380
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:20,240
You want to see arguments for why these are the case, for why they're putting forward a stopwatch design.

381
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,060
Because of the possibility for so much bias. You need to have strong reasoning for why you're choosing this.

382
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:33,680
So they need to justify the stepwise design and they need to consider alternatives to explain why they didn't choose something else.

383
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,200
Okay. So there's a lot of references here.

384
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:48,300
If you're just interested in stepwise designs, like I said, I actually so I helped design to I gave one away.

385
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:57,310
I have one current software design in the field and I've consulted for a number of software designs that have just gone wrong.

386
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,040
And there's a lot in the literature about what the design should look like and what the analysis could be for those perfect designs.

387
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,310
And there's a lot of literature on why the design is bad.

388
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,470
And what I'm not seeing and what I see a lot of open opportunity for is like, how do you fix the problems?

389
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,659
So like it went bad. Now what do you do to make sure that you still get something useful out of it?

390
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:24,220
And or what do you do in the trial when something bad happens? How can you try to get it back to better?

391
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,489
So just really interesting again, like as we saw with the adaptive design,

392
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:36,760
there's a lot of people who are really pro adaptive design and there are a lot of people who are really into adaptive design and kind of similar here.

393
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,069
I see why it can be useful,

394
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:47,170
but I also see that there's a lot of opportunities for bias and so you have to be really sure that this is the right design to move forward with it.

395
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:53,680
And this one, the stepwise design I think that I give you was in about delirium is right.

396
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:03,279
Yeah. Yeah. So I actually I an investigator here at Michigan came forward with this design and I said, no, thank you.

397
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,919
I don't what kind of software design. But that person got funded and actually was in like the Michigan record.

398
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,590
If you guys read that, it's like a email that comes out.

399
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:19,000
They got a massive Cary Grant to study, to study the treatment in delirium using a stuffed wedge design.

400
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,809
And they have family from jail.

401
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:30,610
As a consultant who is a semi still recent graduate from grad school who worked on stepdad's design methodology.

402
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:40,990
So just really interesting, you'll see that these these designs are going on and there is a lot of need for statisticians to be at the table.

403
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,010
They're. Okay. The fourth project is about patient preferences.

404
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,480
This design is motivated by an actual smart that I work on.

405
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:58,930
But you're not. This is the one that I gave you is an A smart is just a one stage four treatment designed to think about patient preferences.

406
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,379
When I was working with the investigators, they were interested in including patient preferences and the methods for

407
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,480
patient preferences design just combined with Smart or which I'll talk about.

408
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:16,110
Or sequential multiple assignment randomized trials didn't exist and so we couldn't actually include them together.

409
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:26,380
And so I put forward a grant to study that and that's now me and you guys met Mari and, you know, Sarah Medley in this class.

410
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:34,060
That's what they're working on. So again, many of these are motivated from almost all of these are motivated from work I'm doing.

411
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:46,090
So this is talking this is this project is really interested in like how do what patients want help and or hurt clinical trial design.

412
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:53,770
And so, again, this idea of equipoise comes up such that if you're a patient and you're going to agree to be in a clinical trial,

413
00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:00,610
you have to be in equipoise to all of the treatment options, such that you could be randomized to any of the treatment options.

414
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:07,590
However, we know that there are patients who are going to come in hoping.

415
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,090
Right. They're going to say that they have equipoise, but they're really hoping for like a certain treatment or the new intervention.

416
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,190
And what happens is, if they don't get that, even if they're blinded, they might figure it out.

417
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:27,810
They get upset. Right. And then you might not be compliant. And so this can lead to issues of noncompliance, total loss of follow up, etc.

418
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:35,680
And so there is the possibility that instead of saying if you have a preference, you are excluded.

419
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,160
Right? There's a possibility that we could keep those people in clinical trials and see how we could use their data.

420
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,219
So these are different patient preference designs.

421
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,710
This is what's called a two stage randomized design. And so actually in this design,

422
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,310
there's you reanalyze people to whether they get randomized or whether they can tell you their preference and get their preference.

423
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,579
Now, this this design to me seems somewhat I don't really like this design.

424
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,600
I see how statistically it's a good design because we're randomizing, whether you get a preference,

425
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,810
whether you have a you get to tell us your preference or whether you don't.

426
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,589
But all those people in the random group might also have preferences, right?

427
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:21,130
And so just like any other trial, we're ignoring them and we can have all the issues of if there really is preference.

428
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:29,170
So this is this design that is used and it's nice statistically, but I think ethically could have some issues.

429
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:39,850
This design is saying, okay, I'm interested in collecting everybody's preference and I will hold that data,

430
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,420
but I'm randomizing you anyway to the treatments and then I'm going to see how your preference affects your treatment.

431
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:54,430
Right. So again, this design maybe not totally an ethical because we're kind of doing this anyway, but we're at least asking for the preferences.

432
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:00,250
But also it seems kind of bad to ask for the preferences and then ignore the preferences.

433
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:06,280
Right. So. This is called a fully randomized preference design.

434
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,990
But again, I think from a patient perspective is not necessarily amazing.

435
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,660
So this is this is the design that I prefer and I'm working on in terms of the methodology research that we're doing.

436
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,290
This is called a partially randomized preferences. I am so patients come in and we say, Do you have a preference?

437
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,560
And they say, yes. And we say, Great, go ahead, get your preference for your preferred treatment.

438
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,390
Or if they say no, then we say, okay, great, you get randomized, right?

439
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,270
So there's going to be a clear selection bias, right? People who have preference versus people who are willing to be randomized.

440
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:43,090
But we can find some common ground. Perhaps we can use all of this data in some way to get to the treatment effects.

441
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,350
So the partially randomized patient preference design, like I said,

442
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:56,220
the patients can get their preferred treatment or they can be randomized if they're okay with that.

443
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,419
This might provide for a more representative sample who are not kicking out all

444
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,560
the people who had preferences or not giving them a treatment they didn't want.

445
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,889
And because they're getting what they wanted,

446
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,740
there might be better adherence because we know those people who are randomized were okay with being randomized.

447
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:19,950
They might have better adherence and higher retention. These designs patient preference, any design that includes patient preferences,

448
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,470
they're much more they're used much more often when there are treatments with different modalities.

449
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,549
So, for example, they've been used in a lot of surgery trials.

450
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,810
So trials that would have surgery versus a less invasive option.

451
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:37,259
People might say, I don't want surgery, or people might say, actually,

452
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,649
I really want to have surgery because I think that's the best bet in not on the trial I gave you all.

453
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,340
It was a trial for a lower chronic, chronic, lower back pain.

454
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:53,760
And there are four different modalities. There is a drug. There was exercise or physical therapy.

455
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:02,129
There is mindfulness based, cognitive mindfulness based therapy like meditation, and there is acupressure therapy.

456
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,080
And so you can see, right, those are very different modalities.

457
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,110
And somebody might come in and be like, absolutely, I will not try a drug like I did, not with the drug on anything else.

458
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,200
Or they might come in and be like, I absolutely are not doing mindfulness.

459
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,970
That is not going to work. Right.

460
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:23,820
So you can imagine or they might say, like, I really just want this thing and so hence the potential need for a patient preference design.

461
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,980
This all this says what was on that the other option and I think this is probably where a lot of the

462
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:38,520
people want with the specific project is with what's called an equipoise stratified randomization design.

463
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,340
So instead of having to have a specific preference for just one treatment, like I just,

464
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,969
I really just want the drug or I really just want the mindfulness intervention.

465
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,480
You can say like,

466
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:55,799
I really don't want mindfulness when I'm okay with any of the others or like I really don't want to consider physical therapy or acupressure,

467
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:02,340
but I'm okay with the others. And so you have to have more than two treatments for one of these designs to work.

468
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:11,579
But it's essentially that the patient gets to choose the set of treatments that they would be randomized to and each set of treatments.

469
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,930
So you have to have two or more. That's called an equipoise strata, right?

470
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,790
So we're at equipoise across the treatments in this particular set I could be randomized to.

471
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:30,030
So if you consider that there are four treatments, right? There's 11 equipoise strata or acceptability strata, you could be randomized to all of them,

472
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,590
some combination of the three of the treatments or some combination of the two of the treatments.

473
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,400
And if you're not willing to be in any of those strata, then you can't be in the trial.

474
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,800
Now while there are all these strata. Right.

475
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,000
Ultimately we're really concerned with well, I want to compare A versus B versus C versus D or all pairwise comparisons.

476
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,589
And so one option is that you can do all pairwise comparisons.

477
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,600
However, you have to use a stratified analysis to account for all those equipoise strata,

478
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,109
and you might want to use a bonferroni or some sort of multiple comparison

479
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:08,720
adjustment if you're going to if your interest is in all six pairwise comparisons.

480
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:16,750
The advantages of these designs are that they might be more generalizable because we have more of the patient population

481
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:23,060
willing to be in these trials and we can estimate and compare treatments because there's randomization within the strata.

482
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,980
Right. So unlike the patient preference designs, where those who prefer it get that right and there's no randomization there,

483
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:35,680
everybody here has some randomization in the strata that they're in. Obviously, these seem a little bit more complicated.

484
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:44,260
We have all the strata of if there's multiple more, then the more treatment you have, right, the more strata you can have.

485
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:52,630
And at the beginning of the trial, you have to have some estimate of how many people you think would be in each strata in order to size this.

486
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,549
And if you're way off, you might be way off in your power calculation.

487
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,890
And so there can be some some problems with what you expected versus what you see at the end.

488
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:10,390
Okay. We're doing a massively fast drive by of all of these projects.

489
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:19,059
This next one is a smart and I have like most of my most of the slides for this lecture is on this because this is my area of expertise.

490
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,510
I worked on Smart Design since I was in graduate school.

491
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,230
That was what my dissertation was all about and I continue to work on smart designs.

492
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:37,629
In my ten years here at Michigan, I offer a smart workshop in the summers, and there's a lot of interest in smart design,

493
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:46,450
particularly from people who are working in mental health and more like chronic chronic diseases and disorders.

494
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,709
So smart designs, which I'll talk about in a second,

495
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:57,820
but I want to motivate first by like why would we consider a smart and so it's really like for most diseases and disorders,

496
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:06,030
chronic especially, but often acute issues, they're usually not like you can just treat it and be done with it, right?

497
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:12,760
Most of the time, most disorders, we give some treatment. We see how you are done with that treatment or their side effects.

498
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,710
Whether or not is it working, is it not the doctor or physician clinician?

499
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,830
You know, whoever checks back in with you see is how it was working and then might change things.

500
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:27,459
Maybe they give you more, they upped the dosage, maybe they switch treatment.

501
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,810
Maybe they say, okay, now, now you're good, let's try to go off of it, but we'll keep following you.

502
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:38,110
And so usually there's this process, ongoing process of figuring out your treatment regimen.

503
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:47,050
And a lot of times this process ends up being based on clinician expertise, like their experience with other patients.

504
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,460
But ideally, we'd have this process really based on clinical trials.

505
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,389
So this is just an example. This is treating depression.

506
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:05,530
This was taken from I forget where, but it was like a general like flow diagram for clinicians who are treating depression, right?

507
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:10,060
Like first you make the diagnosis, you might select and give some antidepressant medication.

508
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,410
You follow the the person and see if they're doing better.

509
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:21,819
Are they clearly better or great? Continue if they're only somewhat better or maybe we need to adjust the dosage if it's not better at all.

510
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,820
Or maybe there are these side effects. We want to make a change, right?

511
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,320
Maybe we're changing the medication or augmenting it in some other way.

512
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,980
And you can see that there are these arrows that point down sideways.

513
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:42,040
This is really like this ongoing process of checking in, making changes to ensure that we're treating the patient in the best way possible.

514
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:52,900
And so these treatment regimens, this fiscal world gave them this this name dynamic treatment regimens, because they can change.

515
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,049
Now, most clinicians don't understand this terminology.

516
00:53:56,050 --> 00:54:01,030
They don't like dynamic treatment, and they actually, as this whole world call them, dynamic treatment regimes.

517
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:08,890
And that just makes most people think of like the Nazis when you hear the word regime and they absolutely hate the term.

518
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:14,800
And so they the this is all kind of changed it to like regimen because that makes sense clinically.

519
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:23,290
But still most clinicians are prefer like adaptive interventions or tailor decision rules or step care treatment policies.

520
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,610
These are the words that if you actually go into the clinical literature, they're going to use about these.

521
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,909
So these are sequences of individual, individually tailored decision roles that specify whether,

522
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:40,390
how and or when to alter the type, dosage, intensity or delivery of treatment at critical decision points.

523
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:45,250
A really simple example is like start with a and if it's if you respond, continue,

524
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:51,250
and if you don't switch to me, that's what we that's one dynamic treatment regimen or one adaptive intervention.

525
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:58,660
These dynamic treatment regimens, though, they need to be clinically, they need to have evidence.

526
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:05,950
Right? So like the experience based just based on opinion, that's some regimen, but it's not it's not evidence based.

527
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:10,270
We want these dynamic regimens to be evidence based based on data.

528
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:17,590
And so these dynamic regimens include decision points, what we call tailoring variables.

529
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,870
So they tell us how, when, not when,

530
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:28,390
but how do we make those changes or what are we basing the change of treatment on intervention or treatment types, decision rules and outcomes.

531
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:35,259
So like I said, it could be start with a if you respond, continue on if you don't switch to be another specific example.

532
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:42,280
And for example, prostate cancer would be first you receive this combination chemotherapy to see and if it's successful,

533
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,670
you have a decrease of 40% or more in your PSA from diagnosis.

534
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:53,590
No evidence of disease progression at any site at eight weeks, then you continue and if you don't, you'd switch to this other combo chemotherapy, CBT.

535
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:59,669
Now you can see, right, we have something first. We have something. Second, we have to make this decision.

536
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:06,690
When do we make this decision? How do we make this decision? What are we basing it on in order to get evidence for these dynamic treatment regimens?

537
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,890
We have a lot of questions.

538
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:14,850
And so one way to address these questions is with what we call a smart or a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial.

539
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:23,010
And so these are multi-stage randomized designs that are attempting to provide evidence for these sequences of treatments.

540
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:30,570
Now, it's kind of like mind blowing, if you think about it, that most of the treatment that we take is sequential,

541
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:37,320
and yet most of the evidence that we have for that treatment is that in a vacuum at one time was A better than B,

542
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,020
now later is C better than D we don't ever usually like often called trials are

543
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,839
not saying is A followed by B right a good idea or is a followed by a good idea.

544
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,760
So these designs are trying to get at that. They're trying to be a little bit more realistic and say,

545
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,600
we know you're going to take these things in sequence and we know that treatments could have interactions.

546
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:05,490
So let's actually look at that. A lot of people get confused and they think smart designs are adaptive designs

547
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,620
because the word adaptive intervention or dynamic treatment regimen is used.

548
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,390
And that's not actually usually the case.

549
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:20,820
If you remember, adaptive designs are the umbrella term for when operating characteristics of a design change based on accumulate,

550
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:27,570
based on cumulative information, right accumulating data, we might change the probability of of randomization.

551
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:33,620
We're not doing that in a smart we might change treatment based on information from an individual right.

552
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,230
But that's just part of the design. It's not based on information from everyone.

553
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:47,939
So this is not like an adaptive design. All of you have been here and in an era where Susan Murphy was not here,

554
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:52,799
but Susan Murphy is a well-known statistician who used to work here in the Department of Statistics.

555
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:01,290
She's now at Harvard. She is one of the godmothers of smart design and works really a lot in this area.

556
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:09,839
She's now interested in, like super smart design, micro randomized trials, what Walter Dempsey works on.

557
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:15,960
She was one she was one of her post-docs anyway, her so she was one of the great people.

558
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,270
Peter Thiel, who is coming not this Friday,

559
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:26,640
I think next Friday to talk and Jeremy Taylor's 803 class at 9 a.m. on Friday and also I think our regular seminar on Thursday.

560
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:33,600
Peter Thiel was also one of the early leaders of Smart Design and generally he was one of

561
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,420
the early believers in adaptive and then one of the forget that those are terrible guys.

562
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:46,260
And he was like, really interesting. I really if you again like if you don't go to seminars go to his it'll be very entertaining.

563
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,989
Anyway, those are two, two big people in smart literature. There's some others as well,

564
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:59,700
but their original feeling of a smart design was I was in this like phase two space that it was really developing these dynamic training regimens,

565
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,740
that there's all these components, right? There's first stage treatment, there's second stage treatment, there's what's the tailoring variable?

566
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:10,350
And there's too many questions to say we can confirm this dynamic treatment regimen at the end of it.

567
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,180
So it's in this like phase two space where we're trying to figure out what what would be the best

568
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:24,240
dynamic treatment regimen to move forward with and confirm in a regular parallel phase three design.

569
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,140
Okay. So here's one example of a smart design.

570
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:35,280
And when you initially show a design that looks like this to any person that's not a statistician or used to global trials,

571
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,340
they immediately freak out and say, no way to this design.

572
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:45,450
And so over the last ten years of my existence, a statistician who's interested in smarts has been trying to convince people that

573
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:50,280
this is a good design and they shouldn't be scared by this this figure immediately.

574
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:58,439
So we have a lot of branching happening. And whenever people see branching, they're like, Oh my God, the sample size is going to be enormous.

575
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,809
There's absolutely no way we can do this. But that's not necessarily the case anyway.

576
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:07,080
A smart what makes a smart sequential randomization, right?

577
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:13,050
So we have some randomization upfront and then we have another randomization later.

578
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,500
That is what makes us smart and usually what makes a smart.

579
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:23,580
What we consider smart is that that randomization, subsequent randomization depends upon some intermediate response from individuals.

580
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,190
Now there are some nuance to that description.

581
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:37,139
You can have a smart where everyone is re randomized, but the most usual type of smart is where you have an initial randomization,

582
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,490
you collect an outcome and then you re randomize patients based upon that outcome.

583
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:48,360
So for example, here we assessed well, did you respond to your initial treatment and if you did, then you re randomized between C and D.

584
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,560
Did you respond to your initial treatment? If you didn't, you get your ass right.

585
01:00:52,950 --> 01:01:01,190
And I have different. Treatments out here C, D, E and F then over here and B, but they, you know, B could be used over here potentially.

586
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:08,299
And I have different treatments for those are have treatments for those in the second stage you got a and they're the same for those who get B,

587
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,240
but they could differ as well. There is like endless possibilities with these types of designs.

588
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:19,219
So here's an example of an embedded dynamic treatment regimen.

589
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:25,400
So this is where we run a smart because we're ultimately interested in these tailored sequences of interventions.

590
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,780
And what most people don't understand is that those doctors or tailored sequences

591
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:34,400
of interventions include two paths or two groups of people in the trial.

592
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:40,760
The DTR is start with a and if you respond you get C and if you don't you get E, right.

593
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:48,049
The ETR has to be this upfront guideline that a clinician would have that when a patient first walks in, they would say, okay,

594
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:54,530
well I'm going to give you a but I mean, I know that if you don't respond, I'm giving you E, and if you do, I'm going to give you C, right?

595
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:59,000
I have that in my head ahead of time because I know the evidence from this this trial.

596
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,960
So I have to have those two options for whatever is going to happen to that patient.

597
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,080
All all included in my one d tr for them.

598
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:10,280
So this is one tr in this trial, this is another d tr in the trials.

599
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:16,820
First start with if you respond get C and if you don't get S in this trial there are eight doctors.

600
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:21,979
But it's doesn't it's not because there are eight pathways, right?

601
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:31,160
Because each ETR actually includes two parts. These the DCR itself does not include randomization.

602
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:38,030
Right. The DCR is the guideline is the clinical guideline is the prescription that we give the clinician is something we're ultimately interested in.

603
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,540
We're using randomization in the trial. The smart to test the ETR that we end up with.

604
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,300
So TTR is don't include randomization.

605
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:54,590
The design, the smart design does and the smart design includes it so that we can get unbiased evidence for the dieter's.

606
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,560
And user causal inference. So here's another. This is like the most common smart design.

607
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,040
That's where you have individuals treated either with A or B, and if they respond,

608
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,370
they continue that treatment or maybe they discontinue that treatment.

609
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:17,400
And if they didn't respond, then we try something else, right? So here we re randomize the non-responders to two other options.

610
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,080
So how many detours are in this design? Anybody want to try to guess?

611
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:32,400
It's not six. Four.

612
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:36,070
Yeah. Whoever said that? Good job. Oh, yeah.

613
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:41,920
So it's right. Start with a if you respond, get C. If you don't get E, start with A, if you respond, get C.

614
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,610
If you don't get F, right. Those are two up here. And then similarly b.c.e because so there are four doubters.

615
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:54,770
And ultimately what we want to say is like so. We would estimate the outcomes for these debtors.

616
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,999
We would see which one looked the best. Right?

617
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,909
And we take that say it's AC, we take that ETR and go forward to a phase three design and say let's test when patients get a followed by,

618
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:10,620
see if they respond and if they don't versus whatever the standard of care is and see if that actual

619
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:19,200
adaptive regimen is better than some static or whatever else is used in in in clinic as it is.

620
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:27,030
Okay. Here's another one. So this is just to show that whatever you do for people on a, it doesn't mean you have to do that for people on B, right?

621
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,930
These designs don't have to look the same from the top to the bottom.

622
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:36,569
So it might be the case that if you started with B, we just don't have a bunch of options for you.

623
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:41,460
If you didn't respond on it, right? Like B might be a more intensive intervention already.

624
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:48,570
And so there's not something extra that we could do necessarily if you didn't respond beyond just getting.

625
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:53,820
E So this design has also been used. This design has three stars, right?

626
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:57,210
There's one here and then there's the two up here.

627
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:06,809
You're not getting it. So if I'm doing this really fast, but this is just my area of interest, hence why I'm spending more time on it.

628
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:11,580
So there's been a lot of smarts in the fields, most of them primarily in mental health areas.

629
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:19,679
There are several in oncology because it's all random at M.D. Anderson, but there haven't been that many recently,

630
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:27,299
except for looking at more mental health issues with people who have cancer, but not actually on cancer treatments.

631
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:35,040
Even though this is incredibly relevant for cancer treatment because it's always happening in sequence and combinations.

632
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:42,509
I currently have, I think, seven smarts in the field right now in chronic lower back pain.

633
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:47,520
So that one that you're working on for patient preferences is actually a smart one.

634
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:59,580
Insomnia one and two in alcohol use disorders, one in like adolescent drinking behavior issues.

635
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:03,000
Is that the one that you guys had to work on or is this smart that you worked on?

636
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,360
It was energy and alcohol use disorder.

637
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:13,620
So that was a newer one that I'm involved in. And then that one was talking about those cluster randomized in Africa for malaria prevention.

638
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,760
That actually was a smart.

639
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:26,969
So anyway, just really interesting, the ESR has a group of individuals, so Susan Murphy had a group at ESR in that group stage.

640
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:34,260
So Danny were all involving Shani or Shani and some others who are based at ESR.

641
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:41,910
They got a large grant that was previously at Penn State is now here and they have a really cool website that if you click on this,

642
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:47,160
it shows you a bunch of smarts that have been used in the field. So it's just a really great resource.

643
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,680
All right. I think we said enough about smarts, so I have a lot of resources there as well.

644
01:06:53,430 --> 01:07:00,810
Okay. And then the last two, so I'm not talking about the amyloid trial because it's a it's not a design,

645
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:07,470
but I do think that is a really relevant conversation. So I do hope that you watch the video and we'll talk about it on Tuesday.

646
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:12,780
So the last thing is about seamless design, in particular phase one to phase two.

647
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:19,140
When we talked about our clinical trials designs, we talked about phase one.

648
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:25,649
Right. Okay. We pick the dose, we we to write a new protocol, we go to phase two and phase one.

649
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,640
We're trying to really assess safety. We're trying to find the maximum tolerated dose.

650
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,610
And now in phase two, we step over and we're interested in looking at continued safety,

651
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:39,390
but getting some idea of of efficacy to move on to phase three.

652
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:52,349
This seamless terminology emerged in the relatively recently and it was primarily

653
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,940
emerging particularly for at least phase seamless phase one phase two designs.

654
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,280
It emerged from the oncology literature.

655
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:07,680
And this really happened because there are these little phase one trials that they're doing in oncology that they just started adding on more cohorts.

656
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,440
They did a phase one dose finding, and then they were like, Oh, this looks promising because we've seen some responses.

657
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,489
Let's just put more people on this dose. So let's put more people on this dose.

658
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:22,200
And instead of stopping the design and moving into phase two or phase three,

659
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,330
they just kept trying to add people on the phase one design at the dose level.

660
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:36,870
And then and they were calling these expansion cohorts and then some of them, some of these trials went to the FDA and said, hey, look at this data.

661
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:40,170
It's really exciting. Lots of people are doing well.

662
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:47,520
Will you approve this drug? And so they're now trying to get drugs approved from like essentially a really huge phase one trial.

663
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:52,799
And it was it became some people are like, well, oh, this is awesome.

664
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,480
And pharmaceutical companies especially like, oh my God, this is great. I don't have to do each phase separately.

665
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,660
I can just add a bunch of people on to phase one, like, this is great.

666
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:07,739
And then statisticians and ethicists be like, look, you know, you didn't you didn't prepare for that.

667
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:19,750
Is that really a good way to be going? And so there's some literature about, you know, if this is a good idea or not, if you're going to do a study.

668
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:25,940
US design, we should make sure that our entry is correctly estimated.

669
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,030
We want to guard against it being incorrectly estimated and we also want to

670
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:34,440
try to make sure that our estimated response rate is unbiased and efficient.

671
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:42,510
And we we want to try to guard against either of these issues because these errors

672
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:47,159
could decrease the probability of correctly estimating our efficacy at the true MTD.

673
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,060
And ultimately, that's what we want out of these designs.

674
01:09:51,240 --> 01:10:01,500
So there's been some work actually by there's this relatively nice, very simple paper by Phil Boonstra, Tom Braun and Elizabeth Chase,

675
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:09,830
a Ph.D. student here about seamless phase one, phase two design in particular, talking about this modular framework.

676
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:16,470
So they say that right as we start, we're kind of in the stage one or more phase one place,

677
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:21,149
and we're going to do a focus a lot on toxicity assessment and we're going to continue to do that.

678
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:26,309
But the emphasis is going to decrease, whereas we'll always look at efficacy,

679
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:32,580
but the emphasis is much more on efficacy at the end of this seamless design.

680
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:44,159
And so they they very sort of basically talk about how this can be divided into two stages as opposed to specific phases of trials.

681
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:54,420
And how each stage is is about two modules where we're looking at figuring out dose assignment and then we could do some interim efficacy,

682
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,329
look to decide should we continue or should we actually just shut it down because it looks

683
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:05,190
like there's not a high probability of this dose of this treatment being efficacious.

684
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,830
And then it says, if we continue, okay, well, now we can you know, we might think we have the MTD,

685
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:18,989
but we can all still allow for going to different doses if we need to by continuing the dose finding aspects.

686
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:25,080
But we'll also start thinking about efficacy, right, much more and collecting efficacy data on our people.

687
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:34,799
And then at the end we can look at all of the data across this trial and think about the dose effects.

688
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,100
Right? A dose response curve and the efficacy effect.

689
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,790
So write in separate designs.

690
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:53,049
You might like enroll so many patients in phase one, you choose MTD or you'd stop and then you decide to like do a separate phase two, right?

691
01:11:53,050 --> 01:12:03,310
And you look at just at that MTD and you look at the efficacy in a potential seamless design which they talk about in this modular framework,

692
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,149
you might enroll that many patients in the phase one.

693
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:15,400
However, you you would potentially look a little bit early and, and do some efficacy analysis using a Bayesian interval test, for example.

694
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:26,709
And if you decide not to stop, you can continue adding on additional patients for like the phase two or stage two portion to look at efficacy.

695
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:36,040
But across the whole trial, you can look at the and what's the MTD and what's the efficacy of that MTD The paper by Phil,

696
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,729
Tom and Elisabeth also develops in our package for this.

697
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:48,790
It's called seamless sim and you can simulate seamless designs and you can use like, you know, in the phase one portion or dose finding, right?

698
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:55,720
You can use three plus three, you could use CRM, you could do different things and then use different tests for efficacy as you move on.

699
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:02,950
So a seamless design means that basically like within one protocol, you're writing both phase one and phase two.

700
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:09,040
So you can do these more quickly than you could if you did had separate protocols or separate phases.

701
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:16,449
So there's a reduced duration. Also, generally, you can use efficacy data from those in phase one, right?

702
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:22,780
Or those on the dose finding portion for your phase two more phase two efficacy outcome piece.

703
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,980
Usually because we have if you do this dose finding throughout,

704
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:33,040
you get a better dose response curve and you can do more detailed profiling of peak PD information.

705
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:41,070
There are potential disadvantages that are mentioned in some of the papers like there's it's it's

706
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:47,080
potentially difficult to monitor and monitor interim safety and futility if this is a multi site design.

707
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,940
Also, if it's multi-site, it can lack processes for formal review and there can be a higher level of complexity.

708
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:02,820
It has been shown in some of these simulations that if you do a seamless design,

709
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:07,980
the seamless trial off often seamless trials where you continue the dose finding.

710
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:16,530
They often choose a lower proportion of less toxic dose levels as the MTD because efficacy is being estimated simultaneously.

711
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:19,679
So right if we believe that as dose level increases,

712
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,110
toxicity increases and efficacy increases and we're collecting the efficacy information

713
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:30,960
and that can potentially if we're modeling that simultaneously with the toxicity,

714
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,229
we're like we're more likely we're going to be careful and safe,

715
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:40,320
but we're more likely to choose the more efficacious dose, which is the higher dose most likely, right?

716
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,450
So we're less likely to choose as many lower doses than if we did separate trials.

717
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:53,729
These seamless trials require a lower expected sample size because we're having the opportunity to stop and end the trial for futility.

718
01:14:53,730 --> 01:15:01,140
Right then if we did phase one and then went into phase two and most often, however off,

719
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:08,309
most often separate trials are going to treat more patients at the end because we run a phase three on certain patients,

720
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:12,719
we get all those people on MTD and then we only use the MTD and phase two, right?

721
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:20,120
And we wouldn't necessarily have the futility stop. So we're going to treat more patients, which could be a good thing or could be a bad thing, right.

722
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,780
Depending upon the the setting.

723
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:30,730
So I highlighted them just to show you look at how neat that is that those are all people in our department and a Ph.D. student here.

724
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:39,030
Right. Working on this this area. There is another article that's kind of interesting talking about seamless designs.

725
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:45,780
And there's also FDA guidance on seamless designs, a whole document dedicated to this.

726
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:51,630
So this was something that clearly became a big issue and the FDA even wanted to get involved and provide some guidance on it.

727
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:57,809
Okay. So I look forward to watching your videos. I hope all of you look forward to watching the videos.

728
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,010
You have to watch at least two.

729
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:07,860
But please try to put them on like two times the the speed and watch the few more so we can have good discussions next week.

730
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:17,280
And like I said, I'll take attendance next week so that if you're healthy and hear both times, you can get some extra credits.

731
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:23,550
Also, are the teaching evaluations open? You know, please complete the teaching evaluations.

732
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:28,080
Those are really important to complete them for all your classes, not just mine,

733
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:37,080
they provide really great feedback as to improve the courses and for leadership to see how your professors are doing.

734
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,700
So please complete them. But do remember that professors are people.

735
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,820
So be kind, but you can be constructive.

736
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:51,270
Okay, so like, just remember, you're not writing to the office, you're writing to a person, but if you have problems, it's fine.

737
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:55,830
Just also have some constructive ways to improve upon.

738
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,650
All right. Have a great rest of your day.

739
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:23,280
And we can get this straight because, you know, I feel a young boy and I said, you know, oh, you didn't do your test.

740
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:33,620
I have a month here if you wanted to.

741
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:39,090
Thank you so much. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

742
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:45,870
I mean, I think I know what you know about all that.

743
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:58,950
It doesn't make me feel good to apologize.

744
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:12,390
Joining us now to talk about this next go to college.

745
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:18,980
I don't know, like Julian clean.

746
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:37,740
Oh, yeah. It's like, why don't you look at this and say, oh, it's like I was, like,

747
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,600
kind of scared when she said that because I just said I was, like, interested, like, I'm sure that it's for me.

748
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:48,350
I was like, Yeah, I'm interested in this whole treatment of like some machine learning methods.

749
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,220
Someone should study those, like the vision thing. And she said, Which topic?

750
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:58,830
I thought. You train for it.

751
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:05,680
And if you don't, I mean.

752
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:33,800
Well, she was a little stressed out here as well today.

753
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,830
Is that okay? Good luck with what you've got.

754
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:53,960
The other thing is my heart. I have a tiny project where only hours are still waiting.

755
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:58,070
Yeah. Are you guys just need to record? Yeah.

756
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:03,160
Before that century, finding some of our own. Yeah, that's okay.

757
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:08,720
I mean, I'm sure you'll be. Yeah, it'll get them over migraines.

758
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:16,220
You. Because you think. You know what?

759
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:23,540
You know.
