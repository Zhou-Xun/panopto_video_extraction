1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,180
All right. So this is an outline of what we will go through today.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,709
We will briefly provide a classification of study designs, which, again, are those tools.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,900
We have to collect data and take measurements and make causal inference.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,729
And then we will focus on one of them, the first one for some people.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:36,210
They offered the from the study design point of view, the lowest level of evidence with respect to causality.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,800
Because of the limitations we will go through and they are the these ecologic studies.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:55,280
All right. So there are two ways to classify these study designs.

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:04,250
Two systems. The first one is according to the way in which the exposure is assigned.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:16,910
Or not. The second one is according to the unit of analysis, UK seems to.

10
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,060
Okay. If there is any threat to security, please let me know.

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,979
All right. The second system, everything is by unit of analysis.

12
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,950
And we will see what what that is by exposure assignment.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,230
I think you may recall that at the end of the causal inference classes,

14
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,100
we more or less came to conclude that we have two options in epidemiology to make causal.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:58,090
One is, and in the best case scenario, when the investigator can assign exposure, typically following a random procedure.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,140
When that is the case, we are able to make causal inference without assumptions.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,270
We also say that in real life, unfortunately, that's seldom the case.

18
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,690
I have done maybe fewer than 4% of all studies can be conducted in that way.

19
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:27,910
But for that small percentage, when that is possible, those studies fall into the category of experimental studies.

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,720
When the investigator assigns exposure status for the majority of other studies,

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:50,770
we are unable to assign exposure ourselves and therefore we have to rely on observing the exposure status that people may have by themselves.

22
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,350
I mean, that is the case we are in that we are of observational studies.

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,690
The investigator only measures exposure, risk status in a population.

24
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,370
Right. So that's what the classification by exposure is a unit of analysis.

25
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:18,250
So what what is the unit of analysis? Well, the unit of analysis at the observations for which the outcome and the exposure are measured.

26
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:29,620
And basically, there can be two types of units of analysis individuals, meaning individual people, persons or groups of people.

27
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:40,920
And that provides the other system of classification so we could sort of flat flesh out the types of studies.

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,569
In this case, according to the first system of classification by exposure.

29
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,940
So as I said, you have experimental studies which are the first of them.

30
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,820
And a typical example are those randomized trials we we talked about.

31
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,790
And then of the observational studies, we have a number of possibilities.

32
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,970
The first one is what we will study more detail.

33
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:13,379
They are called ecologic studies. Then we have three main types of other studies, cross-sectional studies,

34
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,490
which we will discuss on Wednesday, cohort studies which we will discuss next week.

35
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,730
There will be two sessions for that.

36
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,919
And finally, case control studies, which nowadays are seen as efficient form of cohort studies,

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,190
and we will discuss them, I guess two weeks from today,

38
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:47,700
there might be two sessions on them as well and we could add a cross classification according to the second system, which is my unit of analysis.

39
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:58,050
So if we do that, we have that. These ecologic studies correspond to groups.

40
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:07,830
Group units of analysis, meaning in ecologic studies, information on outcome and exposure is collected on groups of people, not only individuals.

41
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,479
And there are also some special types of intervention studies for experimental

42
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,390
studies in which you can assign exposure not to individuals but to groups of people.

43
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,510
And we will mention some examples in the lecture on randomized trials,

44
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:39,210
because we will have a lecture devoted to the more sort of, you know, logistic and mundane aspects of lots of randomized trials.

45
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:50,460
All right. So nice for a simple classification of of study design is really not very odd, a very convoluted thing.

46
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:59,570
Now, let's get into the matter of ecologic studies, which is the first design we will discuss.

47
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,080
So as I said, the main characteristic of ecologic studies is that the unit of analysis are groups.

48
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,720
They are also called aggregates and they can be defined in a number of ways.

49
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:27,630
Those aggregates could be countries, states, counties, neighborhoods, or they could be workplaces, hospitals, schools, etc. any sort of.

50
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,590
A situation that defines a group of people by having some common affiliation.

51
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:49,180
And as I mentioned before, the key aspect is that both the exposure and the outcome are measured for each group or aggregate.

52
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:59,170
There are two basic types of measures that you can obtain in in groups or other things.

53
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:16,100
The first one represents characteristics that could be measured at the individual level, but that are obtained at the group level as.

54
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:32,120
Summaries or averages, for example, you can estimate the mean of a continuous characteristic in a group and do the same in several groups.

55
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,050
I use use those means as the exposure or outcome for those groups,

56
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:48,890
and you can use also the proportions of a given attribute for a group and use that proportion as the

57
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,900
representation of the exposure outcome for that group and do the same for several other groups.

58
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,930
The second types of of measures are this these two bullet points.

59
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,230
These are measures that cannot necessarily be collected at the individual level.

60
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,870
They cannot be summarized after measuring a number of people into an aggregate.

61
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:31,250
And examples are first environmental measures, for example, physical characteristics of their geographic location like air pollution.

62
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:45,040
So. Air pollution can be measured for a place that may affect a group or an aggregate of people at a given time.

63
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:58,340
But. It's very difficult to ascertain to what extent air pollution affects differently people within that group at the same time or place.

64
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:06,650
Right. Basically, everybody would be exposed more or less to the same level of air pollution.

65
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,930
So that that's that's a measure that that's very difficult to individualize.

66
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,080
And another example are global measures,

67
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:28,400
which are other types of measures that cannot be reduced to the individual level, such as the political system.

68
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,610
A group lives under, you know, either at the same time or the same group historically.

69
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,450
Everybody would be exposed to the same political system.

70
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,970
Or loss the passing of a law, you know,

71
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,770
that can have effects on health and people are not individually affected by the passing of a law that cannot be measured individually.

72
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:02,510
Once a law is both is passed, everybody is exposed to the same law.

73
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:13,430
Okay. All right. Now we're going to provide a few examples of actual ecologic studies to describe

74
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,590
the types of exposures and outcomes that can be collected in such studies.

75
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:32,210
The majority and the classic ecologic studies correlate exposure and outcome measured at a single time point.

76
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:39,349
On the same aggregates, of course, and typically at the same time.

77
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:54,790
Point here is an example. This is a graph from a study that shows an association between per capita daily meat intake in grams.

78
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,670
That's what you have on the x axis is a continuous variable with respect to a

79
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:09,260
measure of how much colon cancer there is in a population that's on the way.

80
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,320
That's the unit of analysis.

81
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:22,290
Are countries. So the way in which this is that is conducted is that people for each country

82
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:32,220
obtain a an aggregate measure of how much meat on average they eat in a year.

83
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,740
And then for the same country,

84
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:44,400
they obtained a measure on the same year as they measure the intake of meat of how much colon cancer there is in that country.

85
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:54,060
Okay. So you can see that is a positive association, right?

86
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,750
It's not strictly monotonic, but it's clearly positive.

87
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,380
And this is, again, a typical ecologic study.

88
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:15,480
How is. Well, you know, this is interesting because meat intake in theory can be estimated at the individual level.

89
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,340
Right. And nutrition measures here are nodding.

90
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,690
That's true. I mean, it's very difficult, but it can be done.

91
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,580
However, in these types of studies, that's not how it's done.

92
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,200
Anybody knows how it's done. The nutrition people.

93
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:44,300
You know about disappearance data. Right.

94
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:52,450
So even though it can it could be estimated and the at the individual level in fact for this that is what people do is they use, um,

95
00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:05,960
fa0 the Food and Agriculture Organization, uh, data that records how much of the food is produced in the country, uh, for a given year.

96
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:15,740
To that they add how much is imported, then they subtract, how much is exported and how much is fed to animals.

97
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,960
And then that's called a disappearance disappearance measure.

98
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,660
Right. And you adjusted for the number of people in the country.

99
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Yeah. Okay. All right. Um.

100
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,440
Later on, we will discuss what might be problems with that type of mission.

101
00:13:46,610 --> 00:14:02,210
This is another very classic, I guess, uh, ecologic study in which the exposure is the GDP per capita and the outcome is life expectancy at birth.

102
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,290
The unit of analysis is again. Which one?

103
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,750
The country's. Right. And as you can see, there is a positive association, non-linear.

104
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,160
There is a sort of a plateau here by, I guess, a GDP of 12,000 or so.

105
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,250
Can the GDP per capita be measured at the individual level?

106
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,210
No, it's only an aggregate measure. Right. How about life expectancy?

107
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:51,190
I guess you could you know, you could apply some sort of predictive models for each individual to predict how much they're going to leave.

108
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,950
But in this case, it refers to the life expectancy of all countries.

109
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:07,820
Right. Okay. Some other ecologic studies actually include a let down between the exposure and the outcome.

110
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:22,580
And this is important because, uh, one key criterion to make causal inference is temporality, which is the exposure must precede the outcome.

111
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:38,230
Right. This is an example of a study that actually started a whole field in epidemiology, life, course B immunology.

112
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:46,180
And it's a correlation between infant mortality rates in Norway.

113
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,050
During the years 1896 and 1925 and deaths from heart disease.

114
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,870
About 70 years later. The unit of analysis is counties.

115
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,440
These dots represent counties in Norway.

116
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:22,790
And as you can see, there is a positive, strong association between infant mortality at the end of the 19th century

117
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,170
and beginning of the 20th and the death from heart disease 70 years later on.

118
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,120
And that interesting. Yeah.

119
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:45,459
Okay. Some other studies use cumulative measures of exposure and outcome.

120
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:57,910
The examples we have examined so far look at exposure at a given time point, but some others use cumulative measures of these variables.

121
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:11,049
This is a very fine example on chocolate intake as the exposure and the number of Nobel laureates that countries have is a very important study.

122
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:17,710
Look is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They didn't publish anything, which is just very important.

123
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,420
So the the exposure is chocolate intake in kilograms per year per capita.

124
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,020
This was measured at the late this year that they could find information.

125
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,020
So that one is still sort of at the single time point. Right.

126
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:49,900
But the outcome is the number of Nobel laureates that each country had had until they assessed chocolate intake per million per year.

127
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,320
But adjusted by the population, the unit of analysis, as I mentioned, is country.

128
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:10,750
Right. And as you can see, there is a strong positive association between chocolate intake and the number of Nobel laureates the country has high.

129
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,379
So we need to start catching up on our chocolate intake.

130
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:33,130
We want to make it there. Now some other less common ecologic studies follow groups over time and these are called time trends study.

131
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:45,700
That is a very interesting example by, um, uh, he was a, he's a physician and uh, an economist.

132
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,870
He used to work here that I use our whole setup here.

133
00:18:51,130 --> 00:19:00,220
Uh, excuse me as my professor, um, on unemployment, which is the exposure, um,

134
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:09,850
and is measured here on this axis and traffic deaths, um, which is on this axis.

135
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:18,850
And uh, here we have the years that the population is followed, um, over time.

136
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,870
Right. So.

137
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:34,860
The upper line represents the mortality and the lower line represents the unemployment.

138
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:44,340
Who would like to describe the association? Excellent.

139
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,120
Jeremy. Stephen. It's an inverse association.

140
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,670
Say more. Stephen. It's a strong association.

141
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:04,560
All right. But how does the outcome behave with respect to the exposure for it to be inverse of the hierarchy?

142
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:15,610
Exactly. Over time, the higher mortality rate, the the higher the unemployment, the lower the mortality rate, and vice versa.

143
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,590
It's always sort of preferable to first describe the exposure.

144
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,280
So that that gives us a sense, I guess in our heads at least, that's how the mind works of of temporality,

145
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,210
what precedes what but could be the possible cause of possible.

146
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,710
But here is a perhaps more interesting question.

147
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:51,410
What's the unit of analysis? Let me give you a hint.

148
00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:03,650
The unit of analysis has to be. Well what where they exposure and outcome are measured but also what gives variability to your study.

149
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:13,070
I reveal too much. Okay.

150
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:33,820
Okay. No problem. Steven, are you still brave to try?

151
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,510
Okay. Come on, guys.

152
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,580
You know this. What gives variability to explosion is in the year.

153
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,090
This is the year. And you are Sofia?

154
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,100
Yes. Is the year. Is this same population right?

155
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,939
Is that the US population? I mean, conceptually, of course the population itself will change because, you know,

156
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,920
people die and get into it like being borrowing, beget, etc. But really what gives variability to this data are the years.

157
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,290
So in this particular case, the unit of analysis is the year x.

158
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:23,090
All right. Now, some other ecologic studies combine aggregate information for a group with person, specific information for an author.

159
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:36,320
And this is a study actually, that that idea really is an ancient study on the homicide rates of a country.

160
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:45,740
That's the exposure to a single country. And the age at the first menstrual period, then you had that.

161
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,100
That is part of an example in your first lap. Right. So it's a very important health indicator.

162
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,980
The time at which girls have their first menstrual period is called Minute.

163
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:07,500
So. The homicide rates in the whole country.

164
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:14,790
Of course, that cannot be assessed at the individual level because they affect everybody living in that godforsaken country.

165
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,340
And it is measured when the girls were five years of age.

166
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,860
That's when we measured the rates of homicide in that country.

167
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:42,940
The data on Asian menarche came from a study in which we actually asked women to recall the age at which they had had their first menstrual period.

168
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,360
So that is represented by these these black dots here.

169
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:49,930
Right.

170
00:23:50,080 --> 00:24:02,080
And this trend line that we fitted across those those points, the homicide rates in the country when the girls were five years of age are plotted.

171
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,040
Here in these open squares for each year.

172
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,810
Right. So.

173
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,790
It is relatively well known that H had Maynard Keynes since the Industrial Revolution,

174
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,680
you know, since the 1800s in the whole world has been declining.

175
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,410
So in the late maybe 18th century or so, girls started menstruating on average as late as at age 18.

176
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,690
That was normal.

177
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:50,900
But with the advent of the Industrial Revolution and, you know, the very many changes, I guess, that the standard of living that that implied.

178
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:59,560
That age has been declining everywhere at a rate of about a decade per year.

179
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,520
So it's pretty fast. So also that tells you very interestingly that these might be a physiological phenomenon

180
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,510
that is very sensitive to the environment because the genes haven't changed.

181
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:18,400
Of course, it's also determined by the genes that that a girl has, but the genes really haven't changed.

182
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,840
And what has changed is the environment is a very sensitive, very plastic indicator.

183
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,940
And that was also the case in this in this one country, in this study.

184
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,100
The interesting thing, though, is that. It has not been a steady decline.

185
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,880
It's not a straight line. Right.

186
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:46,670
And that that detail is what gives you richness here and very ability to to make you, you know, gives you comparisons.

187
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,400
So there was an initial steep decline.

188
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:58,100
Then there was a sort of, um, slowing down of that trend towards earlier menarche.

189
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,970
Then there was an acceleration and then there was again a slowing down of the trend downwards.

190
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,570
And then there was a final steep acceleration toward early mainnet.

191
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,300
And what we noted was that the periods of, um.

192
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:26,210
A slowing down of the train coincided with peaks of homicides and the period of acceleration

193
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:32,060
of the trend or earlier menarche coincided with periods of lower homicide in the country.

194
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:44,899
What does that mean? I have no idea. But I just wanted to bring you an example of a study in which you combined a

195
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:52,640
measure that can only be ascertained at the group level or aggregate level,

196
00:26:52,670 --> 00:27:00,770
such as the homicide rates in a country and a measure that can be obtained at the individual.

197
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,290
All right. What are the limitations of ecologic studies?

198
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:23,330
The main one is this. People in whom outcome information is collected are usually not the same as those in whom exposure to information is collected.

199
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:33,690
This is very important. And I gave you one of the best examples to understand this intuitively,

200
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:44,170
which is this study of infant mortality and coronary heart disease mortality 70 years later.

201
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,290
What is the exposure? Infant mortality was the outcome.

202
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:00,640
Death. 70 years later. Why do you see it obvious in that study that people in whom outcome information

203
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,100
is collected cannot be the same in whom exposure information was collected?

204
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,120
Yeah. They already ready. You cannot date twice. I, you know, I, I guess.

205
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:22,450
Well, some people argue that it's possible with reincarnation stuff, but this particular case, there was no evidence on that.

206
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,840
So this is a really good example, too, for you to always.

207
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,090
You know, take that into into account.

208
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:47,650
In my a second example she's also pretty intuitive is an ecologic study of alcohol intake at the country level and breast cancer rates.

209
00:28:50,900 --> 00:29:00,950
So the picture is pretty much the same as I showed you with meat intake and colon cancer mortality.

210
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:08,030
There is a strong positive association between alcohol intake measured on a given year.

211
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,630
And breast cancer rates for the same country measured in the same year.

212
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,970
What is the mechanism that explains how?

213
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:29,810
It is difficult that exposure and outcome information in that example cannot have been collected on the same people.

214
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,250
So. How could you tell?

215
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:50,750
What could make you suspect that exposure and outcome information in this example could have not been collected on the same people?

216
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:03,840
Yeah, but. But how come it is unlikely that the information belong to the same person?

217
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:12,320
The individual. Take the whole population in consideration.

218
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,120
Breast cancer. Almost there. What's your name?

219
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,580
Anna. Who does most of the alcohol intake in any given population?

220
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,970
Men. And who gets its most of the breast cancer women.

221
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:37,340
So it's very unlikely that exposure and outcome would have been collected on the same people right at the individual level.

222
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:46,190
So in that case, you know, I guess that that would be an argument against causation, right?

223
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,070
Because the people who are more likely to be exposed are not the ones who are supposed to get the outcome, basically.

224
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,440
So the idea is that in these studies,

225
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:10,320
typically you only have information available on the marginal probabilities of exposure and the marginal probabilities of the outcome.

226
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,270
But you don't know about the joint probabilities or the conditional probabilities.

227
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,400
And that's that's that's obviously a problem. I'm going to illustrate illustrate that with this example.

228
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:31,379
Suppose the exposure is high meat intake again and the outcome is colon cancer.

229
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,910
As in that example I showed you here, they have just three populations, three groups, three aggregates.

230
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,650
I'm going to call them country one, country two and Country three.

231
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,740
And if I actually were to conduct an ecologic study with these, this is the information I would have.

232
00:31:53,550 --> 00:32:02,820
This would be everything for each country. I would have the probability of people with the outcome and the probability of people who are exposed.

233
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:09,020
That's it. Has any of you conducted an ecological study?

234
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,420
But that's how your database would look like you wouldn't have anything else.

235
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,620
If you think about it. For each aggregate, these are just marginal probabilities, you see.

236
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:28,190
They are at the margins. You don't have information of what's going on inside each country.

237
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:39,139
But still, you know, you go ahead and you can plot. This is the percentage of high meat intake and this is the percentage of colon cancer country.

238
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:46,320
One follows here. Look, 10% probability of exposure and 1% probability of outcome.

239
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,700
Right. Country to follow here, 30% probability of exposure and 3% probability of outcome.

240
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,340
And here is country three 50% probability of exposure and 5% probability of outcome.

241
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,620
Described Association. Strong positive linear association.

242
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:17,370
Right. But suppose I get information on the joint probabilities on the numbers within the cells.

243
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,530
Let's say for country one. Okay. You ready?

244
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,330
So this is what the numbers look like actually in country one.

245
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:39,410
As you can see, I still have a 1% probability of outcome ten divided by 8000 and I still have a 10% probability of exposure 100 divided by 1000.

246
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,950
If we were to evaluate the association within the country, how would you proceed?

247
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,670
I have asked this question a number of times. I'm sure now you'll be quick.

248
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,290
How do you evaluate an association and you have these two by two table?

249
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:22,860
Yeah. Richard, where are you? Well.

250
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,680
But for the association. For the association, we need to compare probabilities of the.

251
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,690
Outcome. Right. Conditional on.

252
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:43,879
Exposure status, so we will need to compare the probability of y equals one among people with a

253
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,890
equals one with the probability of y equals n among people with a equals zero.

254
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,580
Right? So a priority of y equals one over all.

255
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,860
As I said, still 1% probability of equals, one overall is 10%.

256
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:02,179
These are marginal probabilities and here are the conditional probabilities of y equals one.

257
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,240
Given equals one would be one divided by 100 right in this group or 1% the

258
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,740
probability of y equals one given a equals zero would be nine divided by 900,

259
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,910
but 1%. Is there an association between.

260
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,290
There is absolutely no association. So within groups,

261
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:34,840
the association could actually be null you even in the opposite direction as what you see in the aggregate analysis of the ecologic study.

262
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:45,110
So I have represented that by sort of plotting analysis here within each country to illustrate the paradox.

263
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:55,320
This problem. So we relied only on the results of the ecological comparison.

264
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,740
This one we could conclude well that I made intake is associated with colon cancer and

265
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,660
some people might be bold enough to say maybe a meeting date causes colon cancer.

266
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,980
But when we look at what's going on within populations, we find out that there is absolutely no such association.

267
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,140
This problem is called the ecologic fallacy.

268
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,390
And you heard about that. Yeah. So this is it.

269
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:33,490
It's also called aggregation bias, and it's basically a bias that may happen because an association observed between variables on an

270
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,980
aggregate level does not necessarily represent the association that exists at the individual level.

271
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:46,719
So it's a problem of gross level inference. And there is another example.

272
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:55,870
This one is in your readings. I apologize. I posted them too late, but now I got readings all through the first half of the term,

273
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,060
so you should be able to get them before read them before class.

274
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,160
But this is a study of income and traffic injuries.

275
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,360
There are three populations A, B and C within each population.

276
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:24,610
You have seven people and that for each person you have their income, which is, you know,

277
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:36,730
these numbers in the boxes and you have who got into a who got a traffic injury, which are the bolded boxes, right?

278
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,750
And here you have the summary aggregate information.

279
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:51,880
This is the mean income for population. A this is meaningful for B is meaningful for C, this is the number of people with the outcome,

280
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:57,370
the percentage of people without at the aggregate level.

281
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:04,860
Describe the association. Somebody.

282
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:16,810
There is a positive association between mean income, higher values of income,

283
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,890
mean income correspond to higher proportions of people with traffic injuries, a positive association.

284
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,130
Now describe the association within, let's say, population a.

285
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:39,320
How would you describe the association between income and traffic injuries within population A.

286
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,890
It's inverse, right? So we would compare income is a continuous variable.

287
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:56,130
So we need to compare the arithmetic mean between people perhaps who had a traffic injury and people who did not.

288
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:06,570
That's one way to assess this. And what you can say is that on average, people who got into a traffic accident, this one, this one,

289
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:13,920
this one, this one had a lower income than those who did not get into a traffic accident or had an injury.

290
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:24,100
So within. Each country, there is an inverse association where you can do the same exercise for B and C and you'll find the same.

291
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,830
Okay. So it is sort of a paradox.

292
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:40,530
So what's what's what's the truth? Well, generally speaking, we tend to rely mostly on.

293
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,650
Results from the individual level assessment and analysis.

294
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:55,750
Right. And often times the aggregate analysis can be deceitful.

295
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:09,600
And again, this is just an example of the main limitation of ecologic studies, which is called the EcoLogic Fallacy.

296
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:19,689
Key limitation second limitation lack of exchange ability between groups due to differences in

297
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:25,510
within group distributions of individual level characteristics that may be causes of the outcome,

298
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,400
basically lack of exchange, ability or confounding, although you don't need to worry about that word yet.

299
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,840
But comparison groups. Um.

300
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:46,580
By aggregates may not be exchangeable with each other with respect to.

301
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:59,530
Other characteristics. Here is an example also from that well-known meat intake and colon cancer.

302
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,280
One very I guess intuitive variable that.

303
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,580
Can be an equally distributed between exposure groups.

304
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,860
By exposure groups, I mean there are some countries with higher meat intake,

305
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:26,489
there are other groups with lower meat intake and lack of exchange ability means that those two groups of countries

306
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:34,620
are not exchangeable with each other because it is very likely that they in the countries with high meat intake,

307
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:45,360
that is low intake of dietary fiber because actually at the individual level as a as a dietary habit, that's very common in general.

308
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,000
People with high meat intake may have lower dietary fiber intake.

309
00:41:51,600 --> 00:42:01,410
Right. And vice versa. In countries with low meat intake, the intake of dietary fiber might be higher.

310
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:10,020
So those exposure groups for meat intake may not be exchangeable with each other with respect to dietary fiber intake.

311
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,950
And guess what? Dietary fiber can actually.

312
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,090
Be protective against colon cancer.

313
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:25,420
So when you see the association, you could not attribute it necessarily to a causal effect of high red meat eating.

314
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,140
It could also be a causal effect of low fiber intake.

315
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:44,320
Lack of exchange ability. And again, in most of these ecologic studies, you will not have information on those.

316
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:49,470
Variables that are unevenly distributed and are causing lack of exchange.

317
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,070
So you are more or less stuck with your aggregate information and exposure and all.

318
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:19,130
Now they do have a number of advantages. One is that, um, within groups within countries, for example, the variability in a given exposure may be low.

319
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:35,390
But if you compare the aggregate measure of exposure between groups, you may be able to cover a larger range in variability of exposure.

320
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:44,969
And. This is another example from again that the nutritional mythology failed because

321
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:51,150
actually many original ecologic studies were done in the field of nutrition

322
00:43:51,230 --> 00:44:03,900
genealogy because people in the 1960s were really and seventies were really afraid of trying to figure out what people eat at the individual level.

323
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,340
And they thought that the only the best possible evidence they could collect on the effects of diet on health were from these aggregate studies.

324
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,440
But. Think again of meat intake.

325
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:32,940
How do you compare meat intake, let's say, in the United States with meat intake in Japan?

326
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,920
We know the amount. Where do people eat more meat?

327
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,740
The United States. Yeah. That's like, you know, there is some they don't.

328
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:56,740
The thing is, within the United States, because everybody eats relative a relatively high amount of meat,

329
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:05,170
you may find relatively little variation between one person and another with respect to the amount of meat they eat,

330
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,130
because they all eat on average, relatively high amounts.

331
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,930
In Japan, it's actually the same, but on the low end of the distribution.

332
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:22,090
So you may find relatively little variability in the amount of meat people eat in Japan because everybody is relatively little red meat.

333
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:30,310
Okay. Imagine that meat has actually an effect on colon cancer.

334
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:45,300
That effect is perhaps only going to be observable when you compare very high levels of meat to very low levels of meat.

335
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:55,620
Right. Because it's an exposure that probably needs a lot of, you know, long time and heavy exposure to actually cause cancer.

336
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:05,820
If that's the case, you could not conduct the study within Japan or within the United States.

337
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,540
Within the United States. Most people will have already a high intake of meat and you will not have enough

338
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:20,210
people with enough or sufficiently low intake of meat to compare against any Japan.

339
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:30,240
Already people have low intake of meat. You will not have enough people with sufficiently high intake of meat to observe the effect of meat on cancer.

340
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:40,610
But then if you compare the two countries, each one offering different levels of exposure and others in between.

341
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,560
Maybe you will be able to see that countries. So is that is that clear?

342
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:59,590
With that example. Look. Also, these studies are helpful when the exposure may vary randomly over time.

343
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,340
At the individual level, but is more stable at the country level.

344
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:16,840
And again, nutrition offers a really good example because as you know in general, diet varies well within a short period.

345
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:24,220
There is a lot of within there some day to day variation in that, you know, we don't need the same every day.

346
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:33,280
There is supposed to be an underlying pattern, but still diet would be more stable at the country level than at the individual level within a country,

347
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,770
and that would be advantageous to have a more stable level of exposure.

348
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,240
With respect to the outcome.

349
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:59,560
Many of these ecologic studies use US outcomes, health issues, diseases, etc. that are usually ascertained from national or state registers.

350
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,850
And for some of these diseases, these registers are very high quality.

351
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,640
You know, cancer registers tend to be pretty complete in the countries where they exist.

352
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:19,430
So the quality of the information at the aggregate level may be actually higher than if you were trying to do a study among,

353
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,530
you know, 100,000 people and asking everyone whether they have been diagnosed with cancer or not.

354
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:38,610
Right. Now, another advantage of these studies is that there are some exposures that just cannot be assessed at the individual level.

355
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:46,070
So if you want to make any sort of inference from about those exposures, you know, like income inequality,

356
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,240
level of industrialization policies, those, etc., there is no other way to go around.

357
00:48:52,350 --> 00:49:02,299
You are sort of stuck within an ecological. And sometimes, you know, even four exposures that can be collected at the individual level,

358
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,010
you may actually be interested to know what's happening at the aggregate level.

359
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:15,800
For example, your question might be why factories have different rates of work related accidents.

360
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,700
Why cities have different levels of obesity, etc.

361
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:28,209
Okay. And finally, also,

362
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:37,870
there are certain types of studies that are bound to be ecologic because they rely on assumptions that can only be obtained at the aggregate level,

363
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:42,310
such as studies of complex nonlinear infection and transmission dynamics.

364
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,390
And you might be interested in that field. Yeah.

365
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,380
So. Okay. All right.

366
00:49:51,340 --> 00:50:08,970
Any questions on ecologic studies? Let's know the reason why.

367
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,360
Meat intake in a given year.

368
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:23,250
Uh. Cannot really cause colon cancer on the same year.

369
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:38,780
Okay. Because it takes a lot of time for cancer to for, you know, to become diagnosable and for me to eventually have an effect on cancer.

370
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:46,250
So that's another example on why it's unlikely that the same people in whom.

371
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,280
Exposure is measured at those in whom outcome happens.

372
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,930
Right. No questions. And. Good.

373
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:10,180
It is your progress report for today. They learn to classify the most common epidemiologic study designs according to exposure assignment,

374
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,850
observational and experimental writing and unit of analysis.

375
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:23,170
Individual or group subgroups. You should be able to define ecologic study and provide examples.

376
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,350
Describe the limitations of ecologic studies. What is the main limitation of ecologic studies?

377
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,110
EcoLogic fallacy or aggregation bias,

378
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:46,620
another limitation that is of exchange ability and describe five advantages of ecologic studies that you can find in the corresponding

379
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:58,830
is that okay to it was short and sweet and you have a little longer for lunch before the first lab so we'll I'll see you on Wednesday.

380
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,070
There's excuses, and I.
