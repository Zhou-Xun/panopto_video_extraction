00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,070
Hi. Good to see you again. In this final segment in module.

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,180
Let's discuss competency based human resources management.

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm sure by far you had come to understand that human resources management plays a critical role in aligning organizational values and goal.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,900
On the one hand and employee development on the other hand, because without certain alignment,

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,540
organizations will forever be stuck in a mire of mediocre performance.

6
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,469
Competency based human resources management has gained traction as more and more

7
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,260
organizations realize the strategic importance and function of human resources.

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,030
Many organizations have now tried to articulate the organizational goals and values in terms

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:09,140
of competencies so that their goals and values can be embodied in human resource practices.

10
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,780
And also their goals and values can be understood by employees and teams working within the organization.

11
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,570
They also use competency in the recruitment, training, appraisal,

12
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,590
compensation and other personnel processes so that they can align employee performance

13
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,070
with the performance of organizations in light of their goals and values.

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,090
So what is competency based human resources?

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,940
Basically, it is to use the notion of competency and the result of competency analysis in recruitment selection,

16
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:58,400
employee development reward and other major activities that we discussed in the previous segment of this module.

17
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,590
Clear definition and understanding of the notion of competency is very important.

18
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:13,260
In this sense, competency is an underlying attribute of a person that results in effective or superior performance.

19
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:24,790
Competencies, and those will be defined as skills and behaviors that organizations expect their employees to practice in their work.

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:37,230
In other words, the word competency is focused on desirable social behavior as well as the underlying knowledge, skills and attitude.

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:49,470
It is generally believed that adequate competency or competency is a predictor for individual performance as well as the performance of organizations.

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,010
An example that is closely rather than to you is the SIF core courses that all of you are required to take, including this one.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,890
All of the courses are designed based on this competency concept.

24
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,240
Competency can be organized roughly into three buckets.

25
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,870
The first one is called technical competencies,

26
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:22,510
which are what people have to know and be able to do in terms of knowledge and skills in order to carry out the job effectively.

27
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:32,020
Technical competency could be generic, meaning they are required for a set of similar jobs, positions or roles.

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:41,990
For example, you as public health professionals are expected to know the history, structure and functions of the public health system.

29
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:52,030
You also need to have basic knowledge of biostatistics, epidemiology, behavioral sciences and environmental hygiene.

30
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,200
Taking a core competency can also be specific to a particular job or position.

31
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
If you are hiring to a health informatics position.

32
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,020
You'll need programing skills and be able to work with health data systems.

33
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,700
Which are not competencies required for other jobs and positions.

34
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,310
The second bucket of competency is behavioral competencies.

35
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,170
They are behavioral expectations. In other words, the type of behaviors required to produce desirable results.

36
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:38,260
Examples can include teamwork, communication, interpersonal skills, leadership, decision making and problem solving.

37
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:50,250
They are sometimes called soft skills. This competency are important for employees at all levels, not just limited to the top or middle levels.

38
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,450
One can argue that this competency applies not just to career.

39
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:05,030
But also to personal life as well. They are the traits that every one of us need in order to be successful in work.

40
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,260
As well as in life. Last and definitely not the least.

41
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,430
Emotional intelligence have become an important competency.

42
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,540
Emotional intelligence means the ability to identify,

43
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:27,060
assess and control the emotions of not just hours, but also the emotions of others and even groups.

44
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:36,000
It is important to emphasize that similar to technical and behavioral competencies, emotional intelligence can be learned.

45
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:45,010
It's not something that you're born into. It is belief that emotional competency includes four abilities.

46
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:53,140
The first one is self-awareness, meaning the ability to read our emotions and recognize their impact.

47
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:04,540
Second, self-management meaning the ability to control our own emotions and impulses and be able to adapt to circumstances.

48
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:13,600
A third social awareness, meaning the ability to sense, understand and react to others emotions.

49
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:22,690
And finally, relational management, meaning the ability to inspire influence, give up others, and manage conflicts.

50
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:31,750
Now, if you pay attention to the definition of emotional intelligence, you may feel daunted that this is such a tall order to achieve.

51
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,420
But the good news is that emotional intelligence can be practiced and learned.

52
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,990
The most important thing is self-awareness.

53
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:51,970
If we have self-awareness, that is a solid foundation for us to belong and to develop other essential skills as defined by scholars.

54
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:59,530
Unfortunately, most human resources management models a focus on logic and rationality.

55
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:12,700
But the truth is, emotions permeate all aspects of organizations because organizations consists of people and because people are emotional animals.

56
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,770
So increasingly, organizations are recognizing that emotions are an integral part of work.

57
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,260
They tried performance, they shaped decision making and behavior, and they affect creativity,

58
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,960
leadership, teamwork, and our ability to negotiate and managed conflicts.
