00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, everybody. Alan here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I wanted to make this video to call your attention to a cheat sheet on notation and epidemiology that I made and posted to canvas.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I plan on improving this cheat sheet throughout the semester.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you read it or watch this video and have any questions or have any suggestions to improve it, I'd love to hear from you.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I hope to make this a useful resource to students in the future as well.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So this resource is intended to just basically introduce some of the more common notation that we use in this course, in epidemiology in general.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I know that the math backgrounds of the students in this course can vary a lot.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I always found these things to be kind of confusing if they're just sort of thrown at you and not really explained in a formal way.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so this is sort of an attempt at making that process easier.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So if we start in the top left hand corner, we have some data on students in a classroom.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We'll start with the concept of indexing indexing usually involves a notation that is used to denote membership of a group.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And so we have our examples here to denote the variable student name.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We use a and then a subscript indicating the number of the student.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's sort of the indexing of it.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And our example here, we see that a underscore three represents is equal to Rosa because Rosa is the name of the third student.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Similarly, a underscore five is Isabel, because Isabel is the name of the fifth student.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, this example is by no means all encompassing.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The indexing can really represent either persons that belong to a group as individuals or strata as in the data set.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's say we broke our data set up in to five different strata based on socioeconomic status for instance.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Indexing can also be used to know that multiple indexing can also be used, which you might see.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you might see something like a underscore three four.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So that might mean the name of probably is the example.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So you might see A, underscore B, underscore three four.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So that might be. The age of the third student, a fourth time point.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you were doing some sort of longitudinal study, for instance, and you'll see more examples of this as we go on it, it'll become more clear.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Another thing that's really commonly used is sigma notation. Sigma notation is a large operator that looks like kind of a weird E.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You'll see it at the bottom left hand corner there. It used to denote, take the sum

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of all of the numbers that come after is often combined with i indexing,

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
as you see here, as we write out a way to represent the average of all of the ages in the classroom data.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So you can see there that there's the sigma symbol, which denotes take the sum of all.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then b i so b represents age and we start at i equal to one, which is the number on the bottom of the sigma.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And we go all the way to five.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So start at Jamal who is age 10 and go take the sum of all of the students from Jamal all the way to  to Isabel who is the fifth student.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Divide that by five to get the average. The similar type of notation is called PI is another large operator.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pi is a lot like Sigma, but it's just used to represent taking the product of all of the numbers that follow it.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In this case, we're taking the product of all ages. I don't really know why you want to do that, but it's data that's represented there.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I thought it would keep it simple, similar to the example on the bottom left hand corner.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Our formula kind of in the middle of a sheet indicates.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Take the product of all the ages, starting at student one and go all the way to student five.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Try not to confuse the symbol with a really similar symbol, which denotes statistical independence.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It basically looks exactly like the symbol except upside down. And we'll see examples of that during the course.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Another important thing to look at is how to denote certain types of probability.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is really common in epidemiology.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I just want to give you an example of the sort of types of probabilities that we use an epidemiologist to represent them in notation.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So you see this two by two table that tabulates folks with red hair and whether or not they live in Ireland.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So there's three types of probabilities that we can present from this table and that we generally use epidemiology,

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the first type of probability is marginal probabilities and then joint probabilities and conditional probabilities.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So marginal probabilities are essentially the probability of an event in an entire population conditional on nothing else.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And so you'll see in bullet point one, the marginal probability of having red hair.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's denoted by the sort of PR and then in brackets, red hair.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And that's one 30. So the total number of people in that data set divided by the total number of people in the desert.

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry, the total number of people with red hair in that dataset divided by the total number of people in that dataset.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's eight point one percent. So next is joint probability.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Which is the probability of two things happening at the same time in your data.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And the notation for this is similar, but you separate the variables that you're denoting in the brackets with a comma.

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And so this reads here, the joint probability of having red hair and living in Ireland is PR.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then the brackets red hair comma Ireland. And so that's 120, which is the total number of people that have both red hair and live in Ireland,

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
divided by the total number of people in this table and that's seven point five percent.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's a joint probability. The third type is conditional probability, conditional probabilities are represented by this verticals by arrow,

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
not arrow, vertical line to separate variables out.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And so this this example reads the probability of having red hair given living in Ireland.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And the given part is that is the vertical part. That's how it's read.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The vertical line part. And so 120 is the number of people that have red hair among all the people that live in Ireland.

64
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So you look to the top row there, live in Ireland, 120, and then divide that by 600, which is the total number of people that live in Ireland.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Conditional probabilities are really important in epidemiology. So it's important to know how to write those out.

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Again, the key difference between conditional probabilities and joint probabilities is commas versus vertical lines.

67
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The third type of notation I want to go over is counterfactual notation.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is a little bit more difficult to really sort of represent and a cheat sheet,

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but we can improve it over the semester and it will become more clear as we start to introduce these concepts.

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But counterfactual notation is a probability notation that uses superscripts and sometimes subscripts

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to denote the outcome or the probability of an outcome under a certain counterfactual conditions.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So hypothetical situations. So the two examples here basically represent.

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's say, the probability of having red hair.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If all of the people hypothetically in our study, all sixteen hundred people living in Ireland, and for some people they do live in Ireland.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so that probability is equal to the probability that we observe that they have red hair.

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But for people who don't live in Ireland, it's a counterfactual probability.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And so they say sometimes kind of the fact they live in Ireland.

78
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Both of these things mean the same thing.

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And you might see you might see the superscript or the subscript used interchangeably during your time here, sort of a stylistic thing.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that's basically it takes some time to review this.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And if you have any questions, let me know and we'll see some examples of using this type of notation very soon.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,993
Thank you.
