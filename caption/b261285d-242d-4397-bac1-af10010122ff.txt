1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,580
That's like doing the technical stuff. Oh. Have you tried turning your computer on and off again?

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,460
No, no. Okay.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,760
Hopefully that it was on the owl.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,550
I don't know. You know, like the microphone back.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,190
Yeah. Okay. Hopefully that okay. Or I didn't get raped.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:37,330
That's good. Yes. So here we are. Just to make sure you understand everything she means.

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,900
Library. We just used the term information.

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,070
At Tubman. But we find that it tends to confuse people.

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,630
But I am your one stop shopping for all information that the library provides.

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,110
To the campus. So if you have any questions, contact me first.

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,300
After hours, you can chat with Ask a librarian.

12
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:11,140
But they will know a lot of what you do, a lot of research if you need to do so.

13
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,490
Today, I'm going to talk about how to write an abstract, and I will tell you that even though I asked you in this set of the slides ahead.

14
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,820
While I was going through the slides again this morning, I did make some changes.

15
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:37,340
I will send an updated version of the. So what we're going to talk about, this is new, this nothingness, like what an abstract is and is not.

16
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,510
There are different types of abstract, so we'll just cover.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:47,390
There's two ways we could review some helpful writing tips and then a few small group activities.

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,560
Learn how to analyze abstracts and practice writing abstracts to make the abstracts that you write that.

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,510
So what is an abstract? Anybody.

20
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,170
Yes. It's usually like a brief overview of the entirety of whatever your.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:16,180
So it's like a reporter. It's a good answer.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,420
It needs to be concise. And that's one thing that will either get tell people that, yes,

23
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,830
they want to read your paper because it's important to whatever they're doing or no, it's not a topic.

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,110
You want to have the description of the research method and design.

25
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,790
Some of the major findings of the study and the conclusions.

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,620
So you want each person and the person. So this is one slide, a couple slides.

27
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,490
I've moved up the writing slides. So just give me the structured abstract.

28
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,140
Imran So strikes two, which stands for introduction.

29
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,229
So why is this research important? This is sometimes also called objectives.

30
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,630
Break down your purpose and you'll see different things.

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:19,750
Based on what different publishers, what methods, how you did the study sometimes called materials and methods results almost always call results.

32
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,610
It's what you found and who a discussion. So the implications of your study.

33
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,920
Sometimes called conclusions. Sometimes there is a discussion and conclusion as separate.

34
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,310
One thing that is certain is that it's going to be short 120 to 500 words.

35
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,120
So every word counts in an abstract.

36
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,390
But there are. So this is a stricter abstract example.

37
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,490
And you can see this is what the objective of the study is to show.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,950
Exposure to soft paper dust is associated with impaired life fashion.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,140
Whether there is an increased risk for asthma or chronic destructive pulmonary disease is unclear.

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,560
But they go into the methods, the number of workers and where they studied them and they define what is high exposed worker,

41
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,050
what are the low exposures and then what the follow up is results.

42
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,890
And you can see that there's an increased mortality due to COPD among exposed workers.

43
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:28,220
And thus from exposed workers. Their conclusion is of high official exposure to soft paper dust increases in mortality due to asthma.

44
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:34,000
And the results suggest that people, dust, locals and workplaces should be at the specific.

45
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,540
So if you don't care about some people, just. Then you probably don't want to read about this.

46
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,690
But there is enough information here so that.

47
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,130
You can decide if you want to read it, if you can extract some data from it.

48
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,380
So this is an unstructured abstract, which is we'll probably only do if the journal.

49
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,160
I found a surprisingly large number of unstructured abstracts.

50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,200
I searched for noise. But this is.

51
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:27,769
Yeah. It's. It's a single. Sometimes it's. A couple of paragraphs, something, paragraph and so but it does same kind of thing.

52
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,920
It presents the same kinds of information just in a different format.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:44,730
So I'd like to get together with a partner or two if there are 2 to 3 people around you and read both abstracts critically.

54
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:54,840
So don't do this on the on your read it on the truck together so that one person at the end can report out your group.

55
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,630
Totally. And I want you to look at these two abstracts.

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,480
Structured and structured. Yeah.

57
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:41,010
And I'll give you 5 minutes. I'm sorry.

58
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:56,050
All right. It's.

59
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,670
You know. Exactly. I feel like this is more.

60
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:55,140
From. But I can just see that if you're not already talking together, now is a good time to do them.

61
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:11,350
Like, you know, getting to the point where you expect to get something you're not really well, you know, I mean, traveling.

62
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:27,420
It's like, you know, you. So I was like, that was part of that sort of like I like when you can be in there because.

63
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:46,450
Tough. It sounds to me like you have with the same number of who trying to do something like this.

64
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:55,240
I have to have my doctor's orders.

65
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, I guess this was, like, one of the most horrific.

66
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,190
Feeling that. The construction.

67
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,720
As long as the structural integrity clearly states.

68
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:37,730
This is what we found. And this was. And I was watching you.

69
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:51,670
And I just feel like with the information that's going on here, you're like, yeah, I agree with.

70
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,450
The idea is that you have to get sites from your life.

71
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:16,880
You. This isn't just other articles and stuff like that.

72
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:30,560
Okay. So what do you think about the two different examples of volunteers?

73
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:47,060
Know, I. What differences did you see in the two different types of abstracts so it was easier to read than the other given exam.

74
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,370
Can you find information more easily or is it really or really just the same?

75
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,380
This one just has labels. Yes.

76
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:06,790
So I guess I'm a layperson and I prefer not to start from scratch just because you might not know how to come together with what is happening.

77
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,010
True. However, I mean, do you think we're going to have.

78
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:21,230
You know, there are companies that are. What did other people think?

79
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,280
Yes. I just like the objective. Very clear.

80
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm sorry. You know, officially this when I looked at this.

81
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:47,730
Oops. But you understood that sort of functions as the introduction of.

82
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,770
And then you go down to the kids and then you come.

83
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,820
What then have the results proven? That's one of the interesting things about this particular one.

84
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:11,810
Study deaths in process. But when you are reading a lot of these, this is very, very helpful to give you an overview of what's.

85
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:21,690
But you should be able to get the same information from an unstructured abstract unless you don't have enough.

86
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:36,270
Either dinner or a Ford. Some things to keep in mind.

87
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:50,040
You're not supposed to use phrases such as This is so salmon I will attempt to prove, but sometimes you can't help but do something like that.

88
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,770
There are examples that you see that include that, but you need to write clearly and concisely.

89
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:04,110
It's better to start writing more and then edit yourself down rather than trying to make it come out with just a few words.

90
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:14,250
Avoid the passive voice. This is not the best possible example of that, because often when you use the passive voice, you need more words.

91
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,090
And you're always you always have to be thinking about your word.

92
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:28,780
Count in an abstract. So when you describe the results, provide enough detail so that the reader knows if they want to read the paper or not.

93
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:36,260
But. Also very important so that if this is an abstract for a conference.

94
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,300
Paper that hasn't been published in the Journal yet.

95
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,920
People can still extract enough data to use it in a systematic review or other kind of structure.

96
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,480
Study. So your the research that you do isn't left out until you actually get it published.

97
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
Sometimes, as there is,

98
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:07,500
there is a lot of unpublished research and we encourage people to look at that in part because there is a bias towards positive publication results.

99
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,680
In spite of the fact that there is journal of negative results most.

100
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,740
Research that is published has a positive result in real life positive results.

101
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,730
But by looking at pretty literature, you also find out more about what people.

102
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,460
Arguing or trying to. Keep within the work that you've been given.

103
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:47,290
Journalists have absolutely no mercy. So remember that whether you're writing an abstract or a paper,

104
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,440
you're telling a story or trying to convince you that the research that you've done says.

105
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,480
You say it means what you said to avoid doing the most things which are fun, but they're going to interfere.

106
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:11,750
Make somebody stop and think. Clinging to the sight of your nearest starfish who is clinging to this to the side of an aquarium.

107
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,010
Nobody should have to stop and think about what? What?

108
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,360
What you said. You said that. Earnings.

109
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,230
And remember that a lot of people who are reading what you're writing will not be experts in the field.

110
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:36,240
So we need to be very clear. And if you look at a lot of the best journals, they actually do a lot have a lot of definitions.

111
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,810
So. They will not just use technical terms, we hope to find enough to.

112
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:53,359
Avoid two sentences. I've been an editor and this is my favorite word work the worst sentence.

113
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,180
And it's really one sentence that I had to edit.

114
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:06,230
It was only after so frenetically 40 years, starting in the 1880s as a writer, editor and active participant in a range of critical controversies.

115
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:14,780
We were in this Army doctor, stuck to the least utilitarian of positions regarding our not as two of society, but as a special, a sacred world.

116
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,010
After the wilderness moment and lyrical romances based on the sordid escapades as well as the efficacy is superior,

117
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,710
and she can only so she of new poetic styles.

118
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:31,550
After to his encouragement and through his eloquent web translations instrumental service to the theater,

119
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,810
she can get you movement only after all of these initiatives to produce forms of writing did all go true to the great interpreter she shows us.

120
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:48,620
Do you even care what this means? I have read this to its but opposite a Japanese record of the late 30 centuries.

121
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,670
I have read this to my friends who are in Japanese literature.

122
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,120
And you say that? Yes, it's about what you go and think.

123
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,990
You can't really get anything else out of it because there's there's so much.

124
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,070
So don't do that. If you've got a sentence, that is this one.

125
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:17,040
You can break it up and he must break it up. Okay.

126
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,340
So now we have another activity of working in small groups.

127
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,440
Again, you can work in I don't get for obvious.

128
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:36,780
I've got four articles and the idea is that each couple will be two puppies for each group,

129
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,370
and that together what we do is create a definite script abstract.

130
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,680
So your skin, this paper, you don't need to read it in great detail.

131
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,440
Draft an abstract. And then. Be prepared to talk.

132
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,390
Your abstract. So this is a link to the documents that you would use.

133
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,000
So. For yourself.

134
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,750
Or work. You only want one.

135
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:45,540
Okay. Move on down and. One of the what I've done and the Google Docs is there's a word coming out that

136
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,230
gives you a sense of which document you should choose one of the articles.

137
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,320
Has, should have. The other three will have.

138
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:18,750
Parts of the. After.

139
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,260
Words. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:45,660
Workers in this group, you guys have acoustics, too, right here, right within the first year.

141
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:57,660
And first, if you want to be a producer first on.

142
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,840
Yeah. I'm sorry, because I'm sure I'll find this.

143
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, yeah. Story source stimulus.

144
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:35,370
Milosevic. And if you have any questions, just with introduction regarding U.S., I think I can help you.

145
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:50,680
Let me know. So we're just going to see if.

146
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:14,450
Well, I mean, I would probably have to be cautious, I guess.

147
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,460
Yeah. I mean, having.

148
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,570
Businesses are that. Maybe that.

149
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:05,890
But that's only one part. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

150
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:15,070
That's true. I do. I do pay. And for many children have to learn how to.

151
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:31,460
I'm like, sweet. Oh, yeah. So I told her that thinking about.

152
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,970
The problem is.

153
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,760
I want to talk. Yes.

154
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,310
So. Because. Oh, yeah.

155
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:07,360
There's a study. Done anything to.

156
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,300
Maybe. Is that part of that?

157
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,500
Well, yeah, but I'm saying, like you said.

158
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,710
Is that what way? Oh, yeah, I got it.

159
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,950
But it doesn't matter that it was used for three days.

160
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:51,900
It's only benefits. I don't think it was. It's a really good business.

161
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Well. Because I never got a sense of why.

162
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,880
I haven't seen a clue as to what happened.

163
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:42,670
So I'm going to read about the.

164
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,330
You're going to say open source and that's their source of the footprint they were use.

165
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,270
I think I just think that this was happening right in front of him.

166
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:28,210
And he was. There's a saying, you know, I think that, you know, I think because you look at the military, I mean, a part of me gets a.

167
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,970
The environment can killer. We don't have to here.

168
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,390
I mean, I got news. Oh, that's.

169
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:47,120
That was. I was researching this.

170
00:25:48,480 --> 00:26:04,880
So. There is a new.

171
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:16,200
Suicide. This is.

172
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh. So. No.

173
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:51,960
The seasons change. So of like these folks.

174
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,740
So. Now.

175
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:57,330
There's you. If you read the entire.

176
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:17,650
You're doing? It doesn't years ago.

177
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,600
The flexibility you.

178
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,270
The students that go to the school. I am.

179
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm going to miss them. Yeah, I feel. And so on. People.

180
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,350
It's like while I claim to attain combat like never before,

181
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:57,770
even if some together did that like a 30 year old, they would get like discipline from military.

182
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:04,200
Yeah, I'm like, that's not a lot. That's great. Yeah. And then I come.

183
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,050
My thought is this. Yeah, right. Yeah. Like.

184
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,240
Like, how can you just let students. Control.

185
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:22,680
Have looked at which powers they can easily just spam just like you can disguise you know,

186
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,590
sort of like, you know, it's like everyone just gives it to sort of like going over.

187
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,740
What do you mean? This policy.

188
00:29:44,880 --> 00:30:05,400
I thing that was very scary. Does that have to do?

189
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,680
And also just because they mentioned the intelligence.

190
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:19,620
Nothing to do with, like, the 40. So running record for.

191
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,950
This is the first time I remember for the first the first group that's doing the

192
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,330
acoustics article that means to even if you decide to write it using headphones,

193
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,400
it has to be just one paragraph, no headings and. Yeah.

194
00:30:40,590 --> 00:31:04,730
That's why I didn't put any parents. As I stated.

195
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,470
Or you can figure out that you've got about 3 minutes left.

196
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,189
Oh. Of course.

197
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:40,110
Does not have to be anywhere close to perfect. And I've seen some very nice abstracts.

198
00:31:41,290 --> 00:32:01,810
Google Books. I objected.

199
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:08,510
She just said, you got to play along. Yeah, but not by us like this.

200
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,620
Yeah. This is the one article that the original has. Just a paragraph and unstructured.

201
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:19,390
That's right. Yep. So that's what we need to do. And you might also check to see how many words you have.

202
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,720
I haven't given you a limit, but I would go over 500 words.

203
00:32:36,660 --> 00:33:06,500
23. How can I?

204
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah. Okay, let's get ready to. Cold.

205
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,670
So just one more minute.

206
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,560
So if you haven't added anything or too much here, now is the time to really focus on this.

207
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:46,719
Publishing. If you want to. If you would like, I would suggest to revisit the source.

208
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,290
Dr. You get rid of a few periods.

209
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,570
Variable diarrhea depending.

210
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,630
One more minute because. Makes you feel that.

211
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,830
In France. So. Every research.

212
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:46,510
It's freedom. It's. So let's look at what one has done.

213
00:34:52,870 --> 00:35:00,750
That's a very nice little. And I realize that some of these are very hard to.

214
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:13,050
There's one article that's relatively short, but when you're unfamiliar with the topic, it's a shorter who can be hurt to extract data from it.

215
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:23,330
But this also becomes a challenge. And let me go back to the slides.

216
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,060
So this is the official abstract for DAPL.

217
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,050
So how do you think you performed? I'll take a minute to remember.

218
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,470
We definitely have some similar words in there. Like in year two.

219
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,310
Alma. Yeah. And you don't have to be deployable.

220
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,260
I think we got to study like methods. Basically the same idea.

221
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:06,600
Just because there's one kind of objective look at the distances, what the frequency is for, what the depth was because of the numbers of the center.

222
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:14,700
But the actual interpretation and conclusions of the study were a little bit more difficult for us to pass through,

223
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,190
just given our familiarity with the source material. Yeah, but.

224
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,960
And they don't always have a nice one paragraph conclusion or discussion.

225
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,240
Yeah. This one I think had the results or the confusion and discussion in one section.

226
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:39,030
So it's kind of hard to determine which one was their extrapolation versus just their like blanket and remarks.

227
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,490
Yeah, I really like having a conclusion section that is separate from discussion, but that is.

228
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,010
Sent by either your instructor or by the journal. Sure, I don't have to.

229
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,030
As my librarian, I have to follow a structured abstract.

230
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:02,140
And for what? A lot of what I do, we do a lot of practice. But because this is what I did for this book.

231
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:12,069
I wrote an article on Gamifying, one of my classes coming up with filling in those spaces,

232
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,060
even for a subject that I knew very well, did not always make a whole lot of sense.

233
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,570
But I did it that it took longer than it should have. Considering many others did so.

234
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,080
Yes. So when most of the time that. When you.

235
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:35,560
No the topic. It's not surprisingly.

236
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,910
So let's see. Thank you for.

237
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,650
So to get let's go to three.

238
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,830
So this seems to be a sort of a long abstract.

239
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,150
Did you just hear from how many words it is?

240
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,680
No. This kind of writing. Right. Yeah. Which is.

241
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:21,749
Which is fine, because it's always better to write more and then get it down rather than to try to, unless you're really comfortable with the topic.

242
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,370
And then you might be able to get much closer to just.

243
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,970
Yeah. And you all want to write complete sentences, not two bullet points once you actually get to that.

244
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:51,910
Let me. Okay.

245
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,690
So this is they also had a relatively low. Abstract and.

246
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,560
But in study objectives, just with this journal materials and methods, how do you think you did all things considered?

247
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:17,640
Did you have some of the same information? I'm less concerned about the precise word you used, but do you think you did a good job of selecting?

248
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,730
To put in. You're on the right track. So.

249
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:31,250
Well, it's only ten. I only get for 10 minutes. Yeah. Yeah, right.

250
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.

251
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,580
I just wanted to show you what somebody who actually knew what they were doing.

252
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,870
So if you got the right information in general, that's a really good start.

253
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:55,970
Her. Thanks for.

254
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:06,060
So it's very nice. So how do you feel about.

255
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,150
Did you you did you think that we found to the best of your.

256
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,180
And we've got very young. In this case, there was no discussion, but there was a conclusion.

257
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:34,540
So sometimes the discretion ends up in decisions, which is. But it could be because this particular German has a very small.

258
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Number four is that you can use. And again, that's just.

259
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:50,990
It's good that. This is the extracts of background.

260
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,480
Their methods. Results in the.

261
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,710
If you got. Yeah. I think that if you got pretty much the right information that there was some sense there that's.

262
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,290
But Fatou, I mean, you haven't. I was.

263
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:36,380
So how did you find us? We are challenging and challenging just because it's long been favored.

264
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:46,080
Yeah. You know, personally, I'm not really familiar with some of the top lawmakers thought it was taking longer than Clinton has given.

265
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,350
Yeah. Yeah. The biggest thing is that, like, right from the get go, they already thrown in in support of the right of anything to actually do.

266
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,300
Yeah, because there are some acronyms that they don't even know.

267
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,030
So we did the best that we could. Right? Which is that? Which is all this is about.

268
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,379
This is interesting. And what's interesting is that when you're looking at word counts,

269
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,130
you can often use acronyms without defining them in the abstract, which you cannot do.

270
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:24,080
And again, it's going to depend on the journal. But once you get to the publication process, if you're thinking you're writing for publication, you.

271
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,729
The very next thing you should do other than yes I am going you write this up for publication is go to think about

272
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:39,530
journals you want to submit to and look at their author pages because then you'll see things like what is the abstract?

273
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:46,919
Like How many words do you have? What citation style that you use, which is very important because you have to get that right.

274
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,660
And all of that kind of information is very useful to have this at the beginning rather than.

275
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,569
I get a lot of calls from people who are wondering what's going on because they haven't either haven't bothered to

276
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,790
look at the author instructions because they're just trying to figure things out from looking at articles published.

277
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,900
And you can't know what's going on in the minds of the voters.

278
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,720
And by doing that, they're in this case, they're trying to insert the words for references.

279
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,580
You don't do that. You have the energy to do that.

280
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:30,420
That's an position. But yeah, this was just a case of skimming and trying to find where you might find those pieces of information.

281
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,970
The great thing about the structured abstract is that it's also the structure of your paper.

282
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:44,870
So you can have subheadings. But this is a very good thing about writing in the sciences.

283
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:51,590
I come originally from humanities at a master's degree in art history as well as particularly for Michigan.

284
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,440
And you can organize things almost anywhere you want to just go on and on.

285
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,800
Especially when she got east.

286
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,690
Our history in. That was your first meeting? Yes.

287
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,990
You can just go on at length.

288
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:18,290
But this is great because it says, okay, in this one, you start with the background to what people know, why you're doing this and why you support.

289
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,180
Then you move on to the objectives of the particular study.

290
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:30,530
When you talk about the methods you used to that and then you talk about your results and then you have conclusion,

291
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,060
you might have a discussion of the results or this discussion might be within the results.

292
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,820
And so that's very that actually is very nice.

293
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:50,870
I don't generally personally like owning a paper, but this thing, this part outlines your paper for you and that's take advantage of that.

294
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,420
In abstracts. Any other questions?

295
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,200
I think you did a great job on this. I was actually trying to find.

296
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,500
You just take this. Purpose.

297
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:14,550
But that's such a broad topic. They're all written by faculty.

298
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,950
It's yeah, it was it was a big thing to write. And I really appreciate the effort that you put into this.

299
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:29,070
I'll send you an updated set of the slides that were original, abstract, for one, if you want.

300
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,520
So if you have any other questions for me. Not just.

301
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:45,010
Here's something I totally forgot. My email is C Shannon CSG and that you wished I did you and I can have that to that.

302
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:54,370
Yeah. And. Yes.

303
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,580
And this is the research guide for this department.

304
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:08,729
So it's got a lot of information here. It doesn't have everything, but it's got different kinds of databases, subject, specific resources.

305
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,420
This could be very, very useful for statistics.

306
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,990
The permission of searching, writing, saying all sorts of stuff.

307
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:23,200
So make sure to use this guide. It will save you time and energy.

308
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,240
All right. Great. Thank you. I have a couple of announcements.

309
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,960
Go. So don't forget to submit your draft abstracts today.

310
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:45,260
Thank you for you. I think I was asking for those papers that, you know, this looks familiar.

311
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,110
So next week I will not be here, but Simmons will be here as well as a guest speaker.

312
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,240
So. Next week.

313
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:01,240
And also, I know we've talked a little bit about the internship evaluation.

314
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,590
I talked to the careers office and I have a link for that, but I also have a list of everyone who has completed it.

315
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,740
So to have not completed it, I will e-mail you.

316
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,480
So. We've heard about the.

317
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:42,160
Thank you very much for coming. To do they one.

318
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:49,490
That's what I felt that.

319
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,890
So what? Think. I got it going on the second one.

320
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,600
All right. All of your friends are gonna be here.

321
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:03,660
Oh, yeah?
