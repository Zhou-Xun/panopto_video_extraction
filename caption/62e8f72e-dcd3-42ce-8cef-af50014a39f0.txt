1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,640
Okay. Welcome, everybody. Happy Thursday. Not a lot in the way of announcements today.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,250
So a reminder that your HHC critiques are due at midnight or 11:59 p.m.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,040
Please let me know if that's a hardship.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,160
Secondly, I don't know if you saw my announcement that there were several requests for next Tuesday to do it on Zoom.

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,499
The guest lecturer has agreed to that. So as I said, please attend.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,520
And if at all possible, please keep your camera on, because that's one of my students who really wants to experience teaching.

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,010
And talking to empty squares on Zoom is really, uh, weird.

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:53,639
No, not a good sort of introduction to how teaching should go, so I would appreciate that if you guys could do that.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,209
So that will be on Tuesday. I'll try to figure out how to get that set up.

10
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,520
There is a zoom option on here, so hopefully that will automatically record everything as well.

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,750
So. Any questions on that?

12
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,680
And then I'll also figure out the schedule for the presentations, these last two sessions.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,370
Okay. Today we have another guest lecturer.

14
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,930
We have Professor Deb Watkins, whom I have collaborated with for many years on a number of projects,

15
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:41,360
and she has been kind enough to agreed to do this topic because when I first met her, she was working in this type of area.

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,130
She was doing a lot of the mall type pathway, more Cairo,

17
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:54,950
sort of non occupational exposure assessment work, which I thought was very well done, very detailed.

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,710
So we just kind of expanded it to to give coverage on sort of our progression in the syllabus.

19
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,740
So as you guys all know, we spent a lot of time on Occupational.

20
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,910
After that first unit of both sort of fundamental information on both occupational and environmental.

21
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,870
Then of course, on Tuesday, Professor Ross talked about air pollution.

22
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,000
So now I want to talk a little bit more about environmental approaches to exposure assessment that, you know,

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,330
goes beyond the ambient air pollution itself is a huge field, but now there's a lot more to it as well.

24
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,640
So, again, thank you, Professor Watkins.

25
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,570
I will turn it over to you. Thank you.

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:50,670
So as John said when we first met, this is a lot of this work is stuff that I was doing at that time, which was my doctoral dissertation.

27
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:59,600
So it's been a few years, but there's still, I think, lots of good stories from so.

28
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,020
All right. So just a general outline of what we're going to cover.

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,290
Talk about chemical exposures in the indoor environment,

30
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:17,400
specifically non occupational environments such as homes and what sources and pathways of exposure look like in those types of environments.

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,930
And talk about environmental samples that you can collect to assess exposure in indoor environments as well as personal exposure.

32
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,870
Right. So in a household, household exposure can be very different than occupational exposure.

33
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,240
So when you're trying to characterize exposure, you want to think about a few different things.

34
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:47,640
First is the magnitude of exposure, which is the concentration of the chemical in that environment and the frequency of exposure.

35
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,270
So if it's your home, like, how often are you in that environment?

36
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,290
And duration. So once you're there, how long do you stay there?

37
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,500
So in occupational environments, the magnitude of exposures is generally a lot higher,

38
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,080
but you're only there for a short, relatively short duration, even though it might seem like a long time,

39
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,010
occasionally at lower frequency, whereas in a residential environment,

40
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,360
the magnitude of exposures is usually lower, but you're there more often and for a much longer period of time.

41
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:30,030
And it's not just healthy workers who are the people that go to work and are exposed to the higher the higher magnitudes of exposure.

42
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:39,510
But it's also vulnerable individuals such as kids and people with other conditions that might make them susceptible to exposure.

43
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,380
So household exposure is important for a few different reasons.

44
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,580
People spend about 90% of their time indoors and about 70% of that is inside their residence.

45
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,230
And now that we're in a COVID post-COVID world,

46
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm guessing that that percentage has probably increased as people have turned to work more from home or virtually,

47
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,280
and they're in the home environment. There are actually very few regulations on the indoor environment.

48
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:24,700
There are some recommendations for ventilation rate and with COVID, we've heard a lot about that as well over being together in a room.

49
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:31,540
What is the ideal ventilation rate that also helps chemical exposures in in home environments?

50
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:40,179
But the only places in which there are any sort of regulations really are for tenants in rental housing.

51
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,590
And that depends on where you live in relation to indoor air quality.

52
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:56,590
I lived in Boston for many years and lived in a small condo outside of Boston and everything was great until our downstairs neighbor moved in,

53
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,709
who was a chain smoker. And it's an old house.

54
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,030
And because we both owned our properties, there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,550
So it was a major bummer, but if we were renting, we would have had very different ways to deal with that.

56
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:22,600
So that's the only point at which there's really any type of regulations really for indoor environments.

57
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,120
Household exposure is also important because again, vulnerable populations.

58
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:36,070
We'll talk a little bit more about kids and a minute older adults, people with asthma and other health conditions.

59
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,839
And I think by the time we moved out of here, the house with the smokers,

60
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,829
like almost everyone else in the house, had asthma or some other health condition.

61
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,920
It was just not good. And even green leaf was bad.

62
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,110
No, no. This is way worse. I don't recommend it.

63
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay. So there are lots of sources of various types of exposure in the household.

64
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,479
So this is really just an overview to try to give you a picture of how complicated it can be,

65
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,980
like how there's there can be lots of different sources of different things and how the exposures move around the household can be,

66
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,230
can be complicated. And so there's a lot to think about here.

67
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm going to go in depth into some of the specifics.

68
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:37,780
So some sources of indoor chemical exposures are fuel burning combustion appliances such as gas, stove fireplaces, tobacco, smoke.

69
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,780
Look at that. Candles and incense or cooking.

70
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:48,820
These are all sources of aerosols, particulate matter, carbon, organic material, carbon monoxide and other gases.

71
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,810
Humans are also a big source of chemical of indoor chemical exposures.

72
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,700
We give off CO2, ammonia, fatty acids and other organic material.

73
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,890
We just kind of like as we move around, we're just, I don't know what's the pants character people think,

74
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,200
yeah, we're kind of just yeah, it's, it's kind of gross if you think about it.

75
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,260
So think about that. An outdoor area can also contribute to indoor chemical exposures.

76
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,250
So regular outdoor air pollution and pesticides and radon is another example.

77
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:40,819
Building materials can be a source of exposure such as insulation, paint, vinyl flooring, which, you know, we do a lot of work with phthalates.

78
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,740
That can be a source of phthalate exposure. Carpet can be a source of fast exposure.

79
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:53,180
Prestwood Cabinetry, you know, the wood that is made out of, you're not really sure what.

80
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,670
I think it's like sawdust and formaldehyde and other VOCs furniture, again, with the wood.

81
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:09,560
But also the foam that is in furniture can be a source of exposure, such as flame retardants and other biases.

82
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,829
My dissertation was on polypropylene.

83
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,350
The foam officers are used, which is the old flame retardant which is now no longer used.

84
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,510
But for the most part, I think it's still there. It's still around.

85
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:30,280
Still there? Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,980
We bought a new couch, actually. Upholstery.

87
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,389
So anything any time you have like the I think Scotchgard was all done for it,

88
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,600
but it's kind of like stain resistant treatment that you have, like furniture, upholstery, a lot of that has PBS in it.

89
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,240
Those, again, are all sources of indoor chemical exposures.

90
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:07,190
Household cleaning products, bleach, ammonia and a lot of again, uses personal care products, especially aerosols.

91
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,860
So like the old hair sprays, but really any personal care products,

92
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,770
they can if they're on your hands, they can also get when you touch things, you transfer things.

93
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,280
And so there's other chemicals can spread in that way.

94
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,219
Hobbies. Oh, so sorry. I was just curious about with the, like the furniture, with the wood and foam and stuff.

95
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,260
Is that also inhalation exposure that does that would leach over time or just more of a thermal?

96
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
We're going to talk about that. Okay. But yes, it's both.

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,550
Yeah, it's about. Yes. Sorry.

98
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:59,180
I'll try to. No hobbies that you do inside your home can also contribute to exposures from like paint and solvents.

99
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,970
And considering all the different sources of boxes, they can be 2 to 5 times higher inside a home compared to outside air.

100
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:22,660
All right, so a partition, just. So once a chemical is in an environment, you know, from a source, it's in the environment.

101
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,080
How it moves around that environment is important in considering exposure.

102
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,759
In other words, it has partitioning.

103
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:40,480
So partitioning is the distribution of a salt salute somewhere between two invisible solvents, such as an aqueous and organic phase.

104
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,330
So really what that is, is say you have oil and water like for chemical based on its chemical properties.

105
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,570
Which is it going to go into the water or.

106
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,520
I don't, she said it's not water.

107
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:04,900
I don't know what I said, but so where the chemical properties of that chemical dictate kind of where in the environment it will go.

108
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,550
So there are partition coefficients.

109
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,520
For one is the chaotic IOW or the optimal water partitioning coefficient.

110
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,430
It's a ratio of concentrations of component in a mixture between those two between the actual water.

111
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:29,590
So it's a measure of the both. Felicity So whether it's hydrophilic or hydrophobic, how is it, where is it going to go?

112
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,540
And there's similar constants for water versus air.

113
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,610
And so it's better of the tendency to be an aqueous or gas phase.

114
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,260
And this is also dependent on vapor pressure and temperature.

115
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,720
All right. So this is a study this is from a study by Abbott and Wang.

116
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,990
So this is showing where specific chemicals partitioned to under different environments.

117
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,190
So this is outdoors. And so the pink is the gas phase.

118
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:12,380
So in other environment, these chemicals is not particularly important, like what these chemicals are.

119
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:20,150
We're not going to go into detail about them, but they were there in the gas phase, in outdoor environment, in the indoor environment.

120
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,690
It's very different because there's so much more surface area in the indoor environment.

121
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:33,110
And so they're going to partition to surfaces that are available.

122
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:50,090
However, where they settle and partition depends on their chemical properties because indoors there's organic film that covers everything.

123
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:59,090
And this this is also something that I learned during my dissertation, which completely just, oh, no, I didn't, didn't want to know this,

124
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:09,080
but there's essentially organic material like covering all indoor surfaces and it's from cooking from people from.

125
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,370
So it's just organic material that these chemicals can then deposit into on indoor surfaces in terms.

126
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,500
So. I think biofilm.

127
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,270
It's more just biological. Yeah, it might be like a specific organism or like group of organisms that.

128
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,170
So I think that this is slightly different, but similar.

129
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:43,050
Yeah. Because this is not just biological, it's just more like combination of organic matter.

130
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,100
Um, and so chemicals can partition into these films on surfaces.

131
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,440
And so we're transferring, you know, whatever's on our hands to these surfaces and taking back whatever it is on surfaces whenever we touch things.

132
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,390
And then if there are materials that do not have the film, there's also partitioning to the actual surfaces, building materials and furnishings.

133
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:21,540
And so what they found was that surface reservoirs, meaning these films dominate dynamic gas, surface partitioning in many indoor air constituents.

134
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,530
So things that are would be in a gas phase outside.

135
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,120
Once they get inside, they're much more likely to partition to these surface films.

136
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,560
And so this is kind of a bigger picture.

137
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,210
So we have indoor air coming in through either direct ventilation or ventilation through filtration into our environment.

138
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,870
There's also infiltration and exfiltration through that diffuses through materials.

139
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,870
But inside the environment, there's it can be very active so chemicals can move around.

140
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,440
This is what we were just talking about, the deposition absorption.

141
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,399
So if things are going from gas onto surfaces, but when it's in the air,

142
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,270
there's also lots of different things that can be happening, that can be chemical reactions,

143
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,459
things can coagulate into larger particles that are then more likely to deposit onto

144
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,920
surfaces can change if there is again like particulate to I think that's the gas.

145
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:41,000
And if you have an air purifier which I think more people are doing now, that can also change like the constituents that are in the indoor air.

146
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,650
And so what this means for like, say, a couch with PBDEs in it or other chemicals,

147
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:58,150
because their properties are replaced with other chemicals then depending on the properties.

148
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,840
The chemicals can fall twice into the air and then settle.

149
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,139
Or they can also be just physically from rubbing up against the couch, you know,

150
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:18,850
like the old phone in old furniture, it gets kind of yellow and crumbly and the thing that goes into your dust.

151
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,650
And so that is another way that chemicals can move around the indoor environment.

152
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:35,290
But what we don't know is like which one of those ways of moving around the environment is more important for human exposure.

153
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,390
Like, what is the predominant way? So that's a little bit what I meant to be talking about in a minute.

154
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,080
All right. So. Four pathways of exposure in indoor environment.

155
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,870
First, we talk about inhalation. So in this instance,

156
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:12,320
children are more susceptible to indoor exposures to indoor air because they have a higher respiratory rate relative to their body size.

157
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,160
So that means that they get a higher dose compared to adults.

158
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:26,089
Inhalation is also important for elderly and chronically ill because they're getting they're spending more time at home.

159
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,660
So, again, it's longer duration, longer frequency in the exposure equation.

160
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:40,760
So that, again, leads to a higher dose. Another important pathway of exposure is incidental ingestion.

161
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,310
So I've been talking about like how we walk around touching surfaces and like

162
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,390
transferring chemicals to and from our hands and then we're eating with our hands a lot.

163
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:00,500
And so that actually leads to a lot of incidental ingestion of chemicals from our environment.

164
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:12,410
Infants are also they are exposed to quite a bit through incidental ingestion because they are crawling

165
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:20,450
around on the floors and putting their hands and everything else into their mouth so that they are more.

166
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,889
Not only are they smaller, so they get a higher dose per her body size,

167
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,850
but they're also being exposed to more just because of their behaviors and also dermal exposure.

168
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,320
So again, like if you're sitting on the couch or like laying on the couch in the dust

169
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,910
and things directly from the couch can get into your body through your skin.

170
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,760
All right. So how do we measure this exposure? This looks familiar, I guess.

171
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,750
And then we come back to this one, dear.

172
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,510
This must be from. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't remember, like, how much came from, like, an old.

173
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,670
I don't. You put this one in for context. All right, good.

174
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
All right. Glad that I'm full circle. All right. Okay.

175
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,600
All right. So this is probably more familiar to you than it is to me at this point.

176
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,090
But so ranking of different types of data that you can use for exposure assessment.

177
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,370
So. Personal exposure.

178
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,290
Again, this is what we use quite a bit with use of biomarkers.

179
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,580
You can also measure the environment, things in the area around directly around the person.

180
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,980
Then there's different surrogates that you can use. So I'll direct here.

181
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,390
So today we'll talk about the personal part and some of the area part.

182
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:02,430
On Tuesday, I think that there are done the surrogates and then after Thanksgiving, I'll come back to biomarkers.

183
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,570
So that's sorry. You know, interject whenever you have.

184
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:23,960
Yeah. All right. So I'm actually going to start more here talking about, um, sampling that area.

185
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,700
Um, so why do we do that?

186
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:38,180
Why measure contaminants in environmental media sort of just utilizing hard markers for different reasons?

187
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:47,450
It's really important to not just understand what someone is exposed to, but also understand the sources from which that exposure comes.

188
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,730
Because if you don't know where it's coming from, you can't do anything about the exposure.

189
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,000
So by measuring things in the environmental media, you can see the sources, pathways and potentially timing of exposure.

190
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,390
So again, this can inform interventions and other exposure prevention efforts.

191
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,440
There are certain vulnerable populations that we care about in environments

192
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:24,180
that aren't necessarily open to contributing biomarkers could be difficult,

193
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:36,659
for example, to collect blood from people. Also, like I do a lot of work with kids and so we're interested in the childhood exposure.

194
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,440
But for like really young kids, how do you collect a urine sample?

195
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:49,110
Like if we're looking at infant exposure, you can hope that they go and, you know, give them lots of water, hope that they go in a diaper.

196
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,489
But then you have to worry about contamination. So, like, how how is that?

197
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,440
Because that samples so biomarkers can be difficult in certain populations.

198
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:12,540
There's also biological variability. So if you're measuring something in urine, but renal function influences the urinary measures of exposure,

199
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,160
like how is that going to affect your analysis? And so if the outcome you're STD in.

200
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:29,030
Is related to renal function that can really introduce bias and confounding and not give you a real picture, accurate picture of exposure.

201
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,620
So I went into them. Excuse me. All right.

202
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:45,660
Let me point out. All right. I obviously I biomarkers are, you know, excellent.

203
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,730
But there are you have to understand the the drawbacks.

204
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,170
And of course, this is like epidemiology viewpoint.

205
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:08,180
But even just characterizing exposure is a concrete example of how renal function might influence a biomarker.

206
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,970
Like would it cause you to excrete more generally?

207
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,220
Does it depend on the biomarker and how all of that, I think.

208
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,180
The example I'm thinking of is say. Actually.

209
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:37,020
Is that right? Sorry. Okay.

210
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:49,560
So Peter, if you have renal issues and you're not clearing PVCs in that way,

211
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,290
it will you'll have higher concentrations in your blood because your body's not able to get out of get rid of it.

212
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:05,580
But then if you look at the studies that looked at exposure to PBS using PBS blood as a biomarker in relation to kidney function,

213
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,690
like if they're saying PBS causes problems for kidney function,

214
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,040
but really it's like they have higher exposure because of the kidney function and not the necessarily the other way around.

215
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:32,129
Reverse causation. Yeah. Another one of these like urinary biomarkers was that if you're using creatinine or something to correct for your condition,

216
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,610
that can be really thrown off by the differential. Right?

217
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,569
Yeah. So my example wasn't a biomarker in urine, so I thought it was a biomarker.

218
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:48,370
I mean, it still is, but it's also like if you're looking at biomarkers,

219
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,700
the biomarker of effects and exposure that are both with the same media, that's also a way that that can.

220
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,400
The District. All right.

221
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:11,040
So how do we collect in environmental indoor indoor environmental samples?

222
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,610
First, I'll talk about indoor air sampling. One way is active air sampling, which is when the air is mechanically drawn through the collection medium.

223
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,999
And there are a couple of different ways to do this. There are sampling points and media.

224
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,370
So, like, this is example of a pump. This is a similar canister.

225
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:38,330
This is I've never used one, but this is essentially a vacuum.

226
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,800
So it has an indoor indoor. The inside surface is treated so that it doesn't react with the air going into it.

227
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,610
And so it has a valve that you open that has a controlled flow into the canister.

228
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:59,700
So over a period of time, the vacuum pulls a sample of air into it, and then that is used for analysis.

229
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:07,740
In the consulting world. That's probably the most commonly for boxes that people use for indoor air quality for viruses.

230
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,729
On the left is similar to what we talked about in occupational safety.

231
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:20,960
The personal air sample can be used for personal or sport area, but I think that little one is I've seen a lot use for a very broad range of viruses.

232
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,310
This is actually an example from when my doctoral work,

233
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:41,680
where inside we had someone at Harvard who had created these pumps that then they let us use these.

234
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,290
There's like a motor in here that draws air through this hose, and this is where the media is.

235
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,570
So it's collecting air, pulling air through here.

236
00:27:52,570 --> 00:28:02,800
And then we run the this is like a polyurethane polyurethane foam plug that we then analyze there.

237
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:11,620
Oh, this is just an example of like different setups. And this is on a tripod because it's meant to be at like breathing level.

238
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:18,940
So I can just a bit more on that. So we talked about, you know, disruption, efficiency, things like that.

239
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,280
You can bypass that by using that central because you bring in the air into that environment.

240
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:31,839
And then you can just take that basketball back into the lab and hook it up to the GC or whatever gives you a much cleaner spectrum.

241
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,280
So that's why they use it for certain viruses that they don't know exactly where they're potential chemicals,

242
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,520
whereas the ones are left and right, it might be a little more specialized.

243
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,790
So I think on the right we use those for the multi classes of chemicals.

244
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:57,460
So you can have one filter for metals, one for particulate matter, one for doses and various things on the same apparatus.

245
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:07,510
So they they have their pros and cons. It's an application. And Margaret, you get a much higher floor, even on the left.

246
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,270
So that's why. Right. And this is desirable. Yes.

247
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,030
That's why you can't wear it around, because the pope is too big to wear. Right. And it's noisy.

248
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,950
This is noisy, large.

249
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:26,230
But if you want a more direct measure of what someone is supposed to as they're moving around the environment, that's definitely.

250
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,870
So did you talk about passive or simply in the occupational context?

251
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,230
Okay. Well, this really isn't any different.

252
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,550
It's just, you know, the same method, just using it in a household.

253
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,200
I think for some studies, people can deploy like a passive air sampler into a household and then leave

254
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,189
it there for a week or sometimes longer and then come back and get it later.

255
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:03,780
So that is something that I think can be used in research as well.

256
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:10,800
And I think occupational settings, I think in The Apprentice, on the bright side of that, we use those we had.

257
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,530
Places for passive monitors, for specific things so they can know x.

258
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,779
The cameraman, the other one.

259
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:28,140
But we're pulled into that on that where that breathing zone was on the previous slide, the one we used had multiple things.

260
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,400
Oh, up here. Yeah. Okay. Two feet.

261
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,220
Two things that helped pass the monitors as well, in addition to that.

262
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,550
Okay. Did you use these is similar?

263
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,440
Yeah. Okay. Like these are the same pump that would be required. Yeah.

264
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,430
Yeah. That's really weird. Anyway, small, little this kind of for you.

265
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,330
But if you did a setup like that, how would the flow rates?

266
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:59,610
Could the flow rates from the active samplers impact how the passive samplers pick up samples?

267
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,350
Good questions you want to make sure those are outside of. Luckily the flow is so high.

268
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,490
But another good question is how do you have multiple filters?

269
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,709
The same anthrax. If you look at mobile phones, what we did is we had a manifold that spoke of lines,

270
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,330
and that was a little tricky on the calibration of the piece to get it just right.

271
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:25,690
Good question. Again. All right.

272
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:43,990
All right. So to calculate from samples that you've got indoor air measurements, too.

273
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,280
They're typically expressed as a concentration in a known volume of air.

274
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:01,719
So for active sampling used to get the concentration, you take the mass and divide by the flow rate times of sampling time,

275
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,860
whereas with passive sampling, it's the mass divided by the uptake rate.

276
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,850
And so every time the uptake rate, I believe is content specific.

277
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,390
So it just depends on the how that it's going to partition into.

278
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:30,540
All right. So to estimate inhalation exposure, now that you have you've done your sampling, you have a concentration of a chemical in the environment.

279
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:37,500
How do you then estimate the dose? So I'm sure this is not new.

280
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,260
We usually talk about average daily dose.

281
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:57,150
So for inhalation, what we do is we look at the concentration times, the inhalation rate, times of duration and days, times bioavailability.

282
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,209
So that's really once in your body.

283
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:09,480
Like how does that chemical react with your system? Like in order to get to where it's actually in in your system and divide by body weight.

284
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,319
The questions are that this is during my recovery very early in the semester.

285
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,810
So it's all. In context.

286
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,500
It's still. Yeah.

287
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,360
I think it's important to understand where, you know, going from a chemical environment.

288
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:42,540
I think the methods for actually collecting a sample and then how to get take that to get here to get a dose and improve viability.

289
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,750
Viability. I feel like that would be respectful of time.

290
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,430
I think there's a type component like just single partition coefficients from

291
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:58,549
a basic it's time dependent in the way that the longer that plastic exists,

292
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,650
the the more plastic is left that you're saying.

293
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:11,270
And so there's less plastic to be removed and therefore less bioavailable after ten years and there is after one year,

294
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:18,590
I think that would play a role in this, like the concentration in the air.

295
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,630
When we're talking about bioavailability, we're talking about, okay, we've been hailed the air.

296
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,209
How much of that is going to actually get into our lungs, into our bloodstream,

297
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,220
and how much of it, you know, because to do that, it has to go through cells and like.

298
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:40,010
Sure. But how much of that is actually just going to be exhaled? So that's the bioavailability piece of it.

299
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:46,250
Whereas what you're talking about, that's a good point. But that would be reflected in the concentration.

300
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,170
I can see more absorption, granulation or permeation.

301
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,980
Yeah. This coward that's referring to it.

302
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,360
Actually very difficult to get. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot of assumptions.

303
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,990
Yes. Like in, you know, risk assessment where you're trying to calculate these things.

304
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,130
This is always a piece that has a lot of uncertainty related to it, unless there's lots of, like, toxicology studies that.

305
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,400
All right. Does sampling. This is another type of stuff that I did a great deal of.

306
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,880
So there are multiple ways to do this. You can collect vacuum bags.

307
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:44,730
So if you're wanting to know a specific like household exposure, you can just ask for their use back in back.

308
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:54,590
However, there are lots of drawbacks to that because you don't know how long that bag has been in the vacuum where they've used it.

309
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,680
The only use it in one room. Maybe they lend it to their neighbor like.

310
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:06,960
So it's a little uncertain as to what exactly you're measuring when you collect the vacuum bag in that way.

311
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,620
Another way is to vacuum dust yourself into a specific sampling container.

312
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,270
And when you do that, you want to determine where you want a sample.

313
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:28,439
So what exposures are you interested in? So that can do you want to sample like the living room in, like on the furniture or, you know,

314
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:38,400
so that determining where you're sampling depends on your research question and the duration of sample collection time.

315
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:45,840
Like, do you want to just. Sam vacuum an entire room until you're done or do you want to because of flow rate matters,

316
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,840
like how much that's going to dictate how much you pick up? Do you want to just do it for like a ten minute period of time?

317
00:36:52,950 --> 00:37:07,370
And this is a friend of mine who is like sampling for our study where we had this a cellulose thimble that was inserted into the vacuum nozzle here.

318
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,710
And so the dust was going into this clean thimble, which you can see here.

319
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:22,380
This is what it looks like. And then we would open that up so that once you have the dust, how do you process it?

320
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,000
You have to measure the mass of the sample because anything you measure,

321
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,680
like any chemical that you're looking for, you want to know the concentration in the massive sample.

322
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:50,070
So you have to weigh it and typically sieve the dust samples because as I'm sure you know, dust is one.

323
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:57,480
It's gross. And there can be like big chunks of things in a vacuum sample.

324
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,000
So and you don't want to measure like chemicals in all of that, stuff like that.

325
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,750
Isn't that one that's not relevant to exposure necessarily, but also.

326
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,130
If you're interested in chemical partitioning like you want to get like what's in the shutdown.

327
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,990
And so you save the dust using either a handheld set, which is what we did.

328
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,320
I don't want to tell you how many hours I spent doing exactly that.

329
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,180
This is what I learned about podcast 30 years ago.

330
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,290
Or you could do this with this is a mechanical shaker.

331
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,840
So it's shaking these cells that have different pore size.

332
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:56,249
And so for size is important because depending on chemical properties and really how are chemicals getting into the environment,

333
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,890
it is going to attach to dust of a specific size.

334
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:11,940
And so by doing this you can separate the different purpose sizes and then analyze them separately to find where the chemical is is going.

335
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,280
So this gets at like the couch question, like,

336
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:28,830
is it volatile icing and then settling into the dust or is it being physically brushed off in larger chunks into the dust?

337
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,770
And so depending on what pathway it is or maybe it's both.

338
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:44,110
So depending what pathway. The chemicals getting out into the environment by it will show up in different particle sizes here.

339
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,710
So an sense. They were used vacuum bags and that made it even worse.

340
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:02,750
All kinds of stuff in there, like loose change, hair, weird stuff, turn up and you can see how that went through up here.

341
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:14,149
Yeah. Yeah. That would certainly support. Yes.

342
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:24,620
And we, we had a cabinet and like full gowned up with like masks and everything and it was a dirty job.

343
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,899
It. Yeah. So do you doctoral student or master's student.

344
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,030
And just get him some data and say, here, look, I have a freezer full of backpacks.

345
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,230
You should not tell them now. Yeah. All right.

346
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,520
So why does why do chemicals and dust matter like.

347
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,370
We don't think of ourselves as being covered in dust or with huge exposure to dust.

348
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,660
However, as I mentioned before, there is a great deal of incidental ingestion of dust.

349
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,040
So again, chemicals can reach out of items or partition to, you know, surface dust or films.

350
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,090
And as we touch containment surfaces,

351
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:18,570
we're transferring dust and chemicals to our hands and then we touch our food or our mouth again, ingesting chemicals.

352
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,250
Dermal absorption is also important with dust.

353
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:36,200
It depends on the integrity of your skin, the chemical and physical properties of the contaminant, concentration, duration and surface air contact.

354
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:43,190
So if you're so you're cleaning your house and you get, you know, dusty if you wash your hands.

355
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:53,950
That's you know, that's fine. If you don't wash your hands, then the chemicals have more time to rest and, like, absorbed into your skin.

356
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:00,040
So that can lead to higher exposure on your hands that you touch other parts of your skin.

357
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:16,099
Exactly. Exactly. So I don't think I mentioned it here, but in my doctoral work, we asked people questions about like different behaviors.

358
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,800
And one of them was, how often do you wash your hands?

359
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:31,280
And people who wash their hands thoroughly, the least had the highest levels of flame retardants in their blood.

360
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,589
And, you know, we also took hemorrhoids, which I'll talk about in a minute.

361
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:43,940
So. So washing your hands like it's not just COVID that we've been talking about, but it's also chemical exposures.

362
00:42:47,860 --> 00:43:01,830
All right. Heinrichs So a way to measure what we might be exposed to through dermal exposure, through hands is heinrichs,

363
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:07,910
and this might better reflect personal exposure compared to collecting dust from the floor.

364
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:17,210
So to collect a sample. When we did this, we took a piece of gauze, cleaned gauze, and put it in,

365
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:26,210
soaked it in isopropyl alcohol, and then wiped person's hands, front and backs.

366
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,090
And then you report out the massive chemical per wipe.

367
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:41,780
Um, we did actually also measure people's hands, and there's a UN exposure handbook.

368
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:50,600
I think there's like an average surface area for hands. And so we use that to try to calculate a concentration per surface area.

369
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:58,310
And that essentially did the exact same thing as we had the same findings as we did when we looked at mass per way.

370
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,620
But I think there are slightly different ways to do this. You can use different solvents, but this is a pretty typical way of collecting hand wipes.

371
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:17,200
And we did find that chemicals in the hand went through correlated with concentrations in the house dust as well as with biomarkers.

372
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:23,690
Um. Yeah.

373
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:31,519
And I think this has been done repeatedly with other chemicals over and over again.

374
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:40,460
So I think this, like candidates are a good measure of a personal exposure can be, you know, it's worth as much whether there's causality here.

375
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,800
It's not like the blood is causing this to be on the hands of the person.

376
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:54,049
Well, see, that is actually something that we talked quite a bit about,

377
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,860
because I don't know if you've ever actually put isopropyl alcohol on your hands,

378
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,340
but it really dries your hands out like it leaves them feeling really weird.

379
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:12,610
So is it actually drying out like the interstitial fluids, you know, from the surface of your hand into the way?

380
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:18,350
But I would imagine that that would be fairly small in comparison to what is actually on your, on your hands.

381
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:26,850
Um. So yeah, but I think it's definitely less likely to be reverse causation rather than.

382
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:32,400
So if you're doing an exposé or something you know I think through some this.

383
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:40,860
Yes. Right. You just usually use a hand sanitizer with aloe.

384
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,010
You know, and compare the you know, because that's marketed already commercially available.

385
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:55,440
Right. If you're concerned about the drying, the skin is causing you to be more susceptible to chemical or biological.

386
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,350
Yeah. Invasion, quote, unquote. Right.

387
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:08,910
Because you're saying that the solvent in the hand sanitizer would would draw it out or that they the idea that the alcohol dries out your hand.

388
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,770
And is that eating it with alcohol? Yeah. But dry skin, more cracks.

389
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,370
More cracks, more prone to invasion by chemicals and biologics.

390
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:23,640
I think what we're getting at is because we're using the alcohol as a solvent to draw out the chemicals.

391
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,420
And so we're doing this for wanting it to draw out the chemicals. It's on the surface.

392
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,980
But it could be going deeper.

393
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:38,640
Oh, it could be the alcohol could be getting deeper into your skin and trying out anything that might be in like the top layers of your skin.

394
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,350
When you say anything, you mean anything. Bad chemicals.

395
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,580
Is that a good thing then? That's what we wanted to do. But then you were.

396
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,110
We're using as a as a way to characterize exposure.

397
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:58,980
Yeah. So if we want to know what's on the surface of your hands as a measure of your smoke exposure.

398
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:07,930
Um. Maybe you're also getting the added things that aren't related to bad exposure for the previous exposure.

399
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:16,180
Exactly. Exactly. So outside of a functional into a we're doing a study and that's why we need that.

400
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,680
Okay. Right. Dysfunctional. That's that's a good thing. Right.

401
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,139
Exactly. Yeah. Like if you if you're trying to get rid of chemicals, sure.

402
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,150
That's a good way to do it. I think there are probably better ways of going about it, but alcohol.

403
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,340
Bad feelings? Yeah. Like, sometimes the treatment's worse than that.

404
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:43,000
But, yeah. No, I see your point, but I think it's a matter of like. Like what is the purpose of what you're doing?

405
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,620
Like, if you're wanting to get the best assessment of exposure, then.

406
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,600
Okay. And this.

407
00:47:53,770 --> 00:48:01,120
I've never used this, but in looking around at different types of sampling,

408
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,449
I found the Microneedle patch where it's kind of getting at the same thing.

409
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:15,280
So it's not a sort of wipe, but it is purposefully sitting on your skin.

410
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,780
But it uses a mild suction to sample the interstitial fluid from the skin.

411
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,700
So the thought is this is similar to plasma.

412
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:37,730
So it's a noninvasive way to measure chemicals in the blood, but it could also potentially get dermal exposure.

413
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,790
So this time you're trying to get the interstitial fluid and not the the stuff on the surface.

414
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,330
So I don't know anybody who has used this or have you heard anything and seen this presented by.

415
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:59,490
So actually. It says minimally invasive.

416
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,180
I know I do. I don't think so.

417
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,280
I think they want to make. Yeah, exactly.

418
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:15,180
That's what I'm trying to back. Maybe those are I don't I don't know.

419
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:20,410
But it's an interesting concept. Volunteers. Yeah.

420
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:22,800
All right.

421
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:40,410
Surface weights are similar to hand weights in that again, we use isopropyl alcohol and then we use the wipe to collect dusted or films on surfaces.

422
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:47,519
So this, it's not measuring was directly on her hands, but it could still be more relevant than this.

423
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,120
On the floor could also sample like tabletops, toys, desks.

424
00:49:52,120 --> 00:50:00,420
So where people like high touch areas where people could be potentially getting exposed, uh, frequently.

425
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:13,450
However, in trying to calculate exposure, I get our average daily dose how often people touch specific surfaces.

426
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:21,250
That's really hard to gauge, so it's difficult to determine an actual dose in using a surface wipe.

427
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,290
So I think it depends on the situation, whether this would be an appropriate way to go.

428
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:30,400
I also know, like in some places you measure it,

429
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:39,969
it makes sense to measure like highly utilized areas where in other situations you can use like the shelf,

430
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,920
like the dust on the shelf that no one ever sees.

431
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:49,450
So you can get more of a picture of like what has been in the air and floating around in a room over a longer period of time.

432
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:56,320
But again, that is it's really hard to measure exact to figure out exactly what that means.

433
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,070
It's a matter of context and what the goals of the assessment.

434
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,750
So if your goal is to get a or various relative pathways of exposure, it's important to get various high touch surfaces.

435
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,350
Where I've seen this alternatively used is instead of,

436
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:19,000
you know that big back you approach just taking on top of a doorjamb something that's dust has been there a really long time.

437
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:26,980
And that is like for an epidemiologist that would give you an exposure estimate for the household for a given lot of time.

438
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,649
That seems pretty. Yeah. But like I said, it's based on context.

439
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:38,460
So if you have a study with, you know, 50,000 people and that's the well well, you don't have resources to do that.

440
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:45,600
Maybe that's okay. But if you're trying to actually you've told. Very different.

441
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:54,320
So goals. All right.

442
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:03,590
Let's switch gears a little bit before we do that, as you may have any questions about the dust and ice.

443
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:08,340
Service points. I mean, those. All right.

444
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,970
Whatever the thing you're what? I'm gonna look at this study. Okay.

445
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:20,000
All right. Well, so I guess do.

446
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,580
Do you have any here those micro dermal patches?

447
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,629
No. No blood on their hands.

448
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,940
I will actually credit.

449
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,540
Yeah, I'm on speaker. There's my.

450
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,430
Yeah, I was going to say, I'm like kind of like a conflict of interest.

451
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:47,309
I will say when I was also when I was a doctoral student,

452
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:56,640
I also worked on a study of looking at exposure to jet fuel among Air Force, um, people in the Air Force.

453
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,690
And we took a lot of different samples, one of which was the dermal sample.

454
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:10,890
And how they did it, it was, I don't know if it was a special kind of tape or what, but you took one piece of tape would take off like one level.

455
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:19,720
And then like I think we had to do it three times to get like, what was the jet fuel concentration like in sort of part of their skin?

456
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:28,780
Yeah. Yeah. But it, you know, it doesn't hurt because it's layers of skin that we don't even really think about here.

457
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,250
Okay. Yeah. I don't think we were actually taking.

458
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,370
Well, this was a long time ago, so. Huh.

459
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:48,650
Um, but, yeah, so we were actually taking, like, skin cells, essentially to measure, like, jet fuel, trying to get at dermal exposure to you.

460
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,500
That's another kind of low tech way of sampling.

461
00:53:56,410 --> 00:54:06,910
All right. So drinking water. There are different ways you can collect water samples for testing chemicals in the water.

462
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:14,500
So the best method depends really on what your research question is and what you want to measure.

463
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:20,860
So, for example, you can collect water from different sources.

464
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,140
You can collect groundwater,

465
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:31,090
water from a water treatment plant like that's exiting a water treatment plant to gauge how well the treatment is working.

466
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:41,170
Or from a household tap. So for tap samples, which is again, my work, what we deal with most often.

467
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,240
But again, that's not that often. There are a couple of different ways you can do it there.

468
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:53,950
You can do it first, draw a sample. So where you collect the first water out of the faucet after at least 8 hours of no use.

469
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:00,070
So what this is getting at is if water's sitting in your system,

470
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:08,229
in your house and you turn it on, like what is getting into the water based on that inactivity,

471
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:16,630
like sitting in your case, a flush sample is when you run the faucet for 30 seconds to several minutes prior to sampling.

472
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:22,149
And so what this is getting, it's flushing out everything that's in your system and really getting at what

473
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:29,500
is in the water from the whatever public water source or public water like.

474
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:38,600
Pipes like what is in the water from that. So those are really like the two types of tap water samples that you can collect.

475
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:49,130
And it depends on what your research question is. I think there's something else I wanted to say here, but I don't remember.

476
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,840
It will connect to. All right.

477
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,290
So there are many factors to think about when you're estimating exposure through drinking water.

478
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,810
You want to know whether people are actually drinking tap water or whether they're drinking bottled water.

479
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:14,100
If they're drinking their tap water, do they typically filter it like certain people have a britta or whatever,

480
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:21,870
you know, filter in the refrigerator that that that's the only thing that they drink from in their home or do they not?

481
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:29,730
Is water typically stored after coming out of the tap? And if so, what type of container is it stored in?

482
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:35,670
So for example is like the brighter the product in Boston.

483
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:44,220
Oh yes, we lose hours in some places and we just put them at the end.

484
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,820
But yes, so the Britta, you know, there's a filter, but it's often a plastic container.

485
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,850
So that's like a small scale version of, you know, this question, like where is water typically stored?

486
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:08,010
Also works in Mexico City with a group of people looking at water in a lot of different ways.

487
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:17,040
And so I worked with environmental engineers and anthropologists really to kind of look at like how people in Mexico City use water.

488
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:30,030
And what they found is the biggest issue with people trusting their water was not necessarily the quality of the water coming out of the tap,

489
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:35,250
but the fact that their water was only intermittently available.

490
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:42,150
So when it is available, they have to stock up and store it in like these massive containers.

491
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:52,409
And so after water sitting in these different types of containers, so it can be like a cistern like this below ground or what it's called a taco,

492
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:59,370
which is like it's on top of a building and it's like this plastic rubber type thing that all the houses have them.

493
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:08,020
So after sitting in that, like how? Is that water still water that you would want to drink?

494
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:17,370
And so thinking about that. Thinking about estimating exposure through drinking water.

495
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,490
These are all questions that you need to like.

496
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:28,890
You need to understand the finer details to really get at like how people are exposed to water.

497
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,390
Either, like are they drinking or are they not like, why are they drinking it?

498
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Why are they so cultural? Yes.

499
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,680
Yes. Is tap water used for cooking, showering?

500
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:49,190
Showering. There's like a whole different type of exposure through showering with because it's so hot.

501
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:56,030
It inhalation becomes a an issue with tap water containers in that way.

502
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:10,970
Right. And. Have you ever heard of cases where the filter itself is contaminating the water more than it's purifying?

503
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,180
Not heard specifically about that.

504
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:26,040
But I do know in some of the studies we've looked at some we've looked at predictors of different exposures within like our birth cohorts.

505
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,600
And we asked questions like, do you drink tap water, drink bottled water to use a filter?

506
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:34,530
And sometimes when people who say they use a filter, they do actually have higher exposure,

507
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:40,710
like higher levels of certain contaminants, whether that's actually due to the filter or not.

508
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:46,290
I mean, I don't know. But we always recommend using a certified one.

509
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,919
So NSF international efforts, me right here based in Ann Arbor.

510
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,750
And they said, well, NSF, they want to see like grocery bags and water filters,

511
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,680
but that that sort of process is supposed to prevent that from happening.

512
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:07,140
But with that said, you know, if anyone else is on right now, for example, and order something that's not set, I don't know if they say it's a filter.

513
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,460
If it's not certified, it could be you don't know what it is.

514
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:17,050
So so that's important. What type of filter, how well it's been tested.

515
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:25,960
Birth control over where. Where's it all? I'm just like, baseline, like adjusted by how much water they drink in a day.

516
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:33,100
Because I can imagine people who are adamant about their filter about it will drink

517
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,150
more water in the day than somebody who drinks kind of like a plastic water bottle.

518
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,409
Uh, no, because we don't collect that level, and it's like, no, that's a good question.

519
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,610
And it is, yeah. Next time when we talk about surrogates.

520
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:53,649
So combining this sort of information stuff, you get questionnaires is very important.

521
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:59,920
So, you know, we try to go to the extent we can, but it gets really complicated because every day it's different.

522
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:08,060
Right. And things change over time. So like there are a lot of people switched to bottled water after the hurricanes.

523
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,380
And so we have to kind of trace back, you know, when did that happen?

524
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,280
How much what proportion of their water intake is changes in all of it?

525
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:23,060
So it does get pretty complicated. Yeah, I was actually just going to mention that.

526
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,729
I bet it's so in in Puerto Rico.

527
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:33,110
Like we've been looking at exposures like before and after Hurricane Maria.

528
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:41,270
And some of the engineers that we've worked with have found like higher levels of all sorts of metals in the tap water.

529
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:49,310
But when we look at in the biomarkers of exposure, a lot of the metals have actually gone down in the people.

530
01:01:50,090 --> 01:02:00,770
And it's because before the hurricane, I think this is my hypothesis that before the hurricane, I think over 50% of people were drinking tap water.

531
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:08,750
Whereas now in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, like for the first at least the first six months, people are drinking bottled water.

532
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,170
So, yes, it's higher in the tap water, but nobody's drinking it.

533
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:17,380
So. Know, important questions to.

534
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,730
When you're looking at exposure, like just because something's there doesn't mean people are exposed.

535
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,640
Oh, no, of course. There's the temperature of the water.

536
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,860
Affect how much is absorbed dermal here? Ten years of dermal.

537
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:41,340
Oh, yes. If, for example, someone in like a sauna back versus the cold plunges that people are doing now.

538
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:46,680
I have no idea. That's a good question. Do you know if temperature matters as far as dermal absorption?

539
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:52,010
Okay. You know, the skin is warmer than before.

540
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:58,670
Yeah. So, you know, it's but you usually don't see data to that that you really.

541
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,049
Yeah. I think in the world of like exposure assessment and risk assessment,

542
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:12,910
there's just in order to really characterize things like really, really well, there's just so many things that we don't know.

543
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,140
So there's always a uncertainty, but, you know, that's okay.

544
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:21,500
We can get within the ballpark and understand the question.

545
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,860
All right. All right.

546
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,230
So we're going on the soil.

547
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:41,800
But people can be exposed to continued soil, near residences and schools, and so more naturally occurring, such as asbestos.

548
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,550
Some can be human made there due to current or past land use.

549
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:56,920
For example, pesticides, heavy metals, blood led can be in soil and stick around for a very long time.

550
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,560
They engineer roadways can be continued with patches as well as nearby industry.

551
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,960
So the president's time is sort of depends on properties of the contaminant and of the soil.

552
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:19,880
So I think a big takeaway for this is if you're going to plant food, that plant things that you're going to eat,

553
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:25,469
it is very important to test the soil beforehand because a lot of plants can take up contaminants from the soil.

554
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:29,730
And you don't want to then be eating that if it's if it's heavily continued.

555
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,399
And when I lived in Boston, this was a big deal because I think there are a lot of urban gardens that were just coming about.

556
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:43,050
And so the School of Public Health there worked a lot with communities to make sure that the soil was.

557
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,410
To sample? Well, there are a few different types.

558
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:57,430
You can take samples, which is what this is. I can just use a trowel and dig up some soil.

559
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,620
Or you can do a composite,

560
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:10,630
which is where you take a few different samples and mix them together to get a kind of an average level of per for the area.

561
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:21,210
So to. These are different examples of how you can come up with this sampling plan.

562
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:27,270
So you need to know the area that you need to sample as well as the depth that you need to sample to,

563
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:31,320
which can depend on the reasons why you're there,

564
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:40,170
but what and what contaminant you you're looking for if there's something specific or if you're just looking for any sort of contamination.

565
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,139
And so I'm not going to go through these different types,

566
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:51,210
but it's really just looking at like random sampling or whether you think there pinpoint like specific areas where you are expecting contamination.

567
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:02,010
So hopefully panel which group here in the Senate supports about? What's the project?

568
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:09,620
Is there sampling going on? Not all methods are going to be applicable to all spirits.

569
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:23,900
All right. So to estimate the dose of a chemical through ingestion of water, soil or dust, this is the.

570
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:35,440
Equation. So the absorbed dose is the volume ingested, which is unknown.

571
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,870
Do you know how much dirt you eat per day? The concentration of the contaminant.

572
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,050
And again, bioavailable bioavailability.

573
01:06:44,920 --> 01:07:00,790
So I think it is like shocking how much research has been done on the amount of soil and dust kids eat to come up with these estimates.

574
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:12,730
And this is this number is particularly important in risk assessment and thinking about how much kids are exposed to a bunch of different chemicals.

575
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:21,780
But it's really hard to know, like how much soil does a kidney? And so it can range quite a bit.

576
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:30,030
So this is just an example. And for adults, who is this ten?

577
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:36,200
I don't know what the units are here. Right.

578
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,930
Okay. Yeah.

579
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:52,700
So ten mil, definitely. But I think the upward four percentile of like, kids, it can be like up to 90 milligrams per day.

580
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:02,250
All right. One, I think this is one less measure.

581
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:07,500
Way to measure personal exposure is the silicone wristbands.

582
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:12,000
And so this it I don't know. It's been around for maybe ten years.

583
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,810
So how do chemical measurements in these wrist bands relate to personal exposure?

584
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,870
When these first came out, everyone was very excited.

585
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:31,180
You know, you can just measure everything in this one wristband that people you wear for like a week and then we can get measurements and everything.

586
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:41,920
However, we don't really know the sources, pathways and timing of exposure if someone is wearing something for a week.

587
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:51,670
But this study, The Hill, did see that the wrist bands,

588
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:59,140
chemicals in the wrist bands were correlated with levels in of urinary biomarkers as well as hemorrhoids.

589
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:09,400
So it's an interesting way to measure personal exposure from all sorts of different sources.

590
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,340
What sorts of motion capture? We're proud.

591
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:27,260
Yeah. Talk to me. And what source won't the wristband capture?

592
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:32,490
Yeah. So it's being sold as a, you know, a comprehensive monitor.

593
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:41,300
Maybe be was. Dietary.

594
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:48,900
It's like that kind of person. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:53,520
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

596
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:59,370
So, yeah, I think that's it. So any question?

597
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:13,509
Either of you and I recommendations on buying household products that don't have these million chemicals in them.

598
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:20,350
Because now I feel I mean, I've always felt panicky about it, but after those first few slides, it's resurfaced.

599
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:25,840
Um, well, everything first of all, don't panic.

600
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,200
You know what? You know, there's like, risks everywhere.

601
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:37,750
Like, so I think they're like a certification or anything. And there are some certifications.

602
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:45,790
Um, and I can, there's some furniture and there's been a lot more demand for it, especially institutionally.

603
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:52,960
So you can see more readily, you know, things are, I mean, people market things is growing at a time when, you know.

604
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,610
But there are, I think, certification programs if you're really careful.

605
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:05,140
But those tend to be the higher end. You know, but maybe by, you know, regular priced things.

606
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:12,600
No, you know, they might say free, but that might be, you know, 50.

607
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:19,150
So it's tough. Are you talking about personal care products or like furniture?

608
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:26,530
Yeah. Furniture. They will usually say, like a company will usually say it's like flame retardant free or.

609
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:32,800
Okay. And there are. There are different things you can.

610
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:41,750
Like formaldehyde is a lot of that, Crestwood. So if you buy something that's actual wood is going to be way more expensive, but it takes it out.

611
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:46,550
And then there's certain brands of that that use other chemicals.

612
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,540
But again, trying to trace that to the, you know, the vacuum on a chair like this.

613
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:57,760
Yeah, right. You do. You know, it's like the formaldehyde used in those pressed wood products.

614
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:05,380
Is there, like, significant off gassing in the first set period of time and then it's a little safer after a while?

615
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:18,280
It does. It does decline. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, but usually there are certifications and there's one that I will think of and let you know that is cool.

616
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:24,550
But yeah, companies will usually say because when we're looking around for new a new kind of thing, that was something we certainly pay attention to.

617
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,639
And there's word history. If you remember the documentary I mentioned, Flame Retardants,

618
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:36,850
a famous poster that talks about how they got a law passed in California that had more flame retardants.

619
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:41,499
Yeah. And everything, which is great. Yeah.

620
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:53,420
So if you like we if you if a chair or furniture says that it meets the California guidelines, that's actually a better that's actually about right.

621
01:12:53,440 --> 01:13:00,510
You want to look at the furniture that does not meet those through a whole bunch of lobbying and some like pseudoscience things they set up.

622
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,410
It's just that it's a crazy story. It has a lot of parallels to the tech.

623
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:15,950
All right. Thank you very. All right.

624
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:27,490
So Tuesday, same time on Zoom and P.S. Yeah, I'll see if that works as well.
