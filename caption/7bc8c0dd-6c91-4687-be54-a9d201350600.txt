1
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:09,603
Now that we've learned the amazing
ability of cells to organize and

2
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:15,070
address specific functions, let's
learn more about the cells themselves.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,030
Most cells have three specific parts,
the plasma membrane, the nucleus and

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,930
the cytoplasm.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,430
Let's start by taking a look
at the plasma membrane.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,520
The plasma membrane provides a barrier for
the cell to the outside environment.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,290
It is the gatekeeper of the cell,
and all movement of molecules,

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,620
in and out of the cell,
is controlled through the structure and

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,550
function of the plasma membrane.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,370
Plasma membranes are bilayers, meaning
it is a two-layered membrane, actually.

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,190
And it is made up of liquid and
carbohydrates and proteins.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,130
In this cartoon here
that you're looking at,

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,480
we see the bilayers structure
of the plasma membrane.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,180
It is constructed by the organization
of things called phospholipids.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,577
Phospholipids have two parts,
they have a hydrophilic,

16
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:11,580
or water-loving, polar head at the top and
a fatty acid tail.

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,480
That fatty acid tail is hydrophobic,
or water-fearing.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,340
So the plasma membrane organizes
itself by having those polar heads

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,900
on the outside and
inside of the plasma membrane.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,120
This organization makes the plasma
membrane semipermeable.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,860
Semipermeable means that some
molecules can easily and

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,010
readily move across the membrane,
but others cannot.

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,430
They're not able to get across.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,860
Sometimes those molecules need
to cross the plasma membrane.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,920
And so there are proteins embedded in that
membrane that can help facilitate their

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,220
passage.

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,780
There's several different types of
proteins that can help molecules pass

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,660
through the membrane, including
integral proteins and channel proteins.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,100
The next feature of cells that we're going
to review is called the cell nucleus.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,650
The nucleus is the control center or
the headquarters for the cell.

31
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,950
And it's the storage center where all of
the cell's genetic material, called DNA,

32
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,930
is stored.

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,070
Through the information that is encoded on
the cell's DNA the cell can synthesize,

34
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,460
which means produce,
specific proteins or cellular products.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,380
These cellular products help tell us
something about the function of that cell.

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,380
For example, beta cells that are located
in our pancreas produce insulin.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,510
And that cell type, then,

38
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,970
has a major function in the endocrine
system through the regulation of blood

39
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,990
glucose levels through the product of
insulin that it produces and secretes.

40
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,600
So far, we've learned that the cell is
surrounded by a plasma membrane which

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,950
serves as a protective
gatekeeper to the cell.

42
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,020
The cell has a nucleus,
where it's a control center and

43
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,760
we keep the storage of DNA.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
Now the interior area of the cell
is now occupied by the nucleus,

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
it's called the cytoplasm.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,240
Within the cytoplasm, organelles,

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,410
which are other structures, are dispersed
within something called the cytosol.

48
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,370
The cytosol is kind of a gel-like
consistency, and it provides shape to

49
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,940
the cell, an organizational structure for
those organelles.

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,140
And the cytosol can also
help with cellular movement.

51
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,190
The organelles of a cell are responsible
for specific jobs within that cell.

52
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,240
In total, if we look at the organelles,

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,140
they take up about a half of the space
within the cytoplasm of the cell.

54
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,050
So here on this picture,
we see specific organelles in these cells.

55
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,060
Almost all cells include at
least this set of organelles.

56
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,700
Some certain cell types may be
more specialized than this.

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,980
But these organelles
are largely universal and

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,210
help tell us something
about the way cells work.

59
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,790
So let's go through each one briefly.

60
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,140
First we see this complex network of tubes
and channels surrounding the nucleus.

61
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,410
And they're shown in purplish-blue color.

62
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,880
This is called the endoplasmic reticulum,
or the.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,890
There's a rough and smooth.

64
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,880
And the rough Is responsible for
making and secreting proteins of the cell

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,370
using that genetic code and
information from the nucleus.

66
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,850
The smooth Helps with the transport of
those materials outside of the cell then.

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,050
The Golgi complex, which is sometimes
called the Golgi apparatus,

68
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,490
is shown here in a pinkish color.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,280
The Golgi complex is the area where
substances go after being produced or

70
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,760
secreted by the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,470
The Golgi is important, because it's
where those substances go to mature and

72
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,590
are prepared and packaged.

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,900
So that they can moved out of the cells,
so

74
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,280
they can through the plasma membrane and
be used by the rest of our body.

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,140
The mitochondria of the cell, shown
here in a orange-ish yellow color, and

76
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,040
kinda shaped like a bean,

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,468
these are the organelles that
are the power plants of the cell.

78
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,995
They're the place where
energy from nutrients

79
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:04,050
that we take in from dietary sources is
made and converted into a usable form.

80
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,081
We see here two organelles,
the peroxisome and a lysosome.

81
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:10,904
They're really important,
cuz they have a role in detoxification and

82
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,350
digestion of cellular waste.

83
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,630
Both are helpful in keeping
our cells healthy, so

84
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,240
that they're not damaged by toxins or
waste products.

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,020
In this session, we've learned about cells
as the basic building blocks of life.

86
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,010
This means that cells are the smallest
living things, but also the foundation

87
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,000
of our body, of our tissues, organs and
systems that work to keep us healthy.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,510
Cells are complex in structure and
function.

89
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,170
And include a plasma membrane,
which works as a gatekeeper of the cell,

90
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,030
a nucleus to provide that genetic code
that is needed to make proteins and

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,610
help with cellular reproduction.

92
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,330
And also other organelles, a variety
of other organelles, which serve and

93
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,550
have varied roles to help
maintain the function and

94
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,596
structure, as well as
the health of that cell.
