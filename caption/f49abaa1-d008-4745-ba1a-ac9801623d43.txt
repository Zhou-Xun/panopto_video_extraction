1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,290
Hello everyone. Welcome
back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,375
The human body is miraculous.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,945
We are made up of about
30 trillion cells.

4
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,890
There are about 240 different
cell types and each one,

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,195
except our red blood cells has
the exact same DNA inside.

6
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,180
So one of the big questions,

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,334
we talk about epigenetic changes,

8
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:34,955
where are those changes
happening and how do we know?

9
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:37,400
The first of two
learning objectives in

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,180
this epigenome module include
understanding how big and

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,120
complex the epigenome
is and how it is

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,605
not the same from cell
to cell, like genetics.

13
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:51,725
Second, know that some cells
are more accessible than

14
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,810
others and delineate how

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,630
epigenetics is measured
in animal models,

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,515
cell lines, versus people.

17
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:03,290
I want to begin back in 1953 when

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,790
the DNA double helix made

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,965
its debut on the cover of Nature.

20
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,920
By the way, this is when

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,920
the University of Michigan
was already a 136 years old.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,780
The elucidation of the DNA
double helix by Watson and

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,310
Crick paved the way for

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,530
the eventual Human
Genome Project,

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,930
which identified and
located the some

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,830
20,000 genes that determine
much of the way we look,

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,860
live, grow, and whether we
get sick or remain healthy.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,705
But the Human Genome Project
didn't tell the whole story.

29
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:37,510
It fell short of identifying
the instruction book

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,705
that tells all those thousands
of genes when to turn on,

31
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,040
how much to turn on,

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,395
and how to react to various
outside influences.

33
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:48,750
All of that is the
job of the epigenome.

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,215
To help with the genome
in a genetic context,

35
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,695
we will turn to the
Human Genome Project,

36
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:57,530
which was the great
public-private partnership

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,635
in the late 1990s
and early 2000s,

38
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:03,560
which ended up identifying
the alphabet of the

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,130
20,000 genes and
three billion bases.

40
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,830
If we laid this genetic
material end-to-end,

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,925
in fact, it would be about
two meters in length.

42
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,730
But cells are only 10-100
micrometers in length,

43
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,330
so they have a packaging problem.

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,440
The cells use a series of

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,660
tools shown on the
right that help

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,685
compact the DNA double helix

47
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,750
around histones and
into a nucleosome.

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,970
The histone tails have
modifications that

49
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,365
helped compact further
into 30-nanometer fibers.

50
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,370
Then, the fibers form loops and

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,985
condense into the mitotic
chromosome at the bottom.

52
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,430
The packaging of our DNA creates

53
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,780
both challenges and opportunities
for gene regulation.

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,630
Some of the challenges are,

55
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,020
now environmental factors during

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,330
development and
other stages of life

57
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,490
can impact epigenetic marks

58
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,360
in corresponding
chromatin configuration.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,800
But some of the
opportunities are,

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,900
unlike genetic mutations, which

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,290
are static and non-modifiable,

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,900
epigenetic changes are
dynamic and potentially

63
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,630
modifiable which opens up
the areas for intervention.

64
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,190
I want to pause for
a moment to help

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,295
clarify the differences
between related terms.

66
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:22,775
This is epigenetics
versus epigenomics.

67
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:24,710
It actually largely follows

68
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,235
the distinction between
genetics and genomics.

69
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:31,100
Epigenetics is an
emerging frontier of

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,670
science that involves
the study of changes in

71
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,860
the regulation of
gene activity and

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,540
expression that are not

73
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,350
dependent on the gene
sequence itself.

74
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,660
Epigenetics can refer to
both heritable changes in

75
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,750
gene activity and
the expression of

76
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,230
these cells and also long-term

77
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,690
alterations in
transcriptional potential

78
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,425
of a cell that are not
necessarily heritable.

79
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,390
Well, epigenetics refers
to the studies of

80
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,210
single genes or sets of genes,

81
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,200
epigenomics refers to the
more genome-wide analysis of

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,210
all epigenetic changes across

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,945
the entire genome at one time.

84
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:15,275
But an interesting complexity
occurs with the epigenome.

85
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:17,810
While an individual
has one genome,

86
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,670
the hard drive of the body,

87
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,830
an individual can have hundreds

88
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,260
or even thousands of epigenome,

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,190
the software of the body.

90
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,765
The epigenome can vary
by cell and tissue type.

91
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:33,925
It can vary by age and
sex and disease state.

92
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:37,480
However, the genome and
the epigenome are linked.

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,145
Our genome contains
a lot of data,

94
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,005
the hardware in this example.

95
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:44,060
But the data just sit there until

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,680
the epigenomic software come

97
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,900
along and tell it
what to turn on,

98
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,910
how much to turn on,
and how to react to

99
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,935
various different
external stimuli.

100
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,399
We have covered some
basic characteristics

101
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,495
of the epigenome,

102
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,100
such as the complexity in

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,170
differentiation
from cell to cell.

104
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,200
Since epigenomic changes present

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,970
across the entire genome,

106
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,620
understanding their pattern is

107
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,900
extremely valuable, for example,

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,034
for cancer research,
medication development,

109
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,995
disease treatment,
and other things.

110
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:19,280
So here I want to introduce
the Human Epigenome Project,

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,099
which is a multinational
science project

112
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:25,025
with the stated aim
to identify, catalog,

113
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,235
and interpret genome-wide
DNA methylation patterns

114
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:31,740
of all genes in
all major tissues.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,575
You can see it's quite complex.

116
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:37,190
The outer ring of
this chart represents

117
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,644
35 million pairs of
bases in chromosome 22,

118
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,325
which is one of our smallest

119
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:45,715
autosomes in the human genome.

120
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,810
There are marks highlighting

121
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,190
areas of the epigenome that were

122
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,790
tested for different
levels of CpG methylation.

123
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,620
The bar charts indicate

124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,775
the average amount of
methylation that was found.

125
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:02,085
Each chart covers
100,000 base pairs.

126
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:04,520
You can begin to see
that there's a lot

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,650
of variation from
areas on the chart

128
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,990
which are zero percent methylated

129
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,230
to areas of the chart which
are variably methylated,

130
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,700
to finally, areas that are

131
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,690
completely or 100
percent methylated.

132
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,400
IHEC stands for

133
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,490
the International Human
Epigenome Consortium,

134
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,330
which is another multinational
epigenomic database

135
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,670
that aims to understand
the extent to

136
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,550
which the epigenome has
shaped human population

137
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,425
over generations and in
response to the environment.

138
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,760
We are not going to spend a
whole lot of time on this,

139
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,380
but please feel free

140
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,420
to research more if
you're interested in

141
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,545
learning more about the IHEC
projects and publications,

142
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,880
including their data portal
which is quite extensive.

143
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,115
So you may wonder why are
we spending so much time,

144
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:56,140
energy, and funding on
huge projects like these?

145
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,770
Well, it turns out there are

146
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,930
some new drugs in
probes that have been

147
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,760
developed based on
the information

148
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,400
collected from these
Human Epigenome Projects.

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,040
Many of these agents
are currently used in

150
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,485
first-line cancer treatment
and it is very promising.

151
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:14,360
The epigenetic and
epigenomics-focused technology will

152
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,805
be used in future drug discovery
and medical therapies.

153
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,130
As mentions before,
since the epigenome

154
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,580
refers to genome-wide analysis
of epigenetic changes,

155
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,920
it makes sense that they can also

156
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,745
be affected by their
early environments.

157
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:34,805
It turns out that many recent
studies have evaluated

158
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:38,209
epigenome-wide certain
environmental triggers

159
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,505
including prenatal nutrition,

160
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:44,555
maternal care,
exposure to toxicants,

161
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:48,325
and other pollutants,
including pesticides.

162
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:53,240
Similar to epigenetics, the
epigenome can be quantified,

163
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,030
and one popular technology
I'd like to introduce you

164
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,340
to is known as the BeadArray
microarray technology.

165
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,370
Currently, this technology is
only available for studying

166
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,410
the human epigenome while

167
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,680
other model species such as
mice are in development.

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,585
As shown on the figure,

169
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:14,510
the microarray
technology is based on

170
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,760
three microsilica beads that

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,110
self-assemble in microwells
on either of two substrates,

172
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,360
a fiber optic bundle or
a planar silica slide.

173
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,800
Each bead is covered with

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,110
hundreds of thousands
of copies of

175
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,960
a specific oligonucleotide
that acts to

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,275
capture sequences in
a given experiment.

177
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,800
So why is this so important?

178
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,320
Well, what is so cool is that
now we can not only look

179
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,515
at one or two epigenetic
regions at a time,

180
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:48,410
but we can query the
entire epigenome

181
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,195
for the effects of interest,

182
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,545
such as prenatal nutrition
or toxicant exposure.

183
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,020
This is really important

184
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,425
for epigenetic
epidemiology studies,

185
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:59,555
in which you want to
evaluate hundreds,

186
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:04,896
if not thousands of
individuals in one experiment.
