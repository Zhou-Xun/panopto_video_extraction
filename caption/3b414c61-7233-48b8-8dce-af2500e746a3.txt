1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:14,790
I was like, buzzing. He's like, I'm getting ready to move on my knee.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,290
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yeah.

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:38,010
So today we are going to do it. Listen, I just have a few announcements, and then I just want to show you one trick.

4
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,740
But it's a way to filter in the U.S. Census Bureau.

5
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,040
And then I'm going to stop here and then Liz and I are just going to go around and this is

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,340
an opportunity for you on the end of class to use this time to start gathering your data.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,910
You really have two weeks in your mind. You want to be thinking, I have two weeks to get the U.S. Census Bureau data, and after two weeks,

8
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,860
we're going to move on to health and nutrition, which will take you another two weeks and then just enough time to do your priorities.

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,390
Verbiage and you don't have to turn it in. Okay.

10
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,280
So so this is a good opportunity to get started.

11
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,110
So I'm going to turn it over to Liz and then I'll come back when we announce other announcements.

12
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,740
Hi, everyone can hear me. Okay. Awesome. And a good job on the food for thought assignments.

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,870
Everyone should be able to see your grades and your comments. Now, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me either.

14
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,890
I mean, today in class, if you want more by email or you see me around, happy to chat.

15
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,500
I know a lot of people chose the video on weight bias and so I just want to address that a little bit.

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,690
So the presenter of that video actually happens to be a little bit controversial in the debate by space.

17
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,459
And so that's no fault of your off. You wouldn't have known what I just want to address like a little misconception

18
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,250
that came up in a lot of the responses for people who chose that video.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:15,300
So advocating for weight loss for patients who are in higher bodies is still inherently weight bias because it's perpetuating a thin ideal, right?

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,840
You're telling a person there's something wrong with you that you need to change.

21
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,860
So I don't think that was quite encapsulated in the video.

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:31,469
And so I wanted to just let everyone know moving forward that the advocate for weight loss is still bias and that you

23
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:41,560
should be sort of shifting as a practitioner towards more that one of the things that has happened to chat about it.

24
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,900
Super passionate topic for me. I took weight bias last semester.

25
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,000
So yes, happy to chat about that to at any point. Yeah, that's all I am.

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay. And also just to piggyback on to what Liz, this thing about the food for thought assignment.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,770
So if any of you got a couple of points taken off question and you got feedback from listeners, you know,

28
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,760
suggestions on how you could improve your response, I want you to have the opportunity to do that.

29
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:27,960
I will give half credit back if you want to redo one of your responses or several responses to questions that you may have lost some points.

30
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,079
Okay. So again,

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:43,410
just redo the question that you might have lost points off and you can resubmit just that to Liz in an email and you can get 50% of the points back.

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,760
So it's just an opportunity to work on your depth of writing.

33
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,790
Okay. So if you did, I assume everyone saw the announcement.

34
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:10,950
But just to let you know Monday, Mark mILLAR Through the Gathers was going to be here to talk about local food policy and advocacy,

35
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,299
Markle's daycare center for her kids and of professional development that she didn't catch.

36
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,510
And so she's got to switch her presentation to the 19th.

37
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,230
So I'm going to actually present what I was supposed to present today,

38
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,810
which is SNAP our food assistance program, critical program in the United States.

39
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,460
We're going to cover that in class.

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,280
Originally, I was thinking I would record it, but I really want to talk, want to have that and have discussions about it in class.

41
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,629
We're going to cover that on Monday. And the topic that I was going to cover on the 19th,

42
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:53,430
which is getting you started on nutrition and health data collection as well as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm going to do that as a Panopto recording. In fact, it may be a recording from last year that I use that will get you started.

44
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,850
And then we have a whole series of guest presenters over the next two weeks or so.

45
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,219
Not all of them will take a whole hour,

46
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:21,210
so I will just grab nuggets of time at the end of those presentations to check in with you to get you started on the nutrition and health.

47
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:31,350
Okay. So we'll get through all those steps along the way and anything else I want to say about that.

48
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:41,580
You know, the only other thing I just want to point out what you're going to be doing over the next month is gathering data.

49
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,250
And then once you gather the actual raw data, then you need to plug it into tables and figures.

50
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,850
This is especially true for the U.S. Census Bureau data.

51
00:05:51,210 --> 00:06:00,840
Actually, when you get to nutrition and health data, a lot of that data, you can actually take screenshots because often times,

52
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,810
especially in state of Michigan, health data and mortality, morbidity and not so much morbidity and mortality.

53
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,330
Sorry in table. So you can just do a screenshot.

54
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:19,709
But the point is, is that it's important to break up the steps so that you're utilizing your time wisely.

55
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,620
So for over the next two weeks, while you're gathering your U.S. Census Bureau data, which is raw and you need to put it in tables and figures,

56
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,190
you use the half hour, 45 minutes extra that you might have in a day, which you probably are thinking that's I don't have any eggs.

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:46,920
I usually we can carve out a half hour if you have the raw data for, let's say, education attainment, use that half hour to create a table.

58
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:58,400
Right. There's a number of smaller steps that are required for gathering and presenting this information.

59
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:06,860
So use your time wisely. Break it up into small chunks so that you're not having to spend two whole days trying to and being,

60
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,410
you know, sometimes you have difficulty finding it sometimes.

61
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,270
The U.S. Census Bureau acts a little wonky and you're having trouble.

62
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,850
You're not sort of getting the panic mode of like, oh, my gosh, I've got too much to do.

63
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,329
So use your time wisely over the next month and use those half hour, 45 minute nuggets to work on,

64
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,140
writing some, you know, writing it up or getting it into a table or from here.

65
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,360
Okay. So. All right.

66
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:46,120
And, you know, so the reason for me bringing that up, other than an easy way out of your approach is one, I can't give you any extensions.

67
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,510
This assignment is due November 7th.

68
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:58,160
I can't give you guys extensions because the next step is going to require you another month or so to to work through.

69
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,850
So that's why I'm saying be very careful to pace yourself.

70
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,630
And if you find yourself stuck or having trouble finding data, do not wait a whole week.

71
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,190
Grab me. Reach out to Liz. We're here to help you.

72
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay. So and I've had students say, oh, my gosh, it was two weeks after the U.S. Census Bureau.

73
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,000
I did nothing with the U.S. Census Bureau, and I was embarrassed to come to you.

74
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,330
Do not be embarrassed. It happens. Come to me so that I can help you get on track.

75
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,290
Okay. So. All right, enough about that.

76
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:45,620
Let me just show you very quickly how to maximize your data here in terms of.

77
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,450
So for some of your data indicators, you need to present it by city.

78
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,560
And you need a comparison so you can either do it by the county or state.

79
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:09,010
Most needs assessments do it at minimum whatever township or city, and then compare it to state data.

80
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,880
Now, if it's a very comprehensive needs assessment, they'll include city, county and state data.

81
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,040
But for your purposes, I don't want you to have to do that extra step.

82
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,290
So just one more comparison.

83
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:29,830
If you're doing city than either do county or state, I recommend state, but you aren't going to get dinged if you do county.

84
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,210
Okay. So I want to show you how you can do that. Some of you may have already discovered it.

85
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:44,820
So I typed in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and I want to circle back to the difference between township and city.

86
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,660
Somebody remind me, but I don't want to lose track of what I'm doing here, so just have me circle back.

87
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,660
So we're going to go into the demographic section here,

88
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:05,380
and this is where you will be able to collect data on the age breakdown of the population of Ypsilanti.

89
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,020
But I wanted to show you, you can also include the data for the state of Michigan.

90
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,970
Now, in this case, you guys don't need to do the state of Michigan as well as the comparison your population data.

91
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,030
You don't need a comparison group to be able to do something else.

92
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,110
Let's go to race ethnicity.

93
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:37,120
If you wanted to compare the percentage of race and ethnicity breakdown in Ypsi to the state of Michigan,

94
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:46,630
all you do is you go up to Geo and scroll down here and it has.

95
00:10:49,720 --> 00:11:00,490
These filters. And so you select I'm going to select state and you can see this here, but you just scroll down and check Michigan.

96
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,810
Michigan there you can't see it, but it's been checked.

97
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,719
So now I have data for both Michigan.

98
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,150
And then if I take my bar at the bottom and scroll over and I also have data for Ypsi.

99
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,850
So can you show me about Michigan? Yeah.

100
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,070
So you have as tab appears as geo geography.

101
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,400
So just selected. Hang on.

102
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:46,540
I got to go back to. The Army had it selected and so select the geography.

103
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,430
You'll have options for what you want to select.

104
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,650
I'm going to select State. You can select county.

105
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,799
This is just going to end up bringing out data specific to whatever I'm selecting.

106
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,490
So I'm going to say state, like state.

107
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,440
And then you have to scroll down and there's a menu here of all states in the U.S.

108
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,690
Scrolling down to find Michigan. So I check it. But it's not shown in there.

109
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:25,930
But it's been checked. And you can tell is now I have demographic data for both the state of Michigan and Ypsilanti

110
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,340
and that's I'm going to use Michigan is my comparison population and so that's really handy.

111
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,739
You also do not need to include margin of error. So if you want to get rid of that column,

112
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:49,300
just select margin of error and that drops it so you have less columns of information that you're not going to use.

113
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,050
I also wanted to point out a few select notes. It will like, for example, if I select.

114
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:12,080
Ice. And there's any note, I guess it's actually just the whole tape, the whole data component to this survey.

115
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:23,120
It provides information. The nice thing about notes is it also explains why there's sometimes an X or an N in the column.

116
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,780
And that simply means that there's just insufficient data.

117
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,460
So that note is useful. Okay.

118
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:45,870
That's all I really needed to show you. At this point.

119
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:58,020
I'm going to just close Panopto and we're going to spend the rest of the class with you starting to, you know, pull up your data.

120
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:07,710
You can download it or just take screenshots and put it into like a working paper or not paper of a document.

121
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,330
And then again, if you have a half hour, 45 minutes later in the day, you can create a table for that raw data.

122
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:25,650
And Liz and I can come around and help you. There are two examples of a needs assessment done by students from last year under course resources.

123
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,509
That's a really useful document, both of them for what could a table look like?

124
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:41,969
What kind of figure look like? So that's a great way when you start taking your raw data and creating the tables and figures.

125
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:50,500
This is nice examples and any questions in general that anybody has been great.

126
00:14:51,330 --> 00:15:00,230
So do. Adams is due next week based on the science.

127
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:16,410
Thank you for reminding me. So next Friday on the 14th, you have an opportunity to submit a draft of your demographic and economic section to Liz.

128
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,300
She will provide you some feedback even if it's not done.

129
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:30,840
Submit what you have. What I would encourage you to do is to try to get through locating all your data.

130
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,980
Because again, after two weeks, we're going to start moving on to nutrition and health.

131
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,240
And you may be at various stages of taking your raw data and making tables and figures for it.

132
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:53,000
If you can at least have several tables or figures with some write up so that Liz can provide you some feedback,

133
00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:02,330
you know, on how you're describing the data, how you're highlighting key findings from the data and so forth.

134
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,559
So that's an opportunity. It's not required, but I strongly recommend it.

135
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,970
One. It kind of gives you a deadline, sort of a soft deadline.

136
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,320
And too, it's an opportunity to get feedback from Liz. Can I get to that?

137
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:22,100
And I would say to you, I'm going to get your background sections back to you as quickly as possible, but the style of you'll learn quickly,

138
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,579
the style of writing for the background section is different from this section of the needs assessment.

139
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,160
Now you're getting more into the meat of it. So even if you get pretty, I a pretty positive feedback on your background section.

140
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,420
The writing style is different, so it's really helpful to get feedback on both.

141
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,340
Just something to consider. I really encourage you all to to take advantage.

142
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,040
And students have said in the past, I'm not used to having to talk about data.

143
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,450
So, you know, by the time you're done with this paper, you will feel like you, you know,

144
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,760
are more versed in talking about highlighting data on these kind of statistics.

145
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,160
But certainly your first past isn't a great opportunity to get some feedback from Liz.

146
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,459
So that will be next Friday, the 14th,

147
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,190
that you have the opportunity to submit a draft to her and I'll create a pen

148
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,480
assignment and canvas that will be a draft for the US Census Bureau component.

149
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,030
And so and the other thing, I just wanted to circle back the township versus city,

150
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:38,480
so I included two documents on canvas page today that goes over township and cities.

151
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:48,829
So essentially in Michigan and I guess there's 20 other states that do this, it's a historical use of terms.

152
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,870
Township We don't use towns in Michigan, we call them townships.

153
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,870
And it was basically just where populations started to cluster and there was density.

154
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,610
And so they that's how what was formed was a township or a town.

155
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:14,930
There's a little bit more to it, but and then cities are their own entity outside of the township.

156
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:20,149
Okay. So actually if you look at a map of Ann Arbor, they'll be Ann Arbor City.

157
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,010
And there's a tiny little L-shaped section around the city.

158
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:35,780
That's Ann Arbor Township. Census Bureau is not making a distinction or it's not including township data.

159
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:44,140
If there's the city it used to do and I was just talking to Liz about that, I noticed the Ann Arbor Township only has a population of 4000.

160
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:52,310
So that may be why. It may just be they just didn't have enough data to have reliable statistics.

161
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,960
So most of you are going to just be finding cities.

162
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,510
Some of you may find right now there's an area called Clinton.

163
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,310
There's no city. It's called Clinton Township. And it will come up as Clinton Township.

164
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,790
Okay. So you don't need to worry about.

165
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:19,760
Oh, well, let me take a step back. In the past, if I typed in Ypsilanti, I would get Ypsilanti City and Ypsilanti Township.

166
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,210
You don't have to worry about that because it's not coming up that way anymore.

167
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,620
A long answer. Clarifying.

168
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,899
Yes. Yeah. So as for like grading of the background section,

169
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,410
will we have like an opportunity like if we get points off to like get some of

170
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,370
those points back as we make those edits like in the final paper or not really.

171
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:49,569
It's kind of like what you have submitted is. It's nice opportunity for you guys to work on your writing.

172
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:56,620
This is your first semester, so we'll see how you see how it goes.

173
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah, very busy grading and especially once this pick, once your community assessment is turned in, it's a lot because both she and I will be grading.

174
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:17,970
So we'll see. I mean, I want you guys to have that opportunity, so I'll revisit that because I think it's an important opportunity.

175
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:27,400
Yeah. Okay. I'm going to end here and you guys can go ahead and get started.

176
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,780
She's just.
