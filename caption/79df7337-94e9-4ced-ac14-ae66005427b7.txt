00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,270
Hello. First off, I want to thank Dr. Charles for an amazing course and to you all of my fellow students,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,170
thank you for bringing interesting topics and perspectives to our discussions.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,070
I learned so much from all of you sharing your experiences, your thoughts and the research you did on a wide array of climate justice topics.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,740
And I'm just so thankful for that experience.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,630
In reviewing my six America score, it was pretty much exactly the same as at the beginning of the course.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,540
I fall into the 26 percent of Americans who are alarmed about climate change, from viewing all of your videos.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,280
I think we are in good company,

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,730
but we collectively have a lot of work to do to make issues and actions around climate change real and salient to more of our community.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,080
Members here in the US will experience less severe consequences from climate change than people living in other regions of the globe,

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,830
and particularly those in less developed countries. The nations that have benefited the most from greenhouse gas emissions generally

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,870
have more resources to adapt and mitigate the worst outcomes in upcoming decades.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,920
However, as we've learned, members of marginalized groups will suffer the most whether they live here in the US or around the globe.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,450
One topic that I really connected with and of course, is the disparate impact of urban heat island.

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,770
Some poor and minority communities, people who live in neighborhoods that lack tree covers and those who can't afford air conditioning and have

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,260
less insulated housing are at much higher risk of health consequences and potential death during heat waves,

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,770
which will only increase in intensity and duration.

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,980
I see that in the neighborhoods near where I work in Detroit residents there are also people with the least access to health

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,420
care who are more likely to have unmanaged comorbidities that further increase their susceptibility to heat related illnesses.

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,180
An example after example, we see that environmental justice communities will suffer the most from climate change, but no one is immune.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,710
It's clear that climate change will impact everyone on the planet in a myriad of ways,

21
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,960
ranging from increased conflicts and migration to altered ranges of factors to increased

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,420
mental health issues and decreased production and nutritional value and food crops.

23
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,930
The biggest takeaways for me in the course were threefold, though.

24
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,470
First, I learned significantly more about the direct impacts of climate change on human health than I realized.

25
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,430
This is really a call to action for public health professionals.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:25,560
Second, the inequities in climate related consequences for environmental justice communities are vastly greater than I understood prior to the course,

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,590
with a strong understanding of social determinants of health.

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,310
I just hadn't fully connected climate change as an added factor, driving persistent inequalities and injustice.

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,810
Three. I have a renewed interest in engaging on climate related issues.

30
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,350
Today, I see a clearer path to get involved in policy matters at a local and statewide level thanks to this class.

31
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,270
I also have more confidence in my understanding of the issues and ability to present them.

32
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,000
The importance of public health engagement in climate policy and environmental justice can't be understated,

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,090
so I leave the class still among the alarmed. But with more hope for actions that can have a positive impact.

34
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,873
Thank you again, Professor Charles, and thank you again, all of you.
