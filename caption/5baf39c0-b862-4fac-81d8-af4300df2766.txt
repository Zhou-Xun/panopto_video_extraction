1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:16,310
I was the one that's going to be on the right side of the line.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:29,170
I mean, you know, like I.

3
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,310
Yeah. Yes.

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,760
They don't have anything to prove. Yeah.

5
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:57,410
No, I don't like. I don't like. I mean, it survived a civil war.

6
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,440
Yeah. How long did it take you?

7
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:26,930
Oh, yeah. I just felt like every time I like I was like, oh, my God.

8
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,249
It was like, all right.

9
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,430
I want to start with a couple of reminders and announcements.

10
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:43,250
So your peer review feedback on the full manuscript draft will be due next Friday.

11
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,649
So I went ahead and assigned reviewers in the system.

12
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,840
So if you've turned in your assignment, you should be able to see who you're supposed to review.

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,480
And remember, you can't access it from the peer review assignment.

14
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:07,370
You have to go either to your to do list on the front page or go into the assignment where you submitted your paper,

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,380
and that's where you'll see your peers paper.

16
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,500
Any questions about that? Okay.

17
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,840
Also, there's still about ten people who need to sign up for a presentation date.

18
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,790
So presentations,

19
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:36,090
the first ones will be the week before Thanksgiving on the 18th of November and then the two weeks after we get back from Thanksgiving break.

20
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,930
You can sign up as a Google sheet and you can add your name.

21
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,640
There's a link in the syllabus and also in the instructions for the assignment.

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,150
Anybody having trouble finding the. Got it.

23
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,030
Okay. And we'll go. We'll go in the order that people are listed in the signup sheet.

24
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,830
Because some people really want to go in a specific spot. So they sign up for that.

25
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,900
Okay. And then your final project will be due on the last day of class.

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,200
And then that's it. There's no final or anything. Any question.

27
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,490
How are you feeling about your projects now that you've got a full draft?

28
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,970
Victoria. A big. You're laughing. You feel okay about it?

29
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:46,839
Oh, you're glad you finished? Yeah. Comment there.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,559
I was just saying, make sure you sign up for a presentation for the final presentation if you haven't already.

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,630
And there's a link in the syllabus and also in the instructions for the final segment.

32
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:15,460
All right. Let's talk about neighborhoods. So just take a minute and look at these pictures of four different neighborhoods.

33
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:34,290
And tell me what you notice about some of these different places and thinking about it in the context of how.

34
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,990
Yeah. Yes.

35
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:55,050
So they're kind of. Okay.

36
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,660
Uh huh. So this looks fancy.

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,720
And then the fourth one is. Okay.

38
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,610
So you noticed that there's a lot of density of housing here.

39
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,610
This place looks fancy. These places look like maybe people who live there have fewer economic resources.

40
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:38,110
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,170
I want to talk to you about that.

42
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:55,870
Yeah, well, hard to see the fourth one, but the second and third ones, it looks like accessibility might be limited because the sidewalks here,

43
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,520
there's like grass growing over the sidewalks here, the sidewalks that are uneven and cracked.

44
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,260
Yeah. There's a lot of difference in how much green space there.

45
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,270
Yeah. Yeah. You can see the differences in green space between the areas for sure.

46
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,110
How do you think that might influence health? You go outside and play.

47
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
Anyone going to go outside or be outside? Take her inside her.

48
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,530
Yeah. So more greenspace gives you more opportunities to be outside.

49
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,790
Yeah, the. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,450
The more trees and stuff you have, the more it kind of filters the air.

51
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,229
It also keeps things cooler.

52
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:05,500
So when you have a lot of heat, especially if you live in an area where the heat during the day and then continues to put it back out at night.

53
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,970
The share of temperatures rise.

54
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,960
Other things that you notice about these kind of different neighborhood settings that might be important for help.

55
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,370
And maybe, maybe not in these pictures, but just thinking more broadly,

56
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,930
given what you've read and just what you know, because you probably grew up in some kind of neighborhood,

57
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,969
what are your kind of different aspects of neighborhood that can influence how we talked about greenspace,

58
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,090
we talked about accessibility with sidewalks.

59
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,070
Talk a little bit about population density. Yeah.

60
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:17,600
So in the second pictures, it's just. I just don't feel like work is.

61
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,650
Economic development, but like stimulation.

62
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:33,829
Yeah. So you get the sense from looking at here that there's probably not a lot of things that you could walk to and and purchase things or whatever.

63
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,260
So probably not a lot of like healthy food options from these places.

64
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,830
Anything else? Yeah.

65
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,050
Just maybe just play on the level.

66
00:08:50,230 --> 00:09:00,670
Yeah. Yeah. There could be differences in police presence in these different areas, which could impact residents in good ways and bad ways.

67
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay. Well, keep talking about this as we go through. One thing I was just thinking about and Colin,

68
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,930
maybe you can tell us more about this idea because I hadn't heard about it before, but cognitive ability.

69
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,380
What does that mean? So the thinking is like how?

70
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,450
Okay. Like for older adults. Yeah.

71
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,870
Especially. Yeah. So, like, if we have no more space than.

72
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,450
It's good for. They still exercise.

73
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,030
And if there is a museum library like here.

74
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:59,660
Uh huh. Yeah. A lot of it's a simulation, those kind of performance and readings, observations, you know, cognitive function.

75
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:10,360
Yeah. Yeah. And also, uh, there's more grocery store than your eye patch and this kind of thing.

76
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,270
Like multiple dimensions.

77
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,060
Yeah. Yup. Your coffee?

78
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,600
Yeah. I thought that was a really interesting idea and one that I hadn't heard before.

79
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:33,250
This idea that the neighborhood can influence, like cognitive health, particularly as you're aging, and the importance of having,

80
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:41,750
like, walking destinations and places to go, the accessibility of the sidewalks and things like that.

81
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:56,910
Yeah. Okay. So I want to talk about this idea of ecology and how that relates to the study of neighborhoods and neighborhood contexts.

82
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:08,000
So ecology is really a branch of biology that's focused on living organisms, habits, modes of life and relationships to their surroundings.

83
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:14,340
So not not necessarily humans, but kind of all living organisms.

84
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:27,430
And then human ecology specifically focuses on the study of relationships between humans and their natural social and created or built environments.

85
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:35,650
So this is kind of where neighborhood research is situated, is within this area of human ecology.

86
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:52,650
So that brings us to talking a little bit about the history of ecological approaches, particularly in social science, but also in immunology.

87
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,560
So when I say ecological approaches, what do you immediately think?

88
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,340
Sara I saw you lab. I was like, Well, my greatest in science.

89
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,760
I thought like, Oh, that's not what I thought you thought.

90
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,650
But there you go.

91
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,500
That's where I thought you were going for. Yeah, that's all right.

92
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,470
It is Friday morning. We are very far into the semester.

93
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,339
I think we all need a break. Yeah.

94
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:37,620
So I think a lot of times when you're an epidemiology student, you immediately think of the ecologic fallacy or you think of ecological studies.

95
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:47,040
And when you're taught about different study designs, where do ecological studies fall on the good and bad scale?

96
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Yeah, you're like bad logics. Things are bad.

97
00:12:51,630 --> 00:13:03,030
Okay, so that's important to keep in mind, right? So from the 1950s to the 1980s, ecological approaches were very unpopular in the social sciences.

98
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,309
And that is kind of due to this idea of the ecologic fallacy.

99
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,459
So skepticism about ecological approaches to studying social science in particular.

100
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,870
But you could also think about epidemiology because it applies to but the people are very skeptical of this,

101
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,980
don't want to do ecological approaches because of the ecological fallacy.

102
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:33,990
So this is just when you infer individual relationships from relationships observed at the aggregate level.

103
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:44,550
So you really want to understand something about, about individuals, but you don't have data at the individual level.

104
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,100
And so you look at data at the group level and then that's okay.

105
00:13:51,120 --> 00:14:03,000
The problem is then when you try to go back and apply what you found to the individual level, that's where you commit the logical fallacy.

106
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,640
And so it occurs when when aggregate data is used as a proxy for individual data.

107
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:17,640
Can you think of any examples of an ecological study that you read in the past or maybe even done yourself?

108
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,650
Yeah. This.

109
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,290
Bible study that feels like a longer study on multiple levels.

110
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,640
Yeah. Like what was the plausible biological mechanism?

111
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,460
Yeah. Yeah. And I.

112
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:55,559
Yeah, it's a little bit of a stretch, but. Okay. So they were looking at individual level, but their outcome wasn't individual level.

113
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,410
It was a population level covered in that area where they live.

114
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,370
Right. So they like to evaluate the oh, they aggregate it.

115
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,620
Okay. Yeah, that's a problem.

116
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,959
So they aggregated the digit ratio data and then looked at aggregate COVID data and

117
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:22,590
then said people with a higher digit ratio are more likely to get that higher number.

118
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,780
Yeah, that's real bad. Okay, Cohen. Yeah, I have a one on one.

119
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,540
Okay, good. So I know. There's something I had to read.

120
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,840
Why? I research Halloween.

121
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:50,330
Why? Okay, so it's like the confidence, chuckling assumption of the Nobel Prize way.

122
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,270
Mm hmm. And then. Like how many?

123
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:05,310
And then they made the association between the assumption and the assumption and the Nobel Prize at the country level.

124
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,180
So there is an association between chocolate consumption in a country and how many Nobel Prize winners they have.

125
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,620
Okay, Patricia, you've heard this, too. Yeah, yeah. Switzerland is like, yeah, a different group.

126
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:23,880
And the conclusion is that they win the Nobel Prize.

127
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,950
Yes. Yes.

128
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:38,800
And that's that's bad. Well, I mean, it's bad to take from that that eating more chocolate will increase your chances of winning a Nobel for.

129
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,610
Right. So this is you know, it's not really a problem to do the study.

130
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,410
I think the one with the digits of all of weird because they aggregate up the individual.

131
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,940
But like but really if you want to do an ecological study, it's fine.

132
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,170
It's not a bad it's not an inherently bad study design.

133
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:08,280
The problem is when you take the results and you, like misapplied them and you come to sort of an incorrect conclusion, that's where the problem is.

134
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,320
And then, you know, the other kind of issue with it is that it's weaker for causal inference.

135
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,540
So it has limitations, but so do all study design.

136
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:28,170
So I just want to emphasize that point. I think sometimes there is an immediate response of ecologic study.

137
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,810
Bad, but not necessarily depends on what you're trying to do and depends on how you interpret it.

138
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,779
Okay. Oh.

139
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,980
So then I was going to give sort of another example here.

140
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:51,660
So Durkheim's classic suicide study was an ecological study.

141
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,379
And so he was looking at suicide rates and group level religious affiliation.

142
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:08,520
So really looking across countries at this and it it doesn't necessarily mean that Protestants are more likely than Catholics to commit suicide,

143
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,750
even though suicide rates are higher in Protestant countries.

144
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,120
He was really interested in the culture of predominantly Protestant versus

145
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,470
predominantly Catholic countries and how that would influence risk for suicide,

146
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,979
not like the particular religious affiliation and risk at the individual level for suicide.

147
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,000
So this was an example of like a truly ecologic approach.

148
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,640
He wasn't just trying. It wasn't that he didn't have individual level data.

149
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:47,820
It probably didn't entirely. But, um, but he really wanted to understand something about the context of both countries and how it influenced suicide.

150
00:19:49,050 --> 00:20:00,780
So ecologic approaches, after being very unpopular in the social sciences for a long time, suddenly become very popular in the 1990s.

151
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,090
And this is for sort of a number of reasons.

152
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:13,079
So part of it was because there were new developments in statistical methods that made it easier to study these kinds of questions.

153
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:23,820
So we get multilevel models. Geographic information systems give us different spatial analysis techniques are developed.

154
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,020
There's also increasingly, as you saw, particularly in the beginning of the semester,

155
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,000
when we were reading some of those theoretical papers that were written around this time and a little later,

156
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,750
there's a strong desire to get away from purely individual explanations for poor health.

157
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,330
So we've got like the theory of fundamental causes of social theory.

158
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,990
And so ecological approaches allow you to look away just from sort of individual risk factors and to start to think about the environment.

159
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,610
And there's renewed interest in understanding the causes of socioeconomic and racial ethnic health disparities around this time.

160
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:12,780
And so all of these factors come together and then ecological approaches actually become very popular.

161
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,040
And there's this sort of explosion of research on neighborhood effects on health.

162
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,479
So there's sort of entire cohorts of graduate students who are all studying neighborhood effects.

163
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,800
But now a lot of them graduated from from this program, actually.

164
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:45,170
So in terms of early studies in this area, they use census tracts or block groups to proxy neighborhoods.

165
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:53,640
And so I'm going to show you if this works. A map of census tracts.

166
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,380
Ignore the data. I just want you to see the census tracts make it bigger.

167
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,510
Okay, so this is Washtenaw County. And where do you see the lies?

168
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,980
These are census tracts. So this is an art world, right?

169
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:19,230
It's surrounded by all the. And you can see in here there's some really little census tracts, and then there's some bigger ones.

170
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,060
And then when you go further out from Ann Arbor, you see a really big census tract.

171
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,230
The numbers are just how you coded the city for that.

172
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:35,490
But what do you notice when you look at this map of census tracts within Washtenaw County?

173
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,220
Yeah. Well, even the small one for what we consider pretty heavy.

174
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,920
Yeah, even the small ones are big for thinking about, like, what are the bigger?

175
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:03,450
Anything else anybody notices about them? I guess related to that, do you look at that and think, oh, here's my neighborhood?

176
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:13,290
No, really. Census charts really don't map on to what we think of as a neighborhood.

177
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,309
Know they're really an administrative unit that's designed for data collection.

178
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,870
And it has nothing to do with what people think of as as their neighborhood or as a neighborhood.

179
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:41,270
So what are some what are some limitations of using census tract or block groups, smaller groups or smaller units within census tracts?

180
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,070
What do you think might be the limitations of that for research?

181
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:55,460
You want to understand neighborhood effects on how. And so you're measuring neighborhood characteristics at the census tract level.

182
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,330
Yeah. Just like, you know, homicide is just a very violent neighborhood.

183
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,709
Yeah, it may be too big, particularly in less urban areas.

184
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,990
They're just enormous areas.

185
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:24,780
And so it doesn't it may not be capturing the features that you're interested in, like walkability or certain things like that.

186
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah, no, I'm just thinking, like, I think of like what I would consider my neighborhood.

187
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,749
Yeah. It really takes a lot of knowledge to, like, know where the bounds are.

188
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:39,340
So it's like, oh, this is a main street. So, like, I don't really know where to set up my dog when I walk.

189
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,610
Yeah, I was like, you can't. That's hard to connect with, like a blocker, you know?

190
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,400
Yeah, it really is. Like neighborhoods.

191
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,969
Yeah. Victoria, did you. Oh, I thought your and your neighborhood boundaries.

192
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:03,030
You're right. They don't necessarily match these administrative unit definitions and you would need to have a lot of understanding,

193
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,159
local understanding of the community.

194
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:14,670
You're studying to know where those boundaries are, which of course when you're doing a national study isn't really feasible.

195
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,390
Right. To to do that. Yeah.

196
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,790
Sarah, this is great because I wasn't familiar with this. And.

197
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:35,170
I. The first thing.

198
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,150
And to average about four. That already is.

199
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,220
So. Yeah, the mystery. Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:25:53,270 --> 00:26:02,389
So anyway yeah they're not they, they weren't since the strikes were designed to do work on neighborhoods and that's not why they exist.

201
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:08,780
But why do you think we use census tracks and I mean we already talked a little bit about you would need

202
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,630
a lot of knowledge to define neighborhood boundaries while my researchers want to use census tracts.

203
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,200
Yes. Yes. Yes. Relatively stable over time because that's what we need to.

204
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,150
Yeah, that's true. They are fairly stable over time, so that's kind of a nice thing.

205
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,650
If you wanted to look across time, I call him, I think maybe.

206
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,820
Result would be more generalizable. Say more about that.

207
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,000
So. Like the national.

208
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,150
Hmm. Oh, I see. So you could do studies,

209
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:02,030
like if you were going to study neighborhoods in the way that no describing

210
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,360
where you would really have to understand what are the boundaries of these?

211
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,070
You'd have to do it in a small area and then it would be less generalizable.

212
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,809
Whereas if you do a national study. Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's also.

213
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:19,879
Yeah. Partnership. Yeah. That's what I was going to say.

214
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,830
Yeah. There's tons of data that we have by census tract that you can connect to your study data.

215
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,870
As long as you know, like you have geographic indicators for your study participants,

216
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,299
you can link all of these administrative records related to census tracts.

217
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,920
And so you don't have to really go collect data on neighborhoods yourself.

218
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:49,100
The government already did it. And so you just you merge it and so it's really, really convenient.

219
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:57,590
So there's a lot of reasons why people do this. And even though this says this was the approach in the early studies, you can go look at it,

220
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:04,140
you can find probably hundreds of papers published this year that used census measures of neighborhood

221
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,980
like it's still by far the most common way that researchers measure aspects of the neighborhood.

222
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,970
So when researchers use these measures at the sort of census tract level,

223
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:26,610
what they're typically doing is looking at census derived aggregate measures to proxy neighborhood social and physical features.

224
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:40,300
So what might be some examples of these census derived aggregate measures that you could look at and consider a feature of the neighborhood?

225
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,560
Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,810
So you can look at the percent of the population that lives below the poverty line.

227
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,590
What else might you be able to look at at this kind of level?

228
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,770
Yeah. Yeah. You could look at household income.

229
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,129
You can look at crime, you can get crime.

230
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,490
Statistics for the neighborhood is like a proxy for, you know, safety in the neighborhood.

231
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:43,520
Yeah, you can I mean, basically anything that the census asks people about income, education, household size,

232
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:53,660
what else you can get in there, um, you can get racial composition of neighborhoods to use is like a proxy for segregation.

233
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:01,700
There's a lot of information that you can get from the census that you can then use as like as data for your studies.

234
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,979
And so what a lot of people do is they take all these sort of different measures that we just talked about,

235
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,130
and they combine them together and create what's usually called a neighborhood deprivation index.

236
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:21,140
And so they're trying to understand, like sort of the economic conditions of the neighborhood neighborhoods in which people live.

237
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,920
So what might be some limitations of using that kind of measure,

238
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:39,360
like a neighborhood deprivation index that combines crime and poverty, aspects of segregation, education.

239
00:30:39,550 --> 00:31:05,190
That kind of stuff. Galactic feel like individuals can live in those areas, but they themselves have material resources to.

240
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,730
Yeah. So it's not it's not necessarily telling you anything about that individual's circumstances.

241
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:20,810
Right. Like, so you couldn't use that as a proxy for like the individual circumstances living there.

242
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,300
Does it tell you about any of those things that we talked about when I showed you the pictures of the neighborhoods?

243
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,050
No. Right. It doesn't tell you anything about weather.

244
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:48,010
Nothing about cognitive ability. It tells you nothing about whether you have access to a way to grocery stores in the neighborhood.

245
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,520
You can it's you can assume it does. Right. That's why it's a proxy.

246
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,499
You can assume that if it's an area that has higher poverty, for example,

247
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:03,250
that it's probably less likely to have access to grocery stores and recreational facilities and things like that.

248
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,110
But you don't know that for sure. You're using it as a proxy. So it's kind of an imperfect measure.

249
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,900
It doesn't tell you about sidewalks.

250
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,180
It doesn't tell you about green space.

251
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:22,660
It doesn't tell you about a lot of the things that that we think are influencing help in relation to neighborhoods.

252
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,310
So there's been a million studies that have used this kind of approach.

253
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,440
They've looked at all kinds of outcomes mortality, self-rated, health,

254
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,060
mental health outcomes, chronic disease, risk factors for vascular disease, diabetes.

255
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:51,510
Most studies do find effects of neighborhood deprivation on health, even after adjusting for individual level income and education.

256
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:58,470
There's something about living in an area characterized by deprivation, however that's defined,

257
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,570
that creates a risk for health net of the individual's own socio economic characteristics.

258
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,770
But it's really, really hard to separate our compositional and contextual effects.

259
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,790
And Sara, I know you had a question about that. We're going to come to that in just a minute.

260
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,860
When the measure of neighborhood is aggregated from individual level data, because what you know,

261
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:32,040
the how you're characterizing the neighborhood, it's just by aggregating that individual level data.

262
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,860
So how do you separate out the effect of the context versus the composition of the neighborhood?

263
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,209
So let's talk about that a little bit. I think that's next.

264
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,880
Yes. All right.

265
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,510
So compositional versus contextual explanations, a theory.

266
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:55,329
I think your question was also because there is a third one that's talked about and that has ruined my paper,

267
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,840
which was eco watch and environmental with an environmental effect.

268
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,370
Yeah. Okay.

269
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,560
I'll try to remember which one in of this as we go through.

270
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:27,460
All right. So a compositional explanation for neighborhood effects on help says the area's neighborhoods include different types of people.

271
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:35,460
And it's really those differences between the individuals that explains differences in health across place.

272
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:51,920
And this is this makes a lot of sense, right, because people aren't randomly distributed across neighborhoods.

273
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:59,300
We know that people with similar social and economic circumstances tend to live near each other.

274
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,010
Now, that depends on the area where you live.

275
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:15,620
So it's not universally true. And there are there have been a number of efforts in some places to try to change that.

276
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:29,730
But in general, that is the case. So people with higher incomes tend to live in areas where other people also have higher incomes.

277
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:41,240
And so how do you separate out the effects of those people having higher income from living in a place where there's high advertising?

278
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,910
So that's that would be a compositional explanation for why you see differences, say, across census tracts in health outcomes.

279
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,210
And they would argue that even these studies that are, you know,

280
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:04,190
supposedly adjusting for individual income and education, there's probably residual confounding.

281
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,910
And if you could really adjust for that, then it would entirely explain it.

282
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,980
So that's a criticism of using those kinds of aggregated measures.

283
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:20,840
So then a contextual explanation says, no, it's not just about the characteristics of people who live in areas.

284
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,809
There's really features of the social or physical environment that influence the health of people exposed to it,

285
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,600
regardless of their individual characteristics.

286
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:43,490
And the only reason why people would do neighborhood research at all is because they'd be interested in this kind of stuck in type of explanation.

287
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,100
And then the third one here was environmental.

288
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:10,120
So endogenous would be like compositional and then contextual would say that there are features of the neighborhoods.

289
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:17,240
I think that would be things like grocery stores or things like that.

290
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,559
Um, or it could even be collective efficacy.

291
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,940
So it could be a social feature of the neighborhood that influence how.

292
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,680
And then I think you go back and paper, I think the environmental one would be more like.

293
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:53,030
Was weather like an example that they used? Oh, severe.

294
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,959
So they would put perjury stories there. So what does it say?

295
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:18,160
Context. How would you describe contextual? Contextual. Yeah.

296
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:41,500
I just. Yeah.

297
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:47,670
I mean, I think in that way, it's just about who gets care.

298
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,650
Yeah. And the contextual you, there's,

299
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:01,690
there's something that arises as a result of that composition that independently affects how and then I guess they're saying environmental.

300
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:12,130
It's like really external features the way stories and things, but those would kind of arise as a result of the stuff.

301
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:28,000
I think in the article, though, if I'm not mistaken, she says that health researchers really care about environmental health.

302
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,970
Right? Is that what she says? They say. Yeah.

303
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,060
I think it's that kind of formula because now I want to know.

304
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,920
Yeah. Neighborhood health effects researchers are essentially interested in environmental effects.

305
00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:04,300
So that would be you. Earlier.

306
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,720
So it is true, especially so. Ana Diaz Ruiz is the first author on this paper.

307
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,980
It's like one of the biggest kind of neighborhood and health researchers that there is.

308
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,230
And it is true that her work really did largely focus on her early work, use these neighborhood, these proxy census measures.

309
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:50,470
And then she did work more recently where she was really looking at things like neighborhood walkability and distance to.

310
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,509
Destinations. I can't remember what it's called exactly, but like, how can you walk to churches?

311
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,850
Can you walk to gyms? Can you walk to libraries like that kind of stuff?

312
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:12,170
And looking at street connectivity and all of these other features of the leg of the built environment.

313
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,870
Um, but I would say that there probably are also health researchers who care about more of like

314
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,950
the things that she was describing as contextual artifacts and not just the exhaustion,

315
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:32,689
those kinds of things. But I think the reason why there would be an emphasis from a public health perspective on thinking

316
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:40,280
about the exotic and this ones or the environmental ones is because you can you can intervene,

317
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,900
right? You can manipulate them.

318
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:50,120
So if you find that street having greater street connectivity improves cognitive outcomes for older adults, for example.

319
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:57,800
Right. You can pass legislation to to do that for roads, for increasing street connectivity.

320
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:12,649
Whereas if you find that back to that example about kids in schools, like you can't easily manipulate people's socioeconomic status.

321
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:21,350
Right? But you could influence these other things about and we saw that in our some of the papers that we read for today.

322
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,889
Right, like with the corner store intervention, it's like, yeah,

323
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:31,190
that's a that's an example of this future of a neighborhood that you can intervene on relatively easily.

324
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:40,790
And then we also saw in the moving to opportunity trial, um, several of you brought this up, right,

325
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:46,850
that they picked people up and just plopped them down into new neighborhoods rather

326
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:52,190
than trying to change features of the neighborhood that they were previously at.

327
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,079
And why do you think they did that? There were there was a quote was a trust in.

328
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,950
Did you ask that? Yeah, you did.

329
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,670
Yeah. Why give vouchers instead of investing in neighborhoods?

330
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,470
I think it's just like that kind of thinking, you know, and I think it's like a hard line to walk,

331
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,110
especially because you're like, you don't want to invest in that neighborhood.

332
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,770
Yeah. At the same time. For decades.

333
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,669
I think there's always an economic argument that, yeah,

334
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:32,920
so maybe part of it is because it would be really expensive to try to transform the

335
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,420
neighborhood and more expensive than giving people housing vouchers to move somewhere else.

336
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,610
Why else might you want to try this approach, at least at first?

337
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah. It doesn't work.

338
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Yeah. I think part of it was this was they wanted to use this experimental design because it's sort of the most rigorous design.

339
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,120
There was observational data suggesting that like people were healthier when they lived in higher up neighborhoods.

340
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:18,900
But the question was, again, this isn't the composition of the neighborhood or is it something about the context of the neighborhood?

341
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:29,910
And if it's really about the context, if it's really about the neighborhood itself, then you should see that when you move people,

342
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:35,460
when you pick people up out of lower neighborhoods and place them in higher of these neighborhoods, their health should improve.

343
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:46,080
If it's really like causality about the neighborhood. So I think part of it was trying to generate more evidence for this kind of thing.

344
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,280
Right. It's the same with the corner store intervention.

345
00:44:50,670 --> 00:45:01,110
Like, I think there is a lot of reason to suspect that like that doing this type of intervention would lead to changes in behavior.

346
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:06,780
But you really need this kind of more experimental study design to have stronger evidence.

347
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:15,479
That brings up some other kinds of questions that people raised.

348
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,970
A lot of people raised this. You were surprised that the interventions didn't work.

349
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,240
So there was this initial sort of like, why?

350
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,990
That's not what I expected.

351
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:33,930
Although moving to opportunity worked out for some outcomes but not others seemed to be more beneficial for girls and for boys.

352
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:41,600
But why do you think there wasn't strong evidence from these interventions that help them prevent.

353
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,870
After addressing the food environment or after moving people to relatively higher.

354
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:03,070
Yeah. Okay.

355
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:20,930
Okay. So yeah, with food, it really just focused on availability and access and didn't address other things like establishing food preferences.

356
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,780
Yeah. I feel like the main focus this content.

357
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,910
Composition all things together because you only provide them.

358
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:45,320
It's like you only change the contextual things instead of you focus on individuals things.

359
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,780
Yeah. Like there's supposedly for health behavior,

360
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:54,380
there's an interaction between the individual and the social context or anything like you would probably need to address aspects of.

361
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:10,580
What else have you been? Yeah. Like. Yeah.

362
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:18,150
So particularly in the corner store intervention, just a very tiny number of stores and it didn't do anything.

363
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:26,159
So it increased the accessibility of certain types of foods essentially, but didn't decrease the accessibility of other types of foods.

364
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,430
And the idea that this it's the food swap idea that there's there's so much unhealthy food

365
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,560
in the environment that this wouldn't you wouldn't expect it to have a really big impact.

366
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,120
You know, other reasons why you think things might not have been as successful as we would have hypothesized.

367
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:55,260
There, people said. So we talked about this issue of is access enough?

368
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,360
TR You mentioned regional differences in diet.

369
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,630
You were talking specifically about China, but you want to say more about that?

370
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,020
Yeah. Especially those in play.

371
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:25,180
Their culture value. They don't have much they didn't have in the past.

372
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,670
But now, even though the like the college entrance.

373
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,630
Ballard preferred to choose the.

374
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:39,949
Their culture of food. Yeah, because I have friends that come from the heart.

375
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,670
And she told me. You're good.

376
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,710
Mark, who is not on the street. It is all about.

377
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,030
It's kind of like a carbon plus carbon diet.

378
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:07,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I come from northern part of China, and it's because the weather could be cold.

379
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:12,730
Yeah, especially in the winter. So people need to consume more carbon to.

380
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:21,639
Make us keep us warm. Also like Michigan and also the alcohol consumption is also a problem.

381
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,480
All of this is because of the cold weather related to the climate.

382
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:35,229
Yeah. Something about. Yeah. And then when you when you grow up eating certain kinds of foods, you develop preferences for those foods.

383
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:40,510
And so like we don't I mean, how many of you, you probably don't think about it, right?

384
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:46,600
You, you need to eat. Maybe you go to the grocery store, you do this automatically.

385
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,260
I mean, for most of us, we don't give a lot of thought.

386
00:49:50,260 --> 00:50:00,700
So like, what am I going to purchase? And and it's when I'm help is one consideration when thinking about what to eat.

387
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:07,749
But there's far more considerations that go into decisions about what to purchase and what to eat like.

388
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:13,360
I know full well that I would be much healthier if I were vegan.

389
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,010
I know that. I know I would be, like, healthier, and it would be really good for me to have like an anti-inflammatory diet.

390
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,799
But I don't know how to like, I have no experience.

391
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,600
Like, I grew up just eating meat and that's what I know how to cook it.

392
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,430
It's like the recipes I know how to make. It's what I like in terms of taste.

393
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,049
And so it's not that I don't have access to tofu.

394
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,250
I, I do. I don't know how to cook it and I don't like it.

395
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:53,379
I think it's kind of taste weird. So this is, we have to think about this when we think about interventions and public health to that,

396
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,870
people aren't always making choices entirely based on what's healthy.

397
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,790
And so it's not necessarily that people don't know that it's healthier to eat fruits and vegetables,

398
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,820
but there's other reasons why you may not call it. Yeah.

399
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:26,040
So. Mm. I more likely that people leave their jobs.

400
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:38,610
And it's really pretty hard like he's it more vegetables, but still vegetables like candles and not very filling.

401
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:44,850
Yeah. Lower calories, right? Yeah. So you maybe like a more calorie rich diet?

402
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,840
Um, yeah, with certain occupations or.

403
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,630
I think some of you talked about. Oh, Sarah, go ahead. Oh, I was just going to have to.

404
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:05,100
I'm thinking. Films like people through the help of their homes.

405
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:12,600
But. Yes. Yeah.

406
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,319
You know what? Like if I. Am I going to spend it on the salad?

407
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:36,150
Which is delicious, but. I guess like a fall or.

408
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,290
Yeah. Yeah, I do that when I order my lunch.

409
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:51,459
It's really because I have this, like, delivery service and I look at the calories and I'm like, Oh, that looks really good, but it's 350 calories.

410
00:52:51,460 --> 00:53:00,840
I'll be starving. So I go for the higher was because I'm like, I want to pay all this money for this food when I have to go eat.

411
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:11,250
Yeah. I don't know that everybody does that, but. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

412
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:26,190
Just like. Instead of giving her back is not only going to cost, but just demolishing what is still delicious.

413
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,349
But. Yeah.

414
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:37,740
And you'd have to be pretty committed to thinking about that in your diet.

415
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,690
Right. And a lot of us don't don't necessarily. Yeah, McKayla, I have.

416
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:54,280
Now, I. Oh yeah.

417
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:58,969
They have that. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,390
It's like taking advantage of, like, the.

419
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:11,310
And like that. Limited budget.

420
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,460
Tell. What do you want to say about that?

421
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:28,860
I personally think it's more like that for me, but I don't see as many ads for young girls and for.

422
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:47,450
Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think that, you know, that's probably not like a super health food, right?

423
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,620
But but, yeah. Is it something that you grew up with and, you know, I never had it.

424
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,630
I'm sure I would like it because of my mother, but, um.

425
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:06,490
Yeah, but I guess every point that I always think about this, this lecture always comes up right before Thanksgiving.

426
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:12,430
And for those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving, like, it's all about food.

427
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,770
And, um, I remember being in college.

428
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:24,940
I went, I lived far away from home. I grew up in Alabama, and I went to school in Texas and I couldn't go home for Thanksgiving.

429
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,540
It was like too expensive and too far to go for three days or whatever.

430
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:35,110
So I always would go home with friends who lived, you know, within a few hours of campus.

431
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:43,420
And if you've ever had this experience, you're like, That's not what sweet potatoes are supposed to taste like.

432
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:50,140
Or Who would make stuffing with bread instead of cornbread, you know?

433
00:55:50,690 --> 00:56:00,360
Yeah. You know. Yeah, I think I got that.

434
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,780
Yeah, right. What? What? Why would you cut up chunks of bread?

435
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:14,040
Weirdest thing I've ever seen. Yeah. So food is very cultural and it's very emotional and.

436
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,200
Yeah, so we. I think that's. We're getting a little far away from neighborhoods,

437
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,919
but I do think it's important for thinking about these types of interventions that we do in public health.

438
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:34,270
And like I think all of us, we're like, yes, we just increase access to healthy foods and obviously people will eat them.

439
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,020
But there's a lot more to food than that.

440
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:48,280
We also we didn't talk about time. There's time span as fast, you know, and other types of foods are fast.

441
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,020
And when you don't have as much time to cook, then you might go to those.

442
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:02,769
Right. Have you ever have anybody ever cooked like beans and not for making like dried beans?

443
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:10,090
Have you ever cooked these? Are they fast? It's like the slowest thing in the world, right?

444
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,600
Mean you have to you have to rinse them.

445
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:21,999
So you soak them overnight, then you have to season them in some way because they're really bland.

446
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,319
You know, you, you know, from a can and you think they taste a certain way, but you cook them yourself.

447
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,970
You have to put a lot of salt. You have to put usually some kind of pork fat.

448
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,420
Where I grew up and when I make them myself.

449
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:40,059
But it's yeah. And then you have to like simmer them on the stove for hours or whatever.

450
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:48,580
So like these kinds of things we have to take into consideration when we're thinking about food or other health interventions.

451
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:57,340
Okay, I got super far away, but let's see if there's anything else I wanted to mention about the.

452
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:08,120
We talked about adult preferences being heard. Two Chainz talked about elements in culturally relevant foods and the importance of that.

453
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,330
You mentioned time was in your posts.

454
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:26,730
Yeah. Okay. So I think we I think we got it. So let's talk about kind of the types of studies that then came after the original

455
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,110
studies that were really focused on these census tract kinds of measures.

456
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:40,170
And so these are what Diaz Ruben may call second generation studies that kind of started in the 2000s and are still going.

457
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,950
I would say it's still much more common to see the census tract study.

458
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,310
So it's not like those went away. They're certainly still here.

459
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:53,070
But there has been more of an emphasis on understanding what it is about neighborhood,

460
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:58,250
physical and social environments that are driving kind of health differences.

461
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:06,330
So more focus on identifying and directly measuring the hypothesized mechanisms that link neighborhood deprivation to help.

462
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:15,660
So this model kinds of models starts out with residential segregation by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic position.

463
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:24,629
So acknowledging that neighborhoods are segregated along these dimensions of race and socioeconomic status and sort of and

464
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:32,190
try these bi directional arrows here between the composition of the neighborhood and inequalities and resource distribution.

465
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:39,719
So there's this idea that that's sort of that resources are not randomly distributed across neighborhoods,

466
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:46,350
which, you know, and that this then shapes differences in the neighborhood physical environment.

467
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,050
So this would include things like environmental exposures, so things like air pollution,

468
00:59:52,170 --> 01:00:00,550
chemicals, noise, also the availability of food and recreational resources.

469
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:11,219
So are there parks, are there germs, are there restaurants and what types of restaurants and food stores, things about the built environment.

470
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:19,050
So thinking about roads and sidewalks and things like that, that static, quality and natural spaces.

471
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,920
So is it an attractive area? Is it clean?

472
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,450
Are there green spaces or are there trees and grass, that sort of thing?

473
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,760
Services. So do you have access to a post office?

474
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,510
Are there banks? Those kinds of things that are important for life and health?

475
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,920
And then the quality of the housing is the is the housing in good condition?

476
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:59,040
Is it safe for any of you after the seminar yesterday that Alexis handled gave very you were there.

477
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:09,329
I don't know if anybody else was there, but she was showing pictures of the housing that that seasonal farm workers in Michigan live in.

478
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:12,420
So people who pick apples and cherries and things like that.

479
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,770
And the housing was in very poor condition.

480
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:23,100
So like some of the housing had didn't have bathrooms inside.

481
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:32,540
There were outdoor bathrooms. There were a lot of ripped screens on the windows and the doors which would allow bugs to come and things like that.

482
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:38,640
Right. So the physical condition of the housing is something that's related to that.

483
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,049
But then there's the aspects of the neighborhood social environment.

484
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:52,020
So there's things like safety, violence, obviously, that can directly harm your health, but it can also indirectly harm your health.

485
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:58,880
And why do you think that would be? Patricia.

486
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,470
Yeah, it's really stressful if you live in a place where you're not sure if it's safe to go outside.

487
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:14,970
Right. Like, that's that's stressful. And it can have impacts then on your behavior also, because if you feel like it's not safe to go outside,

488
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:20,219
there may be a park or sidewalks, but you're probably not going to go out for a walk.

489
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,720
Right. So neighborhood safety is really important.

490
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,800
Also, social connections and social cohesion.

491
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:35,690
How much are people how much do people in a neighborhood or an area know each other, trust each other,

492
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:43,620
are able to depend on each other for things that can be important for local institutions.

493
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:54,950
So, again, this can be sort of about how much are people invested in their venues,

494
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:06,560
like how much do people participate in civic organizations or, you know, volunteer to, um, to help with voting, that kind of stuff.

495
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:11,100
These are important aspects of sort of the social environment and then norms.

496
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,970
Like what's, what's typical in this neighborhood?

497
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,520
Do people clean up after their pets when they take them for a walk?

498
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:28,630
Is there a norm about that? We had some people in my neighborhood just about lost their mind because, um.

499
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:39,280
Do you guys know the one? It's like a big apartment complex for like, it was just built for students and it's right next to my neighborhood.

500
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:46,360
And a lot of people who live in the one have dogs and they were walking their dogs in our neighborhood and not cleaning up after that.

501
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:56,020
And people wigged out. And so they went over and talked about like the managers or whatever, you know,

502
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:04,239
because there just there was there were differences between like the people who lived in my neighborhood and the students who were living in the one.

503
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,410
And what is expected in terms of cleaning up after your pet.

504
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:13,540
And probably a lot of students have chat for the first time and don't actually like know that that you shouldn't do that or whatever.

505
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:18,790
So it was there was some conflict, but it has been resolved to let you know.

506
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:25,300
But this kind of thing can really like can, can be a feature of neighborhoods and really important.

507
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:30,579
And so then as we just talked about these different things about physical environment and

508
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:39,180
the social environment can influence behaviors that then affect homeboy walking diet,

509
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:47,190
that kind of stuff, and stress and that stress and behaviors kind of interact with one another to sort of influence each other as well.

510
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:55,810
And I think somebody maybe colored that was you talking about stress and how stress affects eating behavior.

511
01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:00,700
I think it was like another week, right? So so these things are connected, right?

512
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:08,679
Like sometimes when you're really stressed out, it affects your diet or it affects your physical activity or other things that impact health.

513
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:16,870
So they are sort of mutually reinforcing. And then this model also says here that there's personal characteristics like your own material resources,

514
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:23,320
psychosocial resources and biological attributes that influence kind of the relationships between all of these things.

515
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:36,910
So explanations for area differences. Why do we see area differences and how?

516
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:45,970
And so all the things that I'm going to show you here, these five different explanations are features that represent opportunity structures.

517
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:55,510
And by that I mean socially constructed and socially patterned features of the physical and social environment that can promote or damage health,

518
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:01,180
either directly or indirectly, through the possibilities that they provide for people to live healthy lives.

519
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,130
So if you think back to health lifestyles theory and we think about agency and

520
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:16,480
structure and we think about how people's choices are influenced by their life chances,

521
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,630
right? So people are making choices from options that are available to them based on their life chances.

522
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:31,990
And so this is sort of thinking about how our neighborhood shaping what's available to us in terms of like behavior and health related outcomes.

523
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:41,200
So we can think about one thing that contributes to area differences in health

524
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,010
are physical features of the environment that are shared by everybody there.

525
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:55,500
So this would be things like air quality, water quality.

526
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,350
Can be things like climate. If you live in a really cold place, a really hot place.

527
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:12,170
So these types of things affect everyone who lives in the area, but might affect some people more based on their individual characteristics.

528
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,199
So you can think about how air quality, poor air quality might affect everyone who lives there.

529
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,740
But if you have a condition like asthma, for example, then that air quality might have a greater impact on your health.

530
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:33,410
There's also the availability of a healthy environment at home, work and play.

531
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:39,290
So this gets back to the thing we were talking about with the quality of housing, that physical quality of housing.

532
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:46,130
Is it safe? Are there opportunities for secure and non-hazardous employment?

533
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,460
What kinds of jobs are available in the area where you live?

534
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:53,150
Are there safe places for children to play?

535
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:59,510
So are there parks that are far enough away from the road to be equipment in good condition, that kind of thing?

536
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:07,820
And again, this will affect people differently depending on things like their age or the presence of children.

537
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:18,640
Then there's the services provided publicly or privately to support people in their daily lives.

538
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:27,460
So this is things like education, transportation, street cleaning, police, health and welfare services.

539
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:35,320
These are all kind of aspects of areas in which people live that can be important for health.

540
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:43,390
And this sort of makes me think of a comment that a couple of people we're talking about are Cynthia Victoria.

541
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:53,019
You guys were talking about particularly intergenerational effects of redlining, segregation and cumulative disadvantage.

542
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,380
And then Sasha and Patricia were talking about school funding.

543
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:01,870
Right. So do any of you want to say anything about all that, what you were thinking?

544
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:16,060
Victory for the of.

545
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:32,040
The first commercial. You will be transferred to the second or third generation.

546
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:46,090
Also mentioned that even the black population was lower than the population was even more.

547
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:55,120
Yeah. So it's thinking about all that well back from that other model thinking about segregation that, that this,

548
01:09:55,270 --> 01:10:01,510
that segregation can have effects intergenerationally through various pathways and then

549
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:10,689
continued segregation also impacts schools and school funding and school resources.

550
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:14,860
Right, because of differences in property values and how schools are funded.

551
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:22,600
So, yes, there's these late kind of effects that compounds relate cumulative disadvantage and that that transmit intergenerational.

552
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,830
Then there's these socio cultural features of a neighborhood.

553
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,780
So this is like political, economic, ethnic and religious history of the communities of our like.

554
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:40,130
You shared an article about the neighborhood where you grew up in Chicago, but really emphasize that.

555
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,330
Do you wanna say anything about that? Yeah.

556
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:54,390
Yeah. I always. Yeah, I am.

557
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,840
Yeah. Yeah.

558
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:06,380
And you know, Chicago's one of the places where a lot of neighborhood research started,

559
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:11,930
in part because Chicago has very well defined neighborhoods, unlike some other cities.

560
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:18,800
So it's not random, but it's really kind of got its start there.

561
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,680
But yeah, so there's these political, economic,

562
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:29,710
ethnic and religious histories of communities that can impact how norms and values that we talked about before,

563
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:37,730
a degree of community integration, levels of crime and threats to personal safety and networks of community support.

564
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:43,520
These are important features of neighborhoods that can explain why health varies by place.

565
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:50,660
And then also the reputation of an area, how areas are perceived by residents themselves.

566
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,040
By banks, investors, city planners.

567
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,350
This can have a big influence on the infrastructure of the area.

568
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:08,340
So if businesses say, oh, that's a terrible neighborhood, I don't want to put my business in there,

569
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:12,540
like people don't have money or people aren't going to shop there, right?

570
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,190
That can mean that you don't have access to something like a grocery store.

571
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:22,290
That's that's part of what goes on in terms of influencing what different areas have.

572
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,920
It can also affect the self-esteem and morale of residents who move in and out.

573
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:37,640
Right. Like, if you feel like you live in a place that people think is bad, this can impact health or through self-esteem to.

574
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:50,070
So in terms of future research directions, there's a lot of interest in defining the relevant spatial context.

575
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:58,820
And this is like sort of getting at this idea of moving away from using census

576
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:04,370
tracts and defining neighborhoods based on the hypothesized causal process.

577
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:10,340
So maybe there's not one universal definition of neighborhood that needs to be used in this kind of research.

578
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:16,370
But it depends on the question that you're asking and the sort of hypothesized causal mechanism.

579
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:24,680
So you can think about if you're interested in social interactions, you might want to focus on a smaller area, right?

580
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:31,940
Whereas if you're interested in food access, that can probably be a larger area.

581
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,250
Right. So whether you want to focus on, you know,

582
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:42,110
within one block of where someone lives versus one mile of where someone lives might depend on the research question that you have.

583
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:50,870
People are also interested in examining spatial dependencies between areas and spillover effects.

584
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:58,399
So what are the health implications of living in an area that has fewer resources?

585
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,880
But you live right next to an area that has a lot of resources and maybe you can access those those resources.

586
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:16,560
Measurement of spatial context. So things like systematic social observation by trained interviewers.

587
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,030
So rather than using administrative data,

588
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:30,310
but actually going to places and having interviewers who drive around in cars or walk around the streets and know aspects of areas.

589
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:39,220
There are people who are doing this kind of work, but as you can imagine, that's extremely time and labor intensive to do that kind of thing.

590
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:50,440
Some people have started using. Google Street View images to do this kind of work, which is kind of a clever way of doing it.

591
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:59,140
People are using gifs and other sources of data for things like street connectivity and social destinations.

592
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:08,090
Doing separate surveys of residents, not just people who are participating in your study,

593
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:16,610
but going and recruiting other people from the area to provide information about neighborhoods to try to get more objective measures.

594
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,920
Thinking about life, course processes and residential mobility.

595
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:34,760
So linking cohort data to historical neighborhood, thinking about measures of cumulative exposure to neighborhood contexts and incorporating mobility.

596
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:39,229
So what does it mean when people move to an area that's very different from an area

597
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:45,200
where they moved before and then trying to account for selection into neighborhoods?

598
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:53,330
Because this is this is a difficult one for thinking about causality that people oftentimes now, of course,

599
01:15:53,660 --> 01:16:00,049
your you know, your choices aren't infinite in where to live, but people do make choices about where to live.

600
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:04,070
And they might select to live in a neighborhood for a certain a particular reason.

601
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:14,120
So it could be that you find that people who live in areas with better sidewalks exercise more,

602
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:19,040
and you're like, okay, we build sidewalks and people exercise.

603
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,850
But what's a selection argument for why you would see that result?

604
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:35,420
Why might it not be causal yet, Patricia? Yeah.

605
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:43,200
So you might be somebody who really likes to run. And so when you're looking for a place to live, you focus on a place that has sidewalks.

606
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:48,059
So that's like that's really hard to tease apart in observational research.

607
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,560
So thinking about selection effects is really important. Synergistic effects.

608
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,750
So thinking about interactions between the neighborhood and individual level characteristics.

609
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,920
So does the effect of residential segregation depend on race, for example?

610
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,100
It can also be like an environment gene by environment studies.

611
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,850
And then synergies between the neighborhood social and physical environments.

612
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:29,010
So does the effect of neighborhood safety or does the effect of air pollution on health depend on neighborhood safety?

613
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:38,030
So can you look at interactions between these different sort of aspects of the neighborhood social and physical environments?

614
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,499
And then thinking about non behavioral mechanisms.

615
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:50,160
Most of the research is really focused on behavior like physical activity, diet, health care utilization,

616
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:58,050
but what is the role of stress and other psychosocial processes in understanding neighborhood or place effects on health?

617
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:05,900
And then experiments and quasi experiments. So we read two of those today.

618
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,729
But this is sort of considered when we're thinking about quality of evidence.

619
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:18,020
We talked about that before, ecologic study, kind of low in terms of helping us understand causation.

620
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,739
Randomized controlled trials at the other end of the spectrum.

621
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:27,080
Right. And so if we can do experiments or quasi experiments, we have stronger evidence for causation.

622
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:34,850
So there's a growing interest in those. Of course, they're expensive and then dynamic models and simulations.

623
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:40,400
So neighborhoods are dynamic systems with interactions and feedback loops.

624
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:48,710
And so people have started doing some work with things like agent based models to think about neighborhoods and how.

625
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,270
So we're going to talk about gentrification a little bit. But that's.

626
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:10,410
Okay. So I'm going to show you this little video is pretty sure. And.

627
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:30,430
So some of you brought up this idea of gentrification in your comments.

628
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:40,000
And I wanted us to sort of think about that and kind of the implications for health and the implications for segregation.

629
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:48,550
So could gentrification reduce segregation by race and socioeconomic status?

630
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:17,190
Maybe temporarily. Right.

631
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:28,800
But then ultimately not, it will just recreate segregation and increase displacement, which is what we were just seeing sort of in the video.

632
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:36,889
So like there is this kind of idea that gentrification could temporarily reduce segregation by race and ethnicity,

633
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:40,520
but it sort of probably doesn't over the long term.

634
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:49,040
So what kinds of policies could help prevent displacement of long term longtime residents of gentrifying communities?

635
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:59,640
Yeah. No. In a different way.

636
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:12,040
I know that I'm in the area again today and I saying this should be 2017 tech that this company

637
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:19,230
actually I want to pay more taxes to make sure that they use affordable housing for three years

638
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:28,530
before I know what everyone tries to move in and take so much money and this place being so

639
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:37,230
close to a lot of people which are just the same thing in Berkeley and all the people are like,

640
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:44,340
we can have this and don't want people to come to our neighborhoods.

641
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:54,150
So I think make the comments like paying for affordable housing.

642
01:26:55,230 --> 01:27:05,280
And I was thinking she has to be sane. Walker is building a public office specifically and saying that they should also people.

643
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:16,640
So I guess, like, you know, some sit in the holding bags, but I think that should be like strong, you know, like laws that actually.

644
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah. So, like local area of city is kind of.

645
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,240
Imposing regulations on businesses that might.

646
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:32,040
Contributed to the that as a way to try to.

647
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:41,440
Affordable housing. Any other thoughts on policy is that you could put in place to try to prevent displacement?

648
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:48,190
Yeah. Control. Okay. So you can have rent control policies.

649
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:55,860
Which sometimes backfires. So there are complex policies.

650
01:27:55,940 --> 01:28:03,220
But yeah, that's like one possibility. Yeah.

651
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:11,600
This is the type. Yeah.

652
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:15,490
So there could be limits to how much you can increase friends.

653
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,570
There can be policies around property taxes for a long time.

654
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:23,950
Residents. One thing that can happen if you you're not a renter, you own your house.

655
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:28,570
But as the neighborhood gentrified,

656
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:36,159
housing values increase and then your property tax bill goes up and that can make it difficult to continue to stay.

657
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:43,830
So there can be policies around that. There's a for you.

658
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,319
So I think it was in your in the article that you shared where you can require that new

659
01:28:51,320 --> 01:29:00,530
development set aside a certain percent of units for low income residents so that yeah.

660
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:09,890
So there are these types of policies that, that areas, municipalities in particular can put into place to try to address this.

661
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:14,420
But but it's it's challenging. It's a challenging issue.

662
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:29,040
And then if we want to think about, you know, if we think about segregation by income and access,

663
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:39,719
I mean of the US and race and ethnicity as being sort of the fundamental cause of differences in resources available in different areas.

664
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:48,090
Like from that, the model that we looked at, right, that was all the way on the left side is segregation by X and race ethnicity.

665
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:54,180
What are some actions that can be taken to reduce segregation in nine gentrifying areas?

666
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:15,430
And maybe before that, do we think that this like is this an approach that we might want to take to reduce area level disparities and help?

667
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,080
Come on, you say no. I'm sure. You're not sure.

668
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,270
Yeah. Yes, there, definitely.

669
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:35,920
So I. I didn't know the area.

670
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:44,050
And so. Oh.

671
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:52,440
I. They're thinking your have.

672
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:03,280
And it's like. The border area.

673
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:09,070
I totally. Absolutely.

674
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:16,960
A lot of people want. Certain demographics having.

675
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:31,490
In. Immigration cars and busses.

676
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:38,470
When you ask them what actions could be taken. Or.

677
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:54,450
Quite, quite a lot of that has to do. It's obvious that by allowing.

678
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:12,550
No, but that's a great puzzle. That's not really about moving people physically to a new place, but increasing access to places.

679
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:16,220
Yeah, that's a really interesting. Point. Yeah.

680
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,350
No, no, no. I think was.

681
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:25,610
Mhm. I, I just, I was shocked when I heard.

682
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:40,600
U.S. I assume that the federal government wants to make sure you get first preference.

683
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:47,879
What has been your school placement school and your mind?

684
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:53,130
You need to just switch that way because a lot of you know,

685
01:32:53,820 --> 01:33:02,610
a lot nowadays that I think just having what you already knew so that when you get home they're optimized.

686
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:10,170
They can just be. Yeah it just might be a nice entertainment.

687
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:15,920
Even though it just make peace and lost.

688
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:19,379
What is it that happened to change?

689
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:26,610
Like the changing districts in that you have to change schools and it just just messes up, you know, like we 13.

690
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:33,010
So I don't think access to any school and law school.

691
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:58,910
And. But that I feel it should be a little more regulated from, like, a top down.

692
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:07,760
Yeah. As far as, like. Like that.

693
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:14,050
I know that it is like riding on a lot of jobs to be.

694
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:23,620
However, those jobs are not necessarily giving them the access and affordability to stay in.

695
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:35,470
And I think that's a big problem as well that. There's no way to really, like, reduce segregation because, like, you can't.

696
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:39,810
Yeah. So there have to also be economic opportunity.

697
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:43,860
Yeah. Way in order to make. Right.

698
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:47,140
Not only to access it, but live and thrive in it.

699
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:51,900
Yeah. So.

700
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:02,880
But it does look like you were supposed to go with this idea of selecting the principles.

701
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,580
Where. Take the test. Senior White House.

702
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:20,870
And then there's. You know, a portion of that said another portion.

703
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:33,780
And then another question. But each high school.

704
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:40,290
Europe. Top high school.

705
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:50,120
Right side, like around 900 to 1000. Depending on your area neighborhood.

706
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,460
You know so a lot of our problem with that.

707
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:02,810
More to your neighborhood but like. Better.

708
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:13,249
Yeah. Still. I think it's a bit controversial, but it was a way to reduce segregation and early access to.

709
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:20,510
Yeah. I think New York is doing has been doing that to New York City with some of their like really selective schools, too.

710
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:25,700
And it's controversial. Yeah. Yeah.

711
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:30,440
I think this is, uh, this one is really it's really challenging,

712
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:43,100
particularly given the nature of our economy in the US to do this because these market forces are driving a lot of this segregation.

713
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:51,719
Um, and so it's really tricky as like anything that you try to do, there's kind of like ways around it and it,

714
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,840
it doesn't always work like we were talking about with rent control or some of these other things.

715
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:03,050
Like there can be unintended consequences of these policies that can make the situation worse instead of better.

716
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:11,030
Um, I think school choice has been another one where it's also increased segregation and in some schools.

717
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:16,610
Um, and so that's, that's tricky. The things that we think might work don't always work.

718
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:21,559
And I think it gets back to the point about some of these interventions that some of you brought up.

719
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:29,670
It's like when you focus on one single thing that's part of like a much bigger and more complicated and dynamic problem.

720
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,730
You don't necessarily see the changes that you expect because you aren't really changing the system.

721
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:37,940
You're just changing just this one little piece of it.

722
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:44,450
Um, so with that, let's take a break and then come back and I know you haven't been in your groups in a while,

723
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,520
but try to remember who is in your group.

724
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:54,410
And we're going to break into groups and talk about the paper for today, the paper that was about the corner store intervention.

725
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:59,510
So come back come back at 1120 and we'll start that.

726
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:48,890
Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

727
01:38:53,050 --> 01:39:06,180
Oh, you know. No, those.

728
01:39:42,460 --> 01:40:12,910
Know. And I thought, okay, you know, do you have cancer or not?

729
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:23,740
Okay. Yeah. Let me let me walk. Okay.

730
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:42,930
This whole show. My therapist.

731
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,610
Okay. Oh, no.

732
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:59,430
Okay, let me try it. Let me push this button again, and then maybe it will. They're okay.

733
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:03,989
I thought it would automatically do it when you get.

734
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:09,780
Does everybody. So.

735
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,440
Okay. Yeah.

736
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,860
If you haven't turned it in yet, it won't give you an assignment.

737
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:27,140
Okay, so I'll have to thank you for telling me that. I'll, um. I will make sure that I click that button again after every event turned a.

738
01:41:43,150 --> 01:42:23,920
That's why. What?

739
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:57,840
Yeah, sure. What?

740
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:38,190
Yeah. That's part of the.

741
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:52,080
Your group. Group tents are down here if you want to grab those and then find your find your group members.

742
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:04,880
What? There.

743
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:27,280
Yes. They're here.

744
01:48:34,030 --> 01:49:08,430
I. It worth much.

745
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:29,670
I think it. We're waiting for.

746
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:54,520
I. I'm actually. I don't know that I.

747
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:23,100
Oh, it's not. I don't know.

748
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:36,920
Yeah. Like.

749
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:48,810
Yeah. Yeah.

750
01:50:52,970 --> 01:51:00,250
I'm in a. I've got.

751
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:15,440
My answer was no.

752
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:46,740
So nice work. Well.

753
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:20,630
Yeah. I that's the way.

754
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:37,030
Oh. Yeah.

755
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:47,230
No, you're. And the.

756
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:57,120
Oh, I'm sorry. Moving.

757
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:15,310
Yeah. It's still. Yeah.

758
01:53:20,990 --> 01:56:25,760
I. Questions about this big.

759
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:39,570
Okay. Yeah.

760
01:56:40,660 --> 01:57:23,760
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

761
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,030
But I. Let me see.

762
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:32,770
Cause I think I have. It's.

763
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:18,680
Oh. Yeah.

764
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:39,860
Do you regret? Social activity over the last year has encouraged outside.

765
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:47,810
I yeah. Yeah.

766
01:58:51,610 --> 01:59:00,110
And then I think they were here for a while.

767
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:04,520
I was having a hard time. And I have no idea what.

768
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:07,970
I have no idea, you know, like.

769
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,580
What the what the presentation of their results means.

770
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:27,100
But. Yeah.

771
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:34,570
Getting ready for. Yeah.

772
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:44,460
Asylum seekers. Change the finger.

773
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:15,260
Yeah. This one is.

774
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:26,530
Serious storms.

775
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:59,460
Yeah. Like a new version.

776
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:10,900
Yeah. Right?

777
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:14,710
That's right.

778
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:46,320
Okay. That is.

779
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:11,000
I. Oh.

780
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:39,360
Oh, no. I do not know how they do.

781
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:07,010
I didn't. But.

782
02:05:06,870 --> 02:06:15,970
I mean. I feel like I just.

783
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:54,830
Yeah. Right.

784
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:35,430
Yeah. I think that's great. Like.

785
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:45,700
But with her.

786
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:21,610
Oh, yeah. I.

787
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:40,410
Oh, good. Business on my feet.

788
02:08:42,150 --> 02:08:47,290
How you got mine? Oh, I had at least three offers.

789
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:56,770
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's great. I didn't make.

790
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:14,690
Yeah. I think, you know, especially when you're on there sometimes, maybe always I'll just go partially because I know this is probably free.

791
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:19,530
All right. Already, right.

792
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:31,550
There you have it. Okay.

793
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:39,030
Yeah, I like it.

794
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:56,040
I think it's really hard. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
02:09:56,390 --> 02:10:08,330
But just like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:23,090
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:32,400
So. That's something from.

798
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:39,850
Trust me, it's a public.

799
02:11:52,760 --> 02:12:00,300
She's. Okay.

800
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:28,900
Why? It's interesting.

801
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:48,750
Yeah. You know.

802
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:55,100
Yes. I'm not going to go.

803
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:10,950
There's not much. But I really.

804
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:28,750
But yeah, I was actually.

805
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:55,050
Yeah. This is all part.

806
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:35,050
This is. Business says influence is.

807
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:50,380
Yeah. Yeah, she was really nice.

808
02:14:56,310 --> 02:15:05,110
Julian Castro. Yes, there was.

809
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:21,290
That was the reason for the behavior that you guys had, because I was watching.

810
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:32,950
Every word of it.

811
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:53,780
I think that's a very. But I'm.

812
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:15,690
I mean, this is like information overload. Yeah.

813
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:25,300
It's like when I was just, like, this is completely different.

814
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:30,700
But on the other hand, are you guys ready?

815
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:42,150
Right here. Let's just say that, you know, for you, I want to make sure you do this better.

816
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:53,690
Yeah, I feel that you're looking for the right kind of data.

817
02:16:56,910 --> 02:17:08,570
Was. The reality is this is the thing that.

818
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:20,570
And this one as well.

819
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:27,610
And I would. I never thought about it that.

820
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:53,030
I didn't really know what to do when I it.

821
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:03,520
Which is.

822
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:28,600
I. During the campaign.

823
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:39,040
The group in the back is really into this. So we'll get started.

824
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:47,650
Really. It's very clear that in five or ten years.

825
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:57,710
I wish that not. Excuse.

826
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:11,700
Still, he said that was good enough.

827
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:15,450
We can work together. I think it's just a.

828
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:27,710
I mean.

829
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:39,270
Thought. Okay.

830
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:43,020
Let's get started, you guys. Good. Okay. All right.

831
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:49,770
So let's start with describing the intervention that they did.

832
02:19:49,800 --> 02:20:06,860
Who wants to take that one? We volunteer. I mean, just calling a group group to watch this group to describe the intervention to us.

833
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:19,050
And we were like the intervention was devastating to urban communities.

834
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:28,299
Yeah. And we found out they did. Basically two things.

835
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:30,520
Want to ease up on our cell conversion.

836
02:20:30,850 --> 02:20:40,330
They change the entire area and all the stores and kind of like rearrange the stores all they like how they look like.

837
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:44,950
And they also install some new things into the stores.

838
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:55,950
And the second thing they do is to. Provide some training to the store owners to provide some increase their owner engagement.

839
02:20:56,260 --> 02:21:01,170
Maintain the profitability of the store since to.

840
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:09,499
Yeah. So they they ended up with three intervention stores and five comparison stores.

841
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:17,239
They initially wanted four of each, but then one of the stores decided not to participate and they never really explain why.

842
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:21,290
I think a couple of you and your comments were like, why? Why did they stop?

843
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:25,459
I don't know. Maybe it was just too much of a pain or something.

844
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:33,380
But so they ended up with three intervention stores and five comparison stores, and they they did a makeover of the stores.

845
02:21:34,130 --> 02:21:44,750
So they put up new signs and painted. And did security upgrades change the layout, gave them refrigeration equipment, changed product placement,

846
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:49,100
and did social marketing promotions for healthful eating, training and business practices.

847
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:52,520
All of a sudden it was pretty comprehensive, like what they did.

848
02:21:53,030 --> 02:22:01,280
Um, the stores were located in two predominantly Mexican-American communities in Los Angeles that had been characterized as food swamps.

849
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:08,300
So places where there was just not that there wasn't food available, but that there was a lot of less healthy food available.

850
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:14,630
And so they were trying to improve community perceptions regarding corner stores

851
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:19,880
in order to get more people to go there and purchase and consume healthy foods.

852
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:25,990
Far right discuss the conceptual model guiding the intervention.

853
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:30,890
Anybody want to take a stab at that one? Yes.

854
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:39,970
Jackie is brave. Okay.

855
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:49,760
Yeah. Cute. And it's a good time.

856
02:24:54,730 --> 02:25:01,010
It was and it was complicated. They did a lot better, but just put it on the computer.

857
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:07,340
Oh, wow. And you did like. Oh, it's just oh, I don't know how to do that.

858
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:14,450
But if you know how to do that, you can try to email this computer by any chance, cause I can.

859
02:25:14,510 --> 02:25:27,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Email it to me and I can pull it up. You know, I do know how to do email and I would imagine how to do that.

860
02:25:27,350 --> 02:25:38,480
Okay. What?

861
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:42,849
I don't have access to Gmail. Okay. I really do know.

862
02:25:42,850 --> 02:25:50,860
How did this email I don't quite know what's occurring here, let's say, oh, I'm signed in as somebody else.

863
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:54,400
Then let's let me do this.

864
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:59,020
Just. I want to sign this personnel.

865
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:09,209
I know. There we go. Are. Now.

866
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:12,810
Let me end up with. There we go.

867
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:24,550
Can I spell my name? A lot of pressure with you watching me, the notes and all of that.

868
02:26:24,570 --> 02:26:31,110
All of you were watching the segment. Okay.

869
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:36,950
Okay. Yes, it's me. I just sent you. You just sent it. Okay.

870
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:40,850
Yeah. All right. Just now?

871
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:45,410
Yeah. Oh, but I just got a date.

872
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:55,370
Okay. Okay.

873
02:26:55,590 --> 02:27:02,480
So. Is it to you?

874
02:27:02,570 --> 02:27:12,820
It's to tease. And that's why. I in-browser the way that I copy and paste.

875
02:27:14,610 --> 02:27:17,930
And then update go.

876
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:26,360
The that are near the group in the back. Thank you.

877
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:29,420
Thank you. You have to walk us through that.

878
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:35,230
Yeah. Tell us. Well, that's what you did.

879
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,670
Okay. So it's a lot. But we wanted to have it.

880
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:49,230
We started with just coming up with the exposure, the outcome, because the intervention is the exposure where you see your outcome.

881
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:53,440
And then we looked at the perception of horror stories.

882
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:57,370
Sorry, the corner store patronage.

883
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:01,450
Heritage, neighborhood perception of healthcare, the sensibility.

884
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:06,690
Systems like SNAP benefits, purchasing of fruit, vegetables, fruits and vegetables.

885
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:09,960
Creativity and consumption of fruits and vegetables.

886
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:18,890
Consumption versus actually purchasing them and then actually consuming things that the authors that you stratify by.

887
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:26,010
So. Okay. So.

888
02:28:27,990 --> 02:28:40,140
So. So with the corner store intervention, that did change how people perceive the corner stores as well as impact how what sorts of people trends.

889
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:47,010
This is what they thought was going to happen. Yeah. So like if there's one part of stories that.

890
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:57,080
How unhealthy fruits and vegetables are going to increase. Perception of healthy food accessibility was with the use of obesity.

891
02:28:57,080 --> 02:29:02,600
But then with more mentions, you would not have the perception.

892
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:09,730
But then also just like General. Increase of purchasing and then consumption ever since then.

893
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:16,880
We also looked at neighborhoods like. Oh, you're like the Virgin founder.

894
02:29:18,390 --> 02:29:26,100
So, um. So sometimes we forget that whether or not they really exposed expose.

895
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:30,170
Then someone's neighborhood is also.

896
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:37,530
There need to be and there's something to be given that these were selected neighborhoods that were predominantly.

897
02:29:40,410 --> 02:29:47,530
And based on that, we know that there is a decision. I think an obesity on an individual.

898
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:52,680
In the neighborhood. It would be a.

899
02:30:01,610 --> 02:30:08,890
And then things like utility. You can also have food assistance that can be seen as well as whether or not you can actually go.

900
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:16,410
So. Except for credit card verses. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:24,389
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's great. I mean, so it's like they do this intervention, right?

902
02:30:24,390 --> 02:30:31,390
Because. So they're trying to understand how these neighborhood conditions might impact obesity.

903
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:31,820
Right.

904
02:30:31,830 --> 02:30:44,549
And so they think part of the way this happens is by shaping access to food and that access to food influences food purchasing and food consumption,

905
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:47,750
which then has impacts on adiposity.

906
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:52,799
So. So, yes, all of these kinds of relationships are here.

907
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:55,770
So they're thinking that operating through those kind of pathways,

908
02:30:55,770 --> 02:31:00,810
that they're trying to address all of these kind of different pieces in their model.

909
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:10,440
All right. So let's. All right.

910
02:31:10,450 --> 02:31:17,080
Describe the data and methods used to test the researchers main research question.

911
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:22,620
He volunteers for that one. Three.

912
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:31,360
Four. Yeah, yeah. We have.

913
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:47,850
It's like having. Last night hybrid.

914
02:31:49,490 --> 02:31:52,820
That's right. Are you on the last?

915
02:31:54,350 --> 02:32:00,260
Yeah. Oh, you're in the last one. Oh, shoot. Do you want to wait till the last one will come back to you?

916
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:04,339
Oh, that sounds like you. No, don't know.

917
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:10,650
You're fine. Anybody want to do number three? I'll do it.

918
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:14,970
Okay, let's go for it. And then we can have more time to devote to the fun.

919
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:22,990
Okay. Main research question Can community level changes be achieved by improving the food environment through corner store conversions?

920
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:28,200
Based on their main question was the data came from a repeated cross sectional household

921
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:34,320
survey that randomly selected households surrounding the intervention and comparison stores.

922
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:40,920
So they asked questions before the intervention and then 1 to 2 years later because they were interested in seeing change.

923
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:49,229
And so we looked at differences between baseline and follow up for the comparison and intervention groups for all of the variables,

924
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:56,790
including their five outcomes. So they were interested in perceived accessibility of healthy foods and whether that increased after the intervention,

925
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:05,880
the perception of corner stores, or whether people had positive or negative perceptions of corner stores, food purchasing and eating behaviors.

926
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:12,930
And they tested for significant differences in the change scores using regression models with the interaction of intervention,

927
02:33:12,930 --> 02:33:20,370
status and time they controlled for sex, age, negativity, status, language spoken at home education and food assistance.

928
02:33:22,290 --> 02:33:25,290
Oh, that's it. That was one. That's what they did.

929
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:31,680
That was their kind of their data. So what did they find?

930
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:39,210
Did the intervention work? You very much take that on.

931
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:51,160
Yeah. Yeah.

932
02:33:51,160 --> 02:34:00,430
So and importantly, regardless of interventions to how those perceptions of food accessibility and corner stores improved over time.

933
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:06,940
So it didn't matter if you lived near an intervention store or a control store.

934
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:13,209
These things improved over time, suggesting that it may not have really been about that particular intervention, that it was done.

935
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:17,440
It could have been related to something else that was happening in the environment at the time,

936
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:24,160
but there were no effects on patronage, purchasing and consumption of healthy foods or it wasn't significant.

937
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:33,339
Right. Okay. Now, Francis, tell us your your intervention that could meet the criteria described in the conclusions.

938
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:40,030
And I'll just say they're looking for things intervene food environment interventions that are part of broader

939
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:45,730
public health initiatives that include the combination of individual community and policy level solutions.

940
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:49,770
Okay. So again.

941
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:57,510
For or against the market for any of the products.

942
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:27,840
Organizations like libraries and more are paired with a partner.

943
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:39,470
Yeah. So it sounds like you're bringing in like an education component, which wasn't, you know, a big part of this intervention that they do.

944
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:45,319
And so an education component and then involving more community organizations.

945
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:49,280
So not just the stores, but hospitals and churches and things like that.

946
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,339
And also you had like the food bank kind of thing.

947
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:57,770
So you're also thinking about making food available without charge, right?

948
02:35:57,770 --> 02:36:04,040
Because this intervention focused on purchasing. Other groups.

949
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:11,030
Why did you guys come up with for an intervention that's bigger than the one that they tried here?

950
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:25,969
Anybody else want to share theirs? Yeah, but I didn't break it up.

951
02:36:25,970 --> 02:36:28,990
I was just thinking. Okay.

952
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:41,450
Yeah, but that. Something.

953
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:56,930
Interesting. I actually didn't know about this. So you can use if you buy certain food products, you can double the value of your snap benefit.

954
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:10,670
Yeah. And so that has to be in conjunction with that particular story.

955
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:13,860
So I think so it's one of the stories.

956
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:18,660
Yeah. Okay. But I don't know.

957
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:25,460
Yeah. That's that's an interesting play. And it has an education component, but.

958
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:32,680
Here? Sometimes. Yeah. Any other interventions.

959
02:37:37,770 --> 02:37:38,819
All right. I do.

960
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:48,959
I do think it's challenging to come up with these, because you do have to address like you have to address multiple factors, not just one.

961
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:56,370
And in terms of feasibility, that can be challenging because of time and money and things like that.

962
02:37:56,370 --> 02:38:03,059
So I think the point is that for these types of interventions to be successful,

963
02:38:03,060 --> 02:38:09,660
they probably have to be on a fairly large scale and they have to address multiple levels of

964
02:38:09,660 --> 02:38:17,340
influence and that oftentimes our interventions aren't designed that way for practical reasons,

965
02:38:17,640 --> 02:38:21,240
but then we don't really see big impacts of those interventions.

966
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:29,820
And so I think thinking through that and what kinds, as we've talked about throughout this semester,

967
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:40,980
what kinds of interventions are the things that address fundamental causes and that are more likely to have a big and a lasting impact?

968
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:50,290
Just keeping those in mind. And then just one reminder again, if you if you weren't here right at the beginning of the class,

969
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:59,440
make sure that you sign up for a presentation date, because next week is our last regular week of class, believe it or not.

970
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:03,229
And then we're moving into the presentation part of us.

971
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:10,150
So we'll have three weeks of presentations, the first one being the week before Thanksgiving break and then two weeks after we get back.

972
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:16,330
And then your final project will be do that class, do us any questions?

973
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:20,280
Okay. Have a good weekend.
