1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:09,510
Today you have your first lab and the lab is now posted in canvas.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,450
There will also be a few hard copies in case you do not have a device to work on it.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:28,520
So the idea is that it will be an in-class exercise not to be graded, not to be their name,

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,850
just for you to have some practice and should be somewhat, I guess, closely related to the homework.

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:47,310
So in case you feel like you should do what sort of fine tuning or adjustments to the homework based on on the lab.

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:58,640
All right. So today we are going to start talking about mostly real world stuff.

7
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:07,070
So they will discuss associations, very practical issues about describing associations,

8
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:16,540
identifying them, and some words on the use of epidemiologic language, the proper use of the analogy.

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:29,210
So we are all sort of on the same page. First, we will discuss how to identify associations and infer size the importance of comparison groups.

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,350
Then we will go through the attributes of an association and then use them to describe them.

11
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:44,149
And at the end, we will do a very brief overview on interpreting associations.

12
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,240
And again, this is just an overview because.

13
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,540
For the rest of the course, really, especially the second part.

14
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,550
This is what we are going to be doing in much finer detail.

15
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:08,210
Okay. But yes, it's important from now on that you have a basic outline on how to interpret associations.

16
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:19,070
So as we have discussed before European logic studies, we aim to make causal influence.

17
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:31,490
In other words, whether a variable a that we call exposure or treatment or any of all these names causes a variable life,

18
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,660
which we call outcome or any of these names.

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,290
So again, these names are all synonyms of each other for exposure.

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,719
And these are synonyms of each other for all. In the real world.

21
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:59,390
We go and take measurements using our epidemiology methods, and then we obtain values on random variables which we call estimates.

22
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:07,340
Right? So any variable that we designate as an exposure or an outcome, they are just random variants.

23
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:23,490
And in the real world, for the most part, we find that the summary measures of an outcome differ by levels or categories of an exposure.

24
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,860
We say that there is an association. Whether the association represents causation, it's it's another discussion.

25
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,150
Okay. But in the real world, all we can say is that there may be an association.

26
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,100
So. Now. How do I identify associations between two votes?

27
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,880
Here is a bit of a checklist that they put together for you.

28
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,500
The first step is we need to compare at least two groups or levels or categories.

29
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:09,710
The comparison of those groups are defined as the comparison groups are defined as plus of one very.

30
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,170
Right. You recall that we gave also different names to the classes.

31
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,850
They can call them equal levels, categories, even locations.

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,820
And the comparison between the groups is made with respect to the values of a second value.

33
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,320
Finally, one of the variables should be identifiable as the exposure and the other as well.

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,430
Now let's put this checklist to work with an example.

35
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,860
Suppose we find this statement in the literature or in the news?

36
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:58,490
In a survey, knee joint pain was reported by 30% of women with obesity and by 10% of women without obesity.

37
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:09,500
The question is, is an association being described so we can pass this sentence checklist as follows.

38
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,170
The first step is need to compare at least two groups.

39
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Which groups are being compared in the state? Women with obesity and women without obesity.

40
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,190
Right. Yeah. Those are the two groups being compared.

41
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,960
Second step is the comparison groups are defined as glasses, categories, levels or locations of one variable.

42
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:50,660
What would that variable be? Well, this with obesity and without obesity should be classes of one variable.

43
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,590
How can we call that? Obviously we'll get.

44
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,879
Then the comparison between groups, meaning these two groups is made with respect to the values of a second.

45
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
Very. Was that secondary? He was knee joint pain.

46
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,010
But. Because we were given percentages of knee joint pain in each of these two groups.

47
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,490
And finally, one of the variables should be identifiable as the exposure and the other as the outcome.

48
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,450
In this statement, which one?

49
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,180
We could say it's the exposure. Obesity.

50
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,720
No, that's that's reasonable. Yeah. And the other could be.

51
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,530
Yeah. Joint thing. Right. Would it be reasonable to say that any joint pain could be an exposure and obesity an outcome to.

52
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:56,710
Yeah, possibly. Right. Because, um, I guess, you know, if, if you think sort of, uh,

53
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:06,410
in terms of how a sequence of events would be for this to happen, perhaps, uh, new joint pains might be, uh,

54
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:15,080
so crippling that perhaps people become much less mobile and eventually, you know, that might lead to problems with,

55
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,620
um, energy balance, etc. and eventually it will be still, you know, it's also possible.

56
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,850
But again,

57
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:33,590
the important thing is that you have at least one possible mechanism that allows you to justify why you are going to call one of the variables,

58
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:49,080
exposure and the other out. So here I had also the, um, the first case that most of you, um, state exposure obesity and outcome region.

59
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,390
Okay. How about this all over stadium?

60
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:07,260
In this survey, 30% of women with obesity reported having the joint pain, whereas 70% of women with obesity reported not having it.

61
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,300
Is an association being stated here? No.

62
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,850
No. Why not? There are no two groups.

63
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,270
There are no two different groups. You are just being given two percentages that are the complement of each other.

64
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,240
Within one group, Women with Obesity. Right. So you are missing a comparison group.

65
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,670
Right now. I have a couple of, uh. Uh.

66
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,600
Exercises as balls. Let's see if they work today.

67
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,800
Uh, if not, you know, we can just sort of talk about them.

68
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,250
So these were from billboards from a few years back before marijuana was legal.

69
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,260
Um, so this one was a billboard on a narrow Dexter road, actually.

70
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:10,350
That's it, then. Of seven of ten Stockbridge teens have never used marijuana.

71
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,000
The thing is, Stockbridge is like a neighborhood there any anybody from this area?

72
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,020
Okay. So the question is, is an association being described by this billboard?

73
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:47,060
It seems he's working for tourists. Who? Okay.

74
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,140
All right. Should we look at the responses? Okay, great.

75
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:11,720
So 99% say no. And I would agree with with you the majority, because what's missing is like a comparison.

76
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,130
Right. Okay. Uh, next.

77
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,739
This was the following year. Exactly the same spot.

78
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:36,080
So they changed the the message with is is two out of three teens choose friends who don't use drugs or alcohol.

79
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,460
It is an association being described.

80
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:14,050
Okay. I think there lots of participation.

81
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,750
That's great. Um. Okay.

82
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,980
That's. You make it to.

83
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,890
All right. Aha. This was less clear cut.

84
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,930
So, um.

85
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,570
I would like to stay with the majority again here.

86
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,440
Um, because what's missing?

87
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,420
Also a comparison group. However, if if, you know,

88
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:13,410
I'm very much open to alternative views the reality if any one who thinks that that an association is being described and would

89
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:23,520
like to to state that reasons you are welcome to do so and maybe we could have a helpful illuminating discussion then on that.

90
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:36,680
Or forever. Hold your piece. Um.

91
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:49,409
Well, it's, you know, I guess when one could say, well, two out of three teens choose friends who don't use drugs or alcohol,

92
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:55,350
that means one of three teens chooses friends who use drugs of alcohol.

93
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,330
But again, there is only one group which is against teens.

94
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:09,960
Right. You would need another a comparison group who it seems would need to be non teens.

95
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,830
Right. I guess that's as close as what one would think of a comparison.

96
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,620
So because there is no comparison group, really, there is no association. Okay.

97
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,980
And I think there is that finally. This one was on Liberty Street.

98
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,930
States that legalized marijuana had 25% fewer opioid related deaths.

99
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,360
It is a bit. I'd be a bit trickier.

100
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,530
So that that's epidemiology.

101
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,550
You know, it's not always clear cut. Yes, of course.

102
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,540
What is the time? Let them play playing states that legalize marijuana.

103
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,520
Well, we don't know. But but the the I guess the question is, does it, mother?

104
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,820
Do we really need that information just to state whether there is an association or not?

105
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:27,210
Stating whether there is an association is a very agnostic process, is just sort of, you know, yes or no.

106
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,120
Okay. Uh huh. This one is interesting.

107
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,320
You ready? Any final votes.

108
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,640
Okay. Uh huh.

109
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,930
76% say yes and 24% say no.

110
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,430
And again, I stay with the majority.

111
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:02,760
But for this one, I would really like to hear the rationale of why somebody said yes.

112
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Is there an nickel? Because there's two different groups. Yes.

113
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,010
Except one of them is sort of tacit.

114
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,910
One of them is not written but is so sort of obvious.

115
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,590
That. A tacit comparison is being made.

116
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,900
You know, you have to be so careful with the use of language. It says fewer.

117
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,770
So it's like if this sentence had been truncated.

118
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:47,760
So in all fairness, it's an incompletely described association because it should have said explicitly,

119
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:56,280
I would say fewer than what Nicole Nicole Richie identified quite correctly.

120
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,290
So was everybody more or less thinking along those lines when you said yes?

121
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,690
And I suppose if there had you said no, you were thinking, well, strictly speaking, you know, sort of incomplete is an incomplete statement.

122
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:21,310
So. I would say so.

123
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,000
And you yourselves could sort of complete it, you know? Fewer than.

124
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:36,820
Yeah, but but again, it is a good question because this to me also, you know,

125
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,890
I guess illustrates the fact that there is a lot of ambiguity in in our field.

126
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:51,020
And part of my job a little bit is also to train you to, you know, tolerate ambiguity,

127
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,200
really, to increase your resilience for ambiguity, because there is a lot of it.

128
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,790
All right. Now, how do we describe an association?

129
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,100
It is also sort of a series of steps here.

130
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,650
The first one is we always have to identify the exposure and the outcome.

131
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,950
And as you will see from now on in many of your homeworks exercises labs,

132
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,520
one of the first questions will always be was the exposure, was the identify exposure.

133
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,490
And the second step is to use the attributes of an association.

134
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,450
Any association has three attributes. The first one is the direction or shape.

135
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,750
The second one is the magnitude or strength. And the last one is the precision.

136
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,390
This is what many people call statistical significance.

137
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,710
Now, here in this course, we are going to be focusing on the first two opinions.

138
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,930
There will be only maybe one lecture, the end on this, because, I mean,

139
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:17,110
you are taking your statistics courses and there is a difference between epidemiologic thinking and statistical thinking.

140
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:27,310
Even though, of course, they go together. But it's very important that you first become very well acquainted with these first two.

141
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:34,190
All right. So what's the what's the direction of an association, the first step?

142
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,940
Well, the direction refers to.

143
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:48,190
The relation between the two variables in terms of how the outcome goes with respect

144
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:56,080
to the exposure and according to the detection associations can be positive if.

145
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:03,950
Greater values of the outcome correspond to greater values of the exposure.

146
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,520
So just in this little diagram. Yes.

147
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:15,460
Question is very piece of. The outcome for the.

148
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:26,870
Of the relation between developments? Yes. Now the direction of that association can also be inverse.

149
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:38,650
If. Increasing values of the exposure correspond to decreasing values of the outcome or vice versa.

150
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:49,000
And this is represented by this diagram here. Or an association can be in existence.

151
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,320
There may be no association. No.

152
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,450
If there is no difference in values of the outcome.

153
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:13,610
Between different levels of exposure. So you may recall the example on daily marijuana, smoking and Alzheimer's disease.

154
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,580
Uh, yeah. You may have a little PTSD over that some,

155
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:27,390
but they brought it back here just to use it to to describe the association with what we are learning today.

156
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:36,709
So you recall among the exposed, uh, the marijuana smokers, the probability of outcome was five divided by ten.

157
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,940
And among the unexposed, the probability of the outcome was three divided by ten.

158
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:51,560
So these are the comparison groups, right? So the variable is marijuana smoking, and the two levels are yes or no, exposed or unexposed.

159
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,610
So what is the direction of the association? Is it positive, inverse or no?

160
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,370
Positive because. Yes, marijuana smoking.

161
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,590
Goes with higher probability of Alzheimer's.

162
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,590
Right. So both go in the same direction.

163
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,090
There is a positive association between daily smoking and developing Alzheimer's disease over a 30 year period.

164
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,919
And you could further say people who smoke marijuana daily have a higher probability

165
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,300
to develop Alzheimer's disease than do people who do not smoke marijuana.

166
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:43,190
And guess what? This is actually important and helpful because when you are writing your daily paper,

167
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:50,000
this is exactly how everybody expects you to describe the associations that you will expect you will find.

168
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,640
Okay. This is this is standard language for us in epidemiology writing.

169
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:13,180
Now here is a different example. Let's assume that the dichotomous exposure is receiving the COVID vaccine versus not receiving it.

170
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:22,870
So being exposed mean yes, receiving the vaccine, being unexposed means not getting the vaccine.

171
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:32,050
And the outcome is also dichotomous. But is developing COVID 19 or not having the disease?

172
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:45,510
Yeah. So let's say that in this particular example, people who get the vaccine meaning exposed.

173
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:56,060
Have a zero probability of God, whereas people who are unexposed, meaning those who did not get the vaccine, have a.

174
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:04,070
10% probability of the outcome was the direction of the association inverse.

175
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:10,610
Excellent. There is an inverse association between receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and developing COVID 19.

176
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:18,320
Receiving the vaccine is related to a lower probability to develop COVID 19 compared with not receiving the vaccine.

177
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:29,600
Note that you should always include the comparison group not to leave the statements truncated like that.

178
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:40,550
Billboard So you always have to say greater than this other group or more than or compared to this other.

179
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:58,670
Okay. Good. Now there is a nuance in the description of the direction, which is that sometimes even within a given direction,

180
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:10,490
there might be slightly different shapes of the association, especially when you have more than two categories in your exposure or Europe.

181
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,190
So if the exposure is in the ordinal or the continuous scales.

182
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:26,010
Positive and inverse associations can further be of four different types.

183
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,700
The first type is called a linear association.

184
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:41,150
And in these types of associations, again, assume a continuous outcome with many values and a continuous exposure with many values.

185
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:49,520
For an association to be linear, the differences in outcome values between equally exposed,

186
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:59,330
equally based at levels is always the same within equally spaced exposures, right?

187
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,980
So in other words, if you if you remember the characteristics of a line, you will have.

188
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,520
Uh. Slope of one.

189
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:26,720
I guess. Strangely. Now there are also associations that may not be a straight line.

190
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,060
You know, might be a little bit sort of wiggly, but.

191
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:45,930
The differences in outcome values between levels of exposure are always in the same direction, even if the slope varies.

192
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,060
So as you can see here. You know, you have a positive slope here.

193
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,290
Uh, then you have a less inclined slope for the second segment, but still positive.

194
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,220
Then you have a more steep slope for the next segment and so on and so forth.

195
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,150
It's always steep. It's always, you know, a positive result.

196
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,900
When you have that, you have a strictly monotonic association.

197
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,400
Get. The next step is one in which.

198
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,170
For some levels of exposure, for some segments of values of exposure.

199
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:36,290
The differences in outcome flatten meaning this low becomes zero.

200
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,340
But overall, you still have a positive association, right?

201
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,740
You could still trace the straight line. That will have a positive result.

202
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,950
Through these points. And that's the case.

203
00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:05,110
You'll have a monotonic association is no longer strictly monotonic because there are segments of it in which the slope flattens and becomes zero.

204
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,060
Like. And finally, you may also have non monotonic associations.

205
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,960
In which you have some segments of this loop that can go in the opposite direction,

206
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,440
that on average, on average, the average of this loops is still positive.

207
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,909
And you could tell I mean, you could you could calculate the overall is low.

208
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:42,710
But in general, you know, just visually you could say that this is, for example, a positive association region.

209
00:27:51,170 --> 00:28:02,120
Absolutely so. Right. So this also works for Inverse Association, except that, well, the lines would all be, you know, coming down.

210
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,730
Okay. Let's see some some real life examples.

211
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:27,420
On these types of associations. This is the very famous study but Sir Richard Doyle and Brad Thornhill from the mid you know.

212
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:41,450
1900s on smoking and lung cancer, one of the most famous studies in the history of epidemiology, a study of British doctors.

213
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:51,530
And what you have on the Y axis is categories of cigarets smoked per day.

214
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,300
Right. What type of what scale is this variable in?

215
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:08,340
That. Come on. Categorical and which subtype within categorical ordinal.

216
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:16,999
Right. And on the Y axis, you have a measure that which we will actually studied in detail.

217
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,060
But for now, use is a measure of dying from lung cancer.

218
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,600
And in what scale is that variable?

219
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,240
Continues, Christopher. Okay.

220
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:46,510
And what you have here, these these dots represent, you know, the average values of the white variable, which is what the exposure outcome.

221
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,570
Outcome according to categories of the exposure.

222
00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:00,700
Guess what? You could trace a perfect straight line between these dots.

223
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,250
So that's a perfect linear association, and the description would be in words.

224
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,200
There is a positive linear association between the number of daily cigaret smoke and death from lung cancer.

225
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,860
Men who smoke more have higher death rates from lung cancer than do men who smoke less.

226
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:27,620
All right. Now, here is another example.

227
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:38,890
Um from you early studies on fat intake and total mortality at the country level.

228
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:46,690
We will also study these designs in depth to give you a preview of these are called ecologic studies.

229
00:30:47,740 --> 00:31:02,050
But basically what you have on the x axis is a measure of total dietary intake there people per year by country.

230
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,420
So it's an aggregate for countries on the continuous scale.

231
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:17,230
And then on the Y axis, what you have is a measure of death.

232
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,550
Nine is also the continuous scale.

233
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:28,190
And each point represents where each country falls.

234
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:40,870
In this diagram. So you have here the first point is the island, right, was the next one, I think is the Philippines.

235
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,050
Right goes up and then what happens?

236
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,020
You goes back down and Salvador then goes up to Japan.

237
00:31:51,310 --> 00:32:00,010
Then they once they learn I'm sorry, but I think it was the shape of disassociation.

238
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,559
Okay. Non-monetary. Who said?

239
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,990
Non-monetary. Congratulations. So you would say.

240
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,950
And why is it nonmetallic? Because, you know it's going up.

241
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,240
But then this global actually goes down to the next point.

242
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,370
Right. Now. Is it still positive?

243
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,210
How do you know? Yeah.

244
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,820
You know, sort of. Yeah. So abuse that there is a sort of a positive trend.

245
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:42,070
Right. Okay. So would say there is a positive non monotonic association between per capita total dietary fat intake and mortality.

246
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,650
Higher values of total fat intake generally correspond to higher age adjusted death rates.

247
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,690
That's a very nice, clean cashier description.

248
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:03,040
Uh, we could also say, though, that fat intake increases mortality.

249
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,910
Could we? No, we cannot. Excellent.

250
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,790
Why not? Because. Because what for individual country that doesn't change?

251
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:23,810
Well, I mean, that that's correct. But I would say the underlying reason is, again, related to the use of language in epidemiology.

252
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,310
These word increases. Guess what?

253
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Okay. Yes. Implies causation.

254
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:44,170
Why? Because typically the word increases represents a time dynamics.

255
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:54,190
Increases typically implies something has changed over time and change over time, as we will see on Wednesday.

256
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,390
Usually has a causation.

257
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:08,170
Taste to it. So we have to be very careful with how we use every single word that.

258
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,720
So this is why I brought the skull and crossbones here.

259
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,930
This is incorrect. You cannot describe.

260
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:26,240
This association like this because you would be implying that fat intake causes death.

261
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:32,370
And that is probably not. But now we know the nutrition majors here.

262
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,500
That's really not necessarily true, right? But then could we see mortality increases with fat intake?

263
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,800
No, he's just saying, you know, he just switched the earthquake, but still the same problem.

264
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:56,310
So in general, the use of these words increase or decrease or change may be causation.

265
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,640
And I know here you will promise me you will never use these words.

266
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,680
But I know there is a lot of competition in both states because they, for example,

267
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:16,580
describe results of regression analysis as an increase in variable Y of these or X of these many units results in an increase of variable.

268
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,120
That's incorrect. That's incorrect.

269
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,980
We have to become very strict with the use of language.

270
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,910
So please remember us.

271
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:36,329
And this auspicious day when you hear the increase and the increase and increase now mean we can use

272
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:43,170
increase that in very specific contexts when we are measuring both exposure and outcome over time.

273
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,780
James So it's a tired isotope and things are associated or related to higher the death rate.

274
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,680
Yes, that's perfectly legal.

275
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:02,760
That's associated with related to we are actually morally stuck with those two words.

276
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:13,810
It's sort of boring. But, you know, when I'm writing papers or correcting my students, papers say, Well, unfortunately we are not writing poetry.

277
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,480
But, you know, that's okay. People know that. So you're stuck with two words.

278
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,690
It's maybe a little repetitive, some boring, but that's okay.

279
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:30,760
So don't don't use these words unless you are describing actually change over time.

280
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:47,260
Okay. Here is another example for you to think about and discuss what what you think in terms of the direction of this association on the, you know,

281
00:36:47,300 --> 00:37:03,410
said real study on the y axis, you excuse me, x axis, you have actually two variables, although one is only in relation to the other intake of wine.

282
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,370
So let's focus only on this one intake of wine in the continuous scale.

283
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:20,220
No, it's not in the continuous scale. What scale is this in? He's categorical actually is correct.

284
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:29,210
But how do you know? Well, you know, because the measures of association that represented by these points at a specific points of of this.

285
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:40,380
Right. Is not a continuous line. It does give you some some squares here that are telling you this is where we estimated the association.

286
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,060
So you really categorize many. And on the.

287
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,440
Wait until you have risk of cardiovascular disease.

288
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,600
We will learn what risk. He's very firmly, but for now, it's just a measure of getting heart disease right.

289
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,690
What's the direction and shape of the association?

290
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,560
Erection is the inverse and shape and shape.

291
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:27,050
Hmm. But think of of the four types we described.

292
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:40,080
Which one is this of those four types? It perhaps could be of two of those one of its are arguable but.

293
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,460
Which one? No.

294
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:57,120
This could be strictly monotonic if you think that there is still some, uh, you know, changes here that cannot be perceived by the human right.

295
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,490
Or it could be. Not monotonic if you think that this flattens out.

296
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,890
Here. Look. Nonstick the.

297
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:22,050
And so, you know, I think here I gave you that there is a monotonic inverse association between wine intake and risk of cardiovascular disease.

298
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,570
People with higher wine intake have lower disease risk than those with lower wine intake.

299
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,400
We could all say higher intake of wine is related to or associated with lower CVD risk.

300
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:45,420
The two sort of classical words to describe. Now there can be also no associations or no direction.

301
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:56,170
We mention that. And here is an example also from real life on the x axis we have beer intake.

302
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:07,030
Frequency of beer intake in categories is an ordinal variable and on the y axis we have a measure of mortality, of death.

303
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:14,770
And again, what led do you observe in terms of shape association?

304
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,720
There are a lot going on. Should you prepare these for The Lancet?

305
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,810
Well, actually, BMJ not to back.

306
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,840
Not too bad for a null null association. Right? It's a nice association.

307
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:38,510
Okay. So beer intake is not associated or related to mortality risk.

308
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:50,780
All right. Now a few more words on the shape of the association, because there are some special cases.

309
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,220
If the exposure is in the ordinal or the continuous scales,

310
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:04,340
associations can actually take specific shapes without being fully positive or fully inverse.

311
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:11,420
Or fully now. And here is a classic example.

312
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:22,580
It's still the subject of heated debate in nutritional epidemiology, which is that of the association between BMI and mortality.

313
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,140
So. This paper from New England Journal.

314
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:32,500
Um, you have on the x axis body mass index categories.

315
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,020
Right. And ordinal variable many categories. And on the y axis, you have.

316
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:51,989
A measure of death again in the continuously you have two lines representing the association for two groups males in in blue.

317
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,700
I think this is birth assign six and females in red.

318
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:09,380
So what's what's the direction of that association? It's a challenge to describe, right, was the shape.

319
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:20,330
You sort of sort of you shape smiley face shape so you can have specific shapes of associations like you.

320
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:31,670
J Inverted, j, etc. I mean, they may not even conform to an actual letter, but the important thing is to sort of know how to describe.

321
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,149
So how do you go about describing such a, you know,

322
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:44,540
complex association where you have to break it down to its segments and describe segment by segment that correspond to a relatively,

323
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,450
you know, conventional shape.

324
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:56,900
So you could say in this in this case, there is a U-shaped association between body mass index and mortality in either birth sex.

325
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,550
There is an inverse association up to BMI values of about 24.

326
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:12,560
There is no association or perhaps a weak positive in women between BMI 24 and 30 and a positive association at BMI above 30.

327
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:19,990
So you just actually have to spend more words to describe the associations between say, right.

328
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,310
Here is another challenge. What if the exposure is nominal?

329
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:32,450
You remember that scale? The nominal scale. And there are actually no numbers.

330
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,160
Hmm. And this is an example of community health.

331
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:46,270
So this is a study of. Poverty in.

332
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,390
New York community districts, New York City. And I think the boroughs are here, too.

333
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,450
You know, the five boroughs in this. So.

334
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:08,090
Was the exposure. Okay.

335
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:15,150
That's interesting. It could be poverty. Or location, I would say either could work.

336
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,570
Why don't we pick one? Yeah, let's pick.

337
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,310
How about location? It could also be a totality.

338
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,669
But let's say we. We pick location as. As. As the exposure.

339
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,050
And they see poverty as the. So how do we describe this?

340
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,590
Again. We we. We need to use words. Right.

341
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,670
So one option is. Okay, well, there is a positive association between living in community districts these,

342
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,450
these and that the community districts where the poverty is highest.

343
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,700
So it would be positive because living in those districts is related to higher values of poverty.

344
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:10,690
Right. Whereas living in districts these days and that are related to less public.

345
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:18,300
Right. See and clear.

346
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,300
For. All right.

347
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,130
So that those were, you know, that that was the direction of the association and the shape.

348
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,540
Now we are going to deal with the magnitude of the association.

349
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,910
And to do that, we we are going to do a detailed numerical exam.

350
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,860
Suppose you have two towns.

351
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:54,570
One is called a her and the other is called Bibi, for lack of a more creative name.

352
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,180
And. We go to the.

353
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:09,350
Civil register of each down and take a random sample of.

354
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:17,300
20,000 records in each town. And then we classify.

355
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:29,290
Those records, according to the party of the mother, by de means the number of life boats a woman has had to give in time.

356
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,010
And then whether. A baby died.

357
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:48,170
In each group. So we divide parity as high parity using some arbitrary cut point, I guess, you know, some people use five or more as a boat.

358
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:59,890
And the other group is not back. So. When we classify the records.

359
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:09,920
By parity, we find that there are 10,000 records for women with high parity and 10,000 records for women below parity.

360
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:19,140
So you remember the notation, I guess arbitrarily we have called these eight equals one and this level equals zero.

361
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:28,530
The same is true for the other. Done. And then here on this column, you have the number of babies who died.

362
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,430
We are calling infant deaths as well. Variable what?

363
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:39,240
Okay. So this is your summary tables for that exercise in each of the two dots.

364
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:48,030
The first question, as I say, announced earlier, is we finished down what would be the exposure and what would be the outcome?

365
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:59,050
The exposure is. Parity and the outcome in fund.

366
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:06,590
All right. The next question is, is there an association in each step?

367
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:14,060
And again, here you have to connect the knowledge from the prior lectures.

368
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:18,030
How would you. Find out whether there is an association.

369
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:25,470
So remember. You have to first summarize outcome measures.

370
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,360
Summarizing outcome measures depends on. The scale.

371
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:39,330
Of Europe outcome variable. And then you probably have to.

372
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:50,890
Estimate certain types of probabilities or expected values, which, as you may recall, we said were or could be marginal joint or condition.

373
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:58,430
So we that we. A reminder.

374
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:05,350
How would you determine whether there is an association here? Within each town.

375
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,970
Okay. So you are going to compare two things, right? Which things?

376
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,990
Conditional probabilities. Wonderful. Which conditional probabilities.

377
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,690
The conditional probability of. In fact, if.

378
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,540
Exactly in the ex post. That's one conditional probability.

379
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:06,220
And the other. Among the unexposed.

380
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:17,219
Excellent. So here is that exercise again, exactly the same as we have been doing for the previous couple of pictures.

381
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,420
How do we. Yeah.

382
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:30,430
So in the first time, the probability of equals one given a equals one among exposed is 20 divided by 10,000, and the probability of y equals one.

383
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,550
Among the unexposed is four divided by 10,000.

384
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,150
Right. Same notation. Same day.

385
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,760
And in the town maybe when we have these numbers.

386
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,570
So these would be the conditional probabilities. And now you can answer the question.

387
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,490
Let's say in town AA, is there an association between party and infant deaths?

388
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:05,780
Yes, you bet. How do you know there's. Because the conditional probabilities are different.

389
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,660
Right. How about in town?

390
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,370
B. There is an association because the conditional probabilities are different.

391
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:32,950
Or. So we could summarize this exercise by saying, In each town there is a positive association between maternal parity and infant deaths.

392
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,420
By stating this, we are using the direction of the association, right?

393
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:43,840
Because we say it is positive. The higher the parity, the more infant death rate.

394
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,990
How could we add information on how strong the association is?

395
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:59,460
That means how could we add numbers to that association, to that description?

396
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,560
So we have, again, the conditional probabilities here.

397
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:13,440
And to add the strength or the magnitude in numbers to that association, we actually have two options.

398
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:22,220
One option is called going. With the additive escape.

399
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,640
Additive means. Adding up and subtracting.

400
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,440
The other option is going with something called the multiplicative scale.

401
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,380
Multiplicative means. Multiplying or dividing.

402
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:51,910
So two categories of operations and they define the two options we have to numerically describe.

403
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,670
Association. So let's begin with the original sketch.

404
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:09,050
To compare the conditional probabilities in the additive scale, we have to estimate absolute differences.

405
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:21,000
Between the exposure groups. So because in this case the denominators are the same numerically 10,000.

406
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,600
So I have committed the denominators.

407
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:34,469
Let's say in town a. 20 minus four, meaning the number of infant deaths in the exposed minors.

408
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:44,600
The number of infant deaths in the unexposed is 16. So we can say there are 16 more deaths in the high priority group than in the low paid team.

409
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:58,590
That's an absolute difference. That number represents the magnitude or the strength of the association in the additive escape.

410
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:13,490
In town? Bebe We would say 500 -400 equals 110,000.

411
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,910
So there are 100 more deaths in the high fighting group than in the low party.

412
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:27,740
It's just the difference. We subtract one conditional probability from the other.

413
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:37,590
So again, these statements provide a description of the magnitude or strength of the association.

414
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,819
What would it read like for the other escape?

415
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,620
The multiplicative escape? Well.

416
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:58,710
To obtain the magnitude in the multiplicative scale, we have to take relative differences, meaning relative means divide.

417
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,210
So rather than subtract, we are now going to divide.

418
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:15,060
So in down eight, we could divide 24, which is again the number of well, really the probabilities.

419
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:22,570
I have just omitted the denominators because they are the same. This is five and then the description in words.

420
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:29,750
Would be. There are five times more deaths in the High Priority Group than in the low priority.

421
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,550
We could also express this relative difference.

422
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:46,610
With respect to. A percentage.

423
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,450
So from that, to do that,

424
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:04,709
we would subtract one which represents the baseline 100% from the relative difference five and multiply by 100 that difference.

425
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:11,760
And we could say there are 400 more deaths in the hyperactive group than in the low by the group.

426
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:20,810
400% more is not 400% times more.

427
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:27,120
No times is just this number. Is 400% more.

428
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:36,350
In town. Bebe We have 500 divided by 425.

429
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:43,220
So we will say that there are 1.25 times more deaths in the High Priority Group than in the low biting.

430
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,600
We want to express this in terms of percent more.

431
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,550
We would, again, subtract one from this.

432
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:02,340
Relative difference. Multiply one handed and say there are 25% more deaths in the high poverty group than in the low biting.

433
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,930
Okay. Just use of of language.

434
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,660
Is this relatively straightforward? There are regional variations and.

435
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,480
Yes. Very strict. Yes.

436
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:31,430
What are we doing? Right.

437
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:39,230
So we use one because if the probabilities were the same, the ratio would be one.

438
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,760
So you describe how much more with respect to.

439
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,700
The baseline with respect to when there would not be differences.

440
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,810
There will not be differences if the ratio was one.

441
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,190
So anything above one would be more.

442
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:06,780
That's why you have to subtract one. Any other questions?

443
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:20,960
Yes, I'll. Yes.

444
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:29,719
And I apologize. Now, I realize I have changed this example over time, and I still don't seem to get it perfect.

445
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:38,120
But the answer is yes. I guess what I'm saying is I shouldn't have committed the denominators because that might be confusing.

446
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:46,520
But if the sizes of the denominators that mean, if instead of 10,000 everywhere you add different numbers in the denominator,

447
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,700
where you would be comparing here would be the actual probabilities, right?

448
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:04,520
So in other words, thing as if I really had written here 20 divided by 10,000 divided by four divided by 10,000.

449
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:10,130
You must use that. You must use the actual size of the denominator.

450
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:27,480
Is that the question? Okay. Yes.

451
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:39,920
Well, in this case, there is a positive association because high parity, which means more, is related to higher.

452
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:51,030
Invent that probability so that suppose. But you could switch the labels and describe them in the in the other direction.

453
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:59,570
So 25%. Less deaths in the low fighting group compared with a high priority group.

454
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:05,330
Right. It depends sometimes or some on the message that you want to convey.

455
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,950
If there were. How much is four divided by 20?

456
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:26,070
I do not have those abilities myself. Huh?

457
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,670
20%. Point two.

458
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:39,080
So if it is, you look so if if it's point two you'd say that is that you'd say.

459
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:46,590
There are 2.2 times. The number of deaths.

460
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:51,650
In the low priority group as there are in the high priority.

461
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,270
And you would say because the distance from point 2 to 1 is 80.

462
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:06,890
Percent or eight, you would say it is 80% fewer deaths in the group than in the high fighting.

463
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:14,870
Okay. A.

464
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:30,850
No. A question sort of more to get into the interpretation of all this is kind of but the ultimate purpose, what we are doing here.

465
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,159
Question for you. If the association were causal, let's assume it's causal.

466
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,440
Let's assume high parity causes in funds.

467
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:51,670
Okay. And you could change the parity of women as an intervention, obviously, to decrease infant deaths in only one town.

468
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:58,260
Which one you would choose? Are you going to answer this?

469
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,190
Okay. How about I think I have a ball. Would you like to try double?

470
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:06,390
But then you can give us your opinion as to why did you think that?

471
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,600
How about that? Yes, let's do that. Okay.

472
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:19,000
Okay. Okay.

473
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:26,070
It seems we are reaching the. Maximum risk bonds in.

474
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:35,120
This was a tight race, so.

475
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:39,020
But a one.

476
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:48,320
Yeah, that is tough, isn't it? You know, his political decisions are very tough.

477
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:53,750
Um. So.

478
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,700
Okay, Rachel, why don't you tell us about your decision making thinking here?

479
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:05,450
This. I think I'm going to be okay.

480
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:25,290
Right. So Rachel says, if I may repeat, because the acoustics here may not favor us.

481
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:35,970
You picked. Bebe Because you would be saving more.

482
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,270
Actual lives. Um. Because.

483
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:50,310
If you let me ask you sort of I mean, follow up. So if you intervened in Bebe, how many lives would you say?

484
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,360
How many babies? We are in the baby saving business by doing.

485
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,140
Oh, yeah. 800.

486
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:02,070
If you were to intervene in town a.

487
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,750
How many babies would you save? 16.

488
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:11,219
So which one is the baby business savvy?

489
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:15,810
This baby saving baby.

490
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:24,780
Right, baby. So I have to go against the majority here and actually say I'd be greater than the others who answered Baby for exactly the same reason.

491
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:35,700
And that there was a follow up question and you know, we could still try it if this works.

492
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:49,120
Which scale? Let's say, perhaps for those of you who answered BP or those of you who reconsider your age as they are now,

493
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:59,560
think, yeah, okay, maybe some sounds more reasonable. Which scale would you have used to reach that conclusion that it was really the absolute.

494
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:03,160
So let me skip this. The additive escape.

495
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:11,410
So with Rachel's explanation and this sort of intuitive use of the additive scale,

496
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:21,760
we can conclude that the additive is scale or absolute differences, especially useful when we are concerned about counts.

497
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:30,850
In terms of public action, things like saving lives or planning for healthcare needs.

498
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:36,340
How many dialysis units my hospital is going to need?

499
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:41,230
Um. Right. Or, you know, human resource.

500
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:45,630
How many nurses does my system need to.

501
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,450
To serve the needs of this population?

502
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:57,610
So we are interested in counts. The absolute scale is the way to go.

503
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,330
As we will see later in the course.

504
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:13,610
Sometimes they can give us actually in certain instances, perhaps not in just the simple associations, but in some more complex associations.

505
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:23,540
Sometimes they give us the opposite answer. And we also need to consider carefully, you know, which one we we will use.

506
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,500
But in this case, I think it is pretty clear that.

507
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:34,670
If if you are concerned with counts, you should use that the absolute scale.

508
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:52,320
Yes. Well, the question in question is, in which case do we use the multiplicative escape?

509
01:07:52,650 --> 01:08:03,630
And there is a very heated controversy going on in the analogy right now as to whether we should use that scale, in fact, at all.

510
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:13,240
In the past. There was the intuition that when you wanted to.

511
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,780
When you were more interested in causal inference rather than public action or accounts,

512
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:33,040
you would favor de the relatively scale but the multiplicative scale but the the historical reasons for that were four, four, three, two.

513
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:39,470
So there's really no strong reason to, to favor the multiplicative escape.

514
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:47,480
The only one I can think of and I know if if ten or 11.

515
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:55,250
Uh, say something about this from their own knowledge and me privileges that, um,

516
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:03,740
when you need to model these differences using statistical models traditionally.

517
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,700
The measures that you obtain from the multiplicative scale are easier to model.

518
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:15,090
Than those from the absolute scale.

519
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:26,690
But that was mostly true when I was a student. Uh, because there were no sophisticated algorithms, even in statistical software packages.

520
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:38,460
Nowadays, not even that is an excuse because we have the technology to model, uh, you know, in complex ways, uh, absolute differences.

521
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,180
Now, if you read pretty much any paper in epidemiology nowadays,

522
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:52,190
if you did a survey of which measure is used in epidemiology, the practice would be that you will find that.

523
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:59,400
97%, I would say of of papers report the multiplicative scale.

524
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,720
So it has souls. It's also something that's very much sort of embedded in our culture.

525
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:15,150
It's a very good question. But again, you know, I don't really have a straightforward answer and I think is because there is no consensus.

526
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,810
All right. How about that preview on explaining associations?

527
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:31,060
So. To explain associations.

528
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:42,280
We always have to go back to what one of you very intelligently pointed out in a previous lecture, what we call prior personal knowledge.

529
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,160
So to explain something that we are seeing, we always have to go back to thing.

530
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:55,960
And collect what's already known about the potential variables in that association.

531
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,250
So let's say I want to explain the association between.

532
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,860
Higher piety and infant deaths. I don't know if it's caused that or not,

533
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:14,890
but what they find in the literature as prior knowledge is that higher education causes women to have lower bite.

534
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:19,720
That that's that's a fact that, you know, most socialist immunologists would agree with.

535
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:32,110
Right. On the other hand, I also find that higher education decreases infant deaths, meaning causes less infant deaths.

536
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:43,270
If this is the truth from prior knowledge, can I tell with certainty that.

537
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:48,570
Parity causes infant mortality.

538
01:11:49,530 --> 01:12:02,400
I cannot. I cannot because there is very likely lacks or lack of exchange ability between parity groups with respect to.

539
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:08,030
Higher education. Except with respect to education.

540
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:16,189
In other words, it's possible that the association upset was confounded, which again, you don't have to worry about this concept.

541
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:25,969
We will have full lectures on this. But basically what you should more or less start getting intuitively is that there

542
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,300
could be lack of exchange ability if this is what your prior knowledge tells.

543
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:38,100
Right. Now, different situation, different sets of rules.

544
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:47,379
There's all that surveillance on infant mortality is more strict in low SES socioeconomic

545
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:54,130
status neighborhoods where women have higher priority than in higher ACS neighborhoods.

546
01:12:55,770 --> 01:13:08,069
So if this is the case, in other words, if people are keen in recording, maybe that's in some neighborhoods related to one of their exposure levels.

547
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:17,070
Then in another, because, you know, sometimes public health people may need to pay more attention, let's say, to populations that are at higher risk.

548
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:17,850
Right.

549
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:29,220
If this was the case, could we say again with certainty that the association between piety and in fact, that was necessarily cosa probably hope.

550
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:40,530
It may be that there are that more records of in fact did show up among women with high anxiety

551
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:49,320
because people were keen on identifying infant deaths in that possibly higher risk group.

552
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,550
If this is the case, this is a type of bias.

553
01:13:54,580 --> 01:14:00,470
That biases whatever that prevents us from making those elements.

554
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:03,310
And again, we will study these biases with proper name.

555
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:10,989
But for now, suffice it to say, this bias is telling us that the association is probably not causal.

556
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:19,930
It's not necessarily. Now, recall I told you that we had obtained random samples of records in this stuff.

557
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:33,310
Right. So what if somebody else goes back and takes another different random sample of the same, you know, records into a different random sample?

558
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:41,590
And when they classify the infant mortality according to exposure, they get this.

559
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,590
You already look at this very carefully. Look at the numerators.

560
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:51,030
Oh. What happened?

561
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:57,070
They switched. Why? Tough luck because of chance.

562
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,880
It goes by chance. The second time they went and sampled.

563
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,430
Turn out. You know, the classification totally flipped over.

564
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:12,710
They switched. Was the initial association observed causal?

565
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:18,890
No, it was not. Is this one causal? No.

566
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:23,440
Well, we don't know. Right. And.

567
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:29,780
What is this explanation of the findings? These explanation is called shots.

568
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,890
Tough luck. Yeah. Is it sampling problem?

569
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:42,180
Chance. So a chance. Can also make an association.

570
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:51,350
Not because. So that is sort of.

571
01:15:53,820 --> 01:16:01,200
Punch line of of this exercise on on ready general preview and unexplained associations is this

572
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:07,470
these sort of what you should remember is as I like to say you and your and your wedding night

573
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:17,820
always think first of possible non causal explanations whenever you are to explain an association

574
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:25,530
don't jump into the causal mechanisms that that explain this is not happy analogies think.

575
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,890
We are party poopers in a way.

576
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,210
Or causal association poopers. We deal with that now.

577
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:41,320
Yes, that's our job. We have to debunk as much as we can.

578
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:53,290
The associations, and only because this is just how current scientific thinking works, and only if there are no other researchers.

579
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:57,880
We cannot completely bust the association.

580
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,200
Then we can say, okay, well, maybe, but first.

581
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:09,650
Think of non causal explanations and you can do it systematically like this.

582
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,790
First of all, consider potential lack of exchange ability.

583
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:22,220
So what variables that may be differently distributed on average between exposure groups.

584
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:31,880
Might might be making the association evident that without being cost that's the first thing to consider.

585
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:41,420
Second biases. Things like whether you exemplify with more surveillance in one exposure group than the other.

586
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:48,770
Right. And there will be, again, a complete list of biases that we will all learn about.

587
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:52,460
The second part of the course. And finally, chance.

588
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:58,960
Chances also, you know, a potential source of.

589
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,000
Selling. Okay.

590
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:11,370
All right. Are there any questions? Would any of this?

591
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,040
Okay. So I can read you your progress report for today.

592
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:28,900
So this is what we learned today. Oh, lots of things. You should be able to follow steps to identify an association.

593
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:37,960
You should be able to name the three attributes of an association and use them to describe this association.

594
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:45,900
Remember the three attributes? Direction, shape, magnitude and precision.

595
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:50,700
Which ones are we mostly concerned in this course for election?

596
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:57,389
And you should be able to describe associations by the direction recall.

597
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:05,580
They can be positive, inverse or now if positive or inverse and ordinary continuous,

598
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:16,170
they can have a sub classification of four and recall that sometimes when you have ordinal or continuous exposures and outcomes,

599
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:26,300
they may take shapes that. Cannot be described with simple single words that you have to work your way through the different possible shapes,

600
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,990
or they may take specific shape, shape, etc.

601
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,110
These have associations in terms of magnitude using absolute and relative differences.

602
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:41,240
Or remember to know if there is actually an association.

603
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:47,240
You always have to go back to your summary measures of outcome by levels of exposure, which you know well.

604
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:58,340
And then you have two options to say, well, which scale would you use if you are concerned with count numbers saving babies?
