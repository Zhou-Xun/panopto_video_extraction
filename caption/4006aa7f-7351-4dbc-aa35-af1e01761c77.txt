1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,280
A little girl lives out on a farm and every morning she wakes up to see the sun rising and hear the rooster crowing.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,960
She tells her mom how cool it is that the rooster brings the sun up.

3
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,100
And her mom, of course, says that it works the opposite way.

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,050
Now she is not convinced and decides to run a little study.

5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:35,060
So the night before she goes out, takes her rooster and moves it across town.

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:42,970
Of course, with the help of her mom, she then checks to see whether or not the sun still rises the next day.

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,480
Now, here she is, a little budding epidemiologist who's already starting to think about causality.

8
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:59,110
And in fact, what she's done is she's used our longitudinal design, think about exposure and then watch to see what happens with our outcome.

9
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,840
In this particular video, I'm going to talk a bit about these longitudinal sampling strategies.

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,940
I'll distinguish between the randomized controlled trial and the cohort design.

11
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,490
I'll tell you a bit about what it means to be a prospective versus a retrospective design,

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,290
and then we'll talk through different strengths of limitations of the longitudinal design.

13
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,660
One of the strongest designs that we have in epidemiology to study the impact of an exposure on health.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,160
Is the randomized controlled trial or the RC t.

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,890
The idea with this design is that you recruit a bunch of individuals who are without your outcome of interest at the start of the study.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,740
You then randomly assign them to whether or not they become exposed or unexposed.

17
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,080
And then you follow the two groups over time to see whether or not those who got the

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,630
exposure were more or less likely to get the outcome than those who didn't get the exposure.

19
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,750
Now, the benefit of this design, of course, is that by randomizing who is exposed and who is not.

20
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,320
You're effectively making your two groups as similar as possible with respect to their baseline risk of disease.

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,090
Therefore you are likely to get the right causal answer.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,110
You can remember from a previous video that this notion of having the same baseline risk between

23
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,500
your two comparison groups in the absence of exposure is the key concept of exchange ability.

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,030
Now because this strong argument for exchange ability exists with the randomized controlled trials.

25
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,389
This design is often thought to be our gold standard in epidemiology, and in fact,

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:51,600
there are some people out there who will basically not believe any findings from any other design other than the rc t.

27
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,370
But here's the thing not everything can be randomized.

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,030
As was highlighted by one of my favorite papers that was recently published in the very esteemed British Medical Journal.

29
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:12,180
In this paper, they looked for randomized, controlled trials on the use of parachutes as a means to prevent death when falling from planes.

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, not surprisingly, they were unable to identify any RC ts on this particular topic,

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,860
and they left with some choice words for the critics of observational epidemiology.

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,250
Here it is.

33
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:34,079
They concluded that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organized and participated in a double blind,

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,490
randomized, placebo controlled crossover trial of the parachute.

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:47,670
While they use this extreme example. The authors of that BMJ paper were right and that we can't randomize all exposures.

36
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,720
So for example, we can't change inherent features of a person like their genetic makeup or their race.

37
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,430
Similarly, some life decisions are simply too important to randomized.

38
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,790
Really, nobody is going to be willing to give up control over those decisions.

39
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,740
Can you imagine being randomized to if you were to become a parent or not?

40
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,120
Of course not.

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,420
Just like we wouldn't want to randomized people to having horrible life events such as experiencing a house fire that would obviously not be ethical.

42
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,080
And finally, while we're talking about ethics, there's also the issue of what's being taken away.

43
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:35,880
So although drug trials are very common with new therapies, it's clear that we cannot compare a new drug to no drug at all.

44
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,460
If there is a common therapy out there that is known to improve health.

45
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,080
Rather to make sure that we're doing no harm in our study.

46
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,910
New drugs would typically need to be compared to other older drugs that are also effective as a standard of care.

47
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,300
So what happens when we can't randomize people to certain exposures?

48
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,620
Well, we can still actually run the exact same study design.

49
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:12,980
But now what we do is we recruit individuals who are either exposed or unexposed based on their own freewill or life experiences,

50
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,410
rather than assigning some exposure to them as part of our experimental study.

51
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,650
Now, this type of design is called a cohort study, and it's effectively just an observational version of the randomized controlled trial.

52
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:37,820
Now, regardless of whether or not exposure was assigned by the investigator, both the randomized controlled trial and the cohort designs,

53
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,719
as these longitudinal studies follow exposed and unexposed individuals who are without the

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,080
disease of interest at the start of the study over time to see who newly develops the outcome.

55
00:05:52,090 --> 00:06:00,760
In some ways, the easiest way to visualize this particular longitudinal design is to imagine prospective data collection,

56
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,460
meaning that the investigator is collecting the data in real time, so they become involved at the start when no one's yet developed the disease.

57
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:18,550
And then they follow people over time, basically documenting their health as time progresses until they develop new disease or the study ends.

58
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,320
Here, I've added the imagery of a video camera because I think it's helpful to think about these longitudinal studies

59
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,520
as if investigators are effectively creating movies of people's exposure and health experiences over time.

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,500
Although all randomized controlled trials are run prospectively, this is not the case for cohort designs.

61
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,420
In fact, there's times when it's simply too hard to collect data prospectively,

62
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,120
such as in a situation where a disease takes a very long time to develop after an exposure.

63
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,490
In these situations,

64
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:04,030
it can be possible to find existing data sets that act just like stored video files of people's exposures and health histories through time.

65
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,570
Just like rewinding a video and watching it from the beginning,

66
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,550
investigators can effectively create the lived follow up time of people after the fact or retrospectively.

67
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,420
A really nice example of this retrospective design is based on research from Canada,

68
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,090
where researchers went through and found their medical records for every one in the entire country because of national health care,

69
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,000
along with their residential address information that they got from the national tax records.

70
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:47,330
And what they did is they created this cohort study retrospectively using residential exposures to air pollution and mortality.

71
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,780
Now, by virtue of using medical records instead of actively recruiting and following individuals,

72
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:02,240
the study was much more efficient and it was able to investigate the life expectancies of over 2 million Canadian residents.

73
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,470
Something that you can imagine would be very hard in a prospective study.

74
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,390
Now, a similar project has actually been conducted here in the United States as well,

75
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,370
using a population of older adults that have all been served by Medicare.

76
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:27,800
So there you go. That's the summary of our longitudinal designs, both representing the randomized controlled trial and the cohort studies.

77
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:38,260
As both studies really share a fundamental core design where they're starting with people who have exposure not and following them over time.

78
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:47,410
They share several key strands. The strands of these longitudinal designs are that they can study incidence and changes over time.

79
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:55,840
Rare exposures can be evaluated because investigators can actually either assign a rare exposure if it's a randomized controlled trial,

80
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,220
or they can recruit based on exposure status if it's a cohort design.

81
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:08,380
In addition, they can evaluate many different outcomes that all might happen as a result of the exposures of interest.

82
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,490
In terms of limitation, they share two main limitations when conducted prospectively,

83
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,970
and those are that it's an inefficient design for rare or long latency kind of outcomes,

84
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,770
again, just because it would take too long to see enough outcomes of interest.

85
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,300
Similarly, when you're working prospectively, they can be very time intensive and expensive to conduct.

86
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:41,770
Now I put little stars here because the retrospective cohort actually eliminates two of those limitations.

87
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,990
Now here I just wanted to add some additional strengths and limitations that are specific to

88
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,170
the randomized controlled trial and effectively are results of the process of randomizing.

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,930
So in terms of strengths that come about, because we've randomize exposures, we have that the exchange ability likelihood is extremely high.

90
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,810
Only if you have a very small sample are you likely to have poor randomization,

91
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,549
otherwise you would actually expect that exchange ability would be excellent with

92
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:19,120
respect to both known factors as well as unknown factors in terms of limitations.

93
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,530
However, when you're randomizing exposures, it's not always appropriate from an ethical or practical standpoint.

94
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,570
In addition, you can have noncompliance, biasing your results towards the null.

95
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,630
And we'll talk about that a bit more in the next video.

96
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,850
You can also have the issue that your populations who are compliant enough to participate in an RC t are really not

97
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,510
generalizable to the full population so often to make sure that people are going to take the treatment that's assigned to them.

98
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:57,640
Investigators will really select people who are very much rule followers and really are going to keep with the study design.

99
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,860
Again, they might have other characteristics about them that are different from the general population.

100
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:11,930
And finally, when you're randomizing exposures, you obviously can only look, say, at one or two because you're actually assigning those exposures.

101
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,190
You have a limited number of exposures that can be evaluated.

102
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,760
And finally, just to wrap up, I add a couple more strengths and limitations that are specific to cohorts.

103
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:29,740
So because cohorts are observational now you have the benefit that you can actually look at many different exposures in the design,

104
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
especially if you're recruiting based on just a group of people.

105
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,990
People have many different things that they're exposed to or characteristics about them that you can look at.

106
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:45,250
Now, in contrast, because you're not being randomized or the participants are not being randomized with respect to their exposure,

107
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,950
exchange ability can be more limited. So there might be differences in terms of why certain people are exposed and why certain people are unexposed.

108
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,080
In the next videos, we're going to talk a bit more about how you analyze these kinds of data.
