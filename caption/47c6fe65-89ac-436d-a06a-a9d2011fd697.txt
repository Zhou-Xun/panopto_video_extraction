1
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:11,170
The first six steps were background and
thinking about all of the knowledge and

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,010
skills that we want to polish
before we actually execute.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,780
So step seven addresses this issue
of how to advance your message.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,620
How will you communicate your message?

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,430
What are the opportunities to
reach your decision-maker?

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,960
There are many ways to do this, but

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,690
I'd like to hone in on the first one,
face-to-face meetings.

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,300
This by far, in my opinion, is the best
way to interact with a policymaker

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,460
because it goes to the point I mentioned
in the very beginning of the module, which

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,180
is that this expertise is a combination
of substance and relationships.

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,430
So the opportunity to sit down
with another human being and

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,230
have eye contact, and
build trust and rapport,

13
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:12,940
talking about an issue to me is the most
affective way to advance your message.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,670
In addition, testifying in public
hearings can be very effective,

15
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,690
as I mentioned with regard to
the smoke-free workplace issue.

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,880
We had great recognition, and

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,010
acknowledgment, and success following
the hearings that we participated in.

18
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,260
There are other ways to reach out,
as well.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,211
Inviting policymakers and
decision-makers to visit your

20
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:44,840
organization to experience an event,
if there is a relevant event.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,175
Email, social media,
a lot of the online tools, I think,

22
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:54,559
are most effective following
the establishment of a strong relationship

23
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:59,976
that you have developed through
face-to-face meetings and over time.

24
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:04,042
Grassroots efforts that engage
constituents are very helpful

25
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:09,028
because that is a demonstration to
the decision-maker that your message and

26
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,600
your goal resonates more broadly.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,784
This is another very effective
way to advance the message.

28
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:23,720
Step 8 focuses on the preparation
of written materials.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,670
What we've been talking about so

30
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:32,090
far focuses on oral
communication of your message.

31
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,550
I deeply believe that we distinguish
ourselves professionally through our

32
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,020
ability to communicate in both
a written and an oral method.

33
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,425
Written materials are so
essential in advocacy because they allow

34
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:56,060
decision-makers to review them after
that in-person, face-to-face meeting,

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,000
the phone call, whatever that
initial communication may be.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,190
So what types of materials are helpful?

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,550
I firmly believe that a concise
one-pager that explicitly

38
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,020
advances the goal is the most
important written advocacy tool.

39
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,300
And we'll be talking about
that in a later module.

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,640
The one-pager will be part
of a broader leave behind

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,400
package of information that you
will leave following your meeting.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,570
The leave-behind includes
not only the one-pager, but

43
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,520
hopefully a little bit longer white paper.

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,090
Maybe a journal article,
maybe some press coverage,

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,470
maybe an invitation to an upcoming event.

46
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,234
But a packet of information that then arms

47
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:58,730
the decision-maker with the key
points around your topic and

48
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,990
your goal so that they are able to
use those in later meetings and

49
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,590
later conversations that
you may not be a part of.

50
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,428
So these are materials
that can be shared widely.

51
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:14,789
They can also be used as you're
building your coalition,

52
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,910
as you're identifying stakeholder
organizations to include in those

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,170
grassroots efforts that
we just talked about.

54
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:30,080
So the written advocacy tools
are critical in any effective strategy.

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,420
Advocating, step number 9.

56
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,700
This is where we map out and
execute our strategy.

57
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,590
We're building those relationships,
practicing honesty, integrity, and

58
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,610
respect, understanding
the protocol around this process.

59
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,590
And employing the 8 minute rule,
which I was always taught

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,250
was the way to approach any meeting,
which is really very simple.

61
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,600
Hello, thank you for
taking the time to meet with me today.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm Jen Martin,

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,780
I'm here on behalf of the University
of Michigan School of Public Health.

64
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,475
And I'd like to talk with you about
smoke-free workplace legislation that is

65
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:14,290
pending before the state legislature.

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,390
And it flows from there.

67
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,280
It is important to focus on
eight minutes as a timeline for

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,065
your delivery because it is
likely that the decision-maker,

69
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:32,605
whether it's a member of the United States
Congress, the city council, whether it's

70
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:38,305
your dean, whether it's the director of
your organization, they are busy people.

71
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,145
And they may be called away.

72
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:44,990
So being able to articulate
your key points quickly,

73
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,150
concisely, not only helps you hone
in on what those points are, but

74
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,090
it makes it much easier for
the decision-maker to move forward.

75
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,580
And finally, number 10, follow up.

76
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,570
This is essential, going back to
the etiquette, in building relationships.

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,620
When you follow up after your meeting,
you will include a thank you.

78
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,740
Thank you for
taking the time to meet with me.

79
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,870
It was a pleasure to discuss
this issue with you.

80
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,225
I recommend ordering
personal stationary and

81
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:25,816
sending a written note because, in this
day when everything is done online,

82
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:31,421
when I receive a hand-written thank you
note, it stands out more than ever.

83
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:35,299
You'll follow up with additional
information that may have come

84
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:39,396
up during the meeting and
answers to any questions that were raised.

85
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:42,080
It also allows you to maintain contact and

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,764
stay in touch to strengthen those
relationships in a meaningful way.

87
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:53,920
So this is a summary of all of
the steps that we have just discussed.

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,670
It is a checklist that I hope that
you will use in any effective

89
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,589
public health advocacy strategy,
thank you.
