1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,388
And then. Well, we just followed the crushing events for the NBA, and maybe you'll see that in their introductory remarks.

2
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:23,831
So we have three remote attendees at the moment, I think just the universe around us, if we can speak to you.

3
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,181
So we're going to wait just a couple of minutes before we begin.

4
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:35,581
So I just wanted to welcome the online attendees to and actually you're going.

5
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:44,861
Not quite out of this matter anymore.

6
00:00:46,131 --> 00:01:01,731
When I was when I was writing that I like this lean and lean in.

7
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:12,501
Okay. What do you think? I think I may go ahead and get us started.

8
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:21,531
So welcome, everyone. We have some folks in person in the auditorium and a few folks online.

9
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:33,201
I am Gary O'Neil, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and I'm very happy to be able to substitute for the Today four Dr. Handle.

10
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:43,521
And I'm very pleased to introduce our speaker, who, as you can see, is going to join us remotely with a panoramic view behind him.

11
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:48,831
So I will briefly bring up some highlights of.

12
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:57,491
The bio. Dr. Tyler James is a research fellow in the University of Michigan Department of Family Medicine,

13
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:03,671
working in the Center for Disability, Health and Wellness and the Michigan Mixed Methods Program.

14
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:10,691
His research focuses on health care, access, utilization and delivery among people with disabilities,

15
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:14,261
with a focus on people with sensory disabilities.

16
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:20,861
In addition, he has a mixed methods research methodologies with expertise in sampling integration,

17
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:26,291
and then the use of advanced quantitative techniques in mixed methods studies.

18
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:33,881
He received his Ph.D. in health and human performance from the University of Florida in August 2021.

19
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,640
After completing his H.

20
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:46,631
R CU funded dissertation study on developing the conceptual framework to guide emergency department research focused on a d, h h population.

21
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:57,041
In addition, he has eight years of experience in health promotion practice and as a master certified health education specialist.

22
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:01,691
So welcome, Dr. James. Before I turn the floor over to you,

23
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:07,571
I just wanted to request that those who are online please put any questions in the chat and we will hold

24
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:15,861
questions until the end of the remarks so we can accommodate both online and in-person participation.

25
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,971
So thank you, Dr. James, for joining us. Thank you and thank you so much for having me.

26
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:28,111
I have just enabled closed captions on the PowerPoint screen, so hopefully the audience is able to see that.

27
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:32,401
I'm very happy to be here today. Thank you for the invitation and for having me.

28
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:37,861
Just as a point of disclosure, I have no financial conflicts or conflicts of commitment.

29
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:43,211
As was mentioned, I have eight years of experience in health promotion practice.

30
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:49,521
I just wanted to more orient you to my background. I started at Gator well, Health Promotion Services back in 2014,

31
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,661
doing needs assessment and evaluation work for health communication, campaign development.

32
00:03:54,081 --> 00:04:01,251
And I stayed there for about three years. And I also worked in HIV testing and prevention through the Florida Department of Health during that time.

33
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:05,511
And it was really general health promotion services that I really found my love for

34
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:10,251
data analysis and for the mixing of both qualitative and quantitative research.

35
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,300
And because of just the mentors that I was surrounded with at that time,

36
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,661
I decided that I wanted to go get my master's in health, education and behavior.

37
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:21,351
And so it happened to be that I just wanted to get the end of that as well.

38
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,161
On a personal note, I am a person with a disability.

39
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:32,001
I have chronic migraine in addition to a learning disability, and I work very frequently with people with disabilities.

40
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:36,741
This photo of me in the middle was at a gala for deafblind individuals.

41
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:41,541
That was the International Deaf Blind Expo in Orlando, Florida, back in 2016.

42
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,291
I'm pictured here with a deaf blind woman that I worked with quite frequently,

43
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:52,371
and her service guide dog named Cathi Cardi, is a black lab and we are matching with red bow ties.

44
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,401
And as was mentioned, I got my Ph.D. at the University of Florida.

45
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:59,991
I completed all three degrees at the University of Florida, bachelor's in psychology,

46
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:03,921
master's in health, education, and then the Ph.D. in Health and Human Performance.

47
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:12,321
And my dissertation and my research work more during that time, from HIV prevention and to deaf and hard of hearing health disparities.

48
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:21,931
As an overview of today's presentation, I'm going to give a brief background on deaf and hard of hearing patients and how deaf patients communicate,

49
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:28,321
and some of the life course factors that affect deaf and hard of hearing patients as they engage with the health care system.

50
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,261
And then I'm going to go into three different studies.

51
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:37,771
The first study is a qualitative study of emergency department communication among deaf patients who use American sign language to communicate.

52
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:43,111
As a note of abbreviations, whenever you see DHHS, that means deaf or hard of hearing,

53
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:47,551
and whenever you see American Sign Language or ASL, that's what this stands for.

54
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:51,181
Study two is a legal epidemiology study of communication,

55
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,791
access and mental health and substance use treatment facilities, which was recently published in Health Affairs.

56
00:05:55,831 --> 00:06:01,291
I'm very excited about it. And then Study three is findings from a national survey of deaf and hard of

57
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:05,941
hearing birthing parents with respect to their access to COVID 19 information.

58
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:16,221
As is mentioned in the title, really, I think it's important to kind of ground this all theoretically within the social ecological

59
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:21,371
model and also recognizing those dynamic interrelations between the multiple levels of exposure

60
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,820
influence to really understand that deaf and hard of hearing patients don't necessarily have

61
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,351
the control over their patient education or help communication access at the individual level,

62
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:35,091
which is why we have laws which I'm going to be discussing in a few seconds.

63
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:41,871
But it's also really important to think about the life course and historical effects, which Bronfenbrenner termed as like the Kronos system.

64
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,650
And so really we have to think about both the historical aspects of how people with

65
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:51,891
disabilities have been treated in this country and and Western European context for centuries.

66
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:58,880
In addition to how a deaf person who is deaf from birth precedes through their life and into adulthood,

67
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:05,691
and similarly how a person who is not deaf since birth becomes deaf later in life and how that impacts their health care outcomes.

68
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:15,920
So no on terminology for today and I have this Asterix for today because it can get very freaky on describing deaf and hard of hearing

69
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:22,791
populations and the terminology that is used based off of different socio medical characteristics and cultural characteristics.

70
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,761
So for today, this is the terminology that we're going to be using.

71
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:33,831
There are approximately 329 million people in the United States which are represented here as 100 little person icons and white.

72
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,811
Approximately 12 to 15% of those people have a detectable hearing loss.

73
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:45,501
That comes out to be just about 55 million people. And most of these people probably use spoken language to communicate.

74
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:50,300
So here in the United States, that's predominantly English, a minority of this population,

75
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:55,701
approximately 250000 to 1 million are deaf and hard of hearing American Sign Language users.

76
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:01,101
Now, I mentioned that this is like the terminology for today is that this is not as mutually exclusive in practice.

77
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:06,621
I work routinely with deaf and deafblind individuals who use both languages depending on the certain context.

78
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:11,451
So whenever they're around, they're non deaf family members who speak English and don't know sign language.

79
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:17,480
They're going to be using more oral and spoken language methods whenever they're around their deaf friends.

80
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:22,731
They're going to be using sign language, and that works predominately for those people who are down here, these deaf and hard of hearing ASL users.

81
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:29,440
Deaf and hard of hearing English speakers. So the majority of this population are predominately post lingual deaf.

82
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:37,601
And so what that means is that they become deaf after the age of critical period of language exposure, which is approximately 3 to 5 years of age.

83
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,861
And so they typically have a very, very good language foundation base.

84
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:46,961
They have good English proficiency, which of course leads to more access to health promoting resources.

85
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,171
ESL users, however, are predominately pre lingual,

86
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:57,250
so they're deaf before age three and they experience by and large a phenomenon known as language deprivation.

87
00:08:57,251 --> 00:09:03,431
And language deprivation is essentially the lack of exposure to an accessible language before the critical period of language exposure.

88
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:07,931
So imagine the scenario that a deaf child is born to non deaf parents.

89
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:12,340
Typically the doctors come in and say, I'm sorry your child has failed the hearing test,

90
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:16,751
which puts them through a complete cascade in a system of pathway, if you will,

91
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,990
related to diagnostic and treatment of that hearing loss,

92
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:24,641
determining if it is just something that's happening very acutely or if it's actually going to be a long term event.

93
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:29,111
And typically for some of those deaf kids,

94
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:37,061
parents will listen to medical providers who may receive biased information and

95
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,691
not expose that child to an accessible language modality such as sign language.

96
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:47,831
And so instead they chose a spoken language modality which may actually end up further delaying that child's language development.

97
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:55,930
And so that occurrence is called language deprivation. And language deprivation leads to limited access to health, promoting resources,

98
00:09:55,931 --> 00:10:01,541
social disenfranchisement and exacerbates mental health, and actually has been linked to chronic health issues in adulthood as well.

99
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:12,450
So health inequity among deaf and hard of hearing people, despite those two different categories of deaf people, are very similar.

100
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:16,621
So both groups are at higher risk of experiencing worse social determinants of health.

101
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:25,921
So under underemployment being on or under-insured with discrimination and society having worse mental and physical health outcomes so

102
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:32,011
deaf and hard of hearing people who use American Sign Language are more likely to experience traumatic events or have traumatic closures.

103
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:40,051
In addition, deaf and hard of hearing college students, regardless of their language, are more likely to have suicide attempts and suicide ideation.

104
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:46,121
They're at risk for inadequate health literacy and limited English proficiency, particularly deaf ESL users.

105
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:53,041
So remember, they're not working in English predominantly, although they may be bilingual because they're not hearing the English.

106
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:56,730
There's less proficiency and that inadequate health literacy.

107
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:01,831
It's about six times 6 to 7 times more likely to have inadequate health literacy than a non deaf English speaker.

108
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:07,901
They're also considered a high cost, high need population regarding communication, access with cardless visits,

109
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:14,400
financial cost or interpersonal cost, a provider or a person that might have to put more effort into communication.

110
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:19,800
Looking away from the computer, looking directly at the deaf and hard of hearing person to ensure that they may be

111
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:24,961
able to speech read using a clear mask instead of a blue or yellow surgical mask,

112
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:27,061
or in 95 that's going to be covering the mouth.

113
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:34,621
Things of that nature, not to mention interpreters, which can cost up to $120 per hour, typically for a two hour minimum.

114
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:42,601
And so whenever you think maybe 15 to 30 minute primary care appointment, that's considered a high cost for those providers.

115
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,151
There's also limited access to primary care providers and specialists, predominantly because they do not want to provide communication,

116
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:53,161
access and increased emergency department utilization for less acute conditions.

117
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:57,721
So for conditions that could be seen or treated in primary urgent care and specialty care.

118
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:06,260
Back in 2018, I partnered with the Florida Association of the Deaf to conduct the first linguistically accessible,

119
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:12,951
so it was both available in ASL and English and contextually tailored community health needs assessment of Deaf RSL users in Florida.

120
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:18,470
This is an image of one of our items that was translated by the Stef interpreter.

121
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,431
So the person who is on the screen is deaf himself and uses sign language.

122
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,861
And this was an item about binge drinking.

123
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:33,231
So we were using the name, a item related to having four or more drinks within a setting if you're a woman or five or more if you're a man.

124
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:39,531
And in this case, to indicate what a drink was, because there's no standardized sign for a drink in American Sign Language, we used a picture.

125
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:45,050
And this identified mental health as the greatest health concern among deaf ASL users in Florida.

126
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:51,531
And I'm going to show some results about that in the future. But 56% use the emergency department in the past 12 months.

127
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:56,090
And what was really important to me being interested in health care communication is that 37% were denied

128
00:12:56,091 --> 00:13:01,761
an interpreter or hospital at a hospital or medical facility in the past four months after requesting one,

129
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:06,291
so that as a deaf person requesting an interpreter and then not receiving an interpreter from their provider.

130
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:13,571
So you may be thinking, well, this doesn't make sense. I know there's the Americans with Disabilities Act and you'd be absolutely correct.

131
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,381
So under the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are five different titles.

132
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,551
We don't really need to discuss three of them because Title one is related to employment.

133
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:26,680
Title four is related to telecommunications. And the Title five is like more like a control title two.

134
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:32,621
And Title three are really what's important here. So under Title two, we have the primary consideration standard.

135
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,241
And what this means is Title two covers state and local governments.

136
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:42,341
So if it is a state government program or local government program, you can think of county emergency operations,

137
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:51,221
county sheriff's office, the tax collectors office, things of that nature, all things that are ran by a state or local government.

138
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:57,611
If a deaf person or request a sign language interpreter of the facility must then give primary consideration.

139
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,881
And what that means is that they must oblige that that request,

140
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:07,060
except under certain circumstances where it would fundamentally change the program or service or whatever it is,

141
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,531
an administrative or financial burden,

142
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:15,341
which is very difficult to have legal standing for, because typically state, local governments have millions of dollars,

143
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:19,961
if not billions of dollars, and the administrative burden is typically just calling an interpreter.

144
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:26,051
And so that is the primary consideration standard. So a deaf patient is supposed to be able to request something and then receive it.

145
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:30,841
Under Title three. However, it's different. It works under a facility to termination standard.

146
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:35,401
And so this includes hospital settings that are not owned or operated by state and local governments,

147
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,031
grocery stores, malls, businesses out in the community.

148
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,241
Anything that's out in the community that's not ran by the government.

149
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:50,551
And what this facility determination standard is, if you will, is I'm a deaf patient or I'm a deaf patient in a hospital, I request an interpreter.

150
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:57,981
The hospital does not have to provide the interpreter. They just have to show that they did provide effective communication access.

151
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:04,741
So if that means that I requested an interpreter and they feel that writing back and forth is going to provide effective communication,

152
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,571
then that's what they could give me.

153
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:12,361
Of course, that then leads to a lot of litigation because it's not really an effective modality as we're going to discuss.

154
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,041
But so this is how it's categorized into the ADA.

155
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:21,960
You have the facility discrimination standards and the primary consideration standards under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,

156
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:30,061
also known as Obamacare. This changed. So hospitals that received government funds are now categorized under the primary consideration standard.

157
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:35,460
And the reason why is they're basically saying if you receive money from the federal government, you're receiving government moneys.

158
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:39,241
And so you should be held to this higher standard that the government is required to be.

159
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:48,021
Does that make sense? Hopefully. I'm not able to get any thumbs up or anything.

160
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:52,941
So I'm going to assume that that makes sense because it's very important that we understand that before we move forward.

161
00:15:54,801 --> 00:16:02,481
Okay. And so just to, like really collapse on all of the different types of effects that are affecting a deaf and hard of hearing

162
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:07,011
patient as they access health care and things that might affect the health care communication environment.

163
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:13,701
And this was a conceptual model that I developed as part of my agency for Health Care Research and quality funded dissertation study.

164
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:18,171
And it borrows concepts from B C Proceeds model,

165
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:25,431
which is predominant used in health promotion program development in addition to the Anderson's behavioral model of health care service utilization.

166
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,541
And here at the top,

167
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:33,771
I have predisposing enabling and reinforcing factors related to the deaf and hard of hearing patient and then a contextual health system interpreter.

168
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:38,181
Basically, anything that's non patients down here at the bottom predisposing enabling and reinforcing factors.

169
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:44,121
And so this is really important to really just like understand that the language that a patient is using,

170
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,890
which is considered a demographic or cultural characteristic, their access to the auditory environment.

171
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:54,291
So if they're using hearing aids or a cochlear implant or amplified speech,

172
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:59,451
if they have family or friends that are in that social network of deaf ACL users,

173
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:05,721
all of these things are really working together to impact how a deaf patient accesses health care and the communication context.

174
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:12,861
And within that communication context, we have things like the availability and quality of ASL interpreters within a geographic location.

175
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:18,981
If a provider is trained on using an interpreter, if a provider thinks they need to use an interpreter, things of that nature.

176
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,191
So now I want to move into the first study,

177
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:31,051
which is titled They're not willing to accommodate deaf patients communication experiences of deaf patients and the emergency department.

178
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:36,971
So on the slide I have three photos with text under them.

179
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,511
The first photo is about written and oral communication.

180
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:44,861
So whenever a deaf patient goes into the emergency department,

181
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,851
the providers will typically probably start speaking to them or writing to them first

182
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:52,180
until they indicate that they are deaf and then they're trying to communicate.

183
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,521
And this is, again,

184
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:58,841
where it gets murky because a deaf patient who may have access to English and may know English and may be able to speak for themselves,

185
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:08,681
may be communicating in oral communication methods. In this photo, I have what is a brown paper napkin with writing on it.

186
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:16,491
I think it says appointment. And this was given to me by a local deaf community activist and he received this in his emergency department visit.

187
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:20,171
This was what was written by his consultant cardiologist.

188
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:25,121
And then the cardiologist left. And so I'm not really able to say what this says,

189
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:33,881
but I am able to understand the feeling of degradation by receiving something like this and having a provider not communicate with you.

190
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:40,241
The second is onsite interpretive communication. This is typically what a lot of the patients will prefer to use sign language.

191
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:44,710
This is when the medical provider and the patient have an interpreter who is hopefully

192
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:47,861
credentialed and qualified to be working in medical and emergency settings.

193
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:53,291
It facilitates communication between the provider and the patient. And there's also a video remote interpreting.

194
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:58,151
What I like to call an iPad on Wheels, because it's quite literally what it is in most environments.

195
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:02,471
And that is where you have the interpreter who is offsite connected via the wi fi

196
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:07,421
to this iPad where a patient is able to see them and a provider is using them.

197
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,891
Now we're going to get into some of the issues with this video remote interpreting phenomenon.

198
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:13,841
So just some background here.

199
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:21,461
So the study was conducted in north central Florida, which is the home of the University of Florida and the U.S. health health care system.

200
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:27,611
And deaf community members in this area had been reporting varying levels of accessibility or better yet,

201
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:32,051
inaccessibility in the emergency departments, in emergency centers, in the area.

202
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:40,931
And in 2017, I was at lunch with a deaf and mentor when he thought that he was having a heart attack and he had previously experienced heart attack.

203
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:46,021
And he had congestive heart failure. And so we called 911.

204
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:51,031
We went to the E.R. I was advocating the entire time to call for an interpreter.

205
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,211
And it took 8 hours until an interpreter was provided.

206
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,861
They tried after five and a half hours to bring in the video remote interpreting iPad on Wheels.

207
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:06,421
But it wasn't turning on which they then found out that it wasn't charged and then they could not find an outlet to plug it into.

208
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:11,191
And then once it was finally on that, the provider was so upset with it that he just didn't want to mess with it anymore.

209
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:16,680
And so I realized, you know, like, wow, like this is a really bad experience for deaf patients.

210
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:22,621
And like waiting 8 hours without even being able to establish the most basic communication is an issue.

211
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:27,210
So like a good Ph.D. student at the time, I went to the empirical literature and I found,

212
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,661
of course, that written and oral communication is less effective for communication access,

213
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:37,261
which makes sense, and that providers have varying levels of comfort with providing accessibility to that patients, which makes sense.

214
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:43,741
But what I really found was that the Gainesville deaf and hard of hearing patient community experience did not align with the literature at all.

215
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:51,601
Where I did find alignment, however, was litigation. So deaf patients winning the right to sue Baptist Health in Jacksonville for discrimination.

216
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,281
Deaf patients suing a Jacksonville hospital over a lack of interpreters or a Bethesda

217
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:59,851
settlement lawsuit with deaf patients over the use of video remote interpreting.

218
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:06,571
And these experiences that were much, clearly, much more clearly aligned with the experiences that I was getting from deaf patients.

219
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,331
And so this created an issue of like the no problem problem.

220
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:15,240
As Nancy Krieger calls it, which is essentially whenever we know that a social inequity is existing,

221
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:20,641
but because there is no data that are published in the peer reviewed literature, people refuse to believe that it's happening.

222
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:26,551
And so I then made it my goal to represent the deaf patients experience within the peer reviewed literature.

223
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:34,321
Some of the other studies that I did find, however, were in large metropolitan areas, which had a much higher supply of interpreters than Gainesville,

224
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:40,511
Florida, which for those of you who do not know, it's a it's an urban area, but it's surrounded by a sea of morality.

225
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:46,351
So the local interpreter agency covers a 17 county area with five staff interpreters.

226
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:52,761
There are also no studies that were focused solely on the emergency room context, and there was a temporal limitation.

227
00:21:52,771 --> 00:22:00,421
It was all very outdated literature with no studies post the dissemination and implementation of VRA, which happened in 2010,

228
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:08,011
or the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which moved hospitals from that facility to termination standard into primary consideration.

229
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:15,810
So I conducted semi-structured interviews with deaf patients in American Sign Language who

230
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:21,751
had been at a patient at any hospital affiliated emergency department in the past two years.

231
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:30,961
Interviews occurred over almost nine month time period, and the interviews were analyzed in both American Sign Language and translated English.

232
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:36,390
And then afterwards, I followed up with the deaf community members to check my analysis.

233
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:43,861
And basically it's a form of member checking where we return results to the patients or participants who are then able to provide more feedback.

234
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:52,861
This is the sample characteristics from the study. We interviewed 11 patients who had used the EDI between two to more than ten times.

235
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:59,131
Interviews were a median average of 42 minutes, ranging from 27 to 66 minutes.

236
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,561
The majority of them were at risk for inadequate health literacy, and all of them were pretty legally deaf.

237
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:12,391
So remember deaf before age three? So we developed five things through our data analysis.

238
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:17,961
The first thing was that requesting communication access can be stressful, frustrating and time consuming.

239
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:23,721
This describes the negotiation that patients go through and from the moment that they step into the emergency department.

240
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:27,711
So they go up to the check in our registration desk. They indicate that they're deaf.

241
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:32,321
And they were mentioning that the registration clerk was already like just throwing their hands up,

242
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:34,911
not sure how to deal with this deaf patient that was in front of them.

243
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:41,480
There was also this perspectives with and perspectives and experience with video remote interpreting.

244
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:49,041
So something that the deaf community has said for a very long time which was not in the peer reviewed literature, is that video?

245
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:53,711
Remote interpreting doesn't work because it never connects to the interpreter. Staff don't know how to use it.

246
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:57,021
Staff are not trained adequately how to use it. They don't know where to find the machine.

247
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:00,590
And once they do find the machine and they connect to the interpreter, it's pixelated.

248
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:06,320
So imagine if my video right now was completely pixelated or freezing, you wouldn't be able to see me clearly.

249
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:13,281
Now make that your primary language where you're having to see fine motor skill movement occurring.

250
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:20,751
The two way cameras and audio theme three was the expectation, benefits and drawbacks of using in-person interpreters.

251
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:26,321
So by and large, deaf patients in our sample really preferred to have an in-person interpreter.

252
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:33,711
They preferred the rapport that was able to be established, the use of regional sign variations or dialects by interpreters.

253
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,031
But there were some drawbacks.

254
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:43,431
So one is that the deaf patients who had family members with them, their family members felt coerced to provide communication, access.

255
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:48,291
And one person there, our sample deaf blind woman, indicated that her daughter,

256
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:52,761
who was 15, was asked to interpret for her during the emergency department visit.

257
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:58,671
Of course, she put her foot down and she went on to describe that her daughter is not professionally

258
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,051
fluent in American Sign Language and that she does not trust her product of interpreting.

259
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:07,971
Some of the other drawbacks included a lack of privacy expectations.

260
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:15,081
So deaf patients in this area remember this there's one interpreting agency serving a 17 county area.

261
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:21,530
So these that patients are seeing these interpreters in the E.R. they're seeing them in their normal health care use.

262
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:25,161
They're seeing them at workplace trainings, mental health counseling.

263
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:32,961
And there was this feeling that their interpreters had a lot of personal and confidential information about them.

264
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:40,791
A theme for was that written and oral communication provides insufficient information to deaf patients, which no duh, like.

265
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:47,151
Of course, that happens whenever we're dealing with a population that is experiencing inadequate health literacy and limited English proficiency.

266
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:53,991
This makes a lot of sense. And really more than this, discharge summaries were found to be inaccessible for deaf patients.

267
00:25:54,531 --> 00:26:01,431
So a lot of our deaf participants indicated that they were leaving the emergency room without knowing their future treatment goals,

268
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:07,911
their follow up care plans or their diagnosis. And then the fifth theme was that health systems,

269
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:12,951
emergency room staff and providers lack the cultural sensitivity and awareness towards deaf patients.

270
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:25,371
One of our community activists gave me a photo in the E.R. where the a nurse had printed a flier that says Patient is hearing impaired speak loud.

271
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:32,421
The patient was profoundly deaf. And what that means is that they are not getting any auditory information whatsoever.

272
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:37,371
They are also culturally identified as deaf because they were raised by a deaf family.

273
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,341
They were going to a deaf school whenever they were younger.

274
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:44,241
And so not only did they feel like their cultural identity was diminished by the health care provider,

275
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:51,741
but now they have providers and nurses coming into them, looking at them and screaming at them whenever they're not able to hear that.

276
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:59,481
And so here's just a two. I'm going to go through two of these examples with representative quotes over the next two slides.

277
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:06,321
The first is from theme one, which is about that negotiating access and that it's time consuming and difficult and frustrating.

278
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:15,031
So the subcategory here is friends and family as interpreters. The participant said, I don't really like my family to know my personal business.

279
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,781
I prefer having interpreters who have to be confidential instead of my family.

280
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:22,291
Because then they would start knowing. And for this person,

281
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:29,850
it was very important to them because they lived still in their family home and they felt that this was leading to differential power dynamics

282
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:37,201
where their family members had more information and were able to privately discuss the deaf person's life without them having access to it.

283
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:41,641
There's also the varying skill set of interpreting among family members, leading to errors,

284
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:48,741
the bioethical considerations of consent and HIPA whenever a family member or friend is used as an interpreter.

285
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:54,481
And of course, additional stress on deaf and hard of hearing patients and their family members, especially for children.

286
00:27:54,841 --> 00:28:03,241
So that 15 year old child is there to support her mom through the process and is also very scared and now is being asked to interpret.

287
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:11,801
And so that needs that additional stress. The fourth theme is related to those discharge instructions being inaccessible.

288
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,151
So they'll give me my prescriptions and just send me on my way without explaining anything about what is going on.

289
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:22,381
There's no communication. I have to wait until I see my primary care doctor for them to explain what's going on.

290
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,811
I don't know what I'm supposed to do with all of these medications that they are giving me.

291
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:32,971
I don't know everything about what's going on with my health. So this leads to decreased patient self activation and self efficacy.

292
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,101
And of course, E.D., discharge failure,

293
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:43,201
which is whenever a deaf patient or any patient leaves the E.R. without knowing what their next steps are, which, again, leads to revisit.

294
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:52,571
So the key takeaway here is that deaf patient communication rights are being fundamentally denied in some any context, which, yes, is illegal,

295
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:56,981
but it's still happening and it impedes the development of effective patient and provider relationships,

296
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,911
providing a limited opportunity to work with shared decision making.

297
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:09,041
Leading to any discharge failure and revisit and decreased communication access, which is maintaining that lower limited health literacy.

298
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:16,941
The second study is related to a legal epidemiology study that we recently had published focused on health care,

299
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:22,311
communication and access and mental health and substance use facilities.

300
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:36,691
So all users are at higher risk of any mental health diagnosis than non deaf and hard of hearing English speakers based off of our community.

301
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,121
Engage needs assessment of deaf ASL users.

302
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:48,211
We found that depression symptoms in the past two weeks were higher for deafness users than non English speakers.

303
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:54,271
There's not a competence bar for the non English speakers because that's from a national sample and they don't report their standard deviation.

304
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:57,871
And then the binge drinking in the past 30 days,

305
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:09,691
they're at higher risk with about 25% reporting drinking in the past 30 days rather than 15% of non deaf English speakers.

306
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:19,331
Just a reminder on the communication access under the ADA, you have the primary consideration standard and facility determination standard,

307
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:23,991
and the primary consideration standard includes hospitals under the Affordable Care Act.

308
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,941
So it kind of supersedes. So as part of our methods,

309
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:36,861
we assessed a noncompliance with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 1557 is the nondiscrimination provision.

310
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:45,921
It does not only impact deaf patients, it essentially impacts discrimination and forbids discrimination on any protected class of disability,

311
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:48,261
race, sexual orientation and gender identity.

312
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:56,421
And so Section 1557 is the one that says that if you receive government funds from the executive branch of the government,

313
00:30:57,081 --> 00:31:00,861
then you are essentially classified to these more strict standards.

314
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:09,050
And so the data source for this was the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's public data from 2019 and in 2019,

315
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,501
they disseminated two different surveys.

316
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:18,021
The first was the National Mental Health Services Survey, which does a census sample of mental health treatment facilities.

317
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:26,781
And the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which does a census sample of substance abuse treatment services with some exclusions.

318
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:35,691
So they do not. Sorry about that. They do not go through a DOD made in the facility.

319
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:39,971
They do not go through county jails and prisons or facilities like that.

320
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,461
So these are really just out in the community. What could a general personal access?

321
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:55,850
Sorry about that. And then under analysis, this was a very simple analytic strategy.

322
00:31:55,851 --> 00:32:06,050
We basically did a descriptive analysis where we identified the number of facilities that were mandated under the Affordable Care Act, section 1557.

323
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:09,261
And then we mapped the proportion of those noncompliant facilities by state.

324
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:14,901
I will say now that the SAMHSA has emerged these two surveys into one survey.

325
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:19,791
But still, like, we were really happy that this was a data source that was available.

326
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:29,091
So to measure noncompliance, we first look to see if the mental health or substance abuse facility receives public funds.

327
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,691
And so forth that we looked at their payer mix.

328
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:42,011
And so this included Medicaid, Medicare, VA funds, Department of Defense funds, Indian or Tribal Health Service funds, things of that nature.

329
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:48,820
Now, I will say also a lot more facilities are likely included in this public funds category

330
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:54,220
than what we captured because we did not just blindly include commercial insurance,

331
00:32:54,221 --> 00:33:01,751
but because commercial insurance providers are now available on the exchange plans and are partially subsidized by the federal government.

332
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:10,571
Those are also considered public funds. And so that creates more a larger a larger category here of facilities that receive these funds.

333
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:15,101
We also look to see if they reported not providing services and sign language to that patients,

334
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:17,741
which I'll show you the survey item on the next screen.

335
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:23,051
And if they received money and did not provide services and sign language, then they were considered noncompliant.

336
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:30,371
Please note that we are not using the language of they are compliant because compliance is a bigger issue, which I'll get to on the next slide.

337
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:34,891
So some limitations are that it's a very imprecise survey.

338
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:40,060
So the question that's used to measure sign language services being provided are does this treatment

339
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:44,561
facility provide services in sign language at this location for deaf and hard of hearing?

340
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:51,970
For example, American Sign Language, which is a natural language identified in the 1960s that are used by deaf people, signed English,

341
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:58,571
which is a system of communication that uses English grammar and word order with signs or cued speech,

342
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:01,631
which is a visual modality of phonics, essentially.

343
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:06,851
And so like these are all measuring different types of services,

344
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:10,480
but all of these could be considered accommodation services for deaf and hard of hearing people.

345
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,891
So we felt comfortable moving forward.

346
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:18,941
We use this conservative definition of covered entities, so we did not include the exchange funded plans because we did not have access to know that.

347
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:26,381
So compliance is not a term that we are using for this because compliance requires litigation to occur.

348
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:33,941
And then during the discovery process, early during the lawsuit, the judge in the court will make a determination as to if this is a covered entity.

349
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:39,131
So they will look at their payor mix and determine if they are truly a covered entity under Section 1557.

350
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:43,570
And so also there's if you provide an interpreter, is the interpreter really qualified?

351
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:47,981
Did effective communication really happen? So there's a lot of questions for compliance.

352
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:55,511
So we use noncompliant. So this is the prevalence of mental health facilities by state.

353
00:34:56,351 --> 00:35:03,401
Approximately 98% of the mental health facilities were publicly funded and 41% of those facilities were non-compliant.

354
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:13,931
17 states have more than 50% of facilities non-compliant with South Carolina having the lowest prevalence and Wisconsin having the highest rate there.

355
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:24,841
As far as substance use facilities among mandated facilities, 59% were compliant or excuse me, non-compliant with 35 states having 50% or more,

356
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:30,991
Missouri having the lowest and Idaho having the highest prevalence of non-compliant facilities.

357
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:37,921
Here's a side by side comparison, as some of you may be thinking, Well, what's happening with Missouri and South Carolina and Alabama?

358
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:39,931
They lag behind in so many other measures.

359
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:47,861
These states have very robust programs under their Department of Mental Health Services, specifically for deaf patients who use sign language.

360
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:53,011
So South Carolina has a deaf mental health services program that provides technical assistance

361
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:57,931
and direct counseling to deaf people and other mental health facilities throughout the state.

362
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:01,741
And they actually have a number of deaf counselors that work with them.

363
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:08,810
For some implications of this. This lack of communication access increases the likelihood of death.

364
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:15,800
Patients having health care related trauma, of course, is a violation of their civil rights and is a breach of the medical providers.

365
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:21,501
Codes of ethics for social work, psychiatry, psychology, mental health providers.

366
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,831
But it also complicates staff patient health care navigation.

367
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:29,060
If you're a deaf patient and some of these dates think about if you're needing to seek substance

368
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:34,761
use treatment and you're in California and over 70% of the facilities are non-compliant,

369
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:40,221
how are you going to access that treatment? It really complicates the health care access.

370
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:49,331
So we recommended a multi-pronged policy approach for this. At the policy level, enforcement of Section 1557 really needs to be improved.

371
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:50,741
Currently, it basically is.

372
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:56,141
If the deaf patient feels that they were discriminated against, they can file a lawsuit, which takes a lot of time and a lot of money.

373
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,451
They can report it to the Office of Civil Rights, of Health and Human Services,

374
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:07,211
which may give the facility a slap on the wrist or may decide to go further in-depth with it.

375
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:15,371
Or they can report to the facility who does an internal investigation. So it really requires the deaf patient to be proactive in their advocacy.

376
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:20,561
And this is a system that has really failed them a lot and historically and still today.

377
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,951
And so a lot of people do just disengage from that advocacy.

378
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:35,011
We also recommended license reciprocity to increase the number of sign language fluent mental health providers that deaf patients could access.

379
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:41,381
And so this also includes telehealth reimbursement. So if we have a lot of deaf mental health providers in South Carolina,

380
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:45,611
it would be very good for those to be able to provide services remotely to other patients.

381
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:52,591
And then also increasing the number of deaf and hard of hearing providers through pipeline training programs.

382
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,501
Of course, there's also the qualification sense for interpreters.

383
00:37:56,431 --> 00:38:02,701
Many states, including Florida, does not have a qualification, standard or licensure mandate.

384
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:09,001
So if you took high school ASL and you want to call yourself an interpreter, you could probably be thrown into a mental health facility.

385
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:15,541
And also just really looking more at the payor mix of treatment facilities would be very good to ensure that

386
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:22,201
community facilities are taking public funds because then these patients do have a route through litigation.

387
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:27,001
Healthcare providers need better disability, competency training and other patient level.

388
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:31,140
We need to ensure better early language exposure to prevent language deprivation

389
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:35,401
and associated mental health care outcomes and improve health information access.

390
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,861
And I'm going to take us on to our third study.

391
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:45,791
So this one here is in press currently and health literacy research in practice and it's focused on healthcare,

392
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,151
health literacy and information marginalization during COVID 19.

393
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:56,201
So back to that social ecological model, there's multiple levels of barriers to effective health care communication for deaf people,

394
00:38:56,201 --> 00:39:02,951
which I think that you're getting at this point. There's this lack of enforcement of civil rights laws that are protecting people with disabilities

395
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:06,511
for professional preparation of mental health providers and public health professionals.

396
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,021
During my training program.

397
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:17,021
We did not have any disability focused coursework or information about how to make health communication accessible and at the deaf patient,

398
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,101
individual level, limited English proficiency for some patients and limited health literacy.

399
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:26,131
So let's talk a little bit about emergency communication for people with disabilities.

400
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:29,551
Back in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina,

401
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:38,941
the National Council on Disability investigated the failures that occurred at basically every level impacting people with disabilities.

402
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:44,641
This is a photo of Hurricane Katrina here. It was a Category five storm that hit New Orleans and Louisiana.

403
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:52,321
And some of those failures included inaccessible emergency alerts and a lack of interpreters on the news or in shelters.

404
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:58,711
One deaf person that was interviewed, a survivor from the storm, said that all they saw was an elbow on their TV screen.

405
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:03,511
So the interpreter was cut out. But the storm and still happens today.

406
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:12,271
So that was back in 2005. Here's a video from 2017 here in Florida in Manatee County, which was very close to where the recent hurricane hit Florida.

407
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:22,081
This is not a credentialed interpreter. This is a lifeguard who has a deaf sibling who was pulled in by the county to work as an interpreter.

408
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:29,701
It's a little difficult to read, but on the bottom here and white text is what his signs are interpreted as.

409
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,281
All right. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Public Safety Center as the emergency operations center.

410
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:42,551
Today, we have been given the news that Hurricane Irma track has shifted towards Manatee County,

411
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:47,351
which increases our vulnerability to rain on verge and heavy winds.

412
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:54,691
Based on that news being issued and mandatory evacuation already level a hurricane evacuation zone.

413
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:59,881
Those are generally on are by the water on the Gulf of Mexico, the island.

414
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:04,471
So I think we get the point that that's not really fluent sign language,

415
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:10,231
nor is it providing the necessary information related to mandatory evacuations of certain zones.

416
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:20,220
Next slide. So whenever accessing COBRA 19 information, if you think back to the early part of the COVID 19 pandemic,

417
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:25,311
there was really a lack of clear communication coming from all levels of the government, federal, state and local governments.

418
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:33,541
Everybody was saying something differently, particularly during the early lockdowns that aerosol users early on in the pandemic did seek

419
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:38,251
information using English based text forms because a lot of that was not available in sign language,

420
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:43,501
which of course led to those challenges with understanding due to poor health literacy and limited English proficiency.

421
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:50,821
And several epidemiology studies have been published since that have indicated that deaf patients are at higher risk of COVID 19

422
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:57,091
infection than non deaf people with deaf and hard of hearing people of color who are at the furthest levels of marginalization,

423
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:01,890
at highest risk. And some of this information barriers did go away eventually.

424
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:05,611
So, for example, the National Association of the Deaf, a civil rights organization,

425
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:11,941
did sued the Trump administration for not providing American Sign Language interpreters during White House briefings.

426
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:17,761
That was then settled during the Biden administration. Who provided interpreters during those briefings.

427
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:25,721
So this data comes from a survey on pregnancy experience, deaf and hard of hearing women, which was 80 questions long.

428
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:30,041
It was administered between May 2020 and July 2021,

429
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:35,201
and then it used a convenient sampling methodology and eligibility criteria were that

430
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,891
they had to be deaf and hard of hearing before the birth of their most recent child.

431
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:44,561
21 years are older and self-report a child being born within the past ten years.

432
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,890
Or outcome measure was related to this information,

433
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:53,501
to marginalization of have you had trouble getting important and easy access to information about the coronavirus?

434
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:59,591
I wasn't involved in the survey design. I came onto this project after the fact. So you will notice that this is a double barreled question.

435
00:42:59,831 --> 00:43:04,721
Getting important information and easy access to information or two different construct constructs

436
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:10,861
of health literacy was measured with a single item from the Choose Health Literacy screener.

437
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:17,561
So this does have fairly good specificity and sensitivity on how confident are you with filling out medical forms by yourself?

438
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:23,081
Adequate, being very competent or competent, inadequate. Being neutral, somewhat competent or not competent.

439
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,061
And the language preferences again, remember, this is where language gets tricky. Which languages do you prefer to use?

440
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:32,441
Please select all that apply sign language are ASL, English, Spanish or other.

441
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:38,861
And so we had many people who said Oh, ASL and English or ASL in Spanish or ASL English.

442
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:45,251
And another sign language of lesser diffusion in the United States, like Indian sign language from India or Chinese sign language.

443
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:51,561
And so we categorize these as. We had known that just that Spanish by themselves.

444
00:43:51,561 --> 00:44:00,141
So that was removed. And so we had English by itself and then bilingual ESL or English and then ESL by itself.

445
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:10,631
And so we essentially hypothesize that language specifically being ASL user versus an English speaker was going to have a higher

446
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:18,320
odds ratio of reporting this information marginalization so it being difficult to access COVID 19 information and that people who

447
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:25,060
were bilingual were would have a nonsignificant no difference between English speakers because they would be able to move into

448
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:33,130
that English language modality comfortably and that people with inadequate health literacy would have higher odds of information,

449
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:39,461
marginalization. And so we did a logistic regression model using full information, maximum likelihood to account for missing data.

450
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:48,671
Some limitations here, limited sample and sampling design, single item outcome measure, and then small sample sizes leading to small cell sizes.

451
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,741
So not able to test interaction models.

452
00:44:51,611 --> 00:44:58,121
These were the results which essentially indicate that language, a modality was not associated with information,

453
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:01,840
marginalization, which was very interesting for us, but health literacy was.

454
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:09,400
And so having an adequate health literacy had about 2.1 times higher odds of not feeling

455
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:13,661
marginalized with COVID information of reporting that it's difficult to access coded information.

456
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:19,871
We did pair this with a open ended question about barriers to receiving COVID information,

457
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:24,851
and here's a good quote that does a good job of describing it. I can't really find reliable sources on the Internet.

458
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:29,171
The few I find don't do a good job of explaining coronavirus to the general public,

459
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:33,101
and almost none of the news sources have reliable, high quality captioning.

460
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:37,990
So those failures that were identified back in 2025 with Hurricane Katrina and the

461
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:42,881
federal law that is available for protecting this captioning is still not working.

462
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:47,291
Some additional issues were clickbait or conflicting information on the internet.

463
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:53,320
ASL interpreters cut out a video frame, so only seeing the art of the interpreter and also just cognitive load.

464
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:56,321
So it was very overwhelming because of the changing information.

465
00:45:57,481 --> 00:46:01,591
The locations here are that language preference not being associated with COVID 19 information.

466
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:06,841
Marginalization among deaf people indicates that we should really be tailoring information to health literacy

467
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:13,021
principles because those deaf people with inadequate literacy remain at higher risk of that information,

468
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:15,960
marginalization. And so for this,

469
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:22,531
we should better prepare our health communication specialist and public health practitioners to meet the needs of people with limited health literacy.

470
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:27,091
Because it might it will be definitely more helpful for a general population, not just deaf people.

471
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:37,141
Some major takeaways here are that deaf people are a health disparities population, making up about 55 million people in the United States.

472
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,051
They're underserved in health care and public health practice.

473
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:49,351
And that health communication, whether it be in the emergency room in mental health facilities or an emergency broadcast,

474
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:53,910
is limited by factors so that the social ecological model, but especially related to policy,

475
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,351
enforcement, training and availability of services and the development of materials.

476
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:03,811
So really what I hope that this takes away is that we really have to look outside of the individual level.

477
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:10,831
A deaf and hard of hearing person is not going to be able to create the access to information on their own without overcoming very large hurdles.

478
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:15,841
So we should really be doing this from a systems down approach. And that's all I have.

479
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:22,241
So I'm going to stop sharing my screen. I think we have 10 minutes for questions.

480
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:31,351
I don't see what the question was. A John.

481
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:36,740
I really appreciated your your remarks.

482
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:46,131
And I, I didn't see a question in the chat which I can read.

483
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:51,211
It's high time. Thanks for this talk.

484
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:58,560
Can you point to any specific localities where deaf and hard of hearing folks are broadly receiving quality,

485
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:08,491
accessible health care for their local or contextual factors that support adherence to adding level for etc. standards?

486
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:16,951
Absolutely so. Rochester, New York, has one of the largest per capita deaf populations in the United States that use sign language.

487
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:27,191
And that's not by accident. Rochester is home to the Rochester Institute for Technology, which has the National Technical Institute for the Deaf,

488
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,971
a postsecondary education institution for deaf individuals.

489
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:36,911
They also have the Rochester School for the Deaf, which is a K-through-12 school, a New York public school.

490
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:44,051
They're in the area. They also had the Rochester Association for the Deaf, which is a very long standing deaf club.

491
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,921
So it has a very large population of deaf people there.

492
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:58,301
And that deaf community has been extremely engaged in advocacy for decades, which has created a very accessible environment.

493
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:04,931
I mean, they have deaf doctors that work in the hospital system there. They have deaf psychiatrists that are there, deaf mental health providers.

494
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:09,521
They have deaf researchers that are there, a lot of deaf professionals.

495
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:16,300
And in addition to more like community members. And part of that has been a lot of just education.

496
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:21,071
And really it was built to be accessible. I mean, deaf people have lived there for decades.

497
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:26,521
And so that's one area. Another area is D.C., where the Gallaudet University,

498
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:34,121
the world's largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing is D.C., has an office for disabilities.

499
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:39,581
Maryland has a deaf and hard of hearing civil rights office that frequently consults in the area,

500
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:45,761
a higher prevalence of deaf professionals who are more likely to have the resources

501
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:52,481
and time to go through lawsuits or litigation or more intense advocacy efforts.

502
00:49:53,321 --> 00:50:02,331
Austin, Texas has a very large area, but of course, even within these areas, deaf patients do report some limited health care access.

503
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:05,591
I'm thinking of like Tampa, Florida, which has a very large deaf population.

504
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:11,590
Deaf patients kind of know which hospitals to go to because some hospitals don't provide interpreters,

505
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:15,731
whereas others are very good about providing access. So hopefully that provides some.

506
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:27,181
Insight as to what you're looking for, Carol. Thank you for that.

507
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:30,451
Any other questions either from our.

508
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:42,170
Online attenders or those here in person. Well, I have a question for you, Dr. James.

509
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:46,741
So I would be this is really interesting, important work.

510
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:49,871
And I notice your affiliation.

511
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:57,521
You're with the Department of Family Medicine, the Center for Disability Health and Wellness, as well as the Mixed Methods Program.

512
00:50:58,031 --> 00:51:09,980
And I really appreciate your work. Illustrative quotes that really get beyond what's in the survey data, for example, that you use.

513
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:19,231
And I'm just wondering if you could share a little bit about the kind of work that you're presently engaged in at the University of Michigan.

514
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:23,060
And I've had a lecturer from the Mixed Methods Program,

515
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:29,091
in part because I know that some of our epidemiology students really want to cultivate some

516
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:34,821
skills in that area just because of the nuance and the richness it brings to research.

517
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:42,261
Absolutely. So currently I'm involved in several studies where we're using more advanced quant methods.

518
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:54,351
So the mixed methods literature is kind of limited by very strong and robust qualitative data analysis and very weak,

519
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,561
relatively quantitative data analysis.

520
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:04,461
My graduate minor is in research and evaluation methodology, which was housed basically in a Department of Educational Statistics.

521
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:10,041
So a lot of my background is an online variable modeling and item response theory and psychometrics.

522
00:52:10,581 --> 00:52:17,811
And so I'm very excited about the hope of integrating more latent variable modeling and mixed methods studies.

523
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:23,571
So I'm currently working on a systematic methodological review on how in class analysis,

524
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:30,051
enlightened profile analysis and other mixture modeling techniques are used, and mixed methods studies to create better inferences.

525
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:38,750
I'm also involved in one study right now where we are looking at comparing the Veterans Affairs population to a civilian

526
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:45,921
population of people who have traumatic spinal cord injury and the onset of Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

527
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:51,980
During that, because there is a link that Alzheimer's disease may be having an onset of

528
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:56,691
less than six years after spinal cord injury for people who are over age 45.

529
00:52:57,501 --> 00:53:04,730
And so for that, we're doing several survival analysis models and regression decomposition models in addition to some qualitative work.

530
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:07,970
And so we're really able to merge both datasets to get an understanding while

531
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:12,651
there is a statistical difference between VA populations and civilian populations.

532
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:20,630
But what are some of the more descriptive reasons why that's happening above and beyond the quantitative data,

533
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:24,651
which are often so lacking in social equity related variables?

534
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:29,481
And so that's some of the work that we're currently doing right now, which is really exciting,

535
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:33,831
and I'm excited to hear that AP students are interested in more of like mixed methods.

536
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:42,031
Lee Well, thank you so much, Dr. James. I hear the next class clamoring outside the auditorium.

537
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:47,730
So we'll thank you again. And I'll I'll stop the recording and really appreciate your time.

538
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:51,421
And I hope the audience is also appreciated there in front of you.

Thank you so much. Definitely.

00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:59,881
I do see two questions in the Q&A online, so I will go on and just type my answers there, if that's okay before we close out.

541
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:08,761
Oh, right. I'm sorry. I just. I neglected to see those, but I think we do need to conclude anyway because of the time.

542
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:09,511
So.
