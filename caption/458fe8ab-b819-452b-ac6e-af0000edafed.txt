1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,860
Just like this one.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:34,950
Oh, that's true. We're just actually, at this point that you want me to look so good since I was on someone so important.

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Yes, I was here. Yeah, I was told that that is what makes it so scary.

4
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,720
I mean, we're just trying to be able to see his eyebrows just like.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,760
Yes. Actually, she told me to bring my email.

6
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,300
Yes. You have at least ten other things.

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,350
They took one. Yeah. He keeps.

8
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:54,170
I've even put my orientation. I want you to join our team.

9
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:37,140
This work. And like I said, I think I can play at least three seats in the morning.

10
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Okay. Okay. No, it's not like.

11
00:02:50,490 --> 00:03:00,000
So how we today how we celebrations today going on in response to that.

12
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,200
I think plenty of goodies available for everybody.

13
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:12,450
And trick or treating kind of like that.

14
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,170
Only through your office. Oh, really? Wow. So are you prepared?

15
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,629
Oh, yeah. It's going to be a busy night at my house.

16
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,400
I live in I live in Canton, and we have 300 kids who show up each week.

17
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:40,350
So, um, you know, between 530 and 8:00, it's just a steady stream of and that's what I'm doing tonight.

18
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,450
I was wondering, is it possible for you to release seven grades on campus?

19
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,060
Not that the quizzes do now, but I'm going to go over that right now.

20
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,480
Okay. Okay. All right. Quiz number seven. Question number one.

21
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:11,420
Androgen pattern of adipose tissue expansion. You would expect to find all of the following except in this particular question.

22
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:22,219
There are two correct answers now. So if you had this one, so you would you would you would expect to see more adipose tissue of the wings.

23
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,820
Right? And but you wouldn't expect to see adipose tissue expansion by hyperplasia, right?

24
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,240
That's possible, correct. And you would not expect to see adipose tissue expansion.

25
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,040
You would expect to see adipose tissue expansion by hypertrophy.

26
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,590
Right. But you wouldn't expect to see very little of the deficit, hypoxic fibrosis.

27
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,790
So these two would be marked increase.

28
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,540
Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm just confused by this one, too, because I was wondering like,

29
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,729
are they two totally separate things that happen at different times like hyperplasia and hypertrophy?

30
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,330
Because I was thinking maybe they could both be happening.

31
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,719
And that's why the answer could have been, I don't know, I just I was ethically confused.

32
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,660
No. If they were like two separate things, they're like they could kind of intertwine. Yeah, it was a new question.

33
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,160
And that's why the confusion. Okay, there's there's two correct answers.

34
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:32,880
So, yes, Christina, there are also be like visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous fat tissue and android and these are these are generalizations.

35
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,740
So yes, if you have an increase in adipose tissue and then primarily your tendency toward occurring above the waist.

36
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,550
Okay, but you can also see some occurring below the waist as well.

37
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:54,209
So can they happen at the same time or no, can they happen at the same time, both lower and upper body hyperplasia and hypertrophy?

38
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,410
You can, you can. But that one will dominate over the other.

39
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:07,770
Right. Okay. Adequate tissue. Thanks. I'm. It's a question to.

40
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:17,819
So you're scientists who's trying to measure brown adipose tissue activity with this positron emission tomography technique.

41
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:27,510
So you take this up to 18 feet, which is like a glucose that is a positron emitter,

42
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,729
and you injected in that your subjects and the tissues that take it up and body will release the

43
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,300
positron will be the brown adipose tissue that you can image and require these images from a PET scan.

44
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,430
And the type of environment that somebody is in will affect the activity of that brown adipose tissue.

45
00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:01,990
So the images that I showed you from the previous lecture were collected from scans that were done on almost 2000 people,

46
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,270
and they were all done at room temperature.

47
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:16,510
If you wanted to conduct an act, the assay where you would actually stimulate brown adipose activity would be at room temperature.

48
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,850
But if you put a cooling vest on somebody, it would increase brown adipose tissue activity.

49
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:36,640
How about this one? If you gave subjects a sugary drink to consume before they received the 2018 effigy, will that do?

50
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:54,680
Could there possibly be competition with it for the brown adipose tissue to take up to give them a sugary drink before you gave them 18 at the PGA?

51
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:01,490
It's possible that you could reduce the uptake of this particular tracer so that this is a cooling vest,

52
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,020
a correct answer for cooling them down when you're stimulating brown out of tissue activity.

53
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:14,560
Everybody see that? And then the last one.

54
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,780
So you're working in a lab and you're testing the pharmacologic potential of different dietary supplements.

55
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:34,210
One treatment is called X one, and it's thought to stimulate that it's a stimulant and causes negative energy balance and consumed over several weeks.

56
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,050
And after one week of the supplement, what changes do you expect to find in human subjects?

57
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,330
So if there's a negative energy balance, would you expect to see an increase in leptin would go down?

58
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,850
Right. Um, would you expect to see an increase in that at the next level?

59
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah. How about TANF?

60
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,040
Increase will probably decrease. And um, final six would probably decrease as well.

61
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:18,670
Okay. Now, can you explain why the I sense and I guess I'm just confused because we talked a lot about like exercise in aisle six.

62
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:27,580
Yeah. So all that's done here is they're taking a sub, a stimulant that passes through appetite.

63
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:39,500
Right. And they're not exercising or doing anything else. Okay.

64
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,100
So how many of you heard about these experiments with liposuction?

65
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:56,090
It's fine. At Washington University. Probably. I'm the most famous once you've heard about this with a couple of you.

66
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,489
So this is kind of weird. And so liposuction is a surgical procedure done by plastic surgeons.

67
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,360
And it's a cosmetic procedure. It's not something you do for to improve somebody's metabolic health anyway.

68
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,760
Having said that, there were some experiments done to see if it would.

69
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:28,760
And what it's done here is to reduce the subcutaneous adipose tissue around the buttocks and thighs and around the abdomen and in some cases,

70
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:41,470
around the upper arms. So what's done here is they insert a cannula into the tissue, into the subcutaneous adipose tissue layer.

71
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:48,200
And they flush in a certain solution and they suck it all out.

72
00:10:48,710 --> 00:11:00,140
And with these very high volume procedures, they can remove kilogram quantities of adipose tissue and the aspirate.

73
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:07,280
What comes out is you'll have some oil from the ruptured adipocytes, you'll have some floating around,

74
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,230
some adipose tissue floating around in it, and then you'll have lots of fluid associated with that as well.

75
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,320
And then the following day, when somebody has this procedure, they're very sore,

76
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,400
their tissues are inflamed and you'll see an increase in a lot of things in their blood after this procedure.

77
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:33,010
But if you wait for a long period of time, there may or may not be changes to the parameters.

78
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,310
And it depends on the conditions in which you subject that individual after they recover from the trauma of the surgery.

79
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,650
And there were a lot of studies done on this.

80
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,940
There are just 12 of them that were picked out in this particular review paper.

81
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,580
And notice the small number of subjects here.

82
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:06,000
There are 12 different studies. Now, some of them are dealing with mostly women, mostly obese women.

83
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:20,880
And once a group had men with mixed weights and then some had normal glucose tolerance, and only two studies had people with diabetes mellitus.

84
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:32,220
Type two diabetes, the volume of aspirin taken out of these individuals was very, very different in some cases.

85
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:45,030
So the threshold that they considered in this paper to be significant in a significant amount was over over 400 milliliters.

86
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,380
The average was something like 700 milliliters of aspirin.

87
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,830
And then here are the different ages. Six are usually young people in their twenties and thirties.

88
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,150
Very few of these individuals had diabetes.

89
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:12,370
And then the follow up time that was due, sometimes it was very brief, 28 days in one study, and in other times it was a year or later.

90
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:29,130
And then in some groups, they controlled their caloric intake to kind of see if this decrease amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue was out.

91
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:38,040
And as you can see in some of the studies, you did see a decrease in BMI in some of them, this particular might really change that much.

92
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,720
And then they had the level of therapeutic evidence.

93
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:51,960
The level of therapeutic evidence has to do with whether or not they had a large population, whether or not they had a control group.

94
00:13:53,130 --> 00:14:00,470
So therefore, it means that it was a controlled clinical trial, which is not as good as evidence.

95
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,220
Number two, so that the lower the number, the greater the evidence for the scale.

96
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,860
The two designation indicates that it was a controlled clinical trial.

97
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay. I'm sorry. The four was a controlled clinical trial.

98
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:30,570
The two is a randomized clinical trial. So in terms of the effects on insulin sensitivity, glucose level, at some level, it was mixed results.

99
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:38,110
Mixed results probably had to do with a lot of differences in terms of follow up time, in terms of degree,

100
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:48,450
in positive terms, in terms of whether or not the individuals had or controlled for their caloric intake afterwards.

101
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,340
And then the most part, you don't see very much of a change.

102
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,390
Some you do, some you don't have. On the next slide, kind of a summary of all of.

103
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
So this is large volume microstructure.

104
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,379
And all of these procedures were done with subcutaneous adipose tissue.

105
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,170
And only one in two of the subjects in this study did they actually take out visceral,

106
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,780
adipose tissue in people who are undergoing a bariatric surgery procedure.

107
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,070
Okay.

108
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:35,030
So so this is a 12 studies, prospective studies to a randomized controlled trials and three included up to three control groups, which is important.

109
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:44,190
And this was a pooled analysis of 364 different patients in the mean aspirin.

110
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:55,140
The mean amount of stuff that they were able to recover was quite a bit 7.4 million plus or -2000 milliliters.

111
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,600
So it's 7.4 liters. That's a lot.

112
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,050
That's a lot of tissue to take out of the subcutaneous compartment from someone.

113
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,400
So here's the overall change in BMI.

114
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,640
And again, the time of follow up varied from very brief period of time, 28 days to 1.2 years.

115
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:30,270
And in terms of lipids. Now, seven of the studies showed a nonsignificant trend toward a decrease in total cholesterol.

116
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,220
Overall, mean reduction at two had a significant decrease in triglycerides,

117
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:47,310
but also a change where I when I looked when I converted that this reduction the reduction in total cholesterol point to 1 million moles per liter.

118
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,700
I converted that two milligrams per deciliter which will the value we're used to seeing.

119
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,570
Right. It's really small. It's eight milligrams per deciliter.

120
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:06,640
Two showed introduction at triglycerides. As you would expect, leptin should decrease, right?

121
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,610
You have less cells that produce leptin. But only four studies showed a decrease in life.

122
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,640
And again, you know, who knows what's going on with the follow up, the time period,

123
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,610
whether they are on a controlled diet or whether they're raising the caloric intake afterward.

124
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,330
Some of the studies were controlled for that. Some were not.

125
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,960
Two of the studies to the trial showed a decrease in aisle six and TANF and the rest did not.

126
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,600
Two of the studies showed an increase in the zipper neck, and the rest did not.

127
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,100
And two of the studies evaluated.

128
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,770
Only two of the studies had subjects with type two diabetes, and the rest had normal insulin sensitivity.

129
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:08,060
And after a procedure, six of the studies reported improvement in insulin sensitivity and six did not.

130
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:19,790
And remember, there was an even split between the higher quality study, the randomized control versus the clinical control trial or the level four.

131
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:28,910
And then this is remember, this is a paper written by plastic surgeons saying so current data,

132
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:37,969
although conflicting and I highlighted conflicting here, appear to support the notion that large volume liposuction can affect cardiovascular risk

133
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:45,470
factors and metabolic balance and insulin sensitive insulin resistance in positive ways.

134
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:56,120
Future research with prospective studies is needed to clarify the role of large volume of viral suction and improving overall health.

135
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,360
And I have to disagree. I don't think this is a good idea.

136
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,090
So you're shrinking. You're essentially what does liposuction due to the size of the bathtub.

137
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,920
We talked about the bathtub analogy as your capacity to hold liquids increases.

138
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,709
So I would predict all of these studies would show us potentially a negative effect.

139
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,890
Right. You can expand your adipose tissue under the right conditions, but shrinking the bathtub, I would think.

140
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:33,510
Good idea. Somebody has hand over here, so I'll factor out of this.

141
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:42,200
I disconnected significantly increased two studies. Was there just no change and all of a sudden there was no change or not a significant change?

142
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:51,290
Yeah. And then you just see this association between my perception and confused episodes because we are decreasing leptin.

143
00:19:51,860 --> 00:20:00,890
Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question. So you would think that this is something that would be more prominently discussed, but that's not really.

144
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,970
Yeah. So I do work with people who have gone through this.

145
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,200
They have they have to go through a very strict diet credit.

146
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,040
Before and after and after. Really? Then that could explain the insulin sensitivity.

147
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:28,670
Oh, yes. Yeah. So the idea here in these studies was to reduce the amount of adipose tissue to kind of mimic what you would see

148
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,900
if somebody just lost their adipose tissue through lifestyle modification and they didn't get the same results.

149
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:46,190
With the lifestyle modification, you'll see a reduction in adipose tissue improvements in metabolic health that were not evident in these studies.

150
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,730
Okay.

151
00:20:47,450 --> 00:21:01,280
So in terms of what's going on in the tissues that are affected by lipid levels, deliver the pancreas muscle in terms of its sensitivity to insulin.

152
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,389
That's an important question. You know, whether or not lipid levels in those tissues have change.

153
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:16,400
And that was not assessed by these studies. And 11 of these studies included removal of subcutaneous fat tissue.

154
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:26,419
Only one study, the client study in 2008 looked at the removal of visceral adipose tissue,

155
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,610
and those studies were done in subjects that had undergone bariatric surgery.

156
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,010
And they didn't show very much of a difference because two subjects. Now there are also different sites mentioned.

157
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,930
So you have the abdomen, but you also have the hips.

158
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:51,580
So you would expect different. Yeah. Yes. So the interpretation of this kind of information is a mess in terms of trying to come up with a,

159
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:57,110
you know, a baseline in terms of saying, oh, these are the this is this is what happens.

160
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,680
So I wanted to make you aware of this because this is among plastic surgeons anyhow.

161
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,340
I think. Okay.

162
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,260
So we get to the learning objectives for today.

163
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,959
So one thing I should mention here is that with with we're behind day,

164
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,180
but I have in the schedule built into the schedule and open date on the very last

165
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,739
day of classes that we just kind of shift things forward and if we get done earlier,

166
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:39,590
we can ship them back again. So for today, we're going to talk about we're going to define the criteria for metabolically healthy and unhealthy.

167
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,950
And you in your medical nutrition therapy class, if you've gone over a metabolic syndrome that no longer.

168
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,310
So in other learning objectives,

169
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:01,470
she explains why the pattern of body fat distribution is better as a better predictor of metabolic health status, BMI or total adiposity.

170
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,010
To understand the differences between men and women, inadequate adipose distribution.

171
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:19,320
And this is complex. I will try to give you a summary and to describe the factors that affect adipose tissue distribution,

172
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:32,400
like the effects of exercise and the effects of oh, the means effect of cortisol.

173
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,750
All right, so what's metabolic syndrome?

174
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:53,150
So this is from the Harmonized International Diabetes Federation, and there are criteria for which you have to satisfy to this diagnosis.

175
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,460
So you have metabolic syndrome, you have to have three of these five different components, lipids.

176
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:16,400
So if your triglycerides exceed 150 milligrams per deciliter, you have one factor, or if your HDL cholesterol was below the threshold.

177
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,550
So 40 milligrams per deciliter for men and 50 milligrams per deciliter for women.

178
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:34,860
Difference here being that men are more at a greater risk of cardiovascular disease related to cholesterol.

179
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,310
Blood pressure. So this reflects the new guidelines for blood pressure.

180
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:54,790
So less than 130 millimeters of mercury for the systolic values and less than 85 millimeters of mercury for the diastolic value.

181
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,950
Or if somebody is on medication for blood pressure, you can.

182
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,610
So fasting blood glucose, less than 100 milligrams per deciliter,

183
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:15,840
or if somebody has so if you're above that threshold, you would be considered to have one of these things.

184
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:26,729
Or if you're on medication to control diabetes and you have waist circumference

185
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,770
that exceeds 100 or two centimeters for men and 88 centimeters for women.

186
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:43,230
So in terms of if you have more than three of these, you would be considered to have metabolic syndrome, three or more.

187
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:54,880
Okay. So lipids, triglycerides are HDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure exceeding the threshold, fasting blood glucose and weight circumference.

188
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:05,920
So it's been known for a long time. People who have metabolic syndrome are at a greater risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes,

189
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,050
cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic, fatty, liver disease, stroke and many others.

190
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,720
Okay. Yeah. Kristina, I think I know the answer to this, but just the way that the slide,

191
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,760
the previous slide was written, it's like you don't need, like the lipids.

192
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,830
You can have one or the other. Yeah, you can have one or the other.

193
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:37,480
That's true. So you saw this image before and this was the image taken from the paper for the reading for today.

194
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:48,580
And it's a DEXA scan from two different women who have the same are nearly identical BMI and they're about the same age.

195
00:26:49,630 --> 00:27:03,680
So the woman on the left side, she has 30, 34 years of age and four lean body mass is shown here and her fat mass is shown here.

196
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,160
So 44 kilograms of lean mass, 30.8 kilograms of fat.

197
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,770
This other woman here is 39. I got the same.

198
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,170
Lean mass about about the same 44 kilograms fat mass.

199
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,060
31 kilograms. So these are matched individuals.

200
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:35,710
And the one on the left, Mir, is has would be classified as metabolically healthy with obesity.

201
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,570
And the one on the right here would be metabolically unhealthy with obesity.

202
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,840
And today or this morning,

203
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:53,230
we're going to talk about how the deposition of the adipose tissue in the upper or in the lower body affects metabolic health.

204
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,430
And some theories that are that have been used to describe this as a risk factor.

205
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,970
About the healthy, obese and unhealthy foods.

206
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,850
So these are the classifications you'll see.

207
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:25,410
So the first thing you've we've talked a bit about in terms of measuring BMI versus some other anthropomorphic assessments.

208
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:33,300
So you can measure you can estimate this with girth measurements.

209
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:41,910
Doing the measurement of waist circumference or doing a measurement of both the waist and shifts to give you a hip ratio.

210
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,930
Then if you have greater resources,

211
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,550
they're not going to do this clinically unless there's a really good reason or if you have a lot of money to do a research study.

212
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,220
Would you have direct measures of and adipose tissue?

213
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:12,340
So the DEXA scan is the gold standard. Magnetic resonance imaging has also been done.

214
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,930
It's pretty good in terms of its assessment of lean and adipose tissue.

215
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:23,790
And then there's computed tomography and you've seen some scanned C.T. scans before.

216
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,629
And the CT scans are essentially x rays.

217
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,510
And that gives you information about the density of the tissues.

218
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:43,170
And it's very specific and it can show you the location of different tissues based on their density and in terms of.

219
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,270
The specificity in terms of where the structures are.

220
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:59,570
And if you were to take an image and make an assessment of based on the density of the tissues in terms of what they are,

221
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:08,660
that the city scan is very accurate in that sense. But you're going to get you're getting a whole body C.T. scanner, just a trunk city scan.

222
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:16,430
There's a fair amount of radiation associated with it. So that's that's a limitation with that particular procedure.

223
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,740
And all of these direct measurements are quite a bit more expensive than just the measuring growths.

224
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:38,690
Okay. So I showed you a graph like this before looking at quartiles for body mass index and waist hip ratio and how they are.

225
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,020
How predictive are they for the incident?

226
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:52,369
Coronary heart disease. So this is coronary heart disease incidence per 1000 people on the Y axis and the quartiles here low,

227
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:57,530
medium, high and highest for waist hip ratio and BMI.

228
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,870
And this is the way epidemiologists like to split things out in terms of stretching out their data,

229
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,540
going high, low, medium, high and highest using this criteria.

230
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,860
We see in red here, BMI, and you see this,

231
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:20,030
the j-shaped curve that you saw in the very first class in terms of risk of coronary heart disease incidence.

232
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,950
But when you look at the blue bars, which is the waist hip to ratio,

233
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:33,500
you see more of a linear relationship in terms of it being a better predictor of coronary heart disease in men.

234
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:44,719
So it seems like this measuring this estimation or estimate of body composition

235
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,740
by measuring currents is better as a better predictor of this risk factor.

236
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:59,290
And when we do the same type of measurement in women, this time we see a similar relationship.

237
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:08,020
In this case, we're looking at weight circumference and relative risk of diabetes.

238
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:17,379
This particular data was from the Women's Health Initiative, a women's health study from Nurses Health Study,

239
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,450
it's been called this is a cohort of individuals in the greater Boston area.

240
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:28,840
And the earlier people who were in this study were mostly women, mostly white women.

241
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,620
And over time, they've included more men and they've included more, more.

242
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:43,650
More ethnic and racial populations. This is a changing cohort over time.

243
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:50,190
But the thing I want you to look at here is that this waist circumference increase

244
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,620
is a pretty good predictor of the relative risk of developing Type two diabetes.

245
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,430
The follow up that was done, and this is the time period that was done over a long period of time.

246
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,550
So we're looking at people over several years and looking at their waist circumference.

247
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
And how good is it as a predictor of type two diabetes?

248
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,190
And I just put up here that the recommendation in terms of a threshold which is right here.

249
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,360
And even before we see this threshold, you see an increase in relative risk.

250
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,300
And this probably relates to adipose tissue function.

251
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:40,620
So you can have a normal BMI, you can have what appears to be perhaps a healthy physique.

252
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:50,720
But if your adipose tissue is not functioning well, you could still be at risk for metabolic function.

253
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,340
That seems to matter more than anything else.

254
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:05,220
And these anthropomorphic measurements are predictors, and they're associated with that change in risk and they're associated with function as well.

255
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:19,020
All right. So what does this look like in terms of these measurements when you're looking at a more sophisticated approach to assess body composition?

256
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:29,530
Here's your I've seen this before. The green shirt represents the muscle tissue and the white area represents adipose tissue.

257
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,130
And this is based on the density measurements.

258
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:45,040
Here's a CT scan shown here where you're looking at differences in the density of the tissue and you can acquire a whole body scanner,

259
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,090
just that trunk region. And that's that's what's done here.

260
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,970
And you can see an increase here in adipose tissue as you go down the trunk.

261
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:05,380
And you can false color these images to indicate areas of visceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous adipose tissue.

262
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,270
And you can tell the computer to count how many pixels are in those areas,

263
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:19,690
and it'll give you an area of adipose tissue versus muscle, whatever would have your lean, mean tissue.

264
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:37,209
So this next particular slide shows you the differences in adiposity within the subcutaneous and

265
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:44,560
the visceral compartment individuals who have the same BMI or the same waist circumference.

266
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:59,229
So all of the people in this group who have a BMI of 24 have differing levels of total adiposity with a little bit difference

267
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:10,420
in total adiposity and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue or a set or intra abdominal adipose tissue or our 80.

268
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,350
So here's an individual you see very little enter abdominal adipose tissue and

269
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,390
see some subcutaneous adipose tissue or abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue.

270
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,630
And then here's the ratio .0.43.

271
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,070
Okay. As we go down this particular figure,

272
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:44,590
you see a little bit of an increase in total adipose tissue and the amount of intra abdominal adipose tissue increases a little bit.

273
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:53,620
We have some white showing here in a little bit more adipose tissue in the subcutaneous compartment, so that ratio goes up a little bit.

274
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,740
And then in this individual, the total adipose tissue is now 21.8 liters.

275
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:09,890
And we've seen this increase in S.A.T.s and Andrew's abdominal adiposity giving us a higher ratio.

276
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:21,470
So same BMI, but very different levels of adiposity in both the visceral, subcutaneous and plant compartment.

277
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,860
So you would be at the greatest risk for a metabolic syndrome with that with a higher level of intra abdominal adipose tissue, right?

278
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:45,700
Yes. Now let's look at just waist circumference and that's a proxy for tissue.

279
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,860
And I showed you a graph that estimates the risk of cardiovascular disease in men.

280
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,970
In that particular figure, I wish they had put error bars because of something like this.

281
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,439
Okay, so here's waist circumference. We're centimeters.

282
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,899
And these are women. And you're seeing here a difference.

283
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,300
Now, even though they have the same waist circumference,

284
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:22,300
you can have very different levels of both intra and abdominal adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

285
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:32,260
So we go from the ratio of 0.24 here, 2.4 to more subcutaneous and visceral.

286
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:42,720
And then here this particular individual has more abdominal adipose tissue than their subcutaneous adipose tissue.

287
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:49,270
And this person would be at a greater risk of metabolic syndrome because of this different pattern,

288
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,760
even though waist circumference and these different groups is all the same.

289
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:10,719
So between C and S, would there be a difference in risk if that was a subject discussed in this paper?

290
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:19,060
But that's a that's a really good question. I would predict the risk would be similar because of the location of the adipose tissue.

291
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,720
Remember the bathtub analogy? If you have a small bathtub,

292
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,259
you can have type two diabetes because you're not taking up your ability to take

293
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:36,310
up lipids declines and that declines with having less subcutaneous tissue.

294
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:54,580
So here's another example we're looking here adjusted adipose tissue in the trunk, and it's showing you here this particular image,

295
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:05,980
this individual has more subcutaneous than intra abdominal and the individual in the B portions of the figure they have,

296
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:14,140
the ratio of intra abdominal to subcutaneous is a bit higher.

297
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,650
So they would have more of the injured abdominal adipose tissue than this particular individual.

298
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:29,440
And in this case, again, because of the visceral adipose tissue which is less functional, they're going to have a higher risk of metabolic syndrome.

299
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:39,490
So the point of this is to say, yeah, the circumference can be a better measure of EMI, but you've got this going on too.

300
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:47,050
And if you wanted to be exact, sure you can do a CT scan in everybody, but that's going to be expensive.

301
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:53,710
It's going to in terms of telling people about the risk and it's not going to be practical,

302
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,200
the radiation associated with that, which is associated with other types of health risks.

303
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:04,490
So the point of this is it really isn't a perfect assessment tool for this.

304
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,080
They all have their shortcomings. Okay.

305
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:18,030
Back to this study with the individuals who were treated with Pioglitazone.

306
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,170
So I'm giving you more details here. So just to remember this story.

307
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:30,780
So remember, pioglitazone are the drugs that activate Gamma and promote it to the genesis.

308
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:39,840
And in this study, they're looking at abdominal fat distribution and insulin sensitivity in people with preexisting type two diabetes.

309
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:49,740
So they're they want to want to know looks at the mechanisms by which the PIOGLITAZONE improves insulin resistance.

310
00:41:50,730 --> 00:42:01,350
And in this study, small amount of patients, 13, nine men and four women aged 52 years of age, they were treated for five years.

311
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,549
They were started on pioglitazone for six weeks.

312
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,000
And maintaining a diet for weight. Maintaining diet.

313
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,600
And they have the outcomes that they've measured of that distribution.

314
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:23,090
Bodyweight, fasting, glucose, hemoglobin C which is the long term measurement of glucose status.

315
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:36,620
Okay. And this is what they found again. This is one subject in this study where this is the subcutaneous fat area and the visceral fat area.

316
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,150
And you can see that their body weight actually goes up.

317
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:51,799
But the adipose tissue ratio within this region changes quite a bit more subcutaneous

318
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,200
adipose tissue here and less visceral adipose tissue associated with that.

319
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:08,330
Their fasting blood glucose goes down 184 to 117 and their hemoglobin A1 C improves as well.

320
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,580
So this allowed exposed tissue was a strong predictor of health risk that

321
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:22,110
might be overlooked with measuring waist circumference and waist compression.

322
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:31,000
So that's kind of the point is a pilot is has other effects that are problematic.

323
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,570
So you'll see very few people being treated with Pioglitazone who have type two diabetes.

324
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,720
More recently, some physicians have felt that that risk is being overblown.

325
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:50,950
And perhaps we'll see in the future more people who have Type two diabetes treated with this pioglitazone.

326
00:43:50,980 --> 00:44:03,790
However, there are new drugs coming out all the time and that type of drug that works best for individuals may vary quite substantially.

327
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:10,330
Yeah. And so it's visceral, adipose tissue. A better predictor of metabolic syndrome.

328
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,790
Yes. Okay. So how is how is this drug administered?

329
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,180
It's just taken by mouth. And I really say that again.

330
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,780
Every day. Yes. Yeah.

331
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:38,200
Jimmy, when it's visceral and then when you say intra abdominal, is that interchangeable?

332
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:45,990
Yes. Okay.

333
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:53,969
So most of the time you don't bother with weights or coffee, but your recommendation is, yes,

334
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:01,680
you record some of these BMI and you it's probably a good idea to do a waist circumference as well, but this is rarely done.

335
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:07,799
So how well do BMI categories predict metabolic health?

336
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,690
And that was a question of this particular study published in 20 2016.

337
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:18,180
So they examined cardiometabolic health based on standard BMI categories,

338
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,749
and they had a huge number of participants, a database that they use with the enhanced database.

339
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:32,940
And they looked at the period between 2005 and 2012, and they used standard metabolic parameters,

340
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,420
whether or not they were on antihypertensive medication,

341
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,050
lipid lowering medication or anti diabetic medication, in addition to the standard parameters.

342
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:50,190
And they also looked at in terms of their insulin sensitivity,

343
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:59,729
they looked at the high value and C-reactive protein in these groups of subjects and their

344
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:06,810
definition of metabolic health was having 0 to 1 components of the metabolic syndrome.

345
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:14,160
The parameters that we talked about earlier, this is what they found.

346
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:28,410
So this is going down the calling up BMI categories for underweight the standard definitions 18.5, 18.5, 24.9.

347
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,520
Overweight 25 to 29.9.

348
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:41,130
Class one. Obesity 30 to 34.9 and then 34.9 and over.

349
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:50,790
And using that criteria, having 0 to 1, none of our health components 0 to 1,

350
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,820
you would be treating metabolic health more than that would be a great risk.

351
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:06,540
And you can see that there's a linear relationship between healthy and unhealthy based on just the BMI value now.

352
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:19,380
So it's possible to be metabolically healthy at these higher BMI, but the percentage of people who are sick is low.

353
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:33,030
You can have a normal weight and your chances of are the percentage of people, I should say metabolic health compared to those are much greater.

354
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,510
And the same is true for people who are in the underweight category.

355
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:45,870
So there's some heterogeneity here in terms of who's metabolically healthy and who isn't just on BMI, but there is this linear relationship.

356
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,750
Okay. Yeah.

357
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:59,640
You know, the reason why there are like a percentage of healthy to unhealthy and underweight, like, a higher percentage of healthy compared to family.

358
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:11,130
So the the underweight classifications the number of people there and that people who are in that group you have a lot of heterogeneity.

359
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,930
You're not just talking about people who have smaller frame sizes who are very thin,

360
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:24,400
but you have people who are undergoing sarcopenia because they're old, right.

361
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,930
And their BMI declines. You have people who have cancer.

362
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:35,160
You have people who have wasting syndromes. So that could put them in the underweight category.

363
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:43,350
So that could be the reason why we're seeing almost a 25% having problems with their metabolic status.

364
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:54,300
So that that category with one if you're looking at the all cause mortality of the j-shaped curve would include people with emphysema.

365
00:48:54,310 --> 00:49:07,570
It would include people with cancer and so on. So there I would I would predict that that would take a healthy presentation with that explanation.

366
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,690
Oh, I see what you're saying. If you were to expect it to be higher than the normal weight in terms of metabolic health.

367
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,150
Okay. Well, in this this particular data analysis, it was not.

368
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:26,160
You might go back to the previous spring.

369
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:36,870
You'll love sport. Not that we're putting the mental ball in 0-1 components and I understand that.

370
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:48,210
Yes. So you had zero or just one metabolic one component of metabolic syndrome.

371
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,610
You were not in you were you were in a healthy group. The exceeded it was more than one.

372
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,130
You were in the unhealthy group. Okay. All right.

373
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:07,020
Here's another good. Oh, so they did think the people who are considering this.

374
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:13,970
So this is enhanced by this database. Now, I would have to go back and look to see.

375
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:22,980
No, I don't have that. I don't have that detail. But in general but in general, people who have very low BMI could have lots of other things going on.

376
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:32,049
Okay. Right. That's what I was just going to do is whether or not people have cancer, because that would be like BMI.

377
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,620
It's not. Right, right, right, right.

378
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,820
So in this study, I don't know. I don't know that detail, but that's a generalization.

379
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,279
Yeah, well, I was just going to pick was what Chris was saying, I think because this is like just metabolic health.

380
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,389
But I would I would assume people are under a category. There's, like you said, a lot of other things going on.

381
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,140
So like maybe metabolically speaking, we're seeing more, quote unquote, healthy people.

382
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:02,080
But I would doubt that overall that category would be considered healthier than normal in that group is relatively small.

383
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:09,400
In the US I think it's less than 2% of the population are in the 18.5 and below category in terms of the percent of people.

384
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,200
All right. Here's another example. So why are we still using the.

385
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:27,610
So this particular study looked at the relationship between steady state plasma glucose after an insulin and after an insulin infusion.

386
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:38,890
And so you're looking at on the Y axis, steady state plasma glucose concentrations and BMI or waist circumference in 330 people.

387
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,600
So they gave these people an insulin infusion.

388
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:53,230
And then they looked over a period of 30 minutes after that insulin infusion for steady state plasma glucose.

389
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,990
So as you go up looking at BMI now we go up to BMI, there's heterogeneity.

390
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:11,380
But in general with increasing BMI, there's an increase in steady state plasma glucose indicating some some insulin resistance.

391
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:22,380
There's heterogeneity here. You have this person who's down here, they've got lower steady state electric vehicles.

392
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:30,490
When you've got a person up here who's there, they have a low BMI, but their steady state plasma glucose is high.

393
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:36,830
And this this might relate to the function of their adipose tissue being very different.

394
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:47,810
So there is heterogeneity in terms of metabolic health, in terms of insulin sensitivity and based on BMI.

395
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:57,830
Now, if we look at just waist circumference here. Low and behold, we see a similar type of relationship in terms of the statistical analysis.

396
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,920
The R-value here are very, very similar.

397
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:11,570
So way circumference, circumference, you see an increase in steady state plasma glucose after insulin infusion.

398
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:25,309
Okay. So back here. So for this reason excuse me, for this reason, you'll stop.

399
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:31,670
You'll still see the MRI being just clinically to assess people's risk of metabolic health.

400
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:38,840
Okay. But when we're talking about metabolic syndrome, the criteria is waist circumference.

401
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:54,250
All right. So other people have looked at this relationship in regard to metabolically healthy obesity and metabolically unhealthy obesity,

402
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:05,800
and there's no standard for this. The point is, this slide in this graph is to say all of these studies that were done to assess this population,

403
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,970
they all have different ways of assessing metabolic health.

404
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:24,909
Some of you see her to one, some use less than 2% less than or equal to one zero less than to zero or above.

405
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:34,489
And so on. When you take a lot of these studies from people living in North America and Europe to estimate

406
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:39,770
the prevalence of metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy people with obesity.

407
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:50,480
And you look at the parameters of based on that number of metabolic syndrome criteria, assess assessment of insulin sensitivity.

408
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,180
You can produce a graph that looks like this. So.

409
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,610
People who have less than two metabolic components are down here.

410
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:08,670
People have more hurt up here. And then this is metabolically unhealthy with obesity.

411
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,740
And then down here, you have people who have metabolic health.

412
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:22,860
So they're healthy with obesity. And here's the percentage of people 50 to 24 would fit in this category.

413
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:33,780
If they have lower home air, they would fit in this category zero metabolic components or zero metabolic syndrome components and low R,

414
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:40,830
so they're more sensitive insulin. They would fit into this metabolically healthy population.

415
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:50,310
So if we were to combine all of this data and use this criteria, you come out with a value of about 24% of people,

416
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:57,390
even though they have a BMI of over 30, 24% of them might be very healthy.

417
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:03,380
Okay. It's going to change with time. It's going to change as you age.

418
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:08,240
And we'll get to why that is a little bit later in the semester.

419
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:19,250
Yes. You had a question about that. Yeah, I was wondering about like the classification of medical systems, like three or more of the criteria.

420
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,330
Yeah. Like the use of the class of 0 to 1 in the previous study.

421
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,060
Yeah. So everybody uses a different definition. So there's not a standard definition.

422
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:35,749
You're looking at a population of people and you're trying to say, are these people who have a BMI of 30 and over are metabolically healthy?

423
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:40,260
And these people who are been about be healthy, have certain parameters.

424
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,750
There's not a standard definition. And it adds to the confusion of how many people are.

425
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,980
Yeah, maybe percentage, 24% for the United States.

426
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,910
So this was North America and Europe.

427
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:11,320
Okay. So a fairly heterogeneous population in North America, maybe not so much of Europe.

428
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,890
All right. Now let's look at differences in men and women.

429
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:32,950
So you've seen this diagram before, this illustration before, where you have different patterns of adipose tissue distribution women.

430
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:41,139
You would refer to a woman who has a BMI of 30 and over who has more adipose tissue

431
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:48,010
deposited below the waist as having a gluteal femoral adipose tissue accumulation pattern.

432
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:58,530
Whereas in men above the waist, abdominal adipose tissue accumulation in the android patterns of obesity.

433
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,650
So this is more Android. Obesity is more common in men.

434
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,389
So you have an accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue,

435
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:18,100
visceral and subcutaneous fat that you read that we're talking about abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue.

436
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:24,430
So you're going to see increase in both visceral compartment and the subcutaneous compartment in Android.

437
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:35,640
People's Android. Obesity Patterns. And this is more closely associated to the metabolic syndrome and a greater risk of cardiovascular disease.

438
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,770
With the diagnosed pattern of adipose tissue distribution,

439
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:46,290
this is more common in women and you have this gluteal femoral accumulation

440
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,520
of subcutaneous adipose tissue below the waist and subcutaneous compartment.

441
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,780
So what about the percent of adipose tissue?

442
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:12,200
And then in women and looking at a official adipose tissue area as a as a dependent variable and then the percent body fat as a independent variable.

443
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:26,090
So for any percent body fat we're looking at here, men have more visceral, adipose tissue than women in any given body fat percentage.

444
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:34,370
Okay. So the solid field dots women and the open dots representing that.

445
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:50,130
Why is that? No, it's complicated, but it has something to do with how estrogen works.

446
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:56,370
So there are site specific regulation, adipose tissue by estrogen.

447
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,340
And in this particular diagram, you have two different scenarios.

448
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:08,720
We have perimenopause and post menopause, and it doesn't include testosterone here.

449
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,270
And I'll mention that a little bit later in terms of how that affects this recent pattern.

450
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:26,270
Here you have in premenopausal women, you have ovaries and they have aromatase converting cholesterol, estrogen.

451
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:33,589
And this effect circulating at the same level and under the influence of estrogen,

452
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:39,440
which binds to these African receptors in the subcutaneous compartment,

453
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,340
which have the expansion of adipose tissue through this mechanism of hyperplasia.

454
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,530
So you have increased lipid storage in this particular compartment,

455
01:00:51,980 --> 01:01:02,510
you have insulin sensitivity and you have a proliferation of these adipocyte progenitor cells for APC and the visceral compartment.

456
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:14,360
You have decreased hypertrophy, you have decreased lipid storage, an anti-inflammatory environment.

457
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,510
After menopause,

458
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:29,470
there is a great reduction in estrogen and there's still some estrogen coming from traumatic tissue because there's some aromatase there.

459
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:37,100
And under this influence, you have a change in the expansion of adipose tissue.

460
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:45,799
So with a postmenopausal woman, you've got to see more high purchasing.

461
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,330
Now, the subcutaneous adipose tissue, more hypoxia, tissue, hypochondriasis,

462
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:56,870
pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in the proliferation of these adipocyte progenitor cells.

463
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:03,919
And this break that you had here on this or a lot of positive, well, that's kind of change.

464
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:10,130
You're going to see some more visceral, adipose tissue accumulation.

465
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,160
You're going to have hypoxia, fibrosis and support systems, more of a pro-inflammatory strategy.

466
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,060
So here's a diagram that kind of summarizes what I just said.

467
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:30,800
It gives you a visual with high estrogen, low estrogen type of hypertrophy versus hyperplasia,

468
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:38,360
visceral adipose tissue depots or cell death or inflammation metabolically healthy and with hyperplasia,

469
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,480
subcutaneous adipocyte function is preserved insulin sensitivity.

470
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:52,900
Okay, what about circumstances where you have transgender men and transgender women?

471
01:02:52,910 --> 01:03:09,480
What? So for transgender men who are given testosterone or gender affirming therapy, we see what you might expect in men.

472
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:15,540
An increase in deposition of lipids within the this or at least tissue compartment

473
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,280
for transgender women tends to see an increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

474
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:37,750
So this suggests that the sex hormones strongly have an influence over this adipose tissue deposition patterns.

475
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:50,799
Yeah, you see similar trends like equal controls.

476
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:59,560
Or is that just to lower the dose? I don't remember that relationship.

477
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:13,650
But if you're taking estrogen and if you're taking so therefore it was determined that with postmenopausal women who are taking estrogen,

478
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:17,080
estrogen therapy, there was an increased risk of certain types of cancers.

479
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:24,460
I would predict that if you're taking any type of estrogen treatment, it's going to it's going to follow this same pattern.

480
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:31,060
But I don't know. In terms of birth control, how that birth control pills, how that affects this.

481
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:39,889
I don't know exactly. All right.

482
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,820
So here's here's some some bullet points for a summary of this.

483
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,620
So with estrogen and fat deposition,

484
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:57,919
so women have more estrogen receptors in the gluteal and within the lower body of adipose

485
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,550
tissue and nothing to clear from a subcutaneous adipose tissue compartment or g.

486
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:15,320
And this promotes a greater our storage of lipids within this compartment, and it reduces visceral, adipose tissue activity.

487
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:25,580
And after menopause, there's shifts and there's an increase in visceral, adipose tissue storage of lipids without androgens.

488
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:36,200
Well, this story, it's a little bit more complicated. So in men, you have more androgen receptors in the visceral fat, fat tissue compartment.

489
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:43,010
And these receptors are responding to testosterone, which declines with age.

490
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:49,370
And it starts about 20 to 30 years of age. And associated with this, we see increased.

491
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:56,570
This decline in testosterone, we see this increased visceral, adipose tissue decline.

492
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:03,829
And this you have more visceral, adipose tissue and a decline.

493
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:11,330
And this. Video federal subcutaneous adipose tissue age after the age of 15.

494
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:15,560
I'll explain why theories as to why that might happen.

495
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,780
So here are the key differences in adipose tissue distribution.

496
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,490
This has to do with a couple of things run out of tissue by women and men.

497
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:36,020
And you have also the effect of lipoprotein like this activity.

498
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:49,550
So lipoprotein lipid activity is going to liberate the lipids from that are attached to lipoproteins and microns in the blood.

499
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:58,010
And you see greater activity of this enzyme within the subcutaneous compartment in women.

500
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,990
And the estrogen receptor alpha regulates this activity.

501
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:10,760
So you have you can have direct fatty acid release and it's higher in women than in men.

502
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:20,540
And women also have higher levels of left and disconnected compared to men.

503
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:26,030
And then we know that adiponectin levels can promote the genesis.

504
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:36,390
So free fatty acid uptake after a meal is higher in the visceral, adipose tissue compartment invented in women.

505
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:44,030
And the LCL activity in the visceral, adipose tissue is greater in men than women.

506
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:53,000
And this is a kind of a diagram that summarizes this is a very simplified view of adipocyte metabolism.

507
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:59,240
So within an adipose tissue depot, you have a vascular supply.

508
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:14,240
So this area here would be a blood vessel, a capillary, and the triglycerides are attached to calling microns and lipoproteins.

509
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:20,509
And it's the lipoproteins that are lipoprotein lactase enzymes that are expressed

510
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:25,640
in these endothelial cells within the vasculature and they release fatty acids

511
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,469
and then you have fatty acids themselves that are circulating in the blood that

512
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,000
aren't attached to these that can get directly imported into the adipocytes.

513
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:48,230
And they are LPL fatty acid uptake and those fatty acids are incorporated into triglycerides and under the influence of insulin.

514
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:53,450
This occurs as promotes lipid storage within the site.

515
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,130
So if you're sensitive to insulin,

516
01:08:55,550 --> 01:09:03,620
you get storage of lipids in this compartment and this would represent a functional adipose tissue or in a different site.

517
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:13,999
You can have the breakdown now of triglycerides to liberate these fatty acids that can be taken up by nearby adipocytes.

518
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,050
Or we can get out into the blood and circulate.

519
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,840
It can be used as a form of energy. And that's done.

520
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:31,339
It's done under the action of adipose tissue and triglycerides like this or hormone sensitive pockets so the

521
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:39,020
catecholamines can activate hormone sensitive lactase and ATL can be activated by the hormone cortisol.

522
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:51,100
What is testosterone do well. Testosterone can inhibit LPL activity in men.

523
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:57,459
When you have higher levels of testosterone, you have a higher expression of these beta adrenergic receptors.

524
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,890
So this is kind of an arrow pointing from testosterone to beta adrenergic receptors.

525
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:10,280
It kind of increases. We should probably put another arrow here, increasing beta adrenergic receptor expression and get the signs.

526
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:17,860
Okay, so this is what's thought to occur under the influence of testosterone.

527
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:31,930
But again, the testosterone in terms of its effect on policies and and adipose tissue distribution are a little bit confusing and very complicated.

528
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,130
So. Okay. So that's a very simplified view.

529
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,440
What happens with exercise and calorie restriction.

530
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:59,680
How many of you have seen ads for specific exercises and drugs that you might be able to supplement sessions that can target the visceral,

531
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:06,110
adipose tissue compartment? Have you seen these ads in your news feed in your in your stomach?

532
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:15,910
You have your shaking hands. Is it possible to target particular areas with just taking a stimulant such.

533
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:26,530
Yeah. Personally, someone has a lot of stress. Then the cortisol and then the buildup up the tummies.

534
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:34,360
And then if I give him more of a buffer, minerals like zinc and calcium and magnesium,

535
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:39,570
he seems to handle stress better and then the tummy get more swollen.

536
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:45,909
So we're we're we're talking about now hormones are hormone speak secreted locally.

537
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:50,350
Are they being coming systemically? Systemically.

538
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,730
Right. All right.

539
01:11:51,790 --> 01:12:03,370
So so if you are restricting calories or you are exercising, this is going to be a hormonal effect that's going to affect systemic circulation.

540
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:12,850
What's in that systemic blood supply? And it turns out that the visceral, adipose tissue is very sensitive to exercise and calorie restriction.

541
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:21,180
And it's thought to you'll see in terms of if somebody undergoes caloric restriction

542
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,790
or a negative energy balance or has an increase in exercise or physical activity,

543
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:35,640
you'll start to see more of a reduction in visceral, adipose tissue faster than you'll see in subcutaneous administration.

544
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:43,169
So one of the things that I haven't mentioned thus far is that in terms of blood

545
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:52,770
supply and responsiveness to adrenergic activity from the catecholamines,

546
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:57,720
you have more sympathetic nerves within the visceral adipose tissue compartment.

547
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,120
And this is why you'll see a faster change in the visceral,

548
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,700
adipose tissue compartment than in the subcutaneous response exercise or around negative energy balance.

549
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:16,220
Yeah. And that that's referring to any exercise, not specifically targeting any any exercise.

550
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:21,540
Right. Okay. The mediators are being circulating in the blood.

551
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:30,400
Right. So this idea that you can target an area with a particular exercise having a direct effect in adipose tissue is far fetched.

552
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:39,600
No, it's not true. You can change the tone of muscle perhaps in an area and the size of muscle will look better.

553
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:43,440
But the adipose tissue itself is under the influence of circulating hormones.

554
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,710
So. As I said,

555
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:56,800
exercise is under the influence of adrenergic receptors and you seem to have a

556
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:03,070
greater sensitivity to this in that in their visceral compartment exercises can.

557
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:07,570
And in the short term, improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.

558
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:14,950
So I don't know how many of you have taken classes with Jeff Horowitz in his exercise physiology

559
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:23,200
so that it's an exercise you get this time dependent improvement in insulin sensitivity,

560
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:29,470
glucose uptake immediately after exercise, and that works the next day or two.

561
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:35,980
And then if you stop exercising for two or three days, you lose that affect insulin sensitivity with exercise.

562
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:46,669
So a calorie restriction. So if you if you have somebody who loses ten kilograms of their body weight and

563
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:53,840
you look at where the weight loss occurs in relation to adipose tissue adipose,

564
01:14:55,610 --> 01:15:01,190
you can see a 30% relative reduction in visceral adipose tissue,

565
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:11,910
not visceral adipose tissue accounts for a minority of the population or the amount of adipose tissue in your total body.

566
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:23,330
It's mostly subcutaneous. But because of this greater sensitivity to this adrenergic simple signals coming from exercise or a negative energy balance.

567
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:28,550
You're going to see a greater change relative greater change in the visceral.

568
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:42,680
Okay. If your life function improves, you have reduced proinflammatory production and improved insulin sensitivity.

569
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:48,100
Okay. All right. So what happens with these?

570
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:59,500
So as many let's just relates to men have a tendency to acquire more adipose tissue.

571
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:04,170
In other ways what age changes things?

572
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:19,020
Well, there's hunger individually and under the influence of noradrenaline, which is a catecholamines and increases cyclic amp in the site.

573
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,740
And this activates the common sense and light phase downstream that signal.

574
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:36,340
You also have some activation of other types of enzymes that liberate fatty acids from the triglycerides and they get out to the blood.

575
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:49,170
So you get an increase in lipolysis. And this will increase in as a as a as a response to starvation or exercise or cold exposure.

576
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:57,360
So you get greater release or activation of these pathways with the signal here being the catecholamine or adrenaline.

577
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:06,690
So in the aged individual, you see more adipose tissue accumulation here above the waist.

578
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:15,930
What's going on there? Well. As I mentioned, there's some information going on here.

579
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:24,150
There's a dip asides that are growing in the ptosis and necrosis.

580
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,310
And there are some age related factors here.

581
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:37,950
And the debris that's released from these dying cells are referred to as danger associated molecular patterns.

582
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,790
And this thing here, this is a macrophage.

583
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:54,000
And this macrophage now can't actually produce an enzyme here that can downregulate the or I should say catabolism can

584
01:17:54,060 --> 01:18:02,280
catabolism the enzyme that catabolism noradrenaline can be upregulated with in this environment in the individual.

585
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:14,970
As a consequence of that, there's less lipolysis and there's a reduced response to active energy balance, exercise and exposure to cold temperatures.

586
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:27,750
So the type of adipose tissue and the bottom also perform this role because this is.

587
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:36,990
So if you take a biopsy, either an animal or a human, and you look for the enzyme that breaks down your adrenaline,

588
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:43,620
you'll find that it's expression increases, especially in men who have higher adipose tissue in the visceral compartment.

589
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,450
Yes. And if you do the same thing in mice, you'll see the same type of relationship.

590
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:54,900
Yeah. You'll also explain about they have your breasts, so.

591
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:01,479
That has to do with a reduction in testosterone.

592
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,590
And I, I am not prepared to have that discussion right now exactly why that occurs.

593
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:15,740
All right. So cortisol.

594
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:25,500
What does cortisol do and how does it affect this location of adequate tissue?

595
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:30,330
I'll just mention this real briefly and we'll start here when we come back.

596
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:40,560
So people who have Cushing's syndrome can have an elevated level of cortisol that's being produced

597
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:49,510
and the signal starts actually in the pituitary gland where there's a greater production of it.

598
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:55,950
And this can happen as a consequence of having a tumor.
