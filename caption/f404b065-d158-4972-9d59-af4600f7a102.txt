1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:10,920
Start recording, so it just picks up your voice. Well, those slides will go into the Panopto, your mouse and the cursor.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,140
I called my folks at home. Okay.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,310
So these slides are out of sync.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,090
We'll go ahead and get started. Good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:34,240
Okay, good weekend. Just a reminder, the paper topics are due Wednesday.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,710
So if you're having any difficulty coming up with a good paper topic, a couple of people have emailed me already.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,260
I think there's a couple of people I still need to get back to in terms of like wanting suggestions or clarifications.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Totally fine to talk about that with you. Maybe just shoot me an email so we can try to set up a time.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,040
But I'd just like to get a sense of what everyone's planning to do so you can kind of flag any, you know, there might be a topic or,

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,680
you know, we take a look and say, yeah, you might want to narrow that down a little bit or, you know, just modify it a little bit.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,190
So it'd be nice for us to be able to just like look over what you're planning on doing.

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,680
So if you could try to get that to me by Wednesday, this Wednesday, that'd be great.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:23,800
That's, I think, all I had in terms of announcements. Does anyone have any questions or comments?

14
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,180
Problem. Issues regarding course mechanics or anything.

15
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,680
I think we're good, right? Okay. So today we have a guest lecturer, Dr. Kelly Mikulski.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,440
Dr. Mikulski is an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology at School of Public Health here at the University of Michigan.

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,010
And she is the data management and statistical coordinator for the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

18
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,070
She's a molecular epidemiologist and an environmental health scientist.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,189
So we've talked a little bit about things that are related to molecular epidemiology and how we can

20
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,620
use some of these molecules that we're talking about as like biomarkers of exposure or disease.

21
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,440
And we'll talk more about that later in the class as well.

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:16,180
Her research team goal is to understand the environmental, chemical and genetic etiologies of neurological disorders.

23
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:25,540
She has particular expertise in life course, heavy metals, exposure, testing with dementia and an analysis across multiple levels of the genome,

24
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,470
including the epigenome, which we also talked about and the transcriptome.

25
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,270
So all of the genes that are expressed in the body.

26
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,150
So that's what Transcriptomics is. And we've talked a little bit about that too in toxicology.

27
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,800
So cool stuff. I'll turn it over to Dr. Mikulski and please join me in welcoming her to class.

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,190
Hi there on. It's a delight to be here. I'm a graduate of the Environmental Health Sciences Program at the University of Michigan,

29
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,310
and this intro to toxicology class was, I would say, one of the key classes that put me on my path to where I am.

30
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,840
So I love taking this. This is one of my favorite topics to talk about neuro toxicology.

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,290
So we're gonna go over today some of the different molecular ways that chemicals in the environment can impact our brain.

32
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:24,220
Feel free to jump in at any time. Share your expertise if you work on any of these areas before any questions, comments.

33
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,139
Right. So in general, in terms of framing the field of neuro toxicology,

34
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:39,290
I see it as a sitting at the intersection between some of toxicology more broadly and our colleagues over in the med school,

35
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:47,359
in the neuroscience department. There are over 200 known neurotoxic industrial chemicals.

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,820
This is likely a vast underestimate, likely something you've talked about throughout your environmental health sciences.

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,590
Of course, this is that there's incomplete characterization of all of the chemicals out on the market.

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:07,429
There are some chemicals which we exploit for their neurotoxic properties, so we'll use purposeful use of some of these compounds like nicotine,

39
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,370
alcohol, caffeine and various pharmaceuticals with the deliberate intent to manipulate our nervous system.

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,590
Other times there's designed adverse targets.

41
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,150
Some things like chemical warfare, pesticides, which I believe you guys just spoke about.

42
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,590
So there's targets on the insects and the neurologic system.

43
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,540
And then there's this whole vast bucket of chemicals really where I focus a lot of my research teams group,

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:42,320
these things that are in the environment, we're not deliberately seeking out exposures to them, so they're inadvertent throughout our daily lives.

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,730
These include a lot of the heavy metals have strong impacts on our nervous system, pesticides and flame retardants.

46
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,620
But there are many, many others. So my goal today, we're going to go over the structure and function of the nervous system.

47
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:05,810
We have to know what's in our toolbox of this physiologic system of the body before we talk about how we perturb it with toxicants.

48
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,740
So we'll talk about what are the unique features of the nervous system which make it a the study of toxicology,

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,950
very kind of special in the nervous system.

50
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,850
We'll talk about general mechanisms of neuro toxicology and then we'll talk about a life course perspective.

51
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,530
So how this period might be might be particularly susceptible.

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,760
This last one was overambitious. I don't think that's right.

53
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,130
So structure, function, let's talk about our nervous system toolbox.

54
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:47,239
So generally our nervous system function, what we think about is this is a way for us to interpret the environment that our bodies

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,640
in and respond in a coordinated way so that all of our cells aren't acting independently.

56
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Our entire body is acting in a coordinated system.

57
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,260
So this is a way of taking an input of sensing, sensing, pain sensing, temperature sensing, stress responses,

58
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,749
processing that those sensory information and then producing an output function

59
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,710
so it potentially motor might be thought or expression in that kind of way.

60
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,349
And it works tightly coupled with the endocrine system.

61
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:25,850
So that can call it the neuroendocrine system. So there's complementary information being shared throughout these communication systems.

62
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,560
You may have seen so far. Biologists love to put everything in buckets.

63
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,010
So our first set of buckets for the nervous system are sweating about the central nervous system, which you can see here in purple.

64
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:45,030
That includes our brain and our spinal column. And then the peripheral nervous system, which is on the other side, kind of in teal.

65
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,650
This is pretty much everything with the exclusion of the central nervous system.

66
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,669
So all of those nerves that are stretching out to the rest of the periphery of

67
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,000
our body and connecting our brain and spinal column to the rest of our body.

68
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,960
We have over 60,000 miles of nervous system structure in our bodies.

69
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,010
This is incredible. It could wrap around the earth two times.

70
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,740
So we have quite the network of roadways passing information and messaging throughout our system.

71
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,930
All right, so we've got our central nervous system. I'll introduce a couple other buckets, but they won't be the major focus of my lecture today.

72
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,759
But just to let you know what we're working with within the peripheral nervous system, there's a couple other bands.

73
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:38,249
So our somatic nervous system, this includes our sensory arm for our afferent nervous system,

74
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,730
which is bringing input sensors in and our motor which is bringing all of our movement out.

75
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,580
So somatic, this is talking with our body. These these are voluntary muscular movements.

76
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,590
The other side, this is more autonomic. This is more, I think, of this almost like automatic.

77
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,640
This is happening in the background. I'm not consciously aware of a lot of these processes.

78
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:11,489
This this is broken down to our sympathetic nervous system, which is our fight or flight or freeze response,

79
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,899
which is going to direct all of our energy to our peripheral muscles in a way from our gut, our immune system,

80
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,750
our reproductive system are like kind of homeostatic processes, get resources away from them,

81
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:34,710
and our our resources go towards things that can help us escape or provide some kind of ability to stay alive.

82
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,910
And then when we want to have resources go towards our homeostatic functions, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over.

83
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,570
This is going to bring energy and resources towards things like our gut or our immune system,

84
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,950
towards our reproductive system, so that we can do more of a maintenance stay alive.

85
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,920
So so lots of little branches of this system, but they all do these fundamental roles.

86
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:09,340
And we need we need them in their own way. So those are the big system components.

87
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,480
The primary functional unit of all of these nervous systems is our neuron.

88
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,430
So these are the cells which are receiving and transmitting information.

89
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,970
And here where you see from your classroom doors textbook, here's a cartoon of the neuron.

90
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,550
So up here, this is the nucleus and this like cell body or Soma, the key part of the cell.

91
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,720
This is where all the proteins are made. All of the neurotransmitters are made here.

92
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,790
And you see around it almost like a halo. Are the dendrites this?

93
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,450
These are these little projections that are receiving stimuli or input.

94
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,620
All right. So this is where the information is coming in at the Dendrite.

95
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,760
And then we've got this big long tail. This is the axon.

96
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,910
And this is where that signal is going to be transmitted to the next cell.

97
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,490
So it's kind of like, oh, you got that message. Now we're going to pass it on to somebody else who's further downstream.

98
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,590
And so dendrites are receiving the stimuli. The cell body or the Soma is the.

99
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,670
This is where it's generating energy. It's generating proteins.

100
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,080
And then when we actually want to pass the message on, we send it down this long axon chain.

101
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,030
And we see that that signal only goes in one direction.

102
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,780
So our neurons are only going to we're not there's no backwards transmission, but that signal is going down stream.

103
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,150
And we see that the place where it's headed to is this tiny, tiny synapse.

104
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,899
It's a very small, empty space between this neuron and the dendrite.

105
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,650
So the maximum. So they're lined up like a ladder in sequence.

106
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,070
And there's a little bit of gap between them. And we'll see that they're chemical messengers that are sent between those gaps in that synapse.

107
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,910
So, for example, here's the flavor.

108
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:09,040
But for peripheral neurons, you can see that instead of sticking to another neuron, what's at the end of that gap is a muscle.

109
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,310
So the neuron can doesn't have to signal another neurotic and signal the muscle to do some activity.

110
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,570
Here's the afferent, the sensory ones. They have a little bit different shape.

111
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,870
So you can see that those dendrite projections extend out pretty far away from that cell body.

112
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:33,790
That's because we want to protect these cell bodies. If we have sensation in our skin, we don't want the cell body of the neuron up near our skin.

113
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:42,480
We want to embed that a little bit deeper so we protect it. We don't have too much capacity for regeneration of these neurons.

114
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:49,510
So these are the sensing ones are nestled a little bit below the tissue for by means of projects protection.

115
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,360
There's also this connection of how the way we sense throughout our body makes its way into the brain.

116
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,510
And these molecules are a little bit over simplified,

117
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,320
but it's showing how there are connections between these peripheral neurons all the way up to specific areas of the brain.

118
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,750
So we're sensing perceptions in our fingers and a certain part of the brain.

119
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,310
We're sensing perceptions in our mouth and a certain part of our brain.

120
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:31,020
So there's this regional geographic component here where those 60,000 miles of neurons in our body are not just twisted and tangled up.

121
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,630
There's highways that go through two coordinated places mapping across them.

122
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:45,450
Similarly, there's particular places in our brain that are in charge of controlling motor muscular movements in different places.

123
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,300
There's different proportions of brain space occupied by each of these different activities.

124
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,030
These neurons, they can't do it alone. They need a lot of support.

125
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:07,660
So glial cells are the term for support cells that surround the neuron and help in many different ways.

126
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,790
The Schwann cells are these specialized cells that wrap myelin around axons.

127
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,760
Well, we'll see specifically what that is, but they're going to help speed up the pace of neuron signaling.

128
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,110
Satellite cells surround the neuron cell bodies, and they pretty much give the neuron whatever they need.

129
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,050
Like you need more, you need some cleanup duty, some waste products removed will help you with that.

130
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,210
You need some more growth stimuli will help you with that.

131
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,459
And then in the central nervous system, we pretty much have all these same players.

132
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:48,880
They just get a slightly different name. So Oligodendrocytes are the ones that wrap myelin around the analog to Schwann cells.

133
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:59,140
We can also see that astrocytes are the analog to satellite cells that are going to surround the cell body support levels of metabolites.

134
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,010
They also have an added role in the brain, which we'll talk about.

135
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:13,540
They line the capillary and they're the enforcement officers who regulate what compounds from the blood make their way into the brain.

136
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:22,060
So the astrocytes are going to make this like complete layer around the capillaries and excluding factors from the bloodstream,

137
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,790
from getting in the brain. And the astrocytes play that role.

138
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,390
We also in the central nervous system have immune cell resident immune cells called microglia.

139
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,540
And likely you've talked about immune cells in other tissues.

140
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:46,930
So they play roles to phagocytosis compounds or infectious agents that need to that need to go old cells that need to go to play that space.

141
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,350
What do you think we see there's something missing. So there's an analogous cell type across both sides.

142
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,459
With respect to myelin wrapping, we see supporting the cell body.

143
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:05,980
There's an analogous one, but I don't see there's not a there's not a corresponding microglia immune cell function for the peripheral nerve cells.

144
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,820
Anybody have a hypothesis? Why that might be important.

145
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,910
We need immune cells in our periphery. We only made them in the brand.

146
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,120
Guess. Because the brain is kind of like a closed off section.

147
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,400
That whole can get there. Doesn't necessarily need those kind of own dedicated cells.

148
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,930
Yeah, exactly. So our brain that we're starting to see is separated off from the rest of our body with the blood brain barrier.

149
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,239
So it needs its own immune cells there. There's no other immune cells in the area but the rest of our body, we have the benefit.

150
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,030
There are resident immune cells and all of our other tissues. So there'll be immune cells in your liver, they'll be immune cells in your kidneys.

151
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,870
And though the peripheral nervous system is going through those areas and can be supported by the immune cells that are already present there.

152
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:02,330
Yeah, great. And so we still need immune function everywhere else.

153
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,120
They just don't need their own dedicated one because the tissues already have it.

154
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,390
And then there's another cell type called a Penniman cells that help make cerebrospinal fluid,

155
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,140
which I don't think will quite get into that as a topic today.

156
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,940
So one of those myelin I've mentioned, this is our material that wraps around the axons and helps our neurons signal faster.

157
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:36,570
I used to think that they were. Like kind of inert globs of fat, I guess was how I interpreted it when I was initially in school.

158
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:46,110
And it kind of blew my mind when I realized that these are actual living cells that wrap tons and tons of times around the sun.

159
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,240
And the way in which they have fat on them is because it's made up of the phospholipid bilayer membrane of the cell.

160
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:01,770
That's that's the fat component. So it's all of these kind of compressed layers of cell membranes wrapping over and over again.

161
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,470
So we've got this coiled appearance and this is actually supported by a living cell here.

162
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,360
And you can see this oligodendrocyte can provide myelin support to multiple axons at once.

163
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,150
So essentially we've got an accent going through here and we have a swan song,

164
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,110
a peripheral or an oligodendrocyte in the central that's wrapping around that axon.

165
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:34,110
It's as throughout neurodevelopment, that wrapping starts to get tighter and tighter and eventually will wrap many times.

166
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:45,739
So you end up with this kind of cross section of many, many layers here, and it gets compacted in this way.

167
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:52,040
And we have jumping spaces where there will be a section of my land and then a blank space and a section on my own.

168
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,950
We also see that there's groupings of these. So to help with organization and spatial factors.

169
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:13,079
A lot of our nerves are kind of bundled together both in the in the peripheral system there when when we bundle a bunch of neurons together.

170
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:21,270
This is called a nerve. And there's also sections of our brain where there's rapid transit of many axons crossing at the same place.

171
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,450
Do you think all of our neurons have myelination here?

172
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,620
Who wants to make a guess? You think this is a true or false statement? All neurons are myelinated.

173
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,470
Do all of our neurons have us? Yeah. Please. False. Yeah.

174
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,620
What do you think? What's your instinct there? Yeah.

175
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,050
The fact that I generally say false to anything that says all or nothing, just as a test taking schema.

176
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,260
But you have a guess there. What's your idea about it? Yeah. White matter or gray matter or the brain.

177
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,260
I just know that there's myelin and the white matter and gray matter doesn't him either.

178
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,290
Yeah, that's a great point. So in our brain, we have two major coloration that you can physically see with your naked eye.

179
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,009
An autopsy specimen. And the gray matter of your brain is the organization structure where all of the cell bodies are.

180
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,230
The Soma and the white matter is are the rapid transits where there's a lot of excellence there.

181
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,739
And those axons are myelinated. We can see see that myelin is visible.

182
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,280
It's white. There are not all neurons are myelinated because not all neurons need to go quickly.

183
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,830
So myelin helps our neurons trigger signals faster, in particular in our gut.

184
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:43,700
We have a lot of neurons going to our gut for the gut brain axis, but we don't need those neurons to be signaling immediately.

185
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,780
And it would be very bulky if all of our neurons had to be myelinated.

186
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,410
So there are actually a bunch of neurons in our bodies that are not myelinated.

187
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:56,640
Typically these ones that can get away with slower signals for more of a physical reason.

188
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,459
But usually in our brain, where we want signals to be going very rapidly,

189
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,860
we've got myelination there and we'll see upcoming that there are neurodegenerative

190
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:14,240
disorders associated with loss of myelination as well as chemical induced disorders.

191
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,260
If I have to do it. I know this is. A challenging topic.

192
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,250
This was one I had to learn and relearn every time this came up in a biology class.

193
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,960
But the way in which neurons signal and transmit information cell to cell is by changing the charge across the membrane.

194
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,430
So this is a cartoon I made of a neuron.

195
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:51,180
And when a neuron is at rest, it has done a lot of work to pump all of the positively charged electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium.

196
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,710
It's pumped them outside the cell.

197
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:00,090
So the inside of the cell is relatively negatively charged and the neuron has pumped all of the positively charged stuff out.

198
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,380
So this is when a neuron is at rest. It's just hanging out this way.

199
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,210
It's already invested a lot of energy to creating this situation.

200
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,650
So just at rest, these these neurons have have already done their work.

201
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,120
They're already prepared for the quiz the next day. And they are they are sitting there at the top of this, like energy, health.

202
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,980
When they get stimulated, when that previous upstream neuron signals them, or when it senses some issue,

203
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,790
then those gates that were previously closed can flood open and all of those electrolytes

204
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,620
flow down the concentration gradient and they charge their way into the cell.

205
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,880
So now the cell is getting relatively positively charged.

206
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:55,980
This takes no energy to come down. These things are going downhill and it's going to reach this kind of threshold place where we can't signal anymore.

207
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:06,330
We are maximally signaling. And then it's going to use energy again to pump all of those cations back out so that it's ready to signal the next time.

208
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:15,030
So the neuron is going through this wave of I'm negatively charged on the inside at rest.

209
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:21,599
When I get signals, all of those positive charges come downhill into the cell and then I'm going to do all

210
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,190
the work to pump them back out again later on so that I'm ready for the next signal.

211
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:36,180
The way in which this myelin helps is that this charge flipping can jump across those fatty layers.

212
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,060
So this change in charge doesn't have to happen across the entire length of the axon.

213
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,360
It'll just happen and it'll jump across these spaces.

214
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,899
So that's why having myelin helps those neurons signal faster, because it doesn't have to signal the whole way down.

215
00:22:51,900 --> 00:23:04,040
It can jump from spot to spot. These are changing of the charge across the cell membrane is an all or nothing event.

216
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:10,730
You can't, like, fire it around a little bit. It's going to it's either going to go all the way or it's not going to charge at all.

217
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,330
And it's only going to go in one direction like a cartoon fuze on a bomb.

218
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,669
So you can't change the direction and go back uphill and there's a recovery period.

219
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,590
So after the neuron fires, it needs time to build back up that charge differential.

220
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,310
So when that neuron is at rest, the membrane, everything is negatively charged like we saw.

221
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:40,219
The actual firing happens extremely fast because that's those electrolytes are flooding into the cell,

222
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,670
down their concentration gradient, and then it's going to take it some time to recover and go back to where it started out.

223
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:59,540
So the recovery takes longer than the initial firing. Down the length of the neuron.

224
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:07,680
We've got that charge flipping happening and when it finally makes it way to the end of the neuron and it's ready to talk to the next room,

225
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,329
well, it's going to pass that signal on.

226
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,040
It's going to tell the next heron to fire by the release of neurotransmitters.

227
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:26,300
So neurotransmitters are chemical messengers, typically tiny amino acids or proteins made upstream in the previous neuron,

228
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,710
and they're stored in these little vesicles. So they have a membrane bound vesicle pod.

229
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:41,930
They're full of these little protein bits. And when the impulse comes down, when that stimulus comes down, the neuron that charge slipping comes down.

230
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:51,320
That tells these vesicles that are just loaded with neurotransmitters to make their way to the cell membrane and release their contents right there.

231
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,780
So that change in action potential stimulates it to release the contents of that neurotransmitter.

232
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,120
You can see how close these are. Here's the dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron.

233
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,890
They're very, very close to each other. So these little neurotransmitters are not traveling a huge distance there.

234
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,270
They're right there. And that postsynaptic neuron is ready.

235
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,850
It's got one of these ion channels, it's got a receptor,

236
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,140
and these little neurotransmitters are going to make their way in there and button that receptor.

237
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,290
So when that neurotransmitter makes its way across the synapse, it binds the receptor.

238
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:36,680
That tells the downstream neuron to open the ion channels and let all of the positively charged sodium electrolytes to make their way in.

239
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,850
So that's how this chain of events continues to the next cell.

240
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:51,200
So this upstream cell releases a neurotransmitter which opens ion channels and helps those charges flop across the membrane on the next cell.

241
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:01,300
There. There's some key neurotransmitters that will come up with our environmental chemicals and a little bit.

242
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,300
Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, which tells the other the downstream neuron the signal.

243
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:13,420
There's also inhibitory neurotransmitters that tell the downstream neurons not to fire.

244
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,030
That includes GABA nerve transmitters. And there's other neurotransmitters out there that will we'll talk about.

245
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,340
We also have the cleanup. So you can't just leave all those neurotransmitters floating around in there.

246
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,500
Otherwise the neurons are going to continuously signal.

247
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,700
We want to make sure that we end this situation.

248
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,620
It's like an inflammation of that. You want to make sure you have a smooth wrap up when you're all done.

249
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,000
So neurotransmitters can either be taken back up by the presynaptic neuron.

250
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,440
This is nice, efficient recycling. That cell doesn't need to make these again.

251
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,150
It can just use the old ones it had.

252
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:57,560
They also can diffuse out of the cleft and then usually the astrocytes or some other cell in the area will clean them up.

253
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:07,850
Or there could be enzymes or right in the area that can degrade it or chop them up or otherwise metabolize that ram of space.

254
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,010
So here we've got some enzymes free floating in the area that are helping break it down.

255
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,790
So that's kind of the wrap up, the conclusion of a neuron firing.

256
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,630
I want to show you an example of how we can use pharmaceuticals to adjust this system.

257
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:36,870
So here we've got the axon of a nerve neuron and here is the postsynaptic neuron, and here are these synaptic vesicles full of neurotransmitters.

258
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,990
In this case, the neurotransmitter we're talking about is serotonin.

259
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:49,830
So normally serotonin, once this neuron gets signal to fire, these vesicles are and come to the cell membrane released serotonin.

260
00:27:50,040 --> 00:28:01,410
And then serotonin is going to bind the receptor on the bottom neuron and open open the gates for the changing of the charge of the cell membrane.

261
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,930
So this on the left hand side is the normal process.

262
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,920
We can use pharmaceuticals, for example, here, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI, as you might have heard of.

263
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:18,690
They block the recycling of serotonin. So serotonin can't make its way back into the upstream neuron to get recycled.

264
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,920
So you just end up with more serotonin hanging out in that synaptic cleft.

265
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,440
It's not getting cleared out of the way. So that neuron is continuing to fire more often.

266
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,730
There are other ones like the CONTI inhibitors that inhibit break down serotonin.

267
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:44,580
The Mayo inhibitors also work on this. So there's a third is there's multiple ways that we have scientists have developed pharmaceuticals to

268
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:52,350
intervene on this system and help encourage serotonin based neurons to continue firing more regularly.

269
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:06,030
Here's a couple other examples of psychiatric pharmaceuticals that work unrelated pathways with respect to neurotransmitters.

270
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,430
All right, let's pause here. So those are our major toolbox factors.

271
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,520
And as we start talking about chemicals more in more depth, we're going to connect back to the anatomy and physiology there.

272
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:39,099
But I want to pause. How are we doing? What are you curious about? I remember when I took this introduction to toxicology classes.

273
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,629
I've never taken an anatomy and physiology class, so I felt like at the same time I was trying to learn toxicology.

274
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,800
I was also trying to learn how the body it's. Yeah.

275
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,959
That's an exciting time to. All right.

276
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,230
Let's talk a little bit about what is unique about the brain and the nervous

277
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,430
system that we should be keeping in mind as we're talking about toxicology.

278
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,280
So we'll see a couple of ways that the nervous system is special.

279
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:13,270
So one way that the nervous system is special is it has this extra layer of protection through the blood brain barrier.

280
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,860
So in this way,

281
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:23,770
there's an extra barrier protection that's going to limit the availability of materials from the bloodstream to make its way into the brain.

282
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,640
Usually this is going to happen based on whether those chemicals in the bloodstream are lipid soluble

283
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:37,030
because lipophilic things will be able to make their way through the cell membrane of the astrocyte.

284
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,260
And usually based on size. So small things can also make their way through.

285
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,200
There's also an age related factor here. So our blood brain barrier is not fully established at birth.

286
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,200
It takes several years postnatal to get fully established.

287
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,900
So the age of your participants in your study might be related to how much protection they have of their brain.

288
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,810
So so this is a normal capillaries or vascular system throughout our body.

289
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:12,740
There's some space in eight years where the blood vessels excuse me, the blood cells and immune cells are flowing through here.

290
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,560
And we have an ethereal cell. This one cells the lining of all of our blood vessels.

291
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,900
So there's this one. So that's regulating what factors can go into the tissue.

292
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,100
This is normal capillary structure.

293
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:38,150
The special protection we have in the brain is we have these astrocytes that we still have the same endothelial cell lining the copilot.

294
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,410
But now additionally, we have these astrocytes and you can see they're tied up on each other.

295
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,330
They have tight junctions between them.

296
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:53,510
So these astrocytes support cells get to dictate what materials make their way out of the capillary into the brain.

297
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:01,009
And you can see here that lipid soluble factors are able to make their way through small substances,

298
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,860
make their way through, and there's some active transport.

299
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,880
So for larger or hydrophilic molecules, we have specialized transporters that help bring them across.

300
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:19,040
So sometimes environmental chemicals can hitch a ride on active transporters for compounds that are normally brought across here.

301
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:30,660
So we've got the tight junctions between astrocytes providing some protection, capillary endothelial cells that are providing some support here.

302
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,230
And we also have some fluid gradients that are that are working to protect this area.

303
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,420
We also have transporters for efflux. So these transporters can bring stuff into the brain.

304
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,969
They also can pump stuff out so we can pump waste products or bad things out of the brain,

305
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,690
pump them back into the cardiovascular system for want to get rid of them.

306
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,120
So here's an example from your book. Here might be a brain capillary endothelial cell.

307
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,570
Here's the blood stream. Here's the brain side you're going to see.

308
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,150
Here are some transporters that are bringing things into the brain.

309
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,470
There's also some transporters that are helping send things out of the brain and get rid of them.

310
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,870
There's also so this is a special protection factor.

311
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:37,150
There's also a special risk factor. So a lot of the tissues you've covered so far, the liver has excellent regenerative capacity.

312
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:45,130
Sort of a liver cell gets damaged. The nearby cells can replicate and we can rebuild that tissue.

313
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:52,600
Most neurons in our body are in after mitosis are in their fully differentiated state,

314
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,560
and most of them, at least in the central nervous system, can't do much cell division.

315
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,600
There's like active area of research here that there might be a little bit of it, but in general,

316
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,310
there's not a lot of cell division that's able to be happening with neurons in our brain.

317
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,690
There is a little bit more regeneration that can happen in the peripheral nervous system that can happen with the support cells.

318
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:23,980
But in general, this is a tissue in our body where we is a little bit more risky because if we get an injury,

319
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,810
we can't just regrow some of that tissue in a way that we can in some of our other tissues.

320
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,810
The brand also has another risky business because its metabolic demand is super high.

321
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:45,040
So some of our other tissues in our body are more flexible or fluid and what they can use it for their energy sources.

322
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,710
Some of our other tissues can use proteins for energy, can use lipids for energy.

323
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:57,970
But our brain thrives on glucose, wants to use glucose for all of its cellular metabolism.

324
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:07,130
So to do that, it needs a continuous supply of oxygen to do aerobic metabolism and means of continuous supply,

325
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:13,030
glucose to be doing all of that and generating all that ATP.

326
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,940
It needs all of that energy because the flipping of the charges across the cell membranes,

327
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,410
that requires a ton of energy, those pumps, to get the positively charged ions out.

328
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:28,720
Those are all pumps that require a lot of ATP, require a lot of cellular energy to take place.

329
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,750
So for our neurons to signal they need aerobic metabolism working, which means they need oxygen,

330
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,399
which means any glucose in our brain has a blood flow going to it of about 750 milliliters a minute.

331
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,650
That's approximately bottle of wine, of blood that's heading to your brain every minute.

332
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,200
And your brain only weighs about 2% of your body weight, but it is hungry.

333
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,800
It is grabbing 15% of our overall cardiac output and 20% of our oxygen consumption.

334
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:06,550
So it's it's really metabolically active. This might be piquing some of your ideas.

335
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:13,090
What what might you be worried about if you have a tissue like this that needs a lot of oxygen, that needs a lot of glucose.

336
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,720
Using your toxicology have what are you thinking about here?

337
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,690
Are there certain ways that a toxicant might uniquely disadvantage this system?

338
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,680
What are your thoughts? I think it's time I think of one of these specialized protections or specialized risks.

339
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,560
I want to think about what does this mean for toxicology?

340
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:44,440
Now, please, maybe something that impacts the lungs and the ability for oxygen to absorb into the blood.

341
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,290
Yes. You're seeing like connections across tissues here. So if we have an issue in the lungs,

342
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,870
we have an issue in the heart that might be first felt in the brain because interruptions

343
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:02,200
to oxygen are glucose might these cells might be experiencing cellular stress.

344
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:11,940
Some of the first ones in the body. Yeah and so be thinking about what are some toxicants that interrupt the metabolism interrupt oxygenation.

345
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,190
Some of the consequences. These are in general across all tissues of the body.

346
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,810
This is not specific to the brain, but we'll see how they impact the brain. So the term ischemia is when we have low blood flow to a tissue.

347
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,170
Hypoxia is a related term,

348
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:35,610
but that specifically when we have low oxygen and that causes our aerobic metabolism to stop and we'll see some of these consequences.

349
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,799
So where in specifically in the brain, when we have a robust metabolism stop,

350
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,740
we're making less ATP per unit of glucose and we've got low, low energy status in the cells.

351
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,540
That means those pumps, those electrolyte pumps are not running fast enough.

352
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,160
We get too much sodium inside the cell. We're not pumping it back out.

353
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:07,140
Those cells can actually swell up with water and lice themselves so we can get neurons exploding if they don't have enough oxygen fast enough,

354
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,590
we can see here. So like if you have a stroke event, for example, that blocks off blood flow,

355
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:22,710
we get this watershed zone where we get this all the cells which are normally supplied by those capillaries can have downstream consequences.

356
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,260
Anaerobic metabolism gets switched on.

357
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,820
That's going to make lactic acid, which has consequences in that low.

358
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,920
The acidic environment also damages other cell structures. So there's this whole cascade.

359
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,069
Also, we can get exciton toxicity.

360
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:49,710
When we get a severe, that means we get way too much release of glutamate, which opens all these calcium channels.

361
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,120
You may be familiar with the calcium cascades can can lead to a lot of apoptosis and cell death mechanism.

362
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,790
So pretty much a bad time situation. So we've seen ways that our brain has special protections.

363
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:11,210
We've got barriers that help keep infectious agents or other toxicants out of our brain.

364
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,580
But we also have these specialized risks because our brain tissues can't regenerate as well.

365
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:26,990
And their metabolic demands put them in a situation where they need a lot of oxygen and glucose at all times.

366
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,530
Some of these other special features they've got,

367
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,870
the myelin and the signaling systems are really lipid rich environment as opposed to some other tissues in our bodies.

368
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:43,730
They have this unique geometry with these really long tendrils, and they depend on axon transport.

369
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,360
So you have to be able to get, you know, goods that are made at the cell body and move them all the way down that really long axon.

370
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,579
So some of our axons could be three feet long and you have to be able to move neurotransmitters,

371
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,450
you have to be able to move ATP molecules down that distance.

372
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,720
So we'll see that some toxicants acts by interrupting those long processes there.

373
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:14,430
What else? Oh, we see that we need all these electrical signals, these changes of charge to happen.

374
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,390
So we'll see that toxicants, which interrupt charge signaling,

375
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:28,229
are going to have big impacts on the brain and we'll see that other toxicants that interrupts the receptor signaling,

376
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,000
they're going to have a big impact on the brain.

377
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:39,300
So because of these features that are normal parts of the brain, these are places where toxicants can interrupt or cause particular harm there.

378
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,309
So whenever I'm working with a new tissue,

379
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:50,130
I try to think about what are the structural and functional features there and kind of predict what are ways that chemicals could influence that.

380
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,219
In my epidemiology study, we have a few ways we can measure the nervous system.

381
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:06,830
So some of these we do examinations, clinical assessments, for example, we can have questionnaires or testing to assess people,

382
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:12,739
different domains of nervous system function, their motor abilities, sensory hearing, speech, vision.

383
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:20,570
I mean, some of these assessments likely everyone has as part of a US based public schooling requirements,

384
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:28,400
but we can do these in, in our epidemiologic research as well through several tools we can use.

385
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:36,560
We can also use brain neuro imaging. There's a number of types, including MRI's and CT scans where we can look at.

386
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,150
What's the size of all these regions? What's the ratio of gray versus white matter?

387
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:48,930
What's the metabolic use of the tissues? So we can actually measure how much glucose is being used at any given time by a certain brain region.

388
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,790
So these are some ways that we can monitor problems in these tissues in response to environmental chemicals.

389
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:05,040
We also can do electrical activity monitor so we can take advantage of the charge switch, switching with the action potentials of the neuron,

390
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:14,620
and we can put sensors on the body to measure changes in electrical currents throughout the body related to nervous system signaling.

391
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:22,970
So these are three of the ways, main ways that in my research, I measure outcomes in response to neurotoxins.

392
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,240
But you might be able to think of some other ways that might be useful for you as well.

393
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,009
Some of the other options for this are genetics out there,

394
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:42,079
some neurologic disorders that are more like direct genetic Mendelian disorders

395
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,730
like Huntington's disease or the expansion of a repeat region in the genome.

396
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,580
Sometimes in studies, we can monitor the contents of the cerebrospinal fluid,

397
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,440
and that can give us some indicators of disease risk or of environmental chemical outcomes.

398
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:05,690
This is relatively invasive or requires a painful procedure for your participants, so we do not do this often.

399
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:17,660
More frequently will measure circulating levels of substances that are thought to approximate conditions in the brain or in the cerebrospinal fluid.

400
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,290
So here I'm using an example of Alzheimer's disease from my own research.

401
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:35,240
So we'll see the. X-axis is time and the Y axis is how strange that biomarkers and here in green is when

402
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,980
somebody might actually present in the clinic with cognitive impairment or dementia.

403
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,720
So we could pick them up on a questionnaire screener.

404
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,590
So these are the these take the longest for symptoms to occur.

405
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,540
But before that, we could detect abnormalities with an MRI.

406
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,820
Even before that, we could detect abnormalities if we looked in the cerebrospinal fluid.

407
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:08,880
Before that, we could detect abnormalities with a pet imaging as a specific type of neuro imaging that is targeted for a compound in the brain.

408
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,330
And then here's another type of cerebrospinal fluid marker. So I try to stage together.

409
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:24,240
Looking in advance of when somebody has a disease to think of when is the environmental chemical actually of interest?

410
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,140
Because if these abnormalities are happening potentially years before the disorder,

411
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,470
probably the environmental chemical happened even years before that.

412
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:39,360
So what I'm trying to design on these studies, I'm thinking about the timing of everything and when are these abnormalities able to be discovered?

413
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,930
Just a little bit of the logistics of neural epidemiology.

414
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:54,990
Let's jump into mechanism of neurotoxins. Anybody have any comments, questions about what makes the brain uniquely susceptible?

415
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:15,480
We're uniquely protected. We're going to organize our flavors or types of neurotoxicity based on where in the neuron gets hurt.

416
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,460
So we'll walk through these four sites. So this is our healthy neuron.

417
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,030
This is when things are going well. We'll see.

418
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:30,910
Neuron apathy are neurotoxic events that impact the cell body, the soma.

419
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,120
This is going to end up killing the whole neuron. We'll see.

420
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,650
Absent apathy is a situation where the axon can get cleaved.

421
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,730
And so we see that that neuron is not able to signal to the next one.

422
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,470
The cell body starts to swell because it's not able to release things in the way it wants to.

423
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,880
We'll see. Myelin, apathy. This is when we get disorders in the integrity of the myelin sheath.

424
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,970
And then lastly, we'll see interrupted transmission. So what happens when we get problems at the synapse?

425
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,170
So really using geography of where in the neuron gets hurt.

426
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,900
First to talk about what classes of chemicals are involved in each of these types of impairments.

427
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,540
So non apathy. This was the first one where we have an issue.

428
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:26,729
Some damage is happening to the cell body, the solar. This is irreversible.

429
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:32,370
We've seen that the neurons have limited capacity for regeneration.

430
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:40,799
Usually if there is a severe injury to the cell body of the neuron, that's always going to undergo apoptosis if it has enough time.

431
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,030
Otherwise it's going to go undergo necrosis if it's really happening fast.

432
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:53,750
So that dying neuron is going to get engulfed by one of these micro glial cells to clean up the space.

433
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:05,780
Why is this tissue at risk for this? Well, because of the high metabolic rate, that cell, it might not be able to maintain the transporters,

434
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,770
that cellular swelling aspects we just talked about there.

435
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:17,960
If it doesn't have enough oxygen and glucose, there's this really long processes that need to be supported up here.

436
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:23,390
So so there's a lot of demands on this cell body to be able to maintain those changes and charge.

437
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:32,730
This is typically occurring in some of those conditions where there's low oxygen, low blood flow or low blood sugar hypoglycemia.

438
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,970
So some of the examples that caused us some of these toxicants, so exposure to carbon monoxide,

439
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:48,749
so gaseous exposure ends up resulting in insufficient oxygen making its way to the brain tissue, resulting in neuron loss.

440
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,340
And this way, cyanide exposure operates in part through this mechanism.

441
00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:03,589
AMPTP is a. Kind of classic neurotoxic camp that mimics Parkinson's Disease Syndrome symptoms and

442
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,420
results in neuron apathy in a specific region of the brain that causes motor dysfunction.

443
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,190
Try methyl ten. So some of these ten compounds work this way.

444
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,660
This is one of the ways methyl methylmercury works.

445
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:24,820
Apple. Mercury works this way. The polio virus can pass this way, and deficiencies of vitamin B six can work this way.

446
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:31,610
So a lot of different chemical compounds can actually result in dying of neurons.

447
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:41,830
And this is similar to the disease processes for emotions like lateral sclerosis or ALS, as well as another disorder called SMI.

448
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,250
Accent apathy. This is the second class of neurotoxins we'll talk about.

449
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,760
These are ones that interrupt the axon. So it's going to cause that cell to not be able to signal to the next one.

450
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,150
It's not making its way all the way down to the synapse where it wants to.

451
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,710
And we do have some regenerative capacity of our axons in the peripheral nervous system.

452
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,850
I actually personally had this happen. I had an injury to my wrist which cut off motor and sensory function of the back of my hand.

453
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,960
And slowly over the past like three years, I started to regain function.

454
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,090
So the peripheral axons were able to slowly regenerate in that case.

455
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,760
But we don't believe we have exon regeneration possible in the central nervous system.

456
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,030
And here are some exposure sites that are involved in this. So carbon disulfide works this way.

457
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,560
Some of the carbonates work this way. Acrylamide toxins,

458
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:52,580
a lot of these solvents you might be familiar with diabetic neuropathy where people have reduced sensation in their periphery like their feet.

459
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,320
In part, that's because there's some interruption in that axon that's happening.

460
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,740
You can see that there's a couple different type ways in which this can happen.

461
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:15,850
So here there's four different toxicants being shown and they each work slightly different way.

462
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:20,730
So some of these work by causing a tangle in the axon.

463
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:28,410
So things get really cluttered up and muddied up so that everything can't pass beyond that tangle.

464
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:37,020
Sometimes the there's interruption right up next to the cell body.

465
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:44,459
So there's differences in the positioning that happens here and whether the axon is actually gone or it's it might still be present.

466
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,640
It's just tangled and impaired, so nothing could get past it.

467
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:55,200
So there's within the class of axon apathy related chemicals, there's variability in how this can happen.

468
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:03,900
But what's common among them is that these neurons are no longer able to signal to the downstream cell of interest.

469
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:13,909
Mylan. Obviously, this is when we either lose Mylan or the layers get separated and this kind of slows

470
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:19,180
everything down so the signaling is not able to happen at the pace that we wanted before.

471
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,950
And some of those Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system can regenerate.

472
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:35,250
Again, more limited regeneration of the central nervous system. So some of these exposures that work in this way include lead exposure.

473
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:40,200
Diphtheria. Toxin works this way. Tribunal ten works this way.

474
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,770
There's additional chemicals that cause myelin apathy.

475
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,700
And this is believed to be most similar to a disorder called multiple sclerosis.

476
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,120
The last class we'll talk about is this Neurotransmission interruption.

477
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:00,310
So this is why we get an error at the synapse. So the rest of the neuron is functioning normally.

478
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,060
But we got a problem at the site of connection with the downstream neuron.

479
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,550
So this is how botulinum toxin works. This is how Black Widow spider venom.

480
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:17,650
You notice, like some of these biologic acting molecules come in here and what they're able to do, carbon insecticides work here.

481
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:23,340
They're actually able to block some of these receptors here so that the signaling is interrupted and not able to happen.

482
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,040
So hopefully there's some connection with what you learned previously about pesticides here.

483
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,950
And this is has overlap with an autoimmune disorder called myasthenia gravis.

484
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:41,790
And we see that this can happen at ion channels in various places throughout the throughout the neuron.

485
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,930
But in particular, we see these flexible synapse as well.

486
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:55,149
Some of these when you do this on purpose, like this is how anesthesia might work in some cases.

487
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:00,690
So you can see how there is kind of a push and pull some of these tensions of in some cases we want

488
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,020
these interruptions to occur or we're exploiting them for our clinical or recreational benefit.

489
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,850
And in other cases, this is adverse event that's unintended.

490
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,270
So those are some of the main mechanisms of neurotoxicity.

491
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:25,219
And I really tried to group them into which part of the neurons being damaged.

492
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:31,880
And what do you hypothesize the kind of phenotype or the outcome might be because of that?

493
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:36,350
Yeah. What kind of comments, questions do folks have very curious about.

494
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:46,810
Anybody have a neurotoxic and other most curious about it.

495
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:52,980
You want to study for paper later on in this class? I think someone's doing corporate boss, right?

496
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,810
Yeah, that one's like, right on the pulse. There is a lot of drama about whether Chlorpyrifos was going to be banned and then it wasn't.

497
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,030
No, I think it is. Yeah. Yeah. Last I checked, it was banned for food crops.

498
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,470
Okay. But we talked about that a good amount.

499
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,750
And I think you all recall the neurotransmitter, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

500
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,319
Okay. So, yeah. Okay. So you've seen neurotransmitters. Yeah.

501
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:31,209
So we've talked about that a little bit. Fantastic. Let's bring up one of these themes that I'm sure also extends throughout this class,

502
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,560
as well as the rest of your time in environmental health sciences, is that timing matters.

503
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:42,550
So the same level, the same dose of exposure at different points in our life can have vastly different effects.

504
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:50,260
And you'll see specifically how this impacts the nervous system, because our development of the nervous system is such a long and ongoing process.

505
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,550
So starting even from early embryonic development before we even really look like people, Mach one were just tubes.

506
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,520
This is what our embryonic nervous system looks like. So at day 21, we've got this tube.

507
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:14,430
Here's what's going to go on to become our head. And this this is going to become our brain and our spinal column just to be around.

508
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:20,280
And by 28 days of gestation, this tube should be fully closed.

509
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:26,700
So we want the seam closed. And this tube to be hollow in structure.

510
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,860
This is often occurring before most people even realize they're pregnant.

511
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,810
And here's another look of it. So that tube is kind of coiled here.

512
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:44,200
Here's a spinal column, and we expect this space in the tube to be able to be closed by this early, early time.

513
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:48,760
And so here's where portions of that tube will go on to be. The lower part of the brain.

514
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:56,950
The hindbrain, the midbrain and the forebrain are the large cortex area that we think of as the most Brady region when we're looking on autopsy.

515
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:06,140
Neural tube defects are one of these situations where that neural tube closure doesn't happen fully.

516
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:12,290
So some of that spinal tissue is outside of the tube.

517
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,980
So this is a condition. And again, this happens on day 28 of gestation, often before people know that time.

518
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:30,620
And what folks realized was that the vast majority of these incomplete closure of the neural tube was related to insufficient levels of folic acid.

519
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:37,360
So the CDC made an action to fortify our recommendation.

520
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:43,670
So everybody got 400 micrograms of folic acid every day, regardless of your plans for pregnancy.

521
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:49,580
Just because this happened so quickly and they want it to prevent neural tube defects.

522
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:56,800
So this happened throughout the nineties. This happened throughout my life as a young person.

523
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:02,060
Many countries throughout the world started mandatory food fortification with folic acid,

524
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:10,430
and they often put this in the flour and they were able to see that this decreased the incidence of neural tube defects by a higher amount.

525
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:14,239
So this was lofted as a public health victory.

526
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,800
And in this case. Yes. Yeah. I was going to ask if you have any thoughts on just why this isn't pointed more to as a public health victory?

527
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:25,069
Because I feel like the average person kind of doesn't hear about this.

528
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:28,310
We hear about some of the other things, like maybe curbing smoking.

529
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:33,710
But this one, I feel like we don't hear about it as much kind of in the broader conversation.

530
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:40,280
So we thought, Oh, yeah, yeah. The other one that I think of a lot really well, smoke.

531
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,549
Curbing smoking obviously has excellent consequences for infants.

532
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:54,260
Neurodevelopment are able to happen to their full capacity. Another another one I think about is iodine supplementation that has huge impacts on

533
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,570
neurodevelopment and of reducing lead in gasoline and that also helps neurodevelopment.

534
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:09,800
So a lot of these major public health victories have been aimed at helping kids have the best fullest neurodevelopment that they can possibly have.

535
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:16,010
I don't know a lot about like communication strategies that maybe because like this is prevalent,

536
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,780
but not everybody like knows somebody who might be affected.

537
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,920
But just based on these prevalence estimates, I'm not sure.

538
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,820
Chris, something that I have been wondering for several years, but I keep forgetting to look into it.

539
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:35,209
You know, with the rise of gluten free products, those aren't usually fortified with folic acid.

540
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:46,460
If there's been any recurrent trend in neural tube defects, just because it's kind of like a trendy diet.

541
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,840
Yeah. Especially for younger women not getting the folic acid.

542
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:59,820
Yeah, that's a great point. I hadn't considered that. Yeah. So some folks have an allergic type response to gluten.

543
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:10,620
Proteins in their gut typically describe a celiac disease and their dietary recommendations are to reduce their flour intake from wheat type products.

544
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:20,190
And what whether the there might be recommendation that they take a folic acid supplement or something to potentially counteract that.

545
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,800
Yeah, that's right. I hadn't thought about that.

546
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:29,760
There's a interesting ecological experiment happening as as well as that gluten free diet is becoming more prevalent.

547
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,480
Yeah, I'm curious about it too. Now things.

548
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,540
Maybe maybe folic acid fortification would be in other places.

549
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:48,130
There's also this is not happening worldwide. There's many places which have elected not to do this verification action.

550
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,210
So there's there could be a lot of interesting research done on that topic.

551
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:02,650
So that one, I kind of think of it as like super early in development day 27, day 28 when this closure is happening.

552
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:06,900
There is a ton of neurodevelopment yet to come in later.

553
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:16,980
Perinatal period. So by the third trimester of pregnancy, the fetus is developing 12,000 neurons per minute.

554
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:23,040
That is an incredible rate of cell division that's happening really, really rapidly.

555
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,010
And then in that early postnatal period,

556
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,480
those neurons are developing connections with other neurons at the rate of a thousand new synapses per second.

557
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:42,600
So we have this phase where neurons are being rapidly developed and then we have the connections that are branching out between neurons.

558
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,780
So here is this neuron and it's stretching out, making some of these connections.

559
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,990
There's also a migration period, so the neurons can actually move around in the brain before they land in their final place.

560
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:08,080
By age 20, we most typically have about 100 billion neurons, and each of those have somewhere between ten and 100,000 synaptic connections.

561
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,280
So really, a lot of cross cell communication is happening here.

562
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:21,100
We also undergo a period of synaptic pruning, so we don't maintain all of those connections between neurons.

563
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,770
It's kind of a user to lose that. If you don't.

564
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:31,210
If those neurons are firing to each other regularly, other cells are going to come in and prune off those synopses.

565
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:37,630
So here, for example, is is an axon with a limited number of synapses.

566
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,360
And here's an axon that you can see where there's been a failure of pruning and there's too many connections here.

567
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:50,680
This has been described in some folks who experience some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder,

568
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:57,729
where they have increased sensitivity to audio or touch based sensations.

569
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:02,889
And there's a hypothesis that it might be related to loss of synaptic pruning.

570
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:09,760
So lots of connections between neurons can increase your sensitivity to various stimuli.

571
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:15,640
So let's put this a little bit on a map so you can see how this all lines up.

572
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:21,170
So here on the x axis, we have timing from conception to here.

573
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:26,530
No relation. That's that closure of the tube with respect to the neural tube defects.

574
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:33,550
You can see the first phase is neurogenesis or the division and formation of neurons.

575
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,469
Then in kind of middle gestation is are on a migration.

576
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:42,680
This is where the neurons are moving to the right spot in the brain.

577
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,190
Then we have this interesting phase of apoptosis. So we remember that apoptosis is not always a bad thing.

578
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,889
That is actually a normal part of development.

579
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:59,420
So some of our cells, which are a bit divided, will well in practice under a controlled manner and get cleared out of there.

580
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:06,440
Here's our organ anchor at birth, and we're going to see how a lot of these extend into adolescence and early adulthood.

581
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,410
So after that we get a whole bunch of synaptic after Genesis. That's the building of connections between germ neurons.

582
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,460
Then we get the development of glial cells. So those come even later.

583
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,070
That's our oligodendrocytes, our astrocytes. Myelination follows.

584
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,770
After that, so does the coiling around the axons.

585
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:31,320
And then here are these experience dependent synaptic pruning events that happen all the way through adulthood.

586
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:42,030
And folks are like clinical psychologist. Folks have mapped this development of different cognitive and sensory experiences onto these plots.

587
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,780
So the development of your senses like vision, hearing and touch,

588
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:53,429
early talking and language skills and how they map onto these neurologic developmental processes in

589
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:58,620
our higher cognitive processes which are still developing into adolescence and early adulthood.

590
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:08,970
So thinking about how these solid tissue changes result in additional cognitive abilities going forward through development.

591
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,600
Now, what does this mean for environmental chemicals? Is this piquing anything in your interest?

592
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,940
Like, what do we think about the timing of this kind of event?

593
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:25,290
And would an environmental chemical that here have the same effect as one that might hit here?

594
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:28,350
Right, because we have different activities happening at different times.

595
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:37,940
So that means different activities could be interrupted. Right. So the impact of your exposure depends on those developmental type.

596
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,290
So for example, here's a similar plot, but has additional things on here,

597
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:48,530
like a cochlea or a hearing development happening here and making the point that some of our exposures.

598
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:57,100
We might be exposed to low amounts every day. Some of our exposures are kind of cumulative where they build up in our system.

599
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:03,170
Some exposures may come and then pass, but there's all of these kinds of different exposure patterns that can happen.

600
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:07,500
And overlaying them with the type of neurodevelopment we have going on there.

601
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:19,579
Here's a similar a map that was made with respect to their thinking about three different psychiatric disorders.

602
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:26,630
They're thinking about autism spectrum disorder and black schizophrenia and RAD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and blue.

603
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:33,890
And thinking about how different environmental epidemiology and toxicology studies have shown that exposure

604
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:39,830
to different chemicals on this Y axes might be related to risk or the outcomes based on the timing.

605
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:47,809
So thalidomide exposure, this kind of classic environmental chemical that has really widespread developmental

606
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:53,810
impacts have that happening around conception has impacts for one of these disorders,

607
01:05:54,050 --> 01:06:01,790
misoprostol has impact, exposure has impacts for another valproic acid has more of a band here.

608
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,880
It hasn't been completely pinpoint to a specific time window.

609
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:11,070
Some viral infections, some nutritional deficits.

610
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,879
And here's more of my classic environmental chemicals, like chlorpyrifos,

611
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,590
organophosphates, polychlorinated biphenyls and additional chemical exposure.

612
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:27,900
And the absence of one of these chemicals or coloration here doesn't necessarily mean the absence of evidence,

613
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,590
like a lot of these combinations haven't been tested thoroughly yet.

614
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:36,420
But just showing that across multiple types of neurologic disorders,

615
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:44,100
there are folks looking into whether exposure to these chemicals at various times might be maybe relevant.

616
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:54,020
Digging into one of those disorders in particular. So Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

617
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:01,430
Here's some of the hypotheses of how those chemicals might actually contribute to the symptoms.

618
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:05,210
So some of the compounds are related to oxidative stress.

619
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:17,300
A common mechanism explored in this class. Other of these chemicals are involved in the production of cytokine production for pro-inflammatory events.

620
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:24,980
Others are going to occur through disrupting thyroid hormone. This is the pathway that iodine supplementation acts through.

621
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:32,600
This is really essential for neurodevelopment. Others are going to work specifically on different neurologic pathways.

622
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,200
So there's it's hard to pull out.

623
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:42,530
I mean, one way that a lot of these chemicals are impacting the brain because a lot of them are working in multiple ways,

624
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,280
you're seeing PCBs heading up multiple pathways.

625
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:49,370
Similarly, lead is going to head up multiple pathways.

626
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:57,080
Some of these things are so nasty they can hurt the system in many ways and it's hard to tell which one comes first.

627
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,860
But we've got an overall impacted system.

628
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:16,970
Keeping in mind specifically with respect to neuro toxicology, when we're born, our blood brain barrier is incomplete.

629
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:29,160
Also those detoxification enzymes are not at full speed yet, so abiotic metabolizing enzymes are.

630
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:37,680
Our levels of them change throughout our life worse. We also have this rapid growth period migration and pruning.

631
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,580
Yeah, lots of ways in which this system can be impacted and kind of, I think as a summary statement there.

632
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:51,420
So I want to pause and think about time. Think about how's everybody doing?

633
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:55,740
What are you curious about with respect to developmental timing?

634
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:02,340
Do you see linkages to this principle of timing,

635
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:07,440
of exposure to health outcomes with respect to some of the other tissues you've examined in this class?

636
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:19,190
Can I be on how you think of another tissue where that might be the case? I guess that's kind of a kind of a separate question about it.

637
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,960
I mean, obviously, critical periods and more sensitive periods in brain development.

638
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:31,549
But I guess in terms of like neuroplasticity and like also regeneration, is that a, to put it all in younger brains?

639
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,990
Because, I mean, you know, we're 40 don't have a finite amount of like neurons for the most part.

640
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,500
But if you're younger, is there a chance for repair damage or.

641
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,320
Yeah. This concept of neuroplasticity is a really excellent topic to bring in here.

642
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:51,830
And I've been focusing on the early life period, but there is also some ability to change going forward.

643
01:09:52,070 --> 01:10:04,160
So there is. A concept of how we encode memories in our hippocampus and other brain regions which help us encode memories.

644
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:13,249
It's called long term potentiation. This is where we take memories, I guess experiences and encode them.

645
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,540
And there's some hypotheses that's based on epigenetics,

646
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:24,890
but other factors in the cell to help lock lock that experience in or lock that memory in there.

647
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:40,550
And some of these plasticity ideas are thinking about how we can continue to have these memories be encoded efficiently throughout the life course.

648
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:50,360
And how can we continue to have ways to grow and develop our synaptic connections in a nice way throughout our life?

649
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:57,490
Chrysler's an entire field of study like cognitive behavioral therapy, which is trying to.

650
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:08,550
Sometimes we get in a. Neurologic pathway that's efficiently moving through a system, a set of signals that are going through there,

651
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:17,519
and skilled clinicians are trying to help you develop another pathway that might be more helpful

652
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:24,450
for you by guiding you through it essentially repeatedly or in a clinic type environment.

653
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:35,430
So these are ways in which we can guide our continued memory and encoding processes and synaptic connection,

654
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:44,130
strengthening through our brand throughout our life course. And this can happen to great effect for psychologic health.

655
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,620
We also think about this often in my role through the Alzheimer's Center among older adults,

656
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:58,440
where we're trying to extend cognitive capacity potentially, like much later into life,

657
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:06,300
some of the major predictors epidemiologically we've seen of this synaptic plasticity

658
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:15,270
and a concept of cognitive reserve going into older ages is early life conditions.

659
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:28,080
So the level of education that people are able to obtain as a young person relates to how long you're able to stave off symptoms from dementia.

660
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,880
So people who have.

661
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:38,050
Higher levels of educational attainment in early life versus somebody who has lower levels of educational attainment in early life.

662
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:45,940
They both may develop dementia symptoms at the or they both may develop dementia syndrome at the same time.

663
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:50,290
But somebody with a higher cognitive reserve may be able to hold it off for longer,

664
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:56,949
and then they get a steeper decline versus somebody with lower educational attainment may develop impairment.

665
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,550
And it's a much slower, more gradual process that starts a little bit earlier.

666
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:07,570
So kind of differences in your disease trajectories and we find them connected all the way to early life,

667
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:12,300
which is of course a huge social justice issue, environmental justice issue.

668
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:19,300
Who has access to these levels of educational attainment? I'm sure the same is true with chemical exposures levels as well,

669
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:25,570
that many of them likely impact cognitive reserve and synaptic plasticity and older adults.

670
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:29,020
But those are harder to do.

671
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,000
Potentially 80 year studies in humans with respect to chemical exposures and from the premise is being built in

672
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:45,160
some of these larger studies talking about education policy and residential history and access there as well.

673
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:51,460
To other thoughts you'd like to share on this topic. This is a rich area and there's a couple of things.

674
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:57,100
Yeah, I was thinking like as you were talking like you can almost map out you have the early life stages,

675
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:05,110
you could almost map out later life exactly as to like I feel like we almost need to get the whole life course on some of these graphs.

676
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:12,900
Obviously there's some things that are supersensitive, you know, in the fetal stage, in the neo natal stage, etc. But then you're taught, you know,

677
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:20,910
these concepts of like the biological changes that happen in later life and you know, elderly people are exposed to chemicals like everyone else.

678
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:27,670
So maybe we need to understand that impact on various things related to neurological health or, you know, other health systems as well.

679
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:32,080
So yeah, it's another sensitive population maybe to think about.

680
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:40,700
Exactly. And there's kind of two halves of my lab, some that do neurodevelopment, and some of the students are upsetting our degeneration.

681
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:44,850
And I was initially worried that. They were going to be fully separate.

682
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:49,410
But we oftentimes see the same things happening in reverse in those populations, like what you're saying.

683
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,390
So a compound which impacts the blood brain barrier and fetal development.

684
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:58,530
Oh, guess what? It also impacts the blood brain barrier in older adults.

685
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,510
And so then the environmental chemicals are more likely to make their way into the brain tissue.

686
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:11,520
So there's. It's kind of a bookend and they're more connected in ways than I had initially thought when I was setting up my lab.

687
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,780
In terms of you see a lot of the same chemicals hitting neurodevelopmental

688
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:21,450
diseases and other degenerative diseases and it seems very obvious now to me,

689
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:27,060
I guess. But yeah, having a more unified view of neurologic health there.

690
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:33,600
And certainly if we're talking about certain chemicals like cadmium that accumulate and have these like super long half lives,

691
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:40,020
like decades long half lives in the body, you know, someone who's older may have accumulated more of that chemical.

692
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,980
So you maybe looking at like a different situation than someone who has been accumulating it for as long as there's a number of fronts.

693
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:56,400
And I feel like it's really interesting to think about the entire life course that sometimes we kind of give short shrift to one end of that, right?

694
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,599
Yeah. And we're doing this the thought exercise for the nervous system right now.

695
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:06,090
But you could be doing this for each of the tissues that you're curious about and going for it throughout the class.

696
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,720
These principles. In other comments, questions were focused curious about.

697
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:21,120
We make the case to folks not to study neurologic disorders. Let me know.

698
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:26,490
I love to talk talk with you all about this in more detail. There's one other thing I'd like to point out.

699
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,000
Could you go back a couple of slides to the one that showed all the different chemicals?

700
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,590
Like that. One, one, one forward. Yeah.

701
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,050
So you see the Opie's there. We talked about Opie's in the pesticide lecture, like chlorpyrifos,

702
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:49,120
which in terms of their pesticide activity are acting on by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and disrupting neurotransmission that water.

703
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,010
Right. So and that's the way people can be poisoned by chlorpyrifos, too.

704
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:59,680
And that's why we can give atropine to suppress that signaling, because you're getting overstimulation of those nerves.

705
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,020
But you see these other pathways, these other like sort of toxicity mechanisms that opiates can act on,

706
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:10,970
that can cause oxidative stress, that can cause pro inflammation in certain cases.

707
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:16,770
So not only do you have this very specific mechanism, is these sort of side mechanisms,

708
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,680
if you will, or other mechanisms that these chemicals can act through.

709
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:24,390
There's not that many chemicals out there that only act via one specific mechanism.

710
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:31,870
In terms of toxicology, it's mostly you're going to have to think about multiple different mechanisms and multiple things may be going on.

711
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:37,620
So I think that's a good illustration of that because we really talked about the specific the specificity of that mechanism there.

712
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,340
But you can see other ways that these chemicals could disrupt the body as well.

713
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:50,190
My colleague, an environmental epidemiologist, Duncan Pak, studies how lead impacts the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.

714
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:56,760
It turns out that's a major way your brain gets impacted by blood. So by blood hurting the cardiovascular system.

715
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:02,400
And then the brain could be secondary to that because the brain is the consumer of so much material from that.

716
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,530
So it's all connected and it's very exciting. And I would love to have you come work with us again.

717
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,979
Thank you for your attention and engagement today.

718
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:20,370
It was a delight to meet you. Thank you. Favorite topics, please.

719
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,210
