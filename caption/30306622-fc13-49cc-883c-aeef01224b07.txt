1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:08,430
But the kids are all pretty aware that some of the minority students are out,

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,850
even feared because the minimum is zero in the maximum like thousand 900.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,950
I don't know. Sometimes I feel very class.

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,770
So here are some things I can get out of have.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:55,290
My tactic, which I think is a pretty one, is that because I'm more fun?

6
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:09,090
I think the way I fly home tonight actually is a logical thing to do because I think it's actually called Instagram or my flight was like,

7
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,230
I forget what I would actually looked at of it.

8
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,960
So, you know, I used to know exactly like it was like 930 or nine or something.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,710
I think it seems like.

10
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:39,770
Yeah, he was because he has like the structured opportunity which he uses to.

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,330
Teach you.

12
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:26,299
You just. They weren't collecting on the normal perceptions.

13
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,730
I know many of us are contemplating reconnecting with family or going traveling in different ways,

14
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,609
and there is all of the risk perceptions that we may have or not hearing about the active travel and certainly

15
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:49,040
the Immaculate Conception that we may have or not have the heart in COVID risk and sharing with family members,

16
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,140
etc. of. It's.

17
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,020
I saw an article musical.

18
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:11,829
Very supportive. I have no complaints about the purported to have surveyed like epidemiologists and infectious disease people a year

19
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,120
ago about what they were planning to do over Thanksgiving and what they were willing to do or not willing to do.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,540
And then have re surveyed the same people this year and was documenting the shift in

21
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,320
attitudes in terms of what people were thinking they were comfortable doing or not doing.

22
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,250
Not making claims about what I think the right choice is, because obviously it is different for different people in different situations.

23
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:44,520
But it is worth reflecting if we were to do a hard analysis of what are the levels of likelihood of transmission,

24
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:53,270
the seriousness of transmission or occur, etc. And compared to a year ago for us today, how different would those be?

25
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,010
And my guess is the answer is not as different as our perceptions are.

26
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,950
Because at least in part, we're sick and tired of being in a pandemic.

27
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,410
And Alexis, just we have adjusted to.

28
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,500
A level of risk in different ways that we were not necessarily tolerant of a year ago, certainly weren't tolerant of two years ago.

29
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:32,610
Just worth reflecting on as we think about that. So I have only just started looking at the speech assignment, so I had nothing to say about them.

30
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,860
That's going to be my Thanksgiving.

31
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:44,440
I sit on the couch and try and digest kind of what we're sort of pointing where we're going for the rest of the semester.

32
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,430
It's really disturbing every year. Thanksgiving, we have exactly four more crosses after this one, and then we're done.

33
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:00,950
But how do we get. So today we're talking about risk perceptions and behavior.

34
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,880
Tuesday, we will talk about warnings and warning labels and the things that we label, the things that we don't label.

35
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:19,309
Thursday. We get back, we will talk about we will spend one day sort of exploring an interesting line of work that thinks about

36
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:28,220
race perceptions through the lens of culture and our interpersonal associations and our worldviews.

37
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,410
What are the risks that our worldviews align us to pay attention to and that risk that we don't have?

38
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,310
There are both strengths and weaknesses put out by. For Saturday the following week.

39
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,330
Talking about paternalism and the way in which all the professionals and public health is not involved.

40
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:59,050
This sometimes give people risk information in sort of like here, make your own decision and sometimes makes the decision for us.

41
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,310
And when do we do that and how comfortable are we when we do that, etc.?

42
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,760
And what do we do that on and what do we not do that are? And then the last day,

43
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,929
those sort of are open to bring everything related to COVID back on to the table and talk

44
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,090
about sort of the immersive experience of COVID in terms of our risk averse perception.

45
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:31,560
On the final assignment, which I will spend much more time talking about after we get back,

46
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:45,450
is a straightforward sort of analytical paper having to do with labels that we apply or do not apply to what used to be termed GMOs,

47
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:57,570
genetically modified organism food. And now, according to the newly implemented labeling regulations, are referred to as bioengineered foods.

48
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,620
This has been a discussion ongoing for the last decade or more as to what we should think or not think about risks in this space.

49
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,640
It's a nice case study of thinking about labels and warnings because we're all familiar with them.

50
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,800
And so what I'm going to ask you to do is to wrestle with not what has been done,

51
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,510
but what do you think should be done, i.e. applying the lessons of this course.

52
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,890
How should we think about policy or what should be labeled, what should not be labeled?

53
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,370
The implications of what people would do or not do in this kind of situation.

54
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,970
That's what the final exam. We'll talk more about it after we get back. Uh.

55
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,880
The focus today is. Readings are.

56
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,730
He wants to. So I'm going to try and walk us through some of the key pieces of this because.

57
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,730
I think these articles are really is two key ideas here and one of to you that they're not necessarily transparent.

58
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,600
And so they obviously I'm going to try and walk you through it and it's not always easy and it's not all.

59
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,409
And I will get even though I have a copy of the diagram from the first table and I'm going to

60
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,580
be walking through this and I sometimes screw it up when I do it because it's not transparent,

61
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,960
but it is, I think, a really important concept for us to walk through.

62
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:39,460
If what I'm saying, you're sort of going, I really get that applause me You're not the only one.

63
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,430
This is going to be a somewhat difficult sort of like I really want to make sure

64
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,400
each step where you're understanding why it is that I'm saying what I'm saying.

65
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,960
So please feel free to sort of pause me and make sure it makes sense anything before we move on.

66
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,040
Right. So the first thing I want to touch on is.

67
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,150
Again, that's the broader article about risk perceptions and relationships.

68
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,670
And I'm going to try to replicate this figure and then walk it through.

69
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,090
So right here we have my right.

70
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,420
And then over here, we have to.

71
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,020
And each time. You may have some degree of perceived risk.

72
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:56,190
And at each time you might have some. Detective behavior.

73
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,780
I've just sort of crossed this out because soon for the moment, at the beginning,

74
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,110
you're not actually doing much to protect yourself against this, whatever. It's.

75
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,470
So. She?

76
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Why would we believe that someone who at a time one.

77
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:35,270
Is say, facing a higher level of risk. Might face a high level of risk at time to.

78
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:53,150
Why might someone who is at higher risk at time one also be at higher risk of time to.

79
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,470
Are you saying are at the same level at higher risk or higher relative to the first?

80
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,520
Let's just even say the same level of capital. I mean, nothing has changed.

81
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,040
Yeah. So, I mean, this is this is not actually that complicated.

82
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:16,049
If you have external circumstances, your biology, your environment, your behavior, whatever puts you at a higher risk or let's say a lower risk,

83
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:23,190
whichever, and nothing changes during time, then your risk status will continue essentially of it.

84
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:32,780
This is not rocket science. This is why. We do things like measure somebody's risk factors any given point in time.

85
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,670
And if somebody has risk factors to date,

86
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,450
that's likely to be relevant for whether they're going to be facing those risk factors tomorrow or next week or next month or next year.

87
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:52,140
Okay. I want to start there because let's make sure that that's in our mind by all these external factors that predict our risk,

88
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,460
unless they're changing for other reasons, are likely going to continue.

89
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,690
And that allows us to sort people. People who face higher risks and people who face lower risks based on those external factors.

90
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:16,750
So now. That.

91
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:30,490
Why would you believe that someone who is at higher risk at time, one would be more likely to engage in protective behavior in the future.

92
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,230
The consequence and behavior change. Right.

93
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,040
This is what we're aiming for, right? We give you information about your risk.

94
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,450
You figure out, hey, I'm at risk. That motivates you to engage and protect your behavior to prevent that risk.

95
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,010
So this is the. And your.

96
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:10,640
Even motivation hypothesis. I understand my risk now that motivates me to engage in future behavior.

97
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:22,200
To protect myself against risk. If I'm low risk my health.

98
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't necessarily have that protective motivation because I understand that I'm at low risk,

99
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,970
but if I'm a pilot now, then I'm more motivated to do that. So that's why we get that positive correlation.

100
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,640
This is if we want to think about sort of like risk communication as behavior change, this is often what we're aiming for.

101
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,860
All right. Now.

102
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,430
I'm afraid, change the way this is in the diagram, because I think it's actually easier to explain this way.

103
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,280
What's the correlation between the history? At one point in time.

104
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,670
How are our risk perceptions correlated with our degree of engaging in protective behaviors?

105
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:28,920
We're not. So if we want to make this concrete, think about flu perceptions of flu risk and whether or not we have are engaging in vaccination.

106
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,220
If you perceive your risk to be low, you're probably less likely to go out of your way to engage in protective behaviors and that.

107
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,630
That's just one of them. That's the I'm going to engage in protective behaviors.

108
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,440
This is the. Have I engage with those protected behaviors already?

109
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,060
The idea here is this. I know whether or not I've been vaccinated.

110
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,820
If I know that I have been vaccinated, I should feel safer.

111
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,070
I know that I have not been vaccinated. I should feel more at risk.

112
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,250
My awareness of whether or not right now I have my seat belt buckle.

113
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,550
Right now I am vaccinated. Right now I am eating a low salt diet versus a high school diet, etc.

114
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,210
Is a. Interacts with my perception on my current risk.

115
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:41,160
I know that I'm smoking two packs a day. My perception of my current lung cancer risk is going to be higher because I know that

116
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:50,130
if I know that I'm driving a safe car and I'm well buckled up and I have airbags.

117
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,070
Then my perceptions of my likelihood of dying in a car accident is going to be lower because I know all of these behaviors are already occurring.

118
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,440
That's all the sex at any one point in time.

119
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,530
The sections of our risk now are related as a function of what behaviors we're engaging in.

120
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,180
Now that interest point and behavior motivation is relevant.

121
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,969
Like if I know that I am unprotected now and hence high risk is higher now.

122
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:32,150
I might be motivated to do stuff in the future if I know that I'm safe or feel low risk now, I'm probably not motivated to do stuff that's this line.

123
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:41,600
But this line is a negative relationship. Yeah, but not to be like, arbitrary, but that's if you you're talking about it in one time.

124
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,520
But that's not the case because you already have engaged in those behaviors you're speaking past or you will be at the present moment,

125
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,820
you can only be like. Doing. That's like that thought.

126
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,760
Like, it's it's like an oversimplification of the when we talk about time, it's always an oversimplification.

127
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,770
But there's an important distinction to be made, which is the question of.

128
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:15,540
My knowledge of what behaviors have already occurred will feed into my perceptions of risk.

129
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:22,980
My perceptions of risk may or may not feed into my future motivation to engage in other behaviors.

130
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,060
Now, some behaviors are literally at a point in time, do I take the seat belt and cross it across my body and buckle it?

131
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,050
At the moment I'm turning off my car. Some behaviors are more.

132
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,880
I am status in the sense of do I know what my vaccination status is?

133
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,780
Obviously time is you know, it's complicated when we talk about this.

134
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:52,540
But the reason I want to bring this up is when we look in the real world at data about risk perceptions and behavior.

135
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,639
We have to pay attention to this because if what we're looking at is a single point in time,

136
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:10,190
a survey like if I give you a set of questions now, how worried are you about spreading COVID 19 to your friends and family at Thanksgiving?

137
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:20,950
I think now the question and I. Ask you the question what do you intend to do in the future in order to prevent that spread?

138
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,750
That's this question. If I ask you, are you wearing a mask today?

139
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,040
Are you vaccinated today? That's this question. And.

140
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,879
The data we get. And so part of the reason that this paper exists is because there's been lots of debate about, well,

141
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,140
hey, does it help to give people risk information, to motivate them to engage in productive behaviors?

142
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,520
And of literature has been messy for decades because this people get this confused

143
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,300
because there's ambiguity in terms of the timetable of perception of risk.

144
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,680
Now, perceptions of risk in the future, behavior now, behavior in the past, behavior future, etc.

145
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,870
This is worth paying attention to as we think about this.

146
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:16,150
Obviously, from our standpoint within public health, when our motivation is persuasive, when our goal is to motivate protective behavior,

147
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,259
what we're trying to achieve is this one in which there's a very clear let's assess

148
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,000
you now so that we can motivate you to do things in the future to reduce that risk.

149
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,760
All of our stuff in chronic diseases fits this perfectly. Like, let's tell you about your risk of heart attack in the future.

150
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,780
So it's really. Yeah, but we don't have to have that. Let's motivate you to engage in protective behavior that will prevent that downstream.

151
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,250
But when we get into this and many of you shared stories about, well, you know, people who.

152
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:03,670
Say, I know that I'm at high risk and turn around and continue to engage in the behaviors that you know are associated with that high risk status.

153
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,640
That behavior motivation line seems to go like, what happened?

154
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,610
You're telling me, you know, you're at high risk and yet you are failing to engage in the behavior.

155
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,070
What's going on here? And this has been the challenge in this field.

156
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,830
And this is, by the way, I think I was just a note.

157
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:34,150
The lead author of this paper is the same person who was the lead author on the goals paper you read way back on the first week of class,

158
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,740
the one who said, If your goal is to change behavior, you people risk information may not be the best way to do it.

159
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:50,820
This is why. That's why I want us to engage in this, is to recognize risk.

160
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:58,830
Education depends upon that behavior, motivation, hypothesis, working, and it's not always going to work that way.

161
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,900
Now there's one other key thing that we need to talk about here.

162
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,990
Which is. This law.

163
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:21,280
If in the future you engage in unprotected behavior, you get vaccinated.

164
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,410
What does that do to your risk perceptions at that point in time?

165
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,790
And in fact. I know we talked about this.

166
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,410
Kevin was talking about this. You get back to him.

167
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:52,330
You feel more relieved? Do you feel safer? If you do this, what happens then to your behavior?

168
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,530
So this is why I wanted to introduce this in the context of COVID.

169
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,410
As we become. It's not just a question of acclimation, but as we will speak for myself.

170
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,260
I have been vaccinated five times per colon.

171
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,030
Because I'm over 50. So I got a double booster and the new boosters came in and so I got back to work.

172
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:26,880
I am so aware. Of this tendency within me to say, well, I must be safer now, and therefore I don't need to be as careful.

173
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,140
And I'm not sure what to think about that, because on the one hand,

174
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:42,690
I do believe that the vaccination status confers me some degree of protection against severe disease.

175
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,130
On the other hand, I don't want to stop doing things that I should be doing to prevent spread.

176
00:22:51,060 --> 00:23:01,110
And I am less motivated to do that than I once was. And that's this last era recalls.

177
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:22,010
We have plans to stop. Chocolate reappraisal hypothesis, the idea being simply.

178
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,840
When you engage in a protective behavior, you change your diet.

179
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,610
You start exercising. You. Uh.

180
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh. Uh, I say her car.

181
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,720
Your perception of your own risk changes. That's not inaccurate.

182
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,160
You are, in fact, safer because you have engaged in that behavior.

183
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:03,790
So. The question then becomes, well, how does that then feed back into a loop in terms of behavior motivation?

184
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:13,420
My favorite silly but not quite trivial example of this is as we are heading into winter,

185
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,419
is the people who buy the very large and safe car and then go barreling down the

186
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,170
highway at 70 miles an hour in the middle of a snowstorm because they ran a safe car.

187
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,730
So obviously they can't be hurt. Which is they risk reappraisal.

188
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,570
They are aware that they have this safe car.

189
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,880
They are aware that this car is likely protected. And as a result, they engage in behavior.

190
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,890
That puts them at greater risk. And.

191
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,980
Just so that we understand where some of this comes from.

192
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,439
One of the more salient discussions of the risk I think we're going to call this,

193
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,550
but one of the more salient discussions of essentially a risk reappraisal hypothesis of health.

194
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:14,340
You know how to get through the HPV vaccination. I was this was if you vaccinate someone against HPV and that gives them a perception of lower risk.

195
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:22,510
Does that reappraise their perspective, leading them to engage in riskier sexual activity?

196
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,630
Now. To my knowledge, this is not my area of expertise.

197
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:34,990
That particular line has never been proven and there are lots of arguments why it wouldn't necessarily hold.

198
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,500
But it came from this kind of logic saying that, well, wait a second.

199
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,370
If we engage in a protective behavior, how will that change the perception of the individual involved?

200
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:02,420
So some examples to think through photos of your bike accident.

201
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:15,899
I got hit by a car when I was crossing the street on my bike, thankfully bruised and banged up a little bit, but I would say reasonably so.

202
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:25,490
Got a little bit scared when going across streets and started doing the assumption of okay until someone completely stops at the stop sign,

203
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:32,610
don't actually think they're going to, even if they're technically supposed to because of laws or something like that.

204
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,630
And it that worked when I was walking to.

205
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:52,800
Got a lot more cautious in general and then I subsequently did a brisk reappraisal and went, okay, I am taking extra protective behaviors.

206
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,830
So I'm at the same risk that I was beforehand.

207
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:04,020
Even if relatively speaking, it's a good argue, it's a lower risk since I'm being more cautious than originally.

208
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:11,650
But it doesn't seem like it's lower risk because I know that there is a possibility for something significant.

209
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,260
It doesn't seem like it's lower risk now. There's two things I want to highlight here.

210
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,290
One is, as you accurately described, you're going through a risk reappraisal hypothesis.

211
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:27,030
You're aware of your behavior change and you are reappraising your perception of your future risk based upon.

212
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,750
The other thing is I want to draw the distinction between you had a specific incident occur.

213
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,950
So if we go back to the beginning of this class, you had experiential learning this.

214
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,130
I had this happen. This has elevated my personal perceptions of risk through that experience.

215
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:52,810
That's somewhat different than saying I have found out I have a characteristic that puts me at higher risk of being.

216
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,720
In search of an accent. Like it's not like you said.

217
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:05,149
Oh, I am absolutely silly here. You know, I wear really hard to see clothes all the time.

218
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,470
And so I'm at higher than average risk of having cars bump into me when I'm on my bike.

219
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,480
And that's a risk factor kind of thing. That's a future factor that applies now and in the future.

220
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,090
But you had was a specific incident that raised your personal experience and the perception of that.

221
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,380
But either way, you're going through that kind of risk reappraisal process.

222
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,240
And then now the question becomes having reappraised your risk.

223
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:36,160
What are the implications of that? The answer may be nothing.

224
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,280
You just maintain that because you still perceive there to be a risk.

225
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:46,780
But we could imagine circumstances under which someone would say, Well, okay,

226
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,610
I'm engaging in all of these protective behaviors, and therefore I don't need to engage in other ones.

227
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:04,810
I'm looking both ways, so I'm not going to worry so much about what to wear.

228
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:12,370
Again, I'm being silly here, but to illustrate the idea that our risk perceptions come from many different behaviors and when we zoom in on some.

229
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:21,830
That can change our perception of risk, which then we could modify in other ways depending upon what the other behaviors are.

230
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,670
So, you know, again, the sort of silly example of this is of.

231
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,390
My wife sometimes talks about, you know. Shop.

232
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,740
One of everything in the Diet Coke vs the Diet Coke somehow offsets the slice of pie.

233
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:46,330
And there's. It's silly, but it's not in the sense that there is a mental accounting going on.

234
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,520
It is saying, well, if I engage in this virtuous thing that is protecting me, then that gives me space.

235
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,450
I mean, these days, our diets are essentially this.

236
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:03,290
I think there's this there's a complicated relationship here between our perceptions of our current behavior and our perceptions of our risk.

237
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,240
That's why this theoretical paper is worth wrestling.

238
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:17,530
To remind us that it's not just the behavioral motivation. Yes, it can be that a risk perception of this time motivates, motivate future behavior.

239
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:24,970
But that's not the end of the story. We have that potential for risk reappraisal and that looping process to go forward.

240
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,320
And the real question is, where does it stop? Like what?

241
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,500
What motivates us to either maintain that protective behavior?

242
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:44,719
Leaving us more permanently at a lower risk state. Versus almost sort of go on a seesaw where you engage in more productive behavior,

243
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,420
then you engage in other risky things and then you do things about that and that, etc.

244
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,220
Yeah, whole that's just come down to values. Like at a certain point.

245
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,100
In some sense, but say more. Well, so like with the example.

246
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:09,329
Yeah. Like I know it's like I know so many vaccines and so many boosters.

247
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:16,050
I'm part of a COVID study and know my antibody count and know I'm not spreading the word mask, doing like all these other things.

248
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,540
And a certain point, it's not really because I'm afraid of like spreading COVID anymore.

249
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,340
It's kind of a values thing.

250
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:37,920
So this is a nice transition because the other article I asked you to read, which comes from Valerie Arena and her colleagues, this idea of just.

251
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,520
I know Valerie quite well. Ali is a wonderful person, has been talking about just risk perceptions for 25 years.

252
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,870
To this day, I still can't quite tell you what defines just.

253
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:04,750
I personally think there is something very right about her perspective and yet uncomfortably vague about her perspective.

254
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,440
Where I think you're going is this idea that there is some form of meaning that we take about.

255
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,320
What is acceptable and what is not acceptable from a standpoint of risk.

256
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:28,299
You're calling it values. I think that's to some degree, right when we connect it to a larger values,

257
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:39,130
that whole Valorie would say a lot of it is driven by sort of the way in which the takeaway message of the situation is framed,

258
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:47,200
that it's in a context in which sort of the larger message is.

259
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,530
I guess I'm going to be overly simplifying and almost stereotyping in my way in which I describe that.

260
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,620
Just to clarify the distinction.

261
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:09,390
One gist is. How it's just sort of turned into a bad flu and August going to have to live with it.

262
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:20,790
That's not saying there's no risk, but that just becomes one of we live with other stuff, so we're going to live with this.

263
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,690
That's that just leads you to not worrying about wearing a mask and going to restaurants.

264
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,770
That just leads you to doing all the behaviors that you used to do.

265
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,040
Chu is not saying that it's impossible, but not for being.

266
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,360
Not perceiving a need to change one's behavior. An alternative just might be.

267
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:59,840
There are. Even though we're tired of this, this is still a significant risk to many people.

268
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,400
And so I still need to engage productively in. What is the top probability statement to possibly state?

269
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:18,450
And much of the language that Ballerina and her collaborators use when they talk about risk is in possibility terms rather than probability.

270
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:28,170
But she talks in her article that you can get pregnant from one separate sexual encounter or you can get sexually transmitted infections.

271
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,010
That's not how likely that possibility.

272
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,330
And that translates fairly quickly to values, like because you can't.

273
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,550
Therefore, it is not a good thing to engage in unprotected sex.

274
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,710
So we go from sort of a behavior into a value statement.

275
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,360
But this has rolled in with questions of those descriptive and injunctive norms.

276
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,050
What are the norms in our community? What is a norm in our society?

277
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,400
What we think is acceptable or acceptable risk to begin to be handling?

278
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,860
Which is why, again, foreshadow leading us towards the day we're talking about paternalism,

279
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:22,370
because there's a real morals and values, but morals that are brought into why we we frame certain risks the way we do.

280
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:35,890
Just to foreshadow that particular day. One of the most salient domains in which paternalism really needs to be talked about is alcohol, dependance.

281
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,860
And you'll read a couple of different things on that one.

282
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:58,440
So what the Bills paper talks about is, look, in the real world, we observe both of the following things occur.

283
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:09,180
We see people with high risk perceptions. We killed people to avoid that risk and engage in protective behavior.

284
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,770
We also see people. Engaging in high risk behaviors.

285
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,420
And seeming to have that get reinforced in the sense that they engage with those high risk behaviors and they continue to engage with them.

286
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,020
And maybe then over time, they even engage in riskier behaviors over time.

287
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:37,100
How can these two things exist simultaneously? So we've talked essentially about the first one.

288
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,210
That's that part of the motivation. The second one is this.

289
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,350
It goes back to the experiential learning we talked about at the beginning of this class.

290
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,840
At this class, with this course, I'll use the example of driving.

291
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,500
You're a team driver. You just learned how to drive. You're late.

292
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,930
So you speed. Nothing happens.

293
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:10,520
You don't get a ticket. You don't crash. You breathe a sigh of relief.

294
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,170
The next time you're late. Do it again. And nothing happens.

295
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,330
The next time you go. Well, maybe I should go even faster because I'm really late.

296
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,910
And the next time you go, you know what? Obviously, I'm a really good driver because I can manage these speeds and I haven't crashed.

297
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,710
And next time you go, well, I know it's raining, but, you know, I know this road really well and I can see where this is going.

298
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,040
You are aware that you are engaging in risky behavior, but because risk is not outcome.

299
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:49,510
Risk is a tangible knowledge that something might occur, but it has not yet occurred.

300
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,060
When it doesn't occur, you learn experientially that.

301
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,309
If that happened. So maybe it wasn't as risky as you thought it was.

302
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,320
Maybe you're a better driver than you thought you were.

303
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:12,130
Maybe you have more skill than you thought you had, and that makes you feel safer and more willing to engage in those behaviors.

304
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,560
Which, by the way, is the risk reappraisal hypothesis.

305
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:27,770
He was engaged in the behavior. You're not phrasing what level of risk you have based upon the outcome of your observance.

306
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:39,000
All of these things happen. But they're paper really wrestle with what I want to spend much of the rest of the day talking about.

307
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,030
Well, okay, so when does one happen and when does the other end?

308
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,610
This is not a question of risk. Will risk perceptive always lead you to be protective?

309
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,600
Clearly that's not the case. But sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.

310
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:00,640
So. Couple of you have started talking about cumulative behavior.

311
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,760
So any you brought that up? I can't remember the specific context.

312
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,930
You brought it up. I remember you were talking about like doing things over and over again.

313
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,640
Yeah, I think I was talking about, like, smoking and vaping and like young people.

314
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:21,040
I know at this point it's mostly vaping, but like, will I can I totally articulate that risk and feel that risk when they are talking about it?

315
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,029
But overall, I think it's like a combination of overall they feel healthy now.

316
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:33,759
So the risk of like having a health problem feels low and then also the risk of like being sick when they're old feels inevitable.

317
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,079
So like that impact,

318
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:42,729
that interaction of like I'm taking a risk of a specific illness or something doesn't feel very impactful even though they could, you know,

319
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,309
I was reading the study like I think if they were in the study,

320
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,770
they could totally articulate and answer questions in a way that would say they perceive a high risk.

321
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:58,890
Yeah, but they don't respond to it. So. I remember you were also talking about similar kind of stuff, but the exact details.

322
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,160
High risk builds up over time. Yeah. Yeah, it was, um.

323
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,090
I mean, like, my thinking was sparked by, like, a lot of that, um, like, obviously,

324
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:15,660
if you repeat, you need to be like, the risk of AIDS or STDs always increases.

325
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,590
Um, I think I talk about it in terms of addiction.

326
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:26,040
Um, like, obviously the same principle applies to like you might not like the risk of addiction.

327
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:36,150
The first time you drink might be relatively low, but if you repeatedly drink especially heavy amounts over time, increased likelihood of being.

328
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,450
So there's a couple of different things I want to pull out here. One, even without addiction.

329
00:40:45,710 --> 00:41:00,930
We want to talk about if any transmission. There is a distinction between a moment, one sexual encounter and a pattern of behavior.

330
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:17,640
What is the let me ask this question. What is the likelihood of HIV transmission from HIV positive or negative partner in unprotected penetrative sex?

331
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,560
Let's say heterosexual for the moment, just to be concrete. Anybody have an estimate?

332
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:29,770
I put a probability on that one time. We are.

333
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:40,310
Okay. Anybody else have an estimate? I haven't looked this up in a long time.

334
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,390
Last time I looked up on it. The number I got.

335
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,150
It's about. Point 5%.

336
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:59,560
Less than 1%. But you don't engage in one sexual encounter.

337
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,860
He gave many behaviors.

338
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:12,410
And over a year of sexual encounters, especially with multiple partners that risk accumulate effects.

339
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,500
So it's not that there isn't.

340
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:25,240
It's not that people are mis perceiving the likelihood that over a period of time that they will get in transmission.

341
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:31,240
Is that when framed in that one narrow point in time, the number looks mighty small.

342
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,900
And now I say this.

343
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:47,060
Every time I do this in class, I have this this fear because I know what I just did was change your perceptions of HIV transmission risk.

344
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,409
I'm trusting that your knowledge will prevent you from going.

345
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,720
Oh, well, I guess it's not actually that big of a deal and then going off and doing unprotected sex.

346
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:05,919
What? Here is one of the things that the article talks about and I want to make sure you

347
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,870
picked up on is this when people engage in thinking about quantitative thinking.

348
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:23,960
About risks. There is often a case in which people become more likely to engage in risky behavior.

349
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:32,690
Yeah. Do you think with that example part, it's also like the disconnect between like what we're taught and then what people like experience.

350
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:38,690
Because I feel like in like high schools, sex ed a lot, it's always like if you have sex with someone that has a C I like, you will get it.

351
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,099
Like they make it seem like that and then like experientially that's not what's happening.

352
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,009
So like then people perceive there as similarly,

353
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:52,570
but so this is where I want to connect back to what you were talking about and the probably the probability versus possibility kinds of statements.

354
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:00,460
Much. Again, I'm not an expert in the way in which sex ed is done, and obviously there's many different ways and it's poorer and better.

355
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:07,250
I don't know if we can go out about that. Much of sex ed is possibilities, statements.

356
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:19,210
It is. This could occur. It is often framed in an inaccurate way to this will occur and that's that inaccuracy that people like to know.

357
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:29,140
You don't know it will necessarily occur. We do recognize, even with very little knowledge, that not everybody who has unprotected sex gets HIV.

358
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:35,890
Not everybody who has unprotected sex get pregnant, etc., etc. But if the gist is.

359
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,400
This is unsafe. This negative outcome can occur.

360
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,120
You should avoid it in a categorical sense.

361
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:53,110
That supports the idea of using protective behaviors, of navigating risky behaviors, using condoms, etc.

362
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:01,930
What Max is bringing up, which I think is important and what that is bringing up as well, why a pause and think about this the first time?

363
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,800
The single instance is actually a small risk.

364
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,050
The first cigaret is not likely to lead to addiction.

365
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,680
In the absolute sense. Is it moving a little bit down that pathway?

366
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:24,110
Sure. Is your experiential learning that said, hey, that wasn't so bad, maybe I'll do it again.

367
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,350
I'm going to put you more likely to take the next one, which will be more like.

368
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,280
Absolutely. I'm not in any way minimizing the pathway towards addiction.

369
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,790
But it's also the case. That.

370
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:46,870
One cigaret or one drink or one donut or like does it actually cause in that.

371
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:53,150
It's sort of like lottery ball kind of sense, the negative event to occur.

372
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,050
It's an accumulation of risk factors. Yeah.

373
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:04,189
Just on that, I'm curious. Is there any literature on harm reduction strategies and on potentially increasing risk keeping it for them?

374
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:12,739
Because, I mean, are typical harm reduction strategies like drug use of safe injection sites and not oftentimes people who are anti that will say,

375
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,580
well, you're just going to make people use heroin or something like that. I'm kind of curious in any way, so I will own that.

376
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,350
I am stepping out of my knowledge of the literature and I say this,

377
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:31,399
so please take everything I've got to say with a huge grain of salt, because I literally don't know the details.

378
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,560
And there may be literature that I'm not familiar with.

379
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:42,220
My understanding is that well-designed harm reduction strategies and interventions don't tend to see that.

380
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:50,100
In part because they're structured in ways that minimize this kind of risk reappraisal.

381
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,270
And this is why I want today to be about like when does it happen? When it doesn't happen, because it's not a guarantee.

382
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,600
You know, notice with the examples that I brought up have tended to be.

383
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,730
You you engage in one particular behavior and that loosens you in a different but related one.

384
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:24,360
But I can also give you examples of language that we have heard that sounds like this.

385
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:32,030
So I work with a clinician who is involved with people with alcoholic liver disease.

386
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,670
Well, not heroin, but an addictive substance.

387
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:43,000
And she does all kinds of things to try and get these people to reduce their alcohol.

388
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,649
And very clearly, in a harm reduction perspective, like, yes, she wants them to quit drinking.

389
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,080
But, boy, if they can't quit drinking, quitting, you know, reducing their intake makes a big difference.

390
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:00,550
She's absolutely willing to go down that path and she'll get people who are like, This is my favorite one.

391
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,730
You. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know. I need to reduce my drinking.

392
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,930
So I've, I've cut out all the vodka. I'm just drinking a 12 pack of beer a day.

393
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,710
You're like 100.

394
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:24,460
That's a mental model problem. But part of it is a risk reappraisal problem is that they're feeling like their association is with hard alcohol.

395
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,429
They're engaging in a behavior to reduce hard alcohol consumption that makes them feel like they're safer.

396
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,090
And so this other perceived to be less risky them.

397
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,640
Now they're perfectly more comfortable with because they feel like, well, I can do this and stick.

398
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,970
Yeah. Isn't there also an element, though,

399
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,989
like with like harm reduction where you're talking about what are the risks that people are using to make these decisions?

400
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:53,790
Because, like, I don't know that there's a ton of people who get off heroin because of the risk of like a blood borne disease.

401
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,460
And the same way that like, I don't know, teens that don't have sex because they're worried about HPV.

402
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,960
So, like, if we can reduce their risk of HPV, is that actually going to impact, you know?

403
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,919
Is that how they're making this decision? Right. And that, I think, is a key piece here.

404
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,140
Right. All of this is very conscious.

405
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:17,330
If I'm not thinking about it or not engaging in it, it's going to be difficult for me to be motivated by the same thing in a reverse.

406
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:26,270
If I am unaware of the fact of the impact of my risk reducing behavior, I don't reappraise it because I don't have that that sense of change.

407
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:36,770
So how much we are paying attention to these links does have an impact on how likely our behavior is to change in either direction.

408
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,070
Did you? Yeah. Yeah. I was like this. Exactly. Off the topic.

409
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,370
It's just been discussed. But again, I wonder why that.

410
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,260
Um. I was just thinking about like I think I added on it might musing about um,

411
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:57,240
like also just the simple example of getting in a car because every day you get in a car, the more you drive, the higher risk.

412
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:04,719
It's. Yeah. I thought it was interesting because I, I, at one point I was looking just to see about how I could make some money,

413
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:14,410
and it would seem to me being an uber driver. Um, fun fact if you, if you get a job that requires you to use your personal car like so pizza delivery,

414
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,400
Uber, Lyft, you have to report that to your insurance agency.

415
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:26,499
I thought that was kind of interesting that like the insurance agency uses this idea of like risk will increase over time.

416
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,240
The amount of time you're on the road. They use that to determine how much to charge you and your rates.

417
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,830
Something because for them it's a very clear and.

418
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,830
Appropriate in the actuarial sense predictor.

419
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:47,610
Someone who drives more miles is more likely to be getting into an accident per unit of time.

420
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,430
So they're going to be aware of that and want to adjust for that to whatever degree they can.

421
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:59,810
I've. I want to make sure I got here.

422
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,190
Oh, yes, I've got.

423
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,159
You raised in your musings.

424
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:14,630
Something else that I wanted to make sure to touch upon, which was we've talked a lot about sort of initiating protective behaviors.

425
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,650
You raised the idea of, well, wait a second, when do we stop like this?

426
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:24,680
Does this kind of reappraisal process lead us to potentially stop doing things that we were doing to protect ourselves?

427
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:30,080
So I'm a little back on that because I think there are some really good examples we should talk through.

428
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:34,129
Yeah, I was thinking about I didn't really mention it explicitly, my musing,

429
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:40,340
but I was really thinking about my mom because she for years had gotten the flu shot and had gotten the flu.

430
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,390
She was fine. And so this year she's like, You know what? I'm not getting it.

431
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,850
And so I was just kind of thinking like,

432
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:56,620
how do we get to that space where you are engaging in protective behavior so much and you never feel like you're that risk that you're protecting?

433
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:04,070
And she's never actually realized. So what does that do to your risk perception in like when you stop engaging in protective gear?

434
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:17,180
Yeah, my favorite disturbing but somewhat silly example of that is the teens that that adolescent as a physician I used to work with

435
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:27,380
back in Pittsburgh would see who knew that they had engaged in risky behavior and because they had never gotten pregnant,

436
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:35,450
got even less concerned about it because they believe they were in for. I know it doesn't work that way.

437
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:47,630
But this idea that there is this. Experiential learning of I did the thing and the bad thing didn't happen.

438
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,370
So do I perceive myself to have been changed?

439
00:52:53,910 --> 00:53:02,639
Do I perceive me to have a lower overall risk? It's not just something that you can think of that says, I'll stick in the pregnancy.

440
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,420
Don't make you engage in unprotected sex.

441
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,960
You don't get pregnant. Are you lucky or are you infertile?

442
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:22,030
Both explanations are consistent with the data you have.

443
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,870
Because the data you have is I engaged in the risky behavior.

444
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,580
I'm aware that it was risky behavior and a negative thing didn't occur.

445
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,940
So. The more that we frame that outcome in the it's something about me.

446
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,290
I have unique characteristics that makes this negative thing that happen.

447
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,640
I'm infertile, I drive really well. I have a great immune system.

448
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:57,490
But that kind of thinking. The more that we're going to be unmotivated to continue to engage in protective behaviors,

449
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,930
why should I bother to wear a condom, to wear my seatbelt, etc.?

450
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:08,990
Because I know that I am safe. If, on the other hand, we look at that same set of outcomes.

451
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,910
And the gist we got was, man, I dodged a bullet. I got lucky.

452
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,400
This could have been me. Then that risk free presence must have it.

453
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:26,810
I have not changed. I just got I got lucky in the sense that the positive outcome occurred for me and the negative outcome.

454
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,120
That's not good to undermine.

455
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:39,020
And much of what essentially the the fuzzy trace theory of gist idea is about is which one of those are you going to take away?

456
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,310
Because if the gist is. And you got lucky then.

457
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,940
Okay. Let's keep going. Let's keep engaging in the protective behavior.

458
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,510
I will count my stars and go forward from there.

459
00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:03,390
But if the gist that I take away from this is actually as risky the behavior as I thought it was, then you go down the pathway.

460
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,500
Well, maybe I don't need to get back. I've never got the flu, so maybe I shouldn't have.

461
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,810
And by the way, let's just unpack this for a moment.

462
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,240
I'm not picking on your mom, but this is a good example, like someone who gets vaccinated for ten years.

463
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,800
Is less likely than most people to have got the flu in those ten years.

464
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:29,940
The very act of getting vaccinated makes it less likely that they get the reinforcement of getting sick.

465
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,490
Thereby making it harder for them to maintain the behavior.

466
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,200
Whereas had they gotten sick like four years ago, they'd be like, Oh yeah, I want to avoid that.

467
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,380
This is that. If you don't get sick.

468
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:51,250
That undermines the game. If you do get sick, you're motivated to engage in the protective behavior.

469
00:55:52,030 --> 00:56:02,890
And the danger here is just like. So yeah, that was one of the reasons why I want to make sure to touch base on that with other examples.

470
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,500
Well, at least we've already brought this up.

471
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:16,360
Andrew, you were talking about in your musing about the idea of skills and and this absolutely plays in here,

472
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,640
like we can talk about skills as being like, I'm a better driver.

473
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,380
And but we also talk about like, I have a great immune system type of stuff.

474
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:33,530
Yeah, I think, I think it where it came out of is like I am extremely risk averse in almost every aspect of life.

475
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:42,620
I just I am highly logical and I know that the risk is present and generally my behavior is unchanged by experience.

476
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:50,990
But I am certainly guilty of having used my phone while driving, which is like counter to everything that you would think.

477
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,309
And I'm sure I rationalized it to myself as I'm a really good driver.

478
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:59,510
I can do this and I'll be fine. But that's obviously like.

479
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,760
Not necessarily true because so much of that is completely out of your control.

480
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,100
Like, so there's like, this perception of, like we think about.

481
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,399
Our risk in terms of like our self, but the risk doesn't really care about that.

482
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:24,870
The risk is just there regardless. Well, some of it is under our control and some of it may take to take driving as a good example of that.

483
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:35,410
But there is. The risk associated with my awareness of the surroundings, the risks associated with my physical ability to control the car.

484
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:44,240
Reaction time, etc. There is the risk associated with what everybody around me is doing, which I have no control over.

485
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:52,580
We tend to think that driving risk is only the first two and not the last.

486
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:00,680
Errors, accidents, etc. are purely driven by liability and not others abilities.

487
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:11,960
This is actually really silly. So I used to work with two former doctoral student, now alumni of this program graduates whose work focused on.

488
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,410
The driving discontinuation decisions on older adults.

489
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,010
And this played out continually in that conversation.

490
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,810
Then how did they perceive their risk of getting into an accident?

491
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,400
Well, it was always about well, my vision is still.

492
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,170
I'm a really good driver. I always will be. The speed limits I always have.

493
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,340
I always know where I am, like, and let me be true.

494
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:50,090
That doesn't change. They are older, their reaction time is slower.

495
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,290
Their ability to see at night, for example, is different.

496
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,410
Nor does it take into account the.

497
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,699
Interaction effect between. The things that are under their control.

498
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:14,190
Certain things are true. So what we tend to observe in older adults is when do older adults stop driving,

499
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,680
when there's been a near miss or an accident and there's a thing that actually occurs.

500
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:26,930
As opposed to at a certain point as their vision is degrading as as their their

501
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,400
condition is degrading as they are physical reaction times of the great answer.

502
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,560
Because they can't seat the campaign and their framing of the risk is around their own skills,

503
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:45,600
so they perceive themselves still to be able to be a safe driver.

504
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,900
What also, I was just going to say it also goes down that path of paternalism,

505
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:56,760
because a lot of times other people seem to make that decision for them and it reduces autonomy, which we know is not ideal.

506
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:01,830
People don't like their autonomy taken away from them. Well, and I will look back to that in just a second.

507
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,900
You basically just said it like people's ability to perceive themselves as others is more right.

508
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:16,740
So this risk reappraisal process, I don't think it's ever going to be 100% logical.

509
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:30,900
No, no. Nor in many ways, you want it to be like going back to the the the dangers of being all analytical and quantitative.

510
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:38,490
If you if you overthink a risk, you can start to make arguments for doing really stupid things.

511
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,340
Right. And I like irrational things.

512
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:49,630
Well, we we navigate the world in many ways by habitual behaviors.

513
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:59,570
That protects us in a categorical way. Is the need for wearing seatbelts the same every time I get into a car?

514
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:07,610
No, it's not. But I engage in that behavior every single time you get in the car, because I don't want to be engaging in the cognition of it.

515
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:16,430
That would lead me to sometimes not wear what I want to do, as opposed to just having the habit of I get to a car, I buckle my seatbelt, we're done.

516
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,370
I want to engage in a sexual encounter with an unfamiliar partner.

517
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:34,910
I think not the kind of damage I have done. Like that kind of just thinking prevents us from engaging in a rationalization of acceptance of risk.

518
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:42,420
No, I should say that and acknowledge that there are lots of things that we do where we accept risk consciously.

519
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,510
I am the last person to say, as you will read,

520
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:54,040
I will ask first to say that just because a risk exists doesn't mean that we should always try and prevent it.

521
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:04,390
Trade offs with risks for lots of reasons. But one of the things that comes out of this line of work is.

522
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:12,210
When we get all analytical, we are more likely to be able to come up with a reason to go in and do the risky thing.

523
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:22,910
When that undermine that can undermine our vaccination campaigns are safe, sex campaigns are great, disease prevention campaigns, etc.

524
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,270
So we have to own it sometimes.

525
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:31,270
That's just a sort of oversimplification.

526
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:34,210
A categorical statement of this is dangerous.

527
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:44,260
Protect against it, etc. can be a more effective method of getting people to engage in protective behavior and then getting all analytical on.

528
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:55,780
I think everybody would add the skating, which is a great example of, you know,

529
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,850
just sharing a little bit of what's in your music and not telling your story for you.

530
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,939
Oh, so every role is theater, but I don't. So I like skating rink, but I also skate in the skate park.

531
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:14,460
The spirit of that, but of park skating and the roller skating community is a thing and it's pretty dangerous.

532
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:22,290
Like it's not normal for humans to be putting on roller skates and dropping into a six foot bowl people.

533
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:32,470
Yeah, but in September, one of my friends, she she had a jump and then she felt she ended up breaking her jaw and breaking her wrists.

534
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,690
And she always tells me whenever I tell skate, she's like, oh, like just football.

535
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:48,400
And you can, like, end it all like one one, you can break something and having no answers, but also seeing my friends also getting hurt.

536
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,610
You would think that I would not skate, but I still do even.

537
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,630
And my friend got hurt even though she was wearing like a helmet. She was kneepads, wrist guards, everything.

538
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,090
And she still broke her job. Risk exists?

539
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:07,160
Yes. It's the soccer World Cup.

540
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:20,460
Question risk is for a professional soccer player. Astronomical window for a header is a huge risk.

541
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:27,170
Almost every major sport that we can point to has.

542
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:34,040
Documented regular, significant physical and often mental risks associated with it.

543
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,390
Look at football. You look at soccer, you can look at pretty much anything.

544
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:44,760
Why do we do it? Because we enjoy it.

545
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:52,320
Because we accept those risks as part of the price that we pay for getting the other things that we get from that experience.

546
01:04:55,790 --> 01:05:01,970
We'll come back to that when we talk about the eternal. How do we think about what is a sufficient benefit?

547
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:10,820
To offset the risk that may exist and what benefits are considered socially acceptable, and what benefits are not considered socially acceptable.

548
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,850
In this context, what I want to highlight is.

549
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:26,519
You have. Not actually in terms of changed your risk reappraisal based upon that outcome

550
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,460
because you already perceived a degree of risk and engaged in protective behaviors.

551
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:35,909
I'm presuming, by the way you describe this, that when you when you skate, you wear a helmet,

552
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:41,610
you wear protective gear, etc., you do things to minimize that risk to the extent that you can.

553
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:52,559
And. So that the pathway here of behavior motivation is in existence like you are motivate,

554
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,880
you perceive the behavior to be risky, you are motivated to engage in those protective behavior.

555
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:03,980
And the risk reappraisal is that you have not actually reduced this risk enough so that you wouldn't stop wearing a helmet like,

556
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,350
you know, you need to keep doing what? These are.

557
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,450
All the fires to behave. They are not absolutes.

558
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:21,810
Just because somebody has perceived risk does not mean that everybody's going to stop engaging that behavior.

559
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,960
If we go into the context of sexual activity like.

560
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:35,000
Just because somebody perceives a type of sexual activity to be risky does not immediately lead to abstinence.

561
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:43,120
There are many middle ground spaces in which you engage in productive behaviors that might be right.

562
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:48,339
Concerns that might be selective about partners that make all kinds of things fall into

563
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:54,130
that category of modifying your risk because you know that you have a higher risk.

564
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,010
That doesn't I don't want you to take away from this that this has to be in absolutes.

565
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:05,960
There are many different grades. You. But this is sort of the broad.

566
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,570
I always have this day towards the end of this course because we spent all this time talking with people about.

567
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:18,990
How do we communicate probabilities and how do we communicate mental models and how do we think about them in crises?

568
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:25,469
And then every year somebody comes back and sort of like, Yeah, but the stuff doesn't always work.

569
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:35,190
And I'm like, Yeah, it doesn't. Let's all that and talk now about when might it work and when might it not?

570
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:43,420
Because that's ultimately why we're talking about this course is, you know, there are times when communicating risk,

571
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,579
changing people's perception are going to be valuable for changing behavior or allowing you to make good decisions.

572
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:55,750
And there are times when they're not going to change anything. And there are times in the risk, reappraisal, success, when if we do it wrong,

573
01:07:56,140 --> 01:08:01,420
we might even motivate people to engage in riskier behaviors like there are backfire effects here.

574
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,830
So now let's engage in the question of what do we do well.

575
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:13,080
So. Let's actually split up into groups a little bit earlier than usual.

576
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:16,080
I want you to think about two things. What is this?

577
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,630
We've talked about the sort of sense of just and I want to turn to Carolyn's point about sort of like.

578
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:32,280
Just in the sense of this is an acceptable risk at not the sort of value overtones of, hey,

579
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:36,510
I could this could be turn out really poorly or oh, that's not actually that that kind of stuff.

580
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:51,249
And on a related note. When does it seem like giving people risk information leads to this protective behavior of this behavior modification?

581
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:54,700
And when does it. How are those two things interrelated?

582
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:59,560
Just try and come up with examples of situations that worked and situations where it didn't.

583
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,880
And I suspect you're going to find that as you're talking about situations where it worked.

584
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,570
The gist of it is, wow, that's not an acceptable risk.

585
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:10,780
We need to do something about this. This could happen to me.

586
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:17,200
This is bad time of year. And when we're going to be looking at situations where you really don't see behavior change.

587
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:22,210
The gist is going to be that what people have taken away is going to be sort of like,

588
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,760
Yeah, it's not that bad, we can handle this, it's going to happen to me, etc.

589
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,990
So I come to this market to try and get two samples.

590
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,989
I just sort of talk about it in broad terms,

591
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:43,129
trying to get specific examples of situations where it seemed like risk perceptions were or were not related

592
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:48,560
to behavior and then unpack them sort of what are people saying or thinking or doing in other situations?

593
01:09:49,370 --> 01:10:02,800
I'll try and pull this back for a few minutes, hopefully. Of course.

594
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,440
Try not to say I don't know.

595
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:24,240
It's just like I'm like, I know I was a dangerous general.

596
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:32,520
I see that. You think it's okay?

597
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,180
It's okay. You could get hurt walking down the stairs.

598
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,860
Not if you fall down the stairs.

599
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:51,840
Right. I don't get if I think my skill is really good, then I think that I'm not going to get it out of the ground.

600
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:57,510
But I sure drown in that area.

601
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:04,259
But this is but this is so great. But I don't I mean, high risk, even though it technically is a high price.

602
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,110
Exactly like I said before.

603
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:17,669
So it's kind of like you said before, understanding why.

604
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:23,280
But symbolism is being told to get some kind of understanding.

605
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:29,250
I feel I'm just giving you the truth, telling that you.

606
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:39,110
I mean, what are your stories like said?

607
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:46,400
I mean, people drive crazy basically when people get it right.

608
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,950
I guess I didn't have a sense that we're driving doesn't know.

609
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,709
Is there any preceding time period you don't know like a beginning.

610
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,800
There is a of you know, like it's like one goes into the next.

611
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:07,820
That's my issue with it. It's, it's, it's the basis of this.

612
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,100
Oh yeah. Was just going on here because that's what we're here to say.

613
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:26,130
So I guess, I guess I, I guess those things, I mean, like you say, like, do I like my work?

614
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:38,010
But it's not like the bad ones, like HIV,

615
01:12:38,010 --> 01:13:06,020
like it's getting into trouble because obviously it's the the thing is that all these other guys that are coming out other severity and you know,

616
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:13,079
it's like a consequence of yes, I think that, you know, you can get whatever,

617
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:24,690
like I don't call you, you know, like this is like how do I make up for that?

618
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:57,070
It's like it's like I know don't like I guess if it doesn't really have something I have to explain something like trying to

619
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:12,570
help her is reducing like how I was feeling even more not making a film that places like this in here is the just like sex.

620
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,800
But it does sometimes.

621
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,910
Yeah, that's going on.

622
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:38,550
It's on the internet. You know, like I said, it's like like I think that it's like an refreshing crash.

623
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:43,590
But then I start focusing on like the culture is maybe like,

624
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:54,210
okay or even worse than the English, but then you have that kind of thing that can have racist.

625
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:10,320
It's sort of things like that. But I think part of it is coupled with something you're driving you don't understand.

626
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:17,520
I mean, when you think about why it occurs all the time, right, I'm in control of my risk.

627
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:27,750
But yeah, that's exactly what you want to say, to not have to find a situation where, yeah, we're not doing this.

628
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,610
So that's like the whole thing about it.

629
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:48,450
I almost think that's it's like this idea that you can't do that just because you look for individual data and make sure he's going to say,

630
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:52,380
Yeah, yeah, just do it for yourself.

631
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,600
Like, like if you feel like that. Yeah.

632
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:01,050
And I don't know, like, say, yeah, I just.

633
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:16,190
I just feel like, you know, it's just like at the end of his life, like, I never heard that word before.

634
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:24,640
You know, it sounded crazy to me for an article in any of, like, you guys.

635
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:37,160
Just, like, you know, I feel about everything that you have to think about your whole life.

636
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:45,510
So, yeah. Oh, I always thought, like, anybody have a really good example they want to share from their group of zero.

637
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:53,099
Like, Wow, that's a really great example where it's perception. You really do drive behavior or don't have a story.

638
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,930
But I have to say,

639
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:09,840
I guess we were just really struggling with the whole idea of friends and just kind of what is just and like I'm I don't really use it.

640
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,730
I saw Valerie through two weeks ago at a conference and I'm still like, I don't know.

641
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:24,479
I just I think the closest we got to, like, some kind of thing was like the gist of, like, like we're talking about, like, studies or like drug use.

642
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,100
And like, the gist of those are kind of very morally or culturally dependent of like some people might be

643
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:33,299
drug users and worse and possible or like somebody even has to be is the worst thing possible.

644
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:41,970
Does kind of is that just. Well and and notice that let's take HIV.

645
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:50,160
Like has the gist of an HIV infection changed in the area of antiretroviral therapy?

646
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,380
Yeah, it has. And does that have impact on the way in which you then think about those trade offs?

647
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,820
It may. I don't have easy answers. On what just it's like.

648
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:08,750
I think there's a nugget of truth that we we boil down information into something that Valerie would call it just.

649
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:13,400
And whatever that thing is, seems to have a lot of implications on our behavior.

650
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:17,600
But how we get from the information to that just is fuzzy.

651
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,970
Which is, of course, why she calls it fuzzy trace theory. So here's my story, which is related to this.

652
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,700
Number of years ago, I worked on a project looking at.

653
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,020
Talking with women who are at high risk of developing first breast cancers.

654
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:42,910
But. Not necessarily with genetic risk because of other risk factors,

655
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:53,710
whether or not they would want to take hormone suppressing medications to reduce their risk of developing their breast.

656
01:18:55,740 --> 01:19:01,860
And we gave them personalized estimates of their breast cancer risk.

657
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,650
So a quantitative estimate of how likely are you to develop breast cancer in the next five years?

658
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:17,930
We also gave them information about how their breast cancer risk compared to the average woman's risk for their age.

659
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:25,430
So a relative comparative risk. And we looked to see how those risk perceptions.

660
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:34,900
Others risk information on their perceptions of that risk related to their motivation to take these medications.

661
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:42,740
Takeaway from that particular study was. Because this people varied in the degree of the risk.

662
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:48,610
There were some women who had 3%, five year risk, people about 6%, five year risk, etc.

663
01:19:48,620 --> 01:20:00,609
So there's some variation. The variability in the precise risk has absolutely no correlation with your motivation to engage in behavior.

664
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:04,720
The people who had 6% by the arrests were exactly as likely to want it to be,

665
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,820
to want to engage in protective behavior as people who had two and a half or 3% arrests.

666
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:19,580
Comparative risks, their perceptions of being above average versus average risk had a correlation.

667
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,780
They we're taking that sense up again. There's a that's not precisely in a quantitative sense accurate.

668
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:34,750
Just because you're above average doesn't necessarily mean that you as an individual take an action to prevent a risk.

669
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:41,860
But they were clearly translating that, oh, if I'm above average, then this is a risk that I need to pay attention to.

670
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:50,360
Kind of just. In a way that they were not from their precise quantitative risk estimate.

671
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,669
So I'll leave you with that.

672
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:59,900
As an example of a situation in which two different kinds of risk communication seem to have somewhat different relationships to behavior.

673
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:06,970
And. Now we get to wrestle with this moving forward.

674
