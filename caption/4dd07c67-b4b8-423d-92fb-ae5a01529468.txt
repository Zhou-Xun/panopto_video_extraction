1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,610
So as I said before, we're going to we have a lot of sites like 100 slides today,

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:17,370
and I want to try and get through all of them as much as possible because we have another big section and then a test coming up.

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,890
So I'm going to try and keep on schedule if it goes a little bit long and you can't stay,

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,810
just get up and leave, but I'm going to try and get through everything, OK?

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:37,080
So we're to the most interesting part of mycology, and I'm going to move this chair so I don't trip over it.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,540
These are the systemic mycoses. These are the really bad ones, they're endemic because they exist in certain parts of the country,

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,490
so we got capacity or, you know, my closest histoplasmosis and blast on my process.

8
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,470
We're going to be talking about the so some general features of the systemic

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,400
Mycoses besides being that they are thermally dimorphic fungi that live in soil.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,960
What does that mean that if they're not at the right temperature, they can't change from a year to a mold or an old to a yeast?

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,440
OK, thermally dimorphic, their geographic distribution is separate than capacity.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,490
What is is in Arizona, parts of New Mexico and so on.

13
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,370
Southern California, and it doesn't exist for Histo and Blasto exists. Blasto was south of here.

14
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,900
We certainly have histoplasmosis here. We have a little bit of blast, but not very much.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,570
How do you acquire these they acquired by inhalation? So it's growing in nature as a mold.

16
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,660
The wind blows, people breathe and they get infected, OK?

17
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,160
There is no evidence of human to human transmission.

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:56,040
And you don't have to be immunocompromised to get one of these healthy individuals are very susceptible as well as everyone else.

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,300
So the first one, this is the biggest one. Cassidy, one of my courses.

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,860
It's caused by cracks, video images and as I said,

21
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,750
it's confined to the southwestern part of the United States, northern Mexico and central and South America.

22
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:22,410
Micro microscopically in tissue, you see, spherules and spherules are large Sibbald cells filled with small and the spores.

23
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,050
OK, very easy to see. I'll show you pictures at room temperature.

24
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,450
You see hyphae with barrel shaped chlamydia. Very, very easy to identify.

25
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,350
So here is the endemic area in the United States, southwestern United States,

26
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,890
and that in Venezuela down here, also someone Argentina and Paraguay and some in Central America.

27
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,630
And then you could see a broader area, broader picture of where it is in the southwestern part of the United States.

28
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,440
And it's also in the what we call the lower Sonoran Life Zone.

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,010
If you've ever been to Arizona or parts of Texas or New Mexico, that's the lower Sonora Life Zone is a beautiful area.

30
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,440
Lots of cactus. So here's the lifecycle.

31
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:21,300
OK, it's really easy. OK, so we have the fungus in the soil, OK, it's growing in the sand and it's growing and it's growing and going the wrong way.

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,050
It's growing and these are young cells. They get bigger and bigger.

33
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,900
They make hyphae with fragile spores that break off.

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,880
They're in the soil. The wind comes up, blows the sand around and the dirt it's in the air.

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:44,400
It's inhaled by people. People then develop these forms and eventually they cough them out,

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,950
or they are expelled from the body and they get back on the soil and the repeat the cycle again.

37
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,730
So to grow in the soil, it requires some moisture, but not very much during dry periods,

38
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,380
the high heat die and they leave these viable Arthur Kennedy up.

39
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,340
Arthur will be kind of square ish Canadian that can be inhaled.

40
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,110
They get all the way down in the lungs. They're dispersed also by natural forces.

41
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:20,110
I've already mentioned the wind or any animal that's digging in the soil or humans, digging or putting in a new road or anything like that.

42
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:28,540
A new housing area. Anything that disturbs the soil. These Arthur spores can get up in the air and be inhaled.

43
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,590
So there can be epidemics, which is strange with the fungal disease,

44
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:40,780
there can be epidemics following this version of the soil, and it might happen with a big windstorm or something like that.

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:48,580
New construction, as I said, or if there are just a lot of new susceptible people who move into the area, they're really tired of Michigan winters.

46
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,590
They're going to move to Arizona. Well, watch out.

47
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,840
So there can also be a common source outbreaks if the soil is disrupted, I said over building a house or paving roads or anything like that.

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,580
And people oftentimes don't have any immunity. They have to live there and they're very susceptible.

49
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:15,890
So these are the the sports burials, see how big it is, and these are indoor sports within it.

50
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,950
And here's another big variable here.

51
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:28,780
And then these are the are through spores, and this is what it looks like when growing on culture, media or in the soil.

52
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:36,190
And you can see how there's a cell and then it looks like it's dark where it breaks off and another cell where it breaks off and so on,

53
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,070
and you can see how fragmented they can be here.

54
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:47,050
Each of these cells like that one, that one and that one, they're all infectious and it only takes one.

55
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,000
And then I hope I'm not scaring anybody from going to Arizona. I love it there.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,010
OK, pathogenesis. OK. We know they're inhaled, I've only said that now about a dozen times when ingested by pulmonary macrophages.

57
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,840
And what about pulmonary macrophages? Do they circulate throughout the lungs?

58
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,700
But while they're circulating the spherules and the the Arthur Kennedy excuse me,

59
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,300
convert to around self is beginning to get that spherical and enlarges three or more days to become a spherical beer.

60
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,510
Not this big, but it has thick walls.

61
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:30,940
It's eight to 30 microns in size and in diameter, and it contains hundreds of indoor spores, hundreds of spores, and it's very tiny microscopically.

62
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:38,860
So when the spherical ruptures, what happens? Then the spores disperse and they start another and the spore burial cycle

63
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,300
and it goes on and on so they can disseminate not only throughout the lungs,

64
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:50,200
but throughout the blood hematology asleep to meninges bones, skin and other soft tissues.

65
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,890
Absolutely devastating disease. So a person doesn't have any therapy and doesn't have any immunity.

66
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:11,250
Next slide. So pathogenesis inhalation of the infectious particle, which we know are the Arthur Kennedy and or the the spherules formation in vivo,

67
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:21,260
they're engulfed within Fergusons by alveolar macrophages, and they are just to make life more interesting, resistant to intracellular killing.

68
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:30,360
It's like the perfect pathogen. So in a primary infection, what do we see, what will the physician or the practitioner see?

69
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,540
Mostly patients are asymptomatic. They may have a fever and they may have some mild chest pain macaque, maybe some weight loss.

70
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:44,790
It kind of looks like tuberculosis. But when they look to a chest x ray, the longer this scan the lens, I see these nodular lesions.

71
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,790
That's a primary infection in the secondary infection, which is only about one percent of the patients is chronic.

72
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,110
It's fulminant throughout the lungs and then can spread to other tissues.

73
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,420
So it could be in the lungs, as I said, but also the meninges bones and skin.

74
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,250
And here is a picture of someone who has not had any therapy.

75
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,410
This picture has been around for a long time. You can see it on Dr. Fungus that I told you about.

76
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:20,990
And you can see this. This poor person has lesions all over her body. So how is it diagnosed?

77
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,060
Well, we would look at either sputum or other risk for samples or tissues or tissue,

78
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,230
whether it looks like there's lesions and we look to a college prep,

79
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,360
which has been just teasing the tissue apart a little bit in a drop of potassium hydroxide,

80
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,140
putting on a cover slip and then looking at it microscopically to see what we see or we can do.

81
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,600
An HD, which is a pathologist in either one, works beautifully and you look for this very old in culture.

82
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,960
You only grow mold. You're not going to grow yeast in culture unless you do your culture in mice, which we don't do.

83
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,940
Only male colleagues grow it at 25 degrees, which is room temperature.

84
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,430
If you grow in an enriched medium at 40 degrees, you may be able to induce burials.

85
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,440
But it's really not necessary to do that because the diagnostics are very good.

86
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:18,270
We know what we're looking for. We know what the disease is, and there are molecular diagnostics, if there's any question about it.

87
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:27,390
So here is the more white, fluffy mold with a little bit, the older kids gets a little bit grayish looking, as you can see in the center.

88
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,940
Nothing really spectacular about it. But if you're working in a psychology lab and you see that?

89
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:44,250
Be careful. So diagnosis, we do serology complement fixation assays, which most places don't do, but if you need to do antibodies, that's what you do.

90
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,880
You do complement fixation, but say we've got great molecular reagents now that help with the diagnosis.

91
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,990
And just this is I'm not going to go through this, you can look at this yourself, it's from Texas,

92
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,370
the lab in Texas, just how to do a compliment fixation test with a patient with and without antibodies.

93
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,600
Take a look at this look and make sure you know the difference between with and without antibodies.

94
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,270
OK, what about all you have already mentioned it, so there's complement fixation for IG,

95
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:24,190
and you need to test paired system sera sera collected at least a couple of weeks apart, two or three weeks apart.

96
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:30,730
Titers of one two eight or one two six should be repeated in a few weeks, three or four weeks, you know, about a month apart.

97
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,720
If you have a continually rising titer to crumple to Cork City Park City, what is going?

98
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,080
It's a very bad prognostic sign. It means the patient is not handling the infection.

99
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,150
OK, and it's very, very bad for the for the patient.

100
00:10:49,150 --> 00:11:03,340
So if there's any problem concern about cross-reactivity, you can do immuno diffusion in immuno diffusion to to resolve any cross-reactivity problems.

101
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,180
OK, more proxy serology, you can do an MRI, EIA will detect both IDM and IGT,

102
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,640
but it doesn't correlate really well with immuno diffusion and complement fixation on high titers.

103
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:23,140
But overall, overall, it's a good starting point without jumping into a confident fixation test, which takes a lot of work.

104
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,450
So if you're looking at a potential proxy meningitis, lowest pollution is one to two,

105
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,400
and if the patient has it, it'll be positive at one to 75 percent of the time.

106
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,730
That's amazing. While the court culture in the same patient may only be positive about 50 percent of the time,

107
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,190
so it's good to include that serology along with the culture.

108
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:57,190
What is it treated with terrorism being and or itraconazole or flu console because flu console gets into the CSF, whereby the others don't.

109
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:04,980
So if there's meningitis get patients got to have flu console, so.

110
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,850
OK. Pakistani authorities in the test was a potential bioterrorism agent.

111
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:19,650
But not any more, but it's still very dangerous. So working in the lab, you ever see a white, fluffy fungus, you never open it up on the open bat.

112
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:27,700
It's always opened up in a biological safety cabinet and better in a BSL three facility.

113
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,710
OK, on to Histo Histoplasmosis, which we certainly have around here.

114
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,500
It lives in the soil and it likes bat and bird droppings and they enrich.

115
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,570
The soil is prevalent all over the world, but particularly endemic in Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky,

116
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,140
and it goes up into southern Michigan and up to the Lake Michigan side of the state microscopically.

117
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,490
What do we see? We see a small yeast cell and tissue.

118
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:07,090
But when we grow it at room temperature, we'll see Hyphae Micro and macro Canadian and the macro Canadian may have to burkill it back with spores.

119
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:13,330
What does that sound? They're big brown spores that have bumps on the outside.

120
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:19,170
That's a tubercular map of Canadian when grown at 25 degrees.

121
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,250
So here's the histoplasmosis endemic area,

122
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:30,720
and it does come up here into Central Michigan and not as much as they have south of us, but enough that we're aware of it.

123
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,160
We have it on the west side, we have it on the east side. We have it up here. But Traverse City, but none of the U.P. yet.

124
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,900
We have it in my home state of Nebraska and so on. So it's it's in much of the United States.

125
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,160
And here's what it looks like in culture. So these are the two Burke, excuse me.

126
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,230
These are the macro idea, and they've got spikes on the outside. They're big and they've got spikes.

127
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,690
And then you can also see the micro Canadian, Micro Canadian, Micro Canadian, Micro Canadian, so on.

128
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,950
And this is done with phase contrast from my friend up to this.

129
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:16,930
And then here is a yeast growing at 37 degrees in the lab just to make a suspension of it, put it on the slide cover,

130
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:24,820
solid liquid phase contrast and you can see the the forms that you will see with a yeast phase.

131
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:33,150
You can see that they're budding. And this one is actually forming a mycelium and so on.

132
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:44,340
So pathogenesis. OK. Inhalation again of microcredit here or there can be primary cutaneous inoculation, somebody is working outside, they're cutting.

133
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,830
Were there digging holes and whatever they're doing outside and they get injured,

134
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,320
they get cut, the shovel slips, it scrapes their legs, something happens.

135
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,500
And that would be cutaneous inoculation. So wanted to inoculate it in tissue.

136
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:11,040
It converts to body cells, and it can be phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, but it has to get up to the lungs to do that.

137
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,280
So if it's not in the lungs, it's a wound infection. It won't get fed tools like that.

138
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:30,600
Are the reticulated endothelial system will partially restrict growth or dissemination, but it's not 100 percent OK.

139
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:39,120
But if a person's healthy, they may have better luck in getting the disease localized to one side instead of going throughout the body.

140
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:48,310
And the pathogenesis, of course, is worse if the patient's cellular immunity is not working well.

141
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:55,000
Next slide. So what do we find in pulmonary infection? Ninety five percent of the cases of histoplasmosis are asymptomatic.

142
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,730
People don't know that they've been infected, although it could be mild, moderate disease could be severe or even chronic cavity.

143
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,940
And all of this depends on what the patient's immune system is like and how long it's been going on.

144
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:16,600
There can also be disseminated infection that I mentioned previously would most likely be in the particular endothelial system,

145
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,260
which includes liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow or could be mucocutaneous also.

146
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,640
And then, as I said, there can be primary cutaneous infection due to a wound and working outside you get injured.

147
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:37,270
Next slide. So how is it diagnosed? Well, we have to get the specimens into the laboratory and it can be a wide variety of specimens.

148
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:45,080
Of course, it's going to be sputum or tissue of those lesions. If it's severe enough, then we might get bone marrow, CSF or blood.

149
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,950
But the main first specimens we would encounter would be sputum or tissue.

150
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:59,510
Most likely sources of this organism, we're going to process the specimens or make slides, will examine them with games or write staining.

151
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,580
Those are both very good tissue stains that would show an inflammatory response,

152
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,680
and we would also see intracellular or and or extracellular yeast cells.

153
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,110
Remember, these are small. These are two to three microns in size. They're not big like Hoxie.

154
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,820
And then we're in a culture at to two. Temperatures are going to come closer at 25 or at room temperature.

155
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:30,550
We're going to cut culture at thirty five to thirty seven. Also on enriched media to see if we can convert converted from the mold to the yeast.

156
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,920
OK. There is serology for histoplasmosis, full complement fixation and immuno diffusion.

157
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,130
Immuno diffusion is much easier to do, and it's available in many more laboratories.

158
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,770
Complement fixation is more of a reference lab test.

159
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,860
Go to the state health department, go to Mayo, go to lab or go to a big reference lab and they will have it available.

160
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,310
There's also a urine antigen test, and that's very good for initial encounters.

161
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,240
But remember, antigen tests are not as sensitive.

162
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:10,220
They won't detect as much as a cultural. Or molecular athlete?

163
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,900
So a little bit about the plasma plasma, and it can be detected in urine in about 90 percent of the people who have this device,

164
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,140
Moses and in a sermon, about 80 percent of the patients. So that's that's pretty good for the antigen.

165
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,410
Patients have to have disseminated is still to be detected.

166
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,250
There are newer versions of the test have enhanced.

167
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,360
They will detect more and they are more specific, so less cross-reactivity.

168
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,100
But even with their more more specific, they may cross-react with other endemic microbes,

169
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:54,350
such as Blast of Microsystems for if you if you detect the antigen in the urine or the blood and the levels decrease during therapy,

170
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,140
they will increase if there was a relapse. So keep an eye on that's an easy thing to detect.

171
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:06,890
Is the antigen level. Keep an eye on those levels and then you measure antigen levels at set time.

172
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:14,670
So prior to therapy at two weeks, one month, every three months and at six months after therapy,

173
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:24,690
you start to make sure that nothing comes back and you can measure how well the patient has responded in this manner.

174
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,400
So here's an example of an antigen test.

175
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:38,310
We have the control serum up here where the antigen in the center in patients sera around it and then a control serum down here.

176
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:45,150
I don't know if you were all I've ever taken immunology classes. You can see the reactions are complete identity or partial identities of complete

177
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,740
identity of a person line of precipitant that goes like this a partial.

178
00:19:49,740 --> 00:20:01,560
You have a line coming off and if there's not identity, there's no, no, no the lines to the intersect, but they don't meld.

179
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,460
So here's an example, but with Cork City, what is in the system plasma?

180
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,580
And here a number three is positive for coffee and it goes along with this one right here.

181
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,600
You can't see in this picture, but I can see it on the screen and then over here.

182
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,020
But H&M are positive, too. Number two is H&M. And that's positive.

183
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:28,150
And three, number three is positive right here with the control.

184
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:36,400
So, eight, when we talk about H&M, yeah, age is an active case of histoplasmosis, and AB is either active or chronic,

185
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:46,250
or it can be patients who have been skin tested and from the skin testing have developed a little bit of antibody also.

186
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:55,040
So more on the H&M band, the age band usually only present in clinically active cases of histoplasmosis.

187
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,690
So if a patient is not sick with history, they won't most likely will not have an age band.

188
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:11,510
The band occurs in both an active and chronic cases. And if the patient is skin, that person is skin tested with Mr Plasmon, you can tell them that.

189
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:25,260
So that's like a little bit too far from the immune response. So here's a slide that I'm sure I took from Dr. fundus sensitivity of diagnostic

190
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,550
tests for histoplasmosis and is broken down into disseminated disease,

191
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:38,700
acute pulmonary disease and chronic pulmonary disease. So in disseminated disease antigen or detect 92 percent of the patients in acute pulmonary,

192
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:47,880
the three percent detection is lower thirty four point eighty one percent and in chronic pulmonary antigen only detect 14 percent of the patients.

193
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,550
If you go to culture, it's graded disseminated. You got a lot more fungus there to work with to detect.

194
00:21:53,550 --> 00:22:00,900
But in acute pulmonary, only 15 percent will have a positive culture because it has not been patient,

195
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,250
has not been sick with that fungus for that long. But in chronic pulmonary, 85 percent of the patients will be positive.

196
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:14,820
On a pulmonary culture stain, 43 percent will be positive with disseminated infection.

197
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,890
But you know, stains don't detect nearly as much as a culture or a molecular test does.

198
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,730
And so in acute pulmonary and chronic pulmonary, the numbers are much lower.

199
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,610
And then, of course, the serology is the opposite.

200
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:36,210
So in disseminated disease will detect 71 percent of the of the patients because there's going to be some percent that don't make antibodies.

201
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,930
But when you look at acute pulmonary and chronic pulmonary, 98 100 percent positive.

202
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,480
So what about treatment if the patient is doing well, they've been diagnosed,

203
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,620
they've got a little bit of a pulmonary infection, but they're getting better on their own. No treatment.

204
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,910
See how they do. OK, the treatment is not easy.

205
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:08,540
If you're not getting better or if it's disseminated, or if they have an underlying condition, Amphotericin B itraconazole,

206
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,600
or if the lesion or the infection is in just one portion of the lung,

207
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:23,420
they may take that portion out and get rid of it and then keep them on anti-fungal therapy also.

208
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:35,210
OK, that's his deal now, Bledsoe, the Etiologic agent, is blasting son's dermatologists in America, Africa and Asia microscopically.

209
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:43,280
What we see are yeast, and they are large is a large yeast and that you have to be able to see whatever you say.

210
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:51,020
I think it's a huge step to make sure it's buddy. So the bud is attached by a broad base instead of a narrow base at the broad base.

211
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:57,520
OK, and at twenty five degrees, we'll see mold with high in Canadian.

212
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,780
And this is the endemic area for blast analyzes, and yes, we have it here, but it's mostly here along the Lake Michigan side,

213
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:12,460
although we have seen in a few other places, but mostly along Lake Michigan side.

214
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:21,280
So it occurs in south, eastern and south central states of North America and also along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.

215
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,240
How did the heck do they get to Michigan? Nobody's ever figured that out, either.

216
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,010
The birds outbreaks are associated with occupational or recreational activities outside around streams and rivers.

217
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,850
Throwing a line into the stream for fishing? Oh, let's see what's in the dirt.

218
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,740
Let's dig around. And though I cut myself, no big deal nets, big deal.

219
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:51,850
And so round streams and rivers with high content of moist soil enriched with organic debris, rotting wood, bird droppings and so on.

220
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:04,210
Blast Mieses loves that territory. And this is what it looks like, broad based, but so right here, it's broad.

221
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:15,970
OK. Normally when you have somebody, it's a very narrow but segment that connects the bud to the east of this is broad based.

222
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:24,830
So remember broad based bud blastoff. But here we have with a silver stain.

223
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:35,080
And you can see that this one is broad, is broad based, but this one's not attached, well, maybe attach just a little bit, but it's moving away.

224
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:43,090
And then this is the mold. And it's interesting because you don't see very many when you grow it in a mold form,

225
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,990
you have to let it grow for a while, like two or three weeks before you actually see spores.

226
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,480
It's very slow to spoil.

227
00:25:49,480 --> 00:26:01,030
But what you see is a a single celled canedy or right here, a Canadian formed on short Canadian forest that the stuff is the committee for.

228
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,230
But once again, by the time you get get this culture, you wait two to three weeks,

229
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:11,910
you could have had a molecular test and a lot of other tests done at the same time.

230
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,300
So what is the pathogenesis, it's just like the other systemic fungi, you breathe it in.

231
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,370
And so you could also have though people working outside for primary cutaneous inoculation,

232
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,160
you get injured working outside or you're playing ball or getting tackled out in the field or something like that.

233
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,170
You get injured. It's in the soil. You can get infected. So.

234
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:43,680
There will be infiltration of the macrophages and the neutrophils, and the granuloma will fall for people who have normal immune response,

235
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,440
and it is this Ferguson is resistant to oxidative killing mechanisms of neutrophils.

236
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:58,560
They can live inside neutrophils. They love it. It's cozy, and they're also resistant to frontal fungicide activity of macrophages.

237
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:10,860
So it's it's hard for the body to kill this organism. So what happens when a person inhales some of the air?

238
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,580
It transforms into a yeast in the lungs, and then the patient will develop acute pulmonary infection,

239
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,830
which is like bacterial pneumonia and might be treated with unnecessary and bacterial,

240
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,540
which are going to do the patient any good that occurs 30 to 45 days later.

241
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,760
So there's at least a month, month and a half before there's any respiratory problems.

242
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,750
Fifty percent of the primary infections are asymptomatic, people don't know they've been infected, they go on their merry way, OK?

243
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:51,660
But it may, may manifest and show itself to a crop during a chronic or indolent phase that can affect the lungs, the skin,

244
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:59,850
the bones, the genital urinary system and other particular organs so it can spread out throughout the entire body.

245
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,760
And it also mimics tuberculosis and it can coexist with tuberculosis.

246
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:12,390
So we've got a positive skin test. They're going to get treated for tuberculosis and oh, they're not getting any better.

247
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,170
So they would have to go and look for for what else is causing it.

248
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:27,210
Or it can mimic a Bronco Jeneyah carcinoma also. So it's really a tricky organism to identify and the pulmonologist and the idea physicians work

249
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:34,220
very hard to get these identifications correct and so the patient is treated appropriately.

250
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,580
So clinical findings may be asymptomatic. It can be a pulmonary infection.

251
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,130
It can be a chronic cutaneous infection, so a skin one that doesn't go away for a long time.

252
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,480
That can be disseminated infection already told you. Skin tone.

253
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,560
But I was typing away central nervous system or spleen.

254
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:00,080
Certainly, if it gets into the central nervous system, is so, so so much worse than anywhere else.

255
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:10,610
And there can be a primary cutaneous infection. So as a future infection prevention us, you start hearing these things.

256
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,440
When you're in the hospital, you're working with physicians. Keep looking into things.

257
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,150
Don't let it drop. And this is a chronic lesion on the skin.

258
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,580
It's been going on for quite some time.

259
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:32,080
And you can see the if you're going to take a scraping, you always want to take a skin scraping from the outside edge, not from the center.

260
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,250
Always, even with their modifies, your skin scraping from the outside edge.

261
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,050
So diagnosis, either sputum or tissue would be. Did you have a question?

262
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:52,210
OK? Specimens looked to a direct fungal exam, either with potassium hydroxide or send it into an atomic pathologist for an h.

263
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:59,720
And he said, Well, we're going to see if it's there are these cells and the blood once again attached with a broad base,

264
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:08,920
not a little narrow base, but a broad base would grow if we when we get specimens like this, we grow them at both.

265
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:18,610
Twenty five and thirty seven or thirty five °C at twenty five degrees will be a mold you can convert into a yeast on enriched media.

266
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:27,140
But it is. It will take weeks to do it. Weeks and weeks. Better to do a molecular assay to confirm it.

267
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:37,300
Horse strategies. So strategy, complement fixation and diffusion, there is a urine antigen test, which is a good place to start.

268
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:44,050
But antigen tests are not as sensitive as cultures or molecular tests.

269
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,930
OK, routine serology is not very good for both to my closest because it cross-react with everything.

270
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:58,600
So if you do carbon, the fixation you do immunodeficient detect less than 50 percent of the patients with active disease.

271
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,580
And if you do a couple of fixation, it has more false reactions than true reactions.

272
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,170
So really, complement fixation is not useful for blasphemy ecosystem.

273
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:21,170
This immunodeficient test is more sensitive and will pick up more than the complement fixation, but you still have to worry about cross-reactivity.

274
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:32,030
What about treatment after some beef, which we call have a terrible itraconazole from cancer, or if it's just limited to the surface?

275
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:40,460
Surgery to remove it and keep the patient on therapy. OK.

276
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,530
This is one we don't have in the United States, Paranaque City or these Brazilian.

277
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,670
But anybody from South America, they have it there.

278
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:57,350
So it is a dimorphic for this. It's called the diseases Paranaque City or endometriosis, which is a mouthful.

279
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,300
It has no sexual stage or are not polymorph, which is the same thing as a sexual stage.

280
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,220
Nobody has history here was discovered in 1998 by Adolfo Lutz in Brazil.

281
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,320
But he didn't suggest a name for it.

282
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:18,770
And then in nineteen thirty, Dr. Almeda created the genus pericarditis and that it was distinct from its separate from Cork City.

283
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:33,740
All his images totally different from this. So it's an oval east light form at 35 to 37 in the human or in a culture on enriched media.

284
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:41,630
Thirty five degrees at room temperature, you see elongated mycelium that mycelium can convert to the yeast form.

285
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,880
If you give it what you want, which is blood sugar or blood glucose.

286
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,060
So it's a fungal medium with blood like that at 37 degrees for 10 to 20 days.

287
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,440
So it takes a while to grow in the yeast phase, but you can do it.

288
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,420
The high fuel cells will die or they will convert to the space, and these eventually produce the buds that are diagnostic.

289
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:12,470
It's easy to convert the yeast to the mold by growth at room temperature on an enriched or not enriched media,

290
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,790
so like just plain old, several daughter not enriched.

291
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:24,200
It's not sad with just plain old sabra. Convert the yeast to the mycelial form.

292
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:35,410
So. All of you coffee drinkers, this fungus is associated with soils, which coffee is grown and the nine banded armadillo.

293
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,150
That's your unusual fat for the day. I always wondered why the nine banded armadillo,

294
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:47,110
but do they just exist in the same place geographically as it's restricted to Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela?

295
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:54,010
I'm not aware of any more reports showing it in other parts of South America, but that doesn't say that it's not other places.

296
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,420
Most the cases are in Brazil and in the areas in Brazil where it exists.

297
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:10,770
They're hot, humid summers, dry temperate winters, winters and annual rainfall of 20 to 30 or so inches of rain, which is a fair amount of rain.

298
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,740
Why do we see the mycelial form in soil it likes that acidic soil more than does the yeast form?

299
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:27,840
So the girl good coffee, I think what I've heard, we have to have acidic soil and this fungus like the soil also.

300
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,150
So the disease itself is characterized by a very slow,

301
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:41,400
progressive granulomatous changes in the mucosa of the head that would be the nose and the sinuses and other skin.

302
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:48,640
Really affects the lymphatic, it really affects the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal system or the skeletal systems,

303
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:55,640
as you might exist, expect something with spores acquired by the respiratory tract to worry about.

304
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,540
And but it will produce lesions in the lungs of about a third of the patients with progressive disease.

305
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,300
Now, if the patient doesn't have progressive disease, you might not see it at all.

306
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,930
Looks just like these other fungi I'm talking about today the systemic fungi.

307
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:17,770
None of them are contagious person to person. And there is more frequent disease in males and females.

308
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:22,870
Why? Because males are more likely to be working out in the field than females.

309
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:30,550
Now, with the change in the work, working climates and people who are doing work, this might change over time.

310
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,630
But right now it's more in males and females. Also, there's some research.

311
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:50,580
I think it's kind of cool. It supports the claim that estrogen may inhibit the transformation of the mycelial form into yeast, which is kind of cool.

312
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:58,530
So what does it do to a human it causes ulceration of the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose, and these are not little ulcers.

313
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,490
These are big, massive ulcers. And then it can spread through the lymphatic system.

314
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:14,970
It grows and invades more tissue. The pathologic ft pathologic features of tuxedoed of my closest in blast of my courses are similar to paradoxes.

315
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,160
So you can't just go on the pathologic features.

316
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,120
But if you see it in tissue, you can identify it in blast or my closest go back to class to my closest lesion,

317
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:34,650
the poor first in lymphoid tissue and extend the mucous membranes, and they produce localized to diffuse tissue necrosis in the lymph nodes.

318
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:41,880
And then if you have extensive involvement of the lymphoid and in limited occurrence, the GI tract,

319
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:51,100
that and bone and prostate, that's its parent, Hoxie, that separates parent Hoxie from Glasto and the others.

320
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,810
OK, but it's very difficult to rely just upon that.

321
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:03,570
You really need to demonstrate the fungus, either in culture microscopically or with a molecular test.

322
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,550
So there are no FDA approved serologic tests for this disease.

323
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:16,230
If you use a spreadsheet, you work with your laboratory, your lab Tory will work with public health, probably a direct call.

324
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:28,020
The CDC, the mycology labs at the CDC for assistance. Want to set up cultures and obviously by a licensed mycology laboratory.

325
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,010
But if you're doing clinical mycology, your license can't do it any other way.

326
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:38,460
You have to demonstrate the dimorphic nature, the mold form and the yeast form.

327
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,480
There are no and there are no commercially available FDA approved molecular reagents in the United States, but other countries have that.

328
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,690
So you can always send the specimens out.

329
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,590
You didn't hear me say that CDC can help.

330
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:06,060
The CDC is the answer to all this. And there are also some commercial laboratories that are known for outstanding Malay mycology work.

331
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:13,380
So this is it in tissue. And you can see how you've got the large mother yourself and the children attached around the sides,

332
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,680
and that is absolutely diagnostic for Paranaque city authorities.

333
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:24,090
Brazil answers. You can also see where they've split apart and you've got individual yeast cells in the tissue.

334
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:34,050
But this is diagnostic. Now here it is, and a lot of people in blue state and you can see multiple birds on this one.

335
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:40,770
But to hear will bite and then a blood coming off the bird and then more birds over here.

336
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:50,820
And here is the mold, and it doesn't look like anything else looks like Aspergillus penicillium kind of beige light brown,

337
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,410
fuzzy doesn't look like anything else.

338
00:38:52,410 --> 00:39:03,180
But then you see this and you see spores at the end of Short Kennedy and you think, Oh my gosh, I wonder what this is.

339
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,170
So here's an exam type question going to all this.

340
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:13,230
What is the expected microscopic appearance of his plasma in a battle sample?

341
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:24,300
A high b, b c pseudo HIV? These variables?

342
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:33,170
Maybe one. We want to take a guess.

343
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:40,590
Nope. It would be self, little self.

344
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:47,660
That's what we see in this department, and they have to be very.

345
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:58,070
So now we're going on to the opportunistic my courses, and these are separate in nature, they're founded in normal flora.

346
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:04,670
But if the host is immunosuppressed or has an accident, car accident, you know,

347
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:11,870
gets hit by a golf ball and hits the ground hard or something like that, they can get infected.

348
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:20,270
So these are all opportunistic, my Canada. But the candidiasis Cryptococcus is caused by Sydney of Horman's aspergillosis

349
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:27,020
close by Aspergillus species side of psychosis cause there is no single species,

350
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:35,360
the rise of pus and so on, then we have a few serious serious illnesses due to penicillin and so on.

351
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:44,960
But any fungus caused in nature can cause an opportunistic infection if the right situation occurs.

352
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:54,050
And generally there has to be a break in the patient's immunity, such as a cut or a large inhalation.

353
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:00,500
So we're going on to Canada, this is the most commonly encountered opportunistic, my closest worldwide,

354
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:06,410
we see it in people who are not immunocompromised, we see it in people who are immunocompromised.

355
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,820
Cellular immunity is tremendously important.

356
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:16,910
It protects against mucocutaneous candidiasis, candidiasis in the health of your mouth and so on,

357
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:25,700
and neutrophils protect against invasive Candida candidiasis. So there's also endogenous infection.

358
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:33,260
We have Candida in our bodies there, in our rectal specimens, there in vaginal specimens.

359
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,560
They are inside tissue. We have Candida in our bodies.

360
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:45,590
If a patient is put on broad term antibiotics, widescale broad term antibiotics or knocking out normal for walk kill,

361
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,670
they can get a Candida infection because chemo will knock out all your normal can knock out your normal.

362
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:58,580
For two, there is a lot of different species of Canada. The two most common are Candida albicans and Candida tropicales.

363
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,450
But here's just some other commonly one isolated ones.

364
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:09,230
And the list has grown. And I will tell you, Lusitania down in the bottom can be fairly resistant so it can cruise.

365
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:20,420
But generally we get a yeast from a significant site lung, blood, CSF tissue.

366
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:29,030
Physicians are going to ask for susceptibility testing, so morphologically they're all putting yeast, OK?

367
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:39,460
They may produce pseudo hyphy. They may produce two true high. I want to grow them on FDA Sevres Dexter Soccer white to creamy colored yeast colonies.

368
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,560
OK, which ones?

369
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:53,450
Major tubes Candida albicans and can linnean this germ to put a little bit of the isolate in a tube of serum incubated for a couple of hours?

370
00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:03,170
Take a drop out, put it out on a slide with a cover slip and you can see a root or a tail forming out of the yeast cell.

371
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:11,750
So how do we identify them? Well, the first group are old reactions, germ to fermentation, assimilation testing, assimilation testing,

372
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:20,240
meaning you were on different kinds of media that have different biochemical characteristics that some yeast in some some needs to know about.

373
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,860
But that has all been replaced by MALDI-TOF. We can, instead of having to culture yeast and do biochemical testing for two to three

374
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:36,240
weeks once we get girls to maldi-tof and get them identified same day or next day.

375
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:44,190
So here's a picture. Yeast and tissue, and you can see all the high forms that yeast can make.

376
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,670
You can see budding here. And can we identify this?

377
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:57,210
No, this is yeast. So how can that cause infections?

378
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:04,320
It attaches to our past, our skin, our cells are tissues and the germ tube.

379
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,490
If it's growing in your body and it's formed your tubes and you're put on too many antibiotics or you have something else going on with you,

380
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,760
the germ tube form is more adhesive than the cell.

381
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:22,980
So germ tubes are stickier can also adhere to plastic surfaces, so catheters, prosthetic mouth and so on.

382
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,030
So that's what we really worry about people who have prosthetic mouth and artificial joints and so on.

383
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:40,500
We really worry about them with yeast infections. They also produce protease and phospholipids, which can destroy cells.

384
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:48,780
So risk factors for Canada, pregnancy being old and that would be older than me and infancy.

385
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:58,510
Those are the risk factors. You can also have a huge risk of a yeast infection fight, trauma due to burn or infection,

386
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:07,360
particularly burn where the skin is destroyed, there's lots of area for use to get at some kind of logic problems.

387
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:13,630
People who have cellular immune deficiencies have a real problem with fungal infections,

388
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:18,130
particularly with these because we have mole in our bodies and that includes persons with

389
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,050
AIDS and then certain diseases are with some of them chronic granulomatous disease,

390
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,380
the aplastic anemia, anemia, leukemia, lymphoma.

391
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:37,300
But these are all this last group or types of cancer or other diseases where you know your cellular immunity is not working right.

392
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:45,010
Patients who have diabetes, hypoparathyroidism or Addison's disease are particularly prone to yeast infections.

393
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,950
That's why they tell the people with diabetes Check your sugar every day because you don't

394
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,780
want to get into one of those situations where you're prone to one of these diseases. And then there can be.

395
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,500
I have two genetic type of disease where people aren't doing anything wrong

396
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,270
and maybe take oral contraceptives or antibiotics prescribed by their doctor.

397
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,600
Steroids chemotherapy can affect catheters in something just the wrong.

398
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:15,950
He gets into the body and can set up shop.

399
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:26,600
So once again, I said most of these stories cutaneous or subcutaneous infection, so they could be oral vaginal necrosis, what is that?

400
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,080
That's an infection around the nail bed oracle necrosis.

401
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:39,510
OK, dermatitis, you were aware of and diaper rash.

402
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:48,900
There can be systemic manifestations also, and there can be a lot of it, you can see this list is meningitis is misspelled, I'm sorry about that.

403
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:58,800
I usually spell check everything, but it's misspelled. So systemic forms of candidiasis could be esophagitis pulmonary infection,

404
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,680
cystitis, Piolo in the kidneys and endocarditis, heart and myocarditis muscles.

405
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,610
And the list goes on peritonitis, a participle and and you can just read on.

406
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:15,490
And this list is just about every part of the body could have a use and feather Candida infection.

407
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:21,380
Next one. And then there's this chronic mucocutaneous who are so mucocutaneous for thinking

408
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,570
about the mouth or the nose and skin infection of skin and mucous membranes,

409
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:30,980
and we see it in patients who have impaired cellular cellular immunity,

410
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,800
whether it's native, they have a chronic illness that they've had for their entire life.

411
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,830
Or maybe they're on chemotherapy. That's depressing their cellular immunity.

412
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:52,910
We also see quite muted cutaneous candidiasis in patients who have an autosomal recessive trait or hypoparathyroidism or an iron deficiency.

413
00:47:52,910 --> 00:48:05,040
Even with all this, we don't see it that often. How do we diagnose candidiasis, get this person into a laboratory?

414
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,920
We're going to do a direct exam if it's a fluid specimen, we will try and concentrate and use.

415
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:18,030
Some of the concentrated specimen puts them on a slide with some potassium hydroxide, cover step and look for use.

416
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:24,150
But it is not just shoes. They have to be budding or pseudo hiphop if it's tissue.

417
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,750
We will tease it apart. We don't mean to grind it because we can tear.

418
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,080
The mycelial form of fiber will tease it apart a little bit.

419
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,980
But some of us like potassium hydroxide, copper slip and look for the same things we'll cultured on FDA,

420
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:45,540
Sabato's dexterous there and the routine bacterial aged me because they used to grow beautifully on blood sugar and top it over and so on.

421
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:53,000
What? We're very well on the committee. So and then we can do a detailed strategy to look for if the patient has managed.

422
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,920
And that and that is in the cell wall of the East.

423
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
And so we should not see very much, man.

424
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:11,790
But if they're infected, we may see a lot and a variety of different methods for doing it via a latex base and so on to a man.

425
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:17,640
What do we treat with, well, if it's cutaneous, the treatment is a little bit easier and if it's not,

426
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,710
if it's deeper, so we can treat with topical antifungal such as ketoconazole becomes all a nice day.

427
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,680
And if it's systemic, we need to go to the bigger guns.

428
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:37,880
And that might be after some day if the patient is also compromised or has very severe infection, or if you cancel or itraconazole.

429
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,690
And if the patient has chronic mucocutaneous disease around the mouth,

430
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,160
on the face and they can't get rid of it, nothing they've done can get rid of it.

431
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,040
They may have to have the Big Gun Antifungals Amphotericin B or who comes itraconazole.

432
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,100
And with the new Aizawl drugs can console itraconazole.

433
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:06,720
It has reduced the necessity of using Alkatiri's and B, except for the most serious types of infections.

434
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:14,100
Well, you know, some of these things have become resistant, so if you were thinking if you're talking about Canada,

435
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,030
Lusitania or do your mind be best not to use of terrorism,

436
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,920
be because they can be resistant or at least do have antifungal susceptibility testing

437
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:30,060
done because our resistance is increasing because it has been used way too much.

438
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:38,290
LeBron at cruising or more of a genesis and safari have all demonstrated fluconazole resistance, but none have realized what happens.

439
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,660
So this there's really a place for antifungal susceptibility testing.

440
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,670
Other these can become resistant with long term therapy or if the patient's immunosuppressive,

441
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,690
their immune system is not helping to get rid of the organism.

442
00:50:51,690 --> 00:51:06,420
So once again, susceptibility testing is is is needed and necessary for patients who have illnesses or may have some immunosuppression.

443
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:13,080
OK, we got some novel therapies, though, because in the last few years, we've got newer antifungal agents, so very cortisol.

444
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:19,230
This is a tracer and has enhanced activity against Candida Aspergillus in future.

445
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,240
Canada is fairly easy to treat compared to Aspergillus and Fusarium, which are very difficult to treat.

446
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,490
So this is wonderful. But we also have cast for fungal, which is any kind of candidate,

447
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,950
and his inhibits synthesis of beta one three glucan, which is in the fungal cell walls.

448
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:39,480
If found, I cannot make more cell walls, they can't live.

449
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,450
So this is a great antifungal and it's approved for refractory or Aspergillus and can

450
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:51,210
infections that are very difficult to treat patients are not responding to therapy.

451
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:59,370
Now, my favorite organism, which I donated many years of my life to our hosts,

452
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:09,090
the only people who get infected with active disease with senior Forman's and an underlying cellular immune deficiency.

453
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:17,010
OK. And that could be AIDS could be a lymphoma, could be another type of cancer or some other immunodeficiency.

454
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,480
It is acquired from the environment. OK, and how do we get it?

455
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,550
We get by inhalation of yeast etiologic agent Cryptococcus neoformans.

456
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:31,470
So when I went up in that clocktower, I was scared to death.

457
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:37,330
But when your major professor tells you to do something, you do it.

458
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:46,490
OK, general property is a Cryptococcus neoformans, it likes soil and it likes bird droppings, why nitrogen in the birth droppings?

459
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:54,060
OK, that's why it likes bird droppings. It's an encapsulated needs to use India to demonstrate the capsule.

460
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,400
Now, if you're going in culture, you may not have much of a capsule,

461
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:04,020
but when it comes from a bird or a human, they'll have a much larger capsule capsule in soil.

462
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,230
Somehow, this kind of heavy. What does it look like?

463
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,470
A thug? A creamy colonic might be kind of new.

464
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:17,100
Quite the capsule that gives it that viewpoint characteristic on said several extra of.

465
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:24,540
Well, how does it cause disease? Well, it has the capsule, as I said, and the pollies or macrophages can't get around that capsule.

466
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,490
It's slippery. They can't get around it to engulf it.

467
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:36,750
So that's why the UN encapsulated forms of severe forms are much easier to treat because you don't have to worry about the capsule.

468
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:43,440
It also has diphenyl oxidase, which can increase the pathogenicity,

469
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,320
and you can demonstrate this by growing it on birdseed a cafe gas, meaning the colonies will be black.

470
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:56,980
And it can also grow very well at thirty seven degrees, not just out of nature, but at 37 degrees.

471
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:03,610
So if you've ever wondered what an ending slide looks like, we have one here in the upper left side,

472
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:10,260
although none of these can you say this is positive for senior politics because I don't see anybody.

473
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:17,070
And I told Mike McGinnis this one, he put that on, Dr. Francis. So you took.

474
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:24,450
Yes, you have to see body, have to see body. But this is certainly characteristic over the lack of blood and characteristic for the large capsule.

475
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:34,450
This is what we see with the music mainstream. This is a brain section and the musical remains dies in the capsule so you can see it.

476
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:44,220
So here you can see it here. And here's a long graham scene and you can see these large cells, but you can't call them used because there is no body.

477
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:52,770
Remember, you have to see body. And then this is one of my favorite medias.

478
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:57,330
This is birdseed organ. You make it with the same bird seed you put on your bird seed.

479
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:04,860
But you know, bird feeder, bird feeders and Cryptococcus neoformans when you have involved to make this,

480
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,390
we have big bags of birdseed in the lab to make media.

481
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:18,170
But Cryptococcus, the Afghans will turn brown on this medium. And so you can tell right away that senior farmers.

482
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:24,670
Also, Category II, which is the subspecies of neoformans will do it, but there's just it's so cool.

483
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:30,190
OK, what does this do to bodies can cause a pulmonary disease.

484
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,940
The pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic.

485
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:42,780
Many people don't know they've been infected or they can have a flu like illness where they can have full-blown pneumonia.

486
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,560
And then in some patients who have an altered immune response,

487
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,440
whether it's due to cancer chemotherapy or they have an immunodeficiency of some sort the disease can disseminate,

488
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:59,760
and this is where it gets really bad, generally disseminated into meningitis, which could be acute or chronic or both.

489
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,890
You can get a cryptic coma, which is like a large lesion, like a cancelation.

490
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:10,500
You have skin lesions or other forms, so it can be anywhere in the body. But mostly it likes the meninges.

491
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:16,380
Now you can get it out of blood cultures also. So it's something that we all look for in the laboratory.

492
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:24,200
We see a window Abrahamson with the largest. We're going to do some tests to determine right away what it is.

493
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:33,740
So samples to have the lab test, spinal fluid, that's number one, sputum any aspirate from a skin lesion,

494
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:41,670
if you get any fluid out of that, send it into the lab to be culture. We can do a direct exam either ending or a cow before they both will.

495
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:47,090
We'll pick up senior hormones, culture and on subject stronger and stronger.

496
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:52,940
If you have the brincidofovir order in your laboratory, sometimes it's hard to get it commercially.

497
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:59,540
There is serology for CV and performance. It's detection of the capsule antigen in the spinal fluid so that the labs are

498
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,030
very used to doing the rapid latex elimination for severe forms of spinal fluid,

499
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:14,250
and it can also be done on serum. So there's a lot of ways that this disease can be diagnosed.

500
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:21,150
Was it treated with our friend after some B plus plus cytosine and then they give

501
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:25,080
the patient this for and depending on how the patient does at least six weeks,

502
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,400
two months, maybe three months, and then they'll cut down on the after some b dose.

503
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:36,870
So they're less side effects and maybe even keep the patient on lifelong Fukuyama's all prophylaxis, depending on how the patient does.

504
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:45,370
And that's done in particularly with patients who have AIDS because their immune system is is is harmed.

505
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:52,150
OK, now to Aspergillosis, it is most common form is Aspergillus fumigatus.

506
00:57:52,150 --> 00:58:00,160
It's a lovely, grayish green from this mold, but who gets the aspergillosis people who are immunocompromised.

507
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,450
So if they're immuno suppressed, whether it's due to diabetes mellitus and with diabetes,

508
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:13,030
you can have an exaggerated infection due to inhalation of scores or you have a host who has a lot of allergies.

509
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:17,980
They're very topia. You can have inhalation of spores and get it hypersensitivity reaction.

510
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,760
Have you been inhaled?

511
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:27,790
A lot of spores or what's even worse is ingestion of products that are contaminated with Aspergillus toxins, and the toxins are very bad.

512
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:35,500
There's a micro toxin is a hepatocellular cellular, and a colon can also cause colon carcinoma.

513
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,380
So this is this can be a very, very bad disease,

514
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,880
particularly with Aspergillus fumigatus and the other species of Aspergillus that causes much problem.

515
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:53,380
Human hemodialysis is the worst one. So general features like the soil that like the air and what does the house it

516
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:59,530
cause disease gets inhaled or there's a cut or a scrape from the environment.

517
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:04,640
It starts growing as it's growing, it produces phospholipase, which breaks down tissue.

518
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:17,840
And allows it to spread the tissues that Aspergillus really likes are the veins or has vascular invasion because thrombi and infarcts and bleeding.

519
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:24,860
What does it look like on culture plates, a powdery mold and it may be kind of green screen.

520
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,990
And what if when you look at a fungus on a culture plate, not a but a mold?

521
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:38,780
If it's colored, those are the spores. So we would look for a grayish green color, but the color spores varies from one species to another.

522
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,320
Microscopically, we see separate hyphy and dichotomous branching.

523
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:52,890
Dichotomous branching is this. You branch equal just like this when you're sitting saying thumbs up or something, you're branching like this.

524
00:59:52,890 --> 01:00:02,280
OK. And I can also microscopically, you may see vesicles in the tissue, and if it's going on on culture,

525
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,400
plates may see different forms, microcredit, macro, Canady and so on.

526
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:18,300
So here is an Aspergillus flavors, and it's differentiated from fumigatus by how many spores around the outside and how many,

527
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,890
but how extensive the spores are around the outside and the size of the steel head.

528
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:30,160
Now here we have Aspergillus mycelium and you can see that they are separated.

529
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,410
You can see I can see a couple of places where they are supported and they branch once again.

530
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:38,850
And then here is the part in black and white is much more difficult to see to be able to sit on your computers,

531
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:49,910
the sport of heads taken with phase contrast. So clinical manifestations of aspergillosis, allergic aspergillosis,

532
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:55,880
most common kind sneeze, cough, headache, all the signs of allergy can cause asthma,

533
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,420
can cause bronchial and then from there can cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

534
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,040
where the patient needs to be treated because they're having such a bad allergy reaction.

535
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:13,850
There can be noninvasive, local kind conversations, so you have a fungus ball growing in the lungs.

536
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:20,960
Yeah, or the nasal sinuses you can have of my closest words in the outer ear.

537
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:32,920
OK, you're going to want to call my closest in the nail and horribly eye infections where mostly the patient will lose sight in that eye.

538
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:40,040
Depending on if it's corny old time or if it's introduced into IQ, there, of course, is the worst form.

539
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:46,320
Next slide. Invasive aspergillosis can be pulmonary in the lungs, patients immunocompromised.

540
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:53,300
Yeah, you mean like an actual allergic reaction? Or let me go back, let me go back.

541
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,850
The previous. OK.

542
01:01:55,850 --> 01:02:04,250
You said what we're seeing the actual our viewers in a COVID like symptoms people have like actual no allergic reactions to Aspergillus.

543
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:12,860
Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't make that clear. OK, invasive aspergillosis can be pulmonary, which is devastating or disseminated,

544
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,680
which is even more devastating in one disseminated to the gastrointestinal tissues,

545
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:27,260
brain, liver, kidney, heart, eye and skin surgery and more surgery and lots of chemotherapy antifungal chemotherapy.

546
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:36,500
But to have it be that invasive, oftentimes the patients have other things going on, and the outcome may not be very good.

547
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:45,120
And then, of course, they produce toxins, also the mycotoxins. So how do we diagnosis aspergillosis?

548
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,100
Well, we need samples in the laboratory.

549
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:56,070
Generally, we get sputum might be bronchial alveolar tissue or fluid and other types of tissue that might be infected.

550
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:59,460
We're going to do a direct exam, although we take the tissue the same way with anything else,

551
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:06,030
we tease it apart and put it a drop of potassium hydroxide on a slide with cover slip.

552
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:14,150
Let the potassium hydroxide digest any tissue that are on there so we can see if there are hyphy there also.

553
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:18,750
And we're going to look for septic fees across walls in Canadian sputum.

554
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:28,260
But. If it's not as if it's in tissue or invades, we'll see the high, but no spores, no Canadian.

555
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,860
Will Cultural accept extra soccer with him without cyclohexane lied to cyclohexane,

556
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:38,580
I won't reduce the amount of other growth of other organs, other bacteria.

557
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:46,080
We can do allergies if it's an allergic reaction, we can look for specific iJie in serum.

558
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:58,260
If it's an invasive infection, many, many laboratories can do detection of blocked them in an antigen in serum or bronchial alley alveolar fluids.

559
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:07,110
And that's that's a very handy test to say, does this patient have invasive aspergillosis?

560
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:13,320
What do we trade with? If it's an allergic reaction, steroids, but then of course you get steroids, what happens?

561
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:20,910
You're reducing the immune response. So that has to be titrated very carefully and patient as we watch very closely.

562
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:29,540
If it's an aspirin diploma in tissue and if symptomatic surgery followed by a terrorist, be.

563
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:36,270
If there's a local superficial infection we can treat with my Stettin, which generally we use for yeast infections,

564
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:40,820
though we can treat it as localized if there is an invasive infection.

565
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:49,700
The area needs to be to breed it and then after some being itraconazole and most patients don't do very well with this,

566
01:04:49,700 --> 01:05:00,800
there's a very high mortality rate. We're getting down there because I got my process.

567
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:07,460
So these are the fungi that don't have cross walls. OK, because I got my kids, no crossbows are very human.

568
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,660
Fossils, right? Oppose the rise of import and move.

569
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:16,010
Those are the three genera. Where do they exist?

570
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:21,050
Air, water and soil. Just like everything else. What are the risk factors?

571
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:30,290
Diabetic ketoacidosis person with diabetes and heart keeping it in control, state and immunosuppression?

572
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:35,960
How is a person infected inhalation of the spores? Very simple.

573
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:46,460
What tissues would be infected? Vascular. So the veins, arteries and perhaps even the heart you can get through by, you can get in infarct,

574
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:53,590
which kills off the tissue, and that can be bleeding very, very serious.

575
01:05:53,590 --> 01:06:03,490
So he can cause infections in many different places, of course, the one of the most serious is rhinoceros cerebral.

576
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:07,270
So it starts in the nose, goes to the parasite and apparently the sinuses.

577
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:11,560
And then from there it can expand into the eyes, the brain and the meninges.

578
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:25,360
They can also cause orbital cellulitis. He can be treated with antifungals, but basically the only real hope that patients have is surgery.

579
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,580
And yes, it may result in losing an eye or other tissue.

580
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:36,430
But it's a very bad season. There's a thoracic infection.

581
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:43,690
Pulmonary lesions. There can be a in the we have to get the necrotic tissue out of there and hopefully you're able to reset the infected tissues.

582
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:49,270
And all this is done covering with Henry Ford Allegiance. And there can be local infections.

583
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:53,420
There can be a post traumatic kidney infection from trauma elsewhere in the body.

584
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,430
It's traveled to the kidneys and then unfortunately, there can be a skin infection.

585
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:07,420
If the patient's had a burn or other surgery that has destroyed some tissue.

586
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:14,900
So this is an example of a person with orofacial psychosis in you, it's very hard on your face,

587
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:22,240
it's very hard to determine what's in this patient's mouth because it has all been destroyed and tissues being destroyed by the fungus.

588
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,090
Now this did not happen overnight. This happened.

589
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:30,670
This takes a long time to get to this stage, but this is what can happen if it's not treated appropriately.

590
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:39,940
You can even see the patients in surgery over here. But it wasn't enough.

591
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:47,440
OK. Because I got my closest. How are we going to diagnose it? They have samples in the lab sputum.

592
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,740
A biopsy of the Pyrenees or sinuses. Whatever you can get to the lab, we will look at and we will see what's there.

593
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,300
We'll do a direct exam just like we do other direct exams. If it's a tissue will tease it apart.

594
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,800
We don't brain tissue for funding because we can destroy the mycelium, tease it apart.

595
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,280
And we look for non cepted. So no cross walls, ribbon like hyphae.

596
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,140
So they get broader and narrower and narrower, narrower, which branch at right angles.

597
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:22,030
And they may actually form the big speranza of the tissue. Also, if they're real happy, cultured on, said Estacada, it looks like cotton candy.

598
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:29,200
So this is the high fee for Zagel, my seat. And you can see it's very broad, there's no crosswalk or very rear cross.

599
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,710
Also, the hyphae can be very broad, they can be very narrow. It just depends on what they're doing and they can grow in every direction.

600
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:42,100
So here it is with a stay inside. Here it is with. And I can't wait or something like that.

601
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:50,750
And you can see that this area is just full of hyphy and there is no crosswalk.

602
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:59,790
What's it treated with surgery? I like to breed as much as you can get out and then Amphotericin B, and yes,

603
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:05,700
it has a very high mortality rate because most people may have some immunodeficiency

604
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:17,460
or may have had a very extensive accident and the fungus got into the wrong place.

605
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,170
So I had to put Pneumocystis cranium here because it's now a fungus,

606
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,320
which I don't like this to be a parasite because of the parasite, now that's it for this.

607
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:35,550
It's based on nucleic acid and biochemical analysis. Both those healthy children are exposed by age four, but you didn't know that.

608
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:44,280
So if a person is immunocompromised because almost everybody is exposed to this, they can get reactivation pneumonia.

609
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:57,330
And this happens that this was first noted when HIV became prevalent and we could see people who had low CD4 counts less than 200 per microliter,

610
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:04,020
and they had Pneumocystis and they hadn't been anywhere. They hadn't done anything because it was in their body all the time.

611
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:12,120
Pedes in pediatric patients, we can see for these patients who have even a normal to low CD4 count,

612
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,950
that doesn't happen as frequently and as in immunosuppressed adults.

613
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:23,850
OK. What's it treated with? What you can prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfa tempi that hasn't actually

614
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:29,400
turned out from silver will reduce the incidence of Pneumocystis occurring.

615
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:40,310
I don't like that in your backyard. I co-occurring. So here it is with a doomsday, you can see they look like yourself, but they're not.

616
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,970
Well, maybe they are since it's now from that,

617
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:48,770
but you can see the nucleus in each one physical before they light up beautifully under California to do for any fungal infection.

618
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:57,780
And here's a DFA specific for Pneumocystis. And here at the University of Michigan,

619
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:06,480
the laboratory has developed their own assay targeting the genes encoding Pneumocystis large subunit mitochondrial RNA,

620
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:14,460
which I think is very, very cool. They can do respiratory specimens, which will be digested and concentrated and then tested on this PCR,

621
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:22,500
and it's a conventional PCR with gel based detection. Very, very cool.

622
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:35,680
Another exam type question. Play tricks that nations capsule antigen and CSF and serum as the diagnostic test for which organism?

623
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:41,470
There'd be no Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Cryptococcus.

624
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:46,030
I thought there'd be, yeah, d as in dog. OK.

625
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:52,450
I think that's it. Boom. I did it. And it's like, Listen, I don't have.

626
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:56,200
That is a lot of material. I'm just a tremendous amount of hero.

627
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:03,170
Please, please, please read the material into the textbook because there's no way that I could cover all of it.

628
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:08,350
Even though I tried, and you will need that for reinforcement.

629
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:16,530
So please study that textbook questions. OK.

630
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:23,850
Is there anyone here in this room who didn't get a copy their test back on the first Test because it brought in with me, I'm trying to give them out.

631
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,990
Come see me. OK, any questions?

632
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:34,170
Comments anybody doing anything fun over the weekend? Nobody.

633
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:38,700
OK, I'll be walking my dog. OK?

634
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:46,782
Have a good weekend.
