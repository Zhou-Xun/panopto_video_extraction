1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:25,389
You know. Okay.

2
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,830
So again, we're going to follow the order of the signup sheet, which is again posted on today's campus page.

3
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:44,020
So you mean you're up first? I am not going to put my hand up when it's, you know, 30 seconds or 3 minutes.

4
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,710
Instead, I will only put my hand up if you've reached the four minute mark.

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,890
So it's time to wrap up. So again, introduce yourselves and yeah, we're good to go.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:06,280
So learning how to walk and I'm going to talk to you about the heart disease risk and the problem.

7
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:16,060
Ann Arbor, Michigan. And I also introduce a program which I found some potential solutions.

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,219
So the heart disease is about multiple conditions.

9
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,260
All of park as well as a heart like the heart attract heart failure,

10
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:34,450
stroke and arrhythmia and a risk factor which has a multiplicity of such as diabetes,

11
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:41,860
obesity and so social determinants such as in Congress and individual lifestyles.

12
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,760
Our vision problem. In Michigan, we found out the heart disease is the leading cause of the diet.

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,510
So for us to Iraq and the the table shows.

14
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:06,790
So like now as the heart has a tendency which higher have the higher mortality due to the cardiovascular disease all called CVD.

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:15,280
And so and also there's another study found among the young adults in the developed country.

16
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:26,370
So but now we all have the highest incidence rate of the male cardio infarction, followed by all black female, white male.

17
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:38,980
And so let's see now and then another consideration of also CVD risk as a sort of the term determinant to which has a housing.com.

18
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:51,760
I know there is a they have found the discovery indicators occurrences are decreased house income the increase also prevalence of heart attacks.

19
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,100
That's the solution for our Washtenaw County.

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,120
I think I saw her house housing a lot.

21
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,800
Program hands had successfully empowered determined in L.A. County in North Carolina.

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:27,580
And this program is a path to a pact for research reduce the CVD risk through a combination of the research and the intervention of the community.

23
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,660
Well, which includes understand the individual soldier that you call make the determinant,

24
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:45,730
seek substantial capital outcomes, supports the multiple level tent and so promotes the nutritional education.

25
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,569
And the results of this program is called Hands to Promote the House.

26
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,170
The options are my new in three local restaurants,

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:08,290
so they also provide some amendments of how to pension amendment all for love in the hospital also developed so close off of his plan.

28
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:17,169
The nutritional activities remove the sugar sweetened beverage and finally lower the fresh food price through the promoting

29
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:28,390
small markets lunch and the helping subsidized as a cause of fresh food has patients and community members and since you.

30
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:58,390
Thank you. Thank you. It's money.

31
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,390
And it's my honor to be here in our Ann Arbor Health Department meeting.

32
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,570
And it goes up to the our advocate and nutritional program.

33
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,630
It's called gardening interventions.

34
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:21,050
So first, let's see our community priorities on insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits for children aged 2 to 2.

35
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,870
Eating in an hour is a leading cause of childhood obesity.

36
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,660
And from the condition from USDA dietary guidelines.

37
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:38,640
So far, the amount of fruit and vegetables children should eat ranged from 1 to 2 cups for rose and 1 to 3 cups for vegetables.

38
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,560
So to sum up is about 2 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day.

39
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:52,950
But you can see from the table and our 18%, 18.4% of children can do are to one.

40
00:05:52,950 --> 00:06:00,090
Servings of vegetables are fruits a day, which is below the USDA dietary guidelines recommended level.

41
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,710
This is a larger percentage that even than a figure in the state of Michigan.

42
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,840
And for our research,

43
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:15,120
children who regularly eat vegetables are more likely to develop healthy eating habits as adults and are less likely to be obese.

44
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:26,129
So here is the program. The goal of this program is to increase the vegetable and fruit consumption of children through

45
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,930
school based gardening interventions in combination with nutritional nutrition education.

46
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,109
So far, the gardening interventions in program, they provide children with hands on experience blending,

47
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,470
growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables in an effort to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables.

48
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,440
And these interventions must include at least one of the following outside gardens.

49
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,270
Container gardens, micro farms, or other alternative gardening methods.

50
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,920
And for the interventions they might. May also include education or parental consent.

51
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:09,060
They may be employment or the care and education settings, schools, afterschool programs, our communities.

52
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:16,380
Here is a systematic review of this program and this program.

53
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,150
This reveal tested the effects of our gardening intervention.

54
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:32,100
So for a subset of 14 studies that examined these interventions conducted with children, it was found that consumption of vegetables increased.

55
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:38,490
Why a fruit consumption did not change and that interventions including nutrition, education,

56
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,220
addition, in addition to gardening activities, were more effective than gardening activities alone.

57
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,140
So based on this research, the CPS staff recommended gardening interventions.

58
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,680
Got it. Thank you. References.

59
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:26,680
Thank you. Is it their first name?

60
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay, I. Yeah.

61
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,630
For most of them, that's. I just put your first name at the beginning of your bio.

62
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:46,820
Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. The program that I looked at was called Live Well Viable and which was conducted in Rhode Island.

63
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
And my needs assessment was on food access in Detroit.

64
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,280
And I thought this program could be applied in Detroit very successfully.

65
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,800
Food access is a big issue in Detroit because of transportation, people lacking cars,

66
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:13,700
and then Detroit residents lag behind people in in the rest of the state in so many other issues, housing, jobs and all of that.

67
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:21,320
So it's really challenging for them to access healthy food and they lag behind.

68
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,500
The statistics in Wayne County show that they like way behind the rest of the state in food security and food access.

69
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,740
There's been recent developments in the last six, eight years that have made the situation worse.

70
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,120
Stores leaving the area, SNAP authorized stores being reduced, less kids in school lunches.

71
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,230
And as I mentioned, Wayne County has a really high food insecurity rate compared to the rest of the state.

72
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:59,750
In general, lack of food access causes all kinds of health issues, CVD and hypertension, higher rates of mortality, diabetes, other things.

73
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
There's a mental there's mental effects like stress and depression, eating disorders.

74
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:12,320
And being living in a food swamp also leads to higher rates of morbidity and hospital admissions, especially for diabetics.

75
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,430
I don't need to tell this class what the benefits of SNP so that I'll say I'm not going to spend time on that, but that's all a factor as well.

76
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:34,400
So this hour, this program was in our city where they had bi weekly indoor markets set up over the course of 12 months for an intervention group.

77
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,419
They had cooking demonstrations, tasting, they tastings.

78
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,250
They coordinated with SNAP benefits.

79
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:48,410
They were sure to be stacking up foods that the local culture that are culturally relevant that people would relate to.

80
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,760
And then on top of that, they provided educational materials which turn out to be really helpful.

81
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,020
They had a huge turnout of over 80% shopping at these markets.

82
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,310
90% found the prices good. One of the important outcomes was more than three cups of additional produce was eaten weekly.

83
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,670
And also the participants from all the educational material reported learning a lot about healthy eating.

84
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,960
So that was awesome. Why is this good for Detroit?

85
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,310
71% of Detroiters want better access to healthy food.

86
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,800
I consider grocery access very important.

87
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:29,090
There's a lot of partners in Detroit, like urban farming and the greening of Detroit and other groups that are already kind of on this bandwagon.

88
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,240
That could be great partners in getting something like this going.

89
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,260
The conditions in the remote area of Rhode Island where this was rolled out were had a similar poverty situation to Detroit.

90
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,379
So it's a similar setting. And then we have stuff we get we have the likelihood of support from the government

91
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,730
and other private funds that would love to be on board with this kind of project.

92
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,420
So I think it would be a good fit and this feature something.

93
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,510
This morning, Ypsilanti City Council. And, you know, I'm here to talk to you about the access in Ypsilanti and the implementation of it.

94
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,690
All right. So the problem and see, Ypsilanti is a relatively low income community.

95
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,730
Its annual median income is about half of what the state of Michigan is.

96
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,379
And it has a higher unemployment rate than the state of Michigan at 8.6%, compared to 6% in about 30% of Washtenaw County.

97
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:54,250
Residents are living below the poverty line, compared to Michigan's nearly 14% and about 10.4% of Washtenaw County is experiencing food insecurity.

98
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:03,459
And you combine that low income with higher unemployment, there is less food expenditure for less expenditure for healthy food options,

99
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,570
which this lack of healthy food options leads to higher risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes,

100
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,860
cardiovascular disease, obesity, and also symptoms of depression and anxiety.

101
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,100
How we can help mitigate this issue with the implementation of education.

102
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,759
It's a mobile farmer's market that serves lower income and food insecure communities.

103
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,270
And it's a partnership between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a nonprofit organization known as Community Nutrition Partnership.

104
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,030
It helps to improve it hopes to improve diets through school building and addresses multiple aspects of the food environment.

105
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,910
And it helps to improve hopes to improve self efficacy in finding, buying and preparing fruits and vegetables.

106
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,120
The Virginia operates a minimum ten months out of the year and it uses in-season and locally sourced produce.

107
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,060
It helps it does this by providing nutrition education on how to best use the produce that they offer at their markets.

108
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,540
And they also offer cooking demonstrations, recipes and tastes.

109
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,080
And they also accept any food benefit incentive programs such as SNAP, ABC and anything that's local to the community,

110
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,209
and also offer a bundling model to allow more sales at a lower price and to increase

111
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:22,000
exposure to a wider variety of sorts of vegetables to their participants to measure success.

112
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,370
There was a randomized study with 12 communities in North Carolina. After six months follow up the intervention group.

113
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,920
There was an increase in fruit vegetable consumption from 2.8 cups a day to 3.6 cups a day,

114
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,780
and there were reported improvements in self efficacy from the participants.

115
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,600
Participants reported being more confident and being able to put vegetables in the snacks throughout

116
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,530
the day and to be able to make new dishes out of vegetables that were available to them.

117
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,690
Here's a quote from the study that says Veggie Man has the potential to become an effective,

118
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,400
scalable intervention for improving professional consumption in lower income communities.

119
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:06,160
And with all of this in mind, Veggie Van would make a great addition into the community of Ypsilanti by bridging that gap in food access,

120
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:16,030
by providing lower and lower cost fruits and vegetables that are locally sourced and in turn then also lowering chronic disease risk.

121
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,530
That is my one pager. Thank you very much.

122
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,810
Okay. So I'm sorry. I also have a sore throat. So.

123
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:49,990
Yeah, I'm Ina Espinosa, and you all are the Detroit County Health Department and other professionals affiliated with hospitals in Detroit.

124
00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:00,160
Okay, so a brief overview. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and in Detroit, Michigan.

125
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,190
And as you can see on the figure one to the right,

126
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:11,709
it shows that it shows the total CVD death rate per 100,000 older adults from 2020 18 to 2020 in Detroit,

127
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:19,720
Michigan and black or African-American had the highest average of about 22,000 deaths.

128
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,220
And this is roughly twice the national rate of 1300.

129
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,400
So some risk factors of CVD include hypertension, hyper local, you know,

130
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,180
personal health care provider access, smoking or tobacco use and limited access to healthy foods.

131
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,310
So who is most at risk? Black or African Americans? They make up 76.6% of the population.

132
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,060
And among all races, they have the lowest medium and median income of 34,825.

133
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:02,740
They're also least likely for bachelor's degree and have less than 50% of them are employed.

134
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:12,940
And a lot of them rely on public transportation and are experiencing spatial segregation and are pushed to the outskirts of Detroit.

135
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:22,570
And among all races, they are most they are most likely to eat fast food on a daily basis.

136
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,979
So the intervention I chose was the Franklin Cardiovascular Health Program and frankly,

137
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,610
Franklin County, MI, and this was within a 40 year period, basically a cohort study,

138
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:45,610
and it included multiple data collections and it was an integrated intervention with the Franklin Memorial Hospital staff,

139
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:56,480
basically a lot of volunteer nurses, and the goal was to educate residents on CVD and identify potential risk factors at the individual level.

140
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:07,300
So some strategies they use motivational interviewing and lab worker lab workups as screening.

141
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:14,590
So they would take their cholesterol and blood glucose and identify if they had certain risk factors and follow up with them.

142
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:25,180
So they would basically use this through their electronic medical system and implement like education and convention of brochures,

143
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,270
handouts within those records.

144
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:35,769
And they worked with local institutions and small groups and eventually the spread through word of mouth.

145
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,070
And they recruited a lot of volunteers within the community to advocate for this.

146
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:47,020
And within those brochures and handouts, they've minimized barriers by using simple language and a lot of visuals.

147
00:18:52,950 --> 00:19:00,540
Okay. So more than about half the population was evaluated and they saw improvement in health care, access,

148
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:08,370
hypertension and lipid control, a decrease in hospitalization charges and an increase in smoking cessation.

149
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,140
And again, with involvement, they got everyone in the local community.

150
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,390
They even got the University of Maine to advocate for this. And these two titles are switched.

151
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:28,010
So the Affordable Care Act was actually inspired by this and implemented similar interventions across the nation.

152
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,230
And they would do this for CVD and other chronic diseases such as Type two diabetes.

153
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,900
And in terms of cost, it was very was it too costly?

154
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,570
And it was because it was integrated within the hospital treatment.

155
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:52,370
And therefore it could be beneficial to other socio economically disadvantaged areas such as the city of Detroit.

156
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:59,720
So if we start this intervention now, a couple of decades later, we may see a decrease of CVD prevalence in older adults.

157
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:39,920
Thank you. Hello, Miss Christiana.

158
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,030
And today I would like to present to you the Washtenaw County Health Department and Board of

159
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:50,630
Commissioners Project Staff a promising intervention to combat food insecurity in the city of Ypsilanti.

160
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,840
As you well know, Ypsilanti has grown throughout recent years.

161
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,120
However, food insecurity due to income disparities is still a major health concern in the city.

162
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,750
If you've ever walked through the city of Ypsilanti, it signs of food insecurity are clear, quite literally speaking.

163
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,800
Here is a quote from a local billboard just last week reading The cost of food is so high, it is cheaper to eat money.

164
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,230
Food insecurity is defined as insufficient funds or other resources to obtain food.

165
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,299
This is a major concern in Ypsilanti,

166
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:32,890
where the median household income is 43% less than that of Washtenaw County Ypsilanti's poverty rate is over, double that of a county and state.

167
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:42,999
The adult population of Ypsilanti is made up primarily of college and graduate students who account for roughly 80% of residents and 60% of Ypsilanti.

168
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,140
Residents living below the poverty line have at least some college education.

169
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,870
From these, we can deduce that much of the food insecure population of Ypsilanti is students.

170
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,280
And it's also important to note that the city is a large minority population that is roughly 30% black.

171
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,310
Cities with large minority populations are known to be at greater risk of food insecurity due to systemic racism.

172
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,130
The solution to combatting food insecurity in Ypsilanti is Project Dash.

173
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,020
Project Dash. It's a collaborative initiative between DoorDash and Feeding America,

174
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:26,170
which provides meal and food delivery services to local food banks and community based organizations.

175
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,310
And it's the landing project that has partnered with the Food Bank Council of Michigan

176
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,070
to provide services through food to others and growing health care health clinic,

177
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,430
rather.

178
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:48,250
This initiative provides this for an initiative, provides local food pantries and free meals, free meal programs, access to DoorDash platforms,

179
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:57,130
which includes delivery services and online ordering services so clients can directly order and get meals delivered to their homes.

180
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,350
This program naturally targets students who often use online ordering and delivery

181
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,000
services and may have limited transportation and time to access local providers.

182
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,510
The predicted outcomes of Project Dash are improvements in food access,

183
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,560
improving academic performance and education attainment by reducing student hunger and food insecurity related stress,

184
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:29,270
reducing reliance on fast food by providing access to healthy foods, and most importantly, increasing food security.

185
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,360
By improving food access and providing a culturally appropriate way to obtain food without fear of stigma.

186
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,989
Since its inception in 2018,

187
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:47,400
the project has delivered an estimated 50 million meals to people and it has been proven an effective tool in northern Illinois,

188
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:57,150
where 30 to 35% of clients at a local food bank received their food donations to their home through Project Dash.

189
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,090
A crossover randomized trial was conducted at California State University in 2019,

190
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:10,140
which investigated the use of meal and grocery delivery services among college students, an effort to reduce the insecurity.

191
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,569
The study found that 50% of students experienced an increase in food security when given

192
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,850
just $40 per month and either groceries or meals through online delivery services.

193
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,610
The qualitative analysis of the study reported that participants consistently mentioned having increased

194
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,400
access to healthier food options with grocery delivery and convenience and using the meal delivery service.

195
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,379
These data provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of food delivery as a tool

196
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,790
to increase food security among adults in Ypsilanti and improve health outcomes.

197
00:24:43,440 --> 00:25:14,590
Thank you for your time and consideration to project. All right.

198
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,770
My name is Amy Gutman, and I did my project at Food Access, Feeding and Arbor.

199
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,970
So the goal of my program is to increase food access.

200
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,810
And there's concerns about the drop out of the diet.

201
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,899
Currently,

202
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:38,660
10.4% of the population is food insecure in Washington County is also a high based food consumption and high sugar sweetened beverage consumption.

203
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:51,470
The frequency of eating to times out of fast food per week by race white is 11.5%, black 19.7 and Asian 15.4%.

204
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,520
And the lack of access to nutritious foods is a big concern.

205
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:05,630
So only 73.8% of people never have problems getting fruits and vegetables because of the distance to the grocery store.

206
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:12,050
And that leaves 26.2% who sometimes are always have started with that.

207
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:18,110
So if you don't know already, the vegetable is the best thing for the community.

208
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,570
It is a mobile delivery service that accepts SNAP and other local initiatives.

209
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:32,660
They sometimes take old vehicles like an ambulance and convert it into a veggie van, which is cool.

210
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:41,510
They make sure they provide culturally relevant foods and they have reduced costs compared to the market rates.

211
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
And all of these products are fresh, high quality fruits and vegetables.

212
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,489
And along with just giving out these fruits and vegetables, they also provide educational materials.

213
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:59,210
So you should license cooking demonstrations, recipe cards and just tips and tricks to use all the products they're getting.

214
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,800
So the outcome is people in the community of VEGGIE are eating 3.6 cups,

215
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:14,030
fruits and vegetables today per day, versus only about 2.8% of the users without that veggie can.

216
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,020
And they found it easier to make a veggie meal what they had on hand,

217
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,470
along with cooking meals that their families eat and eating more fruits and vegetables and snacks.

218
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,080
And that is my one picture. Thank you.

219
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:58,360
Washington, D.C. Hello, Ann Arbor Board of Education.

220
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,090
Just go with it. I do. I'm Jen Hassan.

221
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,190
I'm an MBA student here at the School of Public Health, and I would like to introduce you to digital health and prevention.

222
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,470
So before we do that, let's talk about a pressing public health concern of our time obesity.

223
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:19,200
15.3% of Michigan high schoolers report to be obese in 2019.

224
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,780
And obesity in adolescents is particularly concerning because it's a risk factor for obesity at later points in life.

225
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:34,500
For example, a 19 year old who is obese has an 82% chance, 82% risk of being an obese adult.

226
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,220
And this is rather concerning because obesity is associated with health risks, such as hypertension and type two diabetes.

227
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,570
And one of the things that we noticed in our needs assessment was this element of physical inactivity.

228
00:28:48,750 --> 00:29:00,570
So when we asked Michigan high school students if they get at least 60 minutes of exercise physical activity per day, in the past week, 78.2% said no.

229
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,629
5 to 17 year olds are recommended to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.

230
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:15,120
So which means we have 78.2% of adolescents who just aren't getting enough physical activity.

231
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,660
And physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of obesity.

232
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,850
So the question becomes, how can we get students to exercise more?

233
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,450
The answer Digital Health Intervention. This is very easy.

234
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,040
So digital health intervention is divided into two parts one the basics and to app assist.

235
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:45,240
So the basics is that we have trained moderators come in and provide support to adolescents in really two major ways.

236
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,060
One is through the basic way of teaching them, Hey, this is how you use the app.

237
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,490
If you have any technical issues, come to us and we'll figure this out.

238
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:03,240
The other aspect is that these trained moderators can actually can teach the adolescents what it really means to lead a healthier lifestyle.

239
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,530
For example, they can teach what a healthy dietary habits look like.

240
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:15,960
They can teach that, you know, how much is enough physical activity to fit more physical activity in your schedule throughout the day?

241
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,660
And, you know, they provide resources and counseling.

242
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,910
And there's also this oversight from health care providers so that they're not in the wrong hands.

243
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:32,460
Part two is app assist. And it's very you can access an app through a website or through your phone or through a wearable device.

244
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,130
These are self-monitor progress checkers.

245
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,190
So the adolescents will set their own objectives, their own intent, their own goals, and they'll keep track to see that,

246
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:49,260
hey, am I getting my targets and my eating more vegetables and really increases accountability and tracking of progress.

247
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,470
And the expected results of this intervention are reduced BMI,

248
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,240
improved dietary habits and increased physical activity, which is what we're most interested in.

249
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,360
So the community guide presented that in other applications of this intervention in the past,

250
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,990
they noticed that physical activity increased by 17 minutes per day.

251
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:13,139
The number of days spent per week active increased by 0.77 days,

252
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:23,190
very intuitive sedentary activity decreased by 42 minutes per day, BMI decreased by 0.39 kilograms per meter squared.

253
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,569
And there was an overall increase of fruit and vegetables, which suggests that this intervention is quite effective at promoting the changes.

254
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:35,670
We want to see and hear my references and this is the one pager.

255
00:31:35,820 --> 00:32:02,610
Thank you. Hello.

256
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:11,610
My name is Carmen Prevention. And today I will be discussing Healthbox as a means to address cardiovascular disease in the Ypsilanti community.

257
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,390
To begin, it's important to stress that cardiovascular disease is an important health concern.

258
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,799
It's the leading cause of death globally, nationally and locally.

259
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:31,380
In the city of Ypsilanti is approximately 23% of deaths in the community are due to cardiovascular disease.

260
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,690
It's also important to mention that it disproportionately affects African Americans.

261
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,980
This is particularly important then to the community of Ypsilanti,

262
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,340
as approximately 30% of residents identify as African-American and therefore constitute a large and important portion of the community.

263
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,260
But in order to adequately address cardiovascular disease,

264
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,780
I think it's crucial to highlight the social determinants of health that impact one's ability to remain healthy.

265
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,170
So three social determinants I've identified here are race, income and food security.

266
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:15,000
So I highlighted two figures here on the left as a percentage of households living in poverty stratified by race.

267
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,230
Black Ypsilanti residents are disproportionately affected by poverty.

268
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:27,120
And in addition, white and Asian Ypsilanti residents also have higher poverty rates than overall Michigan residents.

269
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,370
So the right medium income is also presented stratified by race.

270
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,740
For most all races, Ypsilanti residents earn less relative to year.

271
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,920
Finally, food insecurity is at approximately 10% in Washtenaw County.

272
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,780
Food insecurity relates to cardiovascular disease as stress and poor diet quality

273
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,160
may affect one's likelihood to obtain a chronic disease like cardiovascular disease.

274
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:02,280
So what is the solution? I propose health bucks as an initiative in New York City in 2005.

275
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Health bucks work in part with SNAP benefits to improve fruit and vegetable access to low income individuals.

276
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,530
Improving nutrition access may improve overall health and decrease chronic disease risk.

277
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,030
In New York City, health bucks are completely funded by the New York City Health Department and the USDA Food Service.

278
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,950
So how do health bucks work? Well, for every $2 in SNAP benefits that are used at a farmer's market,

279
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:36,210
$2 in health bucks may just be distributed for up to a total of $10 a day in health clubs.

280
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:44,730
This is intended to increase the purchasing power for low income individuals in a setting which has lots of healthy food options.

281
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,900
In addition, community based organizations may also apply to distribute these health bucks to their clients.

282
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,210
So according to the Snap Toolkit website, as well as use as well as the Health Department website,

283
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,660
surveys indicate that individuals are utilizing farmer's market more because of this health bucks initiative.

284
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:15,180
In addition, in 2021, more than $250,000 were used and distributed at various farmer's markets in New York City.

285
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,660
Health books have also been shown to increase the number of farmers market vendors that are coming to low income neighborhoods,

286
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:28,380
which I believe is particularly important for people who may lack transportation and or have disabilities of any sorts.

287
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:36,480
So overall, much is needed to fix the social determinants of health and subsequent health outcomes, like cardiovascular disease in Ypsilanti.

288
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,500
And I believe health parks are a great starting solution. So thank you.

289
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:17,490
But she goes just in the middle layer at the top to have and then again.

290
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,249
Yeah. Hi. Hi.

291
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:26,400
My name is Michael and I'm going to be presenting a business case for breastfeeding to help improve breastfeeding rates in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

292
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,010
So basically, why breastfeed? Breastfeeding is really important for both mother and infant.

293
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:41,100
For mothers. There's a range of benefits ranging from what, releasing oxytocin that helps the mother recover postpartum and bond with her baby,

294
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:48,120
as well as long term chronic health benefits, including reducing the risk of different types of cancers as well as type two diabetes.

295
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,950
Similarly for infants, breast milk promotes growth and develops the immune system and has long term health benefits.

296
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,010
So the American Society of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for six

297
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,210
months of life and then continuing with complementary solid foods for up to two years.

298
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:15,690
So why is this a problem? Basically, rates in both the U.S. and Michigan, that's lower than they would recommend, as you can see here.

299
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,760
Only 25% of babies are exclusively breastfed through six months of age.

300
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,060
60% of mothers report discontinuation of breastfeeding earlier than planned.

301
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,540
And so there's many reasons as to why this occurs.

302
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,000
But one of them is the barrier of returning to work.

303
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,340
So many mothers return to work before the end of their maternity leave, which in the United States is only three months.

304
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:45,540
So obviously not the six months that is recommended for breastfeeding and that can be due to financial necessity.

305
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:53,160
And in the workplace, mothers lack privacy and the resources to pump and report feeling judgment from colleagues and employers,

306
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,410
and so they just continue breastfeeding.

307
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:04,740
So I'm proposing that we implement the business case for breastfeeding in Ann Arbor to help businesses make breastfeeding friendly workplaces.

308
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,730
This program introduces several different toolkits to help businesses establish breastfeeding friendly workplaces.

309
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,469
It has a toolkit for employers that basically establish help them establish lactation sites that are private,

310
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:26,670
that have high quality equipment for mothers, and help managers establish schedules that work for mothers to breastfeed.

311
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:35,790
This program also has education and resources for employees who are planning to breastfeed from when they start considering breastfeeding,

312
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:42,180
when they're pregnant all the way to when they're at work, and how to kind of handle relationships with their fellow colleagues.

313
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,840
There's also a guide for lactation specialists and health professionals so that they

314
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,070
can work with businesses and their communities to promote breastfeeding at work.

315
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,640
There are many beneficial outcomes. One of the benefits is that there's a big return on investment for companies.

316
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:02,670
So work absences occur more than twice as often for mothers who are formula feeding than mothers who are breastfeeding.

317
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,719
And this is a financial benefit to the company to help mothers breastfeed.

318
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,940
So there are less absences. One study found that the program resulted in annual savings of $240,000 in health care expenses.

319
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,179
There were 62% fewer prescriptions among employees and $60,000 in savings.

320
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:29,400
As a result of these reduced absences. Studies also showed much higher retention rates and much higher rates of female employee loyalty.

321
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,800
In companies that were implementing the program,

322
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,600
they were up to 94% higher of retention rate as compared to the national average of 59% of mothers who are trying to return to work.

323
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,799
And results also show that the productivity of breastfeeding women does not decline.

324
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,950
So that should not be a concern for businesses. And then overall, in terms of improving breastfeeding rates in Ann Arbor,

325
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:58,500
companies that implement these have mothers who continue to see that 73% of mothers continue breastfeeding until age,

326
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,770
while the national average is about 21%.

327
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:08,490
In the study, it was 2009. So that is why we should implement the business case for Breastfeeding and Arbor.

328
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,990
All right. Hi, everyone. I'm Elizabeth. And today we're going to be talking about how to address food insecurity in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

329
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,570
So the problem, as we've heard, described today across presentations.

330
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,120
Food insecurity in Michigan and Washtenaw County specifically is about 10.4% or one in ten.

331
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,149
So with that one in ten individuals being food insecure in mind, we talk about kind of the poverty rate.

332
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,590
So Ypsilanti residents have a higher poverty rate than the average Michigander,

333
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,820
with 38% making less than 25,000 annually, compared to 28% of Michiganders who make less than 25,000.

334
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:22,440
What this means or how this kind of ties into food insecurity is there's less financial stability to be spent towards food.

335
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,580
So as the cost of food goes up, that extra money to be spent on it goes down.

336
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:36,450
And then also to looking at consumption trends nationally, households that make $25,000 or less consume about 20 tablespoons excuse me,

337
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,380
teaspoons of added sugar, while households making $75,000 or more consume about 15 teaspoons.

338
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,390
And so we know that that's well above our added sugar recommended intake.

339
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,559
Well, well above it.

340
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:56,280
And so kind of tying all this together, some of the health concerns for Ypsilanti residents in particular are heart disease and high blood pressure.

341
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,960
And again, these have a lot of ties. But specifically, food insecurity can lead to health choices that overall affect long term health.

342
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,970
So suggested solution is cooking matters. What are the goals of cooking matters?

343
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,280
So Cooking Matters is an empirically tested, multi-pronged approach to decreasing food insecurity.

344
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,630
And this was implemented in Arkansas, Colorado and Maryland in 2013.

345
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,250
It addresses food insecurity by promoting the grocery store tour,

346
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:31,350
so participants will go and be led around their grocery store just to kind of like educate where frozen foods are canned foods, fresh foods.

347
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,989
We I mean, all of us being grocery shoppers, there's a huge difference in fresh produce versus canned versus frozen.

348
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:43,170
So that's really important information to know. They also practice comparing nutrition labels and per unit food costs.

349
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,780
So if you're looking at a yogurt yogurt size and it looks a lot more expensive than a small one,

350
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,610
if you do that per price per ounce comparison, that might actually be the better decision financially.

351
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:00,300
And then additionally, something that was implemented in 2015 that I won't talk about today is cooking and nutrition courses,

352
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:06,090
and that's just kind of online classes to help participants use the food and make the most of it.

353
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,990
So how does this and how does this intervention work?

354
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,500
Basically, you go on a one hour tour of your local grocery store.

355
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,740
Like I mentioned, you go over where the food options are. You practice with a professional about comparing nutrition labels.

356
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:26,640
You look at sodium added sugar, kind of those key ones. Instead of feeling super overwhelmed by everything that's on that label, it's targeted.

357
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:33,510
There's also receipt collection two weeks before the tour and five weeks after the tour and the pre and post intervention questionnaires.

358
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,299
So what is the impact? The big one I want to draw your eyes to is the first one listed,

359
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:47,550
which is that 11% of families increase their food intake excuse me, increase their food security going from 53 to 64%.

360
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:54,360
And then also that almost 90% of families reported saving money on grocery shops five weeks after their tour.

361
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:02,850
The final three facts toward the bottom of the page helps to represent that they these effects were seen post six months intervention,

362
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,069
which means that these changes in buying more fruits and vegetables buy more low sodium foods and

363
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:15,090
buying more low sugar foods is long lasting outside of just the five week post intervention check in.

364
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,980
And so why bringing this to you is that this is a very low cost implementation.

365
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:29,490
It is very impactful and can have really long term health effects both on consumer patterns as well as long term health outcomes.

366
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:49,700
And that is not. So if you like.

367
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:17,290
Category one. My name is Morgan Jones, and I'm going to be talking about the Breastfeeding Heritage and Pride program or BHP itself,

368
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,310
or doing a program that I want to implement in my community as.

369
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,880
So like I was saying in our presentation a few minutes ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics,

370
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:37,750
Pediatrics recommends mother mothers breastfeed exclusively for six months and then supplement with food to 12 months or up to two years.

371
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,560
So as we can see here on this table, both Michigan and the United States have a minority of mothers reaching this fall.

372
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,410
So I'd like to address this disparity specifically.

373
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,220
I think this is more important. Breastfeeding rates by race and ethnicity.

374
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,810
We can see that both Hispanic, Latino and black mothers have the lowest percentages of breastfeeding rates when compared to other races.

375
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,970
So I think a great solution would be implementing the HP program, which originated in Connecticut in 1993,

376
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,629
with the intention motivating mothers of low income status to initiate increase the duration of breastfeeding as promotes a more cost

377
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:20,230
effective strategy for these predominantly low income women who aren't able to pay for the services provided by lactation consultants.

378
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:27,070
This also encourages reclaiming breastfeeding as a cultural tradition and feelings of pride, as there has been shame of breastfeeding in the past.

379
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:34,780
And the program originally was targeted for Hispanic Latino mothers, but now is also for black mothers.

380
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,830
Lastly, this will empower mothers to advocate for themselves by talking with peers as there is mistrust in the health care system.

381
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:49,060
So maybe it's a better idea for these most to talk with their peers as they might trust them more than health care, health care providers.

382
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:57,890
Obviously, some strategies of this program are that your counselors are trained in hospital and they provide perinatal support for these mothers.

383
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,270
It begins prenatally and then continues up to a year after delivery.

384
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:07,419
Education and support of breastfeeding are encouraged through many different modes of communication,

385
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,720
including and hospital visits, client home visits and phone or video calls which can be shown in this figure on the right.

386
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:22,090
See, there are other additional free services, such as lactation consultant in the hospital that can help with LATCH assistance.

387
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:30,850
And there are also free breast pumps available. So some outcomes of this program include increasing breastfeeding rates in these minority groups,

388
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:36,400
as well as increasing education support and bridging the gap of trust in the medical community.

389
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,680
This program provides peer counseling to over 1400 low income minority women each year,

390
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,989
and that there has been some evidence of success of this program through two studies,

391
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,160
one chosen for and then the other chosen five and chosen for chairman.

392
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:57,040
And all showed that peer counseling services increase the likelihood of Latina mothers breastfeeding at 1 to 3 months.

393
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,779
And then in regards to exclusive breastfeeding,

394
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:09,790
Anderson found that groups with the group counseling 27% more exclusively breastfeeding while control group without any peer counseling at all,

395
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,340
and only 3% were exclusively breastfeeding.

396
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:18,970
Therefore, I feel like this would be a really good program to implement in Ypsilanti to increase breastfeeding rates in these minority groups.

397
00:48:37,120 --> 00:49:12,850
So in other words, she just wanted six different sources.

398
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:36,580
Did you go to the sources? She says, I'm sorry, I'm not coming.

399
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:43,450
So. Hi, everyone. For today's one page presentation, I will talk about our information generation.

400
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,120
I will go through the background.

401
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:53,750
My opinion needs assessment and then identify the problem and talk about in the Russian program in detail and the solution of this problem.

402
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,900
So my community needs assessment.

403
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:07,239
My goal is to assess the obesity rate among children under 18 years building and Timber, Michigan, and visit data.

404
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,460
In this two table. We can see that obesity is a House issue for people in Michigan.

405
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:18,610
And although I can only gather data from high school students student waste status in Michigan,

406
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:25,510
I can see there is over 70% of students that suffer from a problem like overweight.

407
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,370
So I'm so, so, so, so, so.

408
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:37,120
And this to do in the table, we can see that food access is a problem that children face.

409
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,639
As for that research, we know that low food access is related to obesity.

410
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,340
Thus, I think I identify the problem as tutoring and are struggling with food,

411
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:53,409
access and intervention as children have more chance to get access in daily life

412
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:58,490
is necessary and this can help them to alleviate the problem off of attitudes.

413
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:07,090
And then I find that housing generation, which is a program aimed to promote housing development so that young people can achieve good housing.

414
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,499
I chose this intervention because is a nation's largest school based program.

415
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,750
A school is an important site for students,

416
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:21,460
for students and children to provide health and education to target population health consistent with my target population.

417
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:29,070
So to deal with the problem, conduct the six step process of housing generations of your choice.

418
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:37,569
And this program, Trump program, our idea of action to address household lot and this including provide fruit and vegetable

419
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:43,030
which a house food by hard for people living in poor community to get out every day.

420
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,940
And in addition there is other good points for this interaction.

421
00:51:48,940 --> 00:52:00,580
Like you can get more housing, housing, education and physical activities which can help children to deal with deal with their basic problem of state.

422
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,140
And there is even evaluation of face intervention.

423
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:13,320
And the evaluation shows that through the program, to serve the program, it makes a big change also.

424
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:24,410
Students. It makes it makes a big change, a big change of the house environment in the school in this radius.

425
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:30,780
And this is a reference, at least on the one page poster of my assignments.

426
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:43,330
Thank you. She?

427
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,090
Operations and health of everyone.

428
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:19,910
Marshall City Council. My name is Serino Chen and today I'll be presenting about my intervention strategy called Healthy Bones for Life.

429
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,880
So just an overview. Bones are a living part of our bodies and we have two types of bone cells,

430
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,320
ones that are constantly growing, and then the other ones that are constantly dying.

431
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:44,450
And so osteoporosis happens when we have net bone cell death, which means that more are more of the bone cells are dying,

432
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,830
there are more bone cells are dying than the ones that are growing.

433
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:56,810
And so in Washtenaw County, very much higher rates of osteoporosis than at the state level.

434
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:04,550
And so if we take a look at this graph on the right here, I have the current rates of osteoporosis per 100,000 people.

435
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:09,530
And in blue is Washtenaw County and then in red is Michigan.

436
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,430
We can see that that blue bar is way, way higher than Michigan.

437
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:21,710
And for postmenopausal women, they are at much higher risk and they can experience up to 20% bone loss in their lifetime.

438
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:31,730
So and in Washtenaw County, we will expect there to be more older seniors throughout the, you know, the near future.

439
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:38,240
And so this is a very problematic situation and requires adjustment.

440
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,990
And so what isn't healthy? Don't realize. What is it?

441
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:56,879
So it's basically an exercise program that combines activities such as walking, calisthenics and resistance strengthening,

442
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,100
and those activities are assumed to be adequate enough to improve aerobic capacity.

443
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,600
Or sometimes we can also combine aerobic capacity with muscle strength.

444
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:12,390
And so basically what it boils down to is you have the stress or mechanical loading of bones.

445
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,830
And so what the stress mean, it means that when bones support the weight of the body.

446
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,940
And then mechanical loading is when movement is versus resistance.

447
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,500
So, for example, to one, when you have these woman use weights.

448
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:35,550
And so further examples are aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises are implemented in this program.

449
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:44,010
And so some of the outcomes and these are just the outcomes that we measure, not exactly the outcome,

450
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,419
the expected outcomes always presenting, but the expected outcomes in the next slide.

451
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,880
But here are the things that we measured in this in this randomized controlled trial.

452
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:03,840
So a major outcome that we've looked at is number of fractures, both vertebral so at the spine and then also nonverbal at the hip and the wrist.

453
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:14,879
We also took a look at other outcomes such as bone mass, I should say bone mass density, which stands that's not BMD.

454
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:25,690
And then you have a C, which is bone mineral content. And then we also took a look at calcium bone index immediately post intervention and then

455
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:33,900
follow other events that we also looked at included severe life adverse events like death,

456
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,930
and then also minor adverse events like falls.

457
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,020
And so this is the effective effectiveness of the intervention.

458
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:50,770
So those who had exercise had on average a 0.85% less bone loss at the spine and

459
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:55,450
then 1.03% less bone loss at the hip compared to those who did not exercise.

460
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,210
And so more specifically, we take a look at the different intervention types.

461
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,130
When there was an intervention that comprised more than one exercise type,

462
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,120
there was a significant effect on the bone mineral density at three sites, including at the femur, the spine and the trochanter.

463
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,260
And then the risk of fracture in these exercise groups is lower than that of the controls.

464
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:23,080
Exercises like walking or tai chi had a significant effect on bone mineral

465
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,129
density at two sites at the spine and the wrist compared to the control groups.

466
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:36,670
And then another form of exercise like, for example, single leg standing that had a significant effect on bone mineral density.

467
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,180
And so I'll keep my slide here. Thank you for listening.

468
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,900
Yeah. Funny. All right, we actually have time.

469
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:10,060
So I want to know if any had questions about any of the interventions that were offered today or presented today or on Monday.

470
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:19,290
So, yeah, for Hannah, for your little education, is it part of their curriculum or is it like extra classes that they would have to take after school?

471
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,720
It was just like implemented throughout their school day.

472
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,830
So I would say like it was not necessarily part of like their school, but it was in their school days that makes sense.

473
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:35,319
Like, so like they would have to take extra class early somewhere while there was like the opportunity to take extra outside stuff.

474
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,040
But like when they were at school, they were getting this education.

475
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,330
Okay. And I'm sorry, I meant to open up questions at the end of class on Monday.

476
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:53,170
Got any other questions?

477
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:57,310
Yes. This is for Elizabeth. So I.

478
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,090
So during my gap year, I actually volunteered with cooking batteries, and I loved it.

479
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,040
And I just wanted to know, like, what was your most favorite thing you learned while doing your research?

480
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:16,870
So I think, one, I liked how easy it was like as an intervention, just like it's so easy to like walk around grocery store and I like that.

481
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,930
But the thing that I would have liked to learn more about was kind of like the cooking classes and like the

482
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:28,450
stuff that they were doing with kids because the like the grocery store part was the first one I found.

483
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:33,309
And so that was the most applicable to my like the food insecurity.

484
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:40,420
But then everything else that they did, I just felt like it just seemed like a very wholesome, like community.

485
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:44,620
Like I that's, that was what I really liked about it. So that's really cool that you worked with that.

486
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:50,370
You know, I loved it. It was so fun. I did like virtual volunteer, I guess like a nutritionist, like instructor.

487
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,170
So were you in the grocery stores or were you. No, it was virtual.

488
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:58,170
It was like during like I mean, it was like a year ago, but it was like a virtual program.

489
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,750
I did like a six week program. That's so cool. That's really cool.

490
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,700
Yeah. So to piggyback onto that.

491
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:13,950
So in this class, prior to COVID, I used to require students to fulfill 30 hours of service learning in the community.

492
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,800
And one of the ones, one of the service learning sites was cooking matters.

493
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:26,910
And so students would actually go and volunteer with a chef and conduct the cooking matters classes.

494
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,030
And they loved it. So I just wanted to put a shout out.

495
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:36,290
I don't know where we're at with cooking matters. Sorry, my forebrain, love.

496
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:41,100
I don't know where we are at with that in terms of whether or not they're doing in person.

497
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,600
But for those of you interested, that's probably something you could do.

498
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,990
Volunteer. They had they used to have a volunteer website.

499
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,980
So even if it's not in-person, there might be some virtual. So I encourage you to check it out.

500
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:59,880
We had some students that actually continued over their two years because they loved it so much.

501
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,870
So that's it's a great organization.

502
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:12,390
So yes, it would it be possible to make these available to everyone because they're just like,

503
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,620
I feel maybe like in a year we'd come across something and we'd be like, Oh yeah, that project.

504
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,610
I wanted to remember the details of that, you know, that might be relevant in our professional life.

505
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:25,230
Well, it's on Panopto. Oh, right.

506
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:33,260
I mean, I guess I could do a PDF of everybody's, but it'll be a little time consuming.

507
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,840
No, I don't want to put you to that. I forgot that it was recorded, so I recorded it.

508
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:41,070
So, yeah. So you can, you'd have access to it for a bit.

509
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:52,300
I think about there's a way to. I'm keeping PDFs and you can just I'm happy to think there's ways you can combine.

510
01:01:53,020 --> 01:02:00,160
Now I can combine it. It's just not everybody. But I can. It just takes time for those that intended as a PDF have to convert it to a pdf and then.

511
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:05,379
But I can do it. So I'll I'll do that and post it as one big pdf.

512
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:11,200
It may be a bit, but the course will be open and you guys can access that later on.

513
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,860
I wanted to just make a comment for those of you who I'll have the veggie van.

514
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,210
I totally understand. I mean, it's a really cool concept.

515
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:25,210
But, you know, it's important to recognize that you guys all kind of approach that a little differently.

516
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:33,100
At least one or two of you, Jennifer, you did a picture of what the actual box look like, what products look like and what they might get.

517
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:43,300
So again, we all learn, even if there is duplicity and in the intervention, everybody kind of approaches it a little differently.

518
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:52,930
You guys all did a great job and I know 3 minutes isn't very long, but it's amazing what you can cover in 3 minutes.

519
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:57,489
So I think it's important to, you know, hopefully in your professional careers,

520
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:02,350
you will actually have a little bit more time unless it's a prescribed TEDTalk,

521
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:10,390
but usually you'll have a little bit more time, especially if you're working with community members or even in a meeting.

522
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:16,899
The other nice thing about doing this is to recognize not all of us are super creative.

523
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:27,219
I'm one that's not. And so when I go to conferences or meetings and I see how other people do their slides, I'm like, okay, mental note to self.

524
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:39,010
I really like that. You know, I found myself engaged with a particular PowerPoint slide template and approach so we learn from one another, right?

525
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:44,349
So because I would say that even doing this for years and years,

526
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:54,820
I still feel like I can improve on my slides and it's just like writing be always can have that type of deliverable.

527
01:03:54,970 --> 01:04:03,280
So well today's our last day which seems like the semester has just flown probably for you.

528
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:13,299
Not necessarily. Community nutrition is a foundation class for many of you in the nutritional sciences program,

529
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:24,090
so this is providing you foundational knowledge that you will be using in other courses building on, right?

530
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:35,530
I hope you walk away with a greater appreciation or an appreciation for community nutrition and public health in the community.

531
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:42,219
I really firmly I mean, it's the health of our communities really dictates the health of our nation.

532
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:52,180
And so all of us can work in some capacity in improving the health of our our own community or a neighboring community and so forth.

533
01:04:52,180 --> 01:05:00,250
So this last bit of the program that you guys just sort of took your nutrition assessment,

534
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:08,290
carried it through, identified a priority and then identify it and intervention.

535
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:18,490
So that's all key framework in public health in terms of program planning, community change, community action.

536
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,880
And so that's sort of been the backbone of this whole course.

537
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:33,280
In addition to learning about how do we assess and monitor nutrition in country, how can we do it at a community or county level?

538
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,960
And then all the different agencies that are involved,

539
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:49,630
everything from the National Academies providing nutrient recommendations to our dry eyes, to USDA, writing our dietary guidelines,

540
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:57,580
and then learning about all the different programs and agencies in the communities that help our vulnerable,

541
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:03,040
vulnerable and that nutrition nutritional status as well as health.

542
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,379
So it's been a pleasure sharing this semester with all of you.

543
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,800
I've really enjoyed you.

544
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:18,280
I enjoyed coming to class and so I'll see many of you next semester.

545
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:22,750
And if I don't see you next semester, stay in touch.

546
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:45,230
So we're done. One thing I just wanted to say about your hesitation, we kind of posted on canvas I've been making out trying to provide feedback.

547
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:51,230
If there was any sort of real, tangible feedback that other than just, Oh my gosh, you did a great job.

548
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:59,239
So it take me a little bit, but I have my days all done, so probably tomorrow.

549
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:07,129
I'll work on today. So you should have your grades for your presentation by Friday and know that it's going to

550
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:11,750
take a bit for getting the grades for the one case or it's not going to happen all week.

551
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:26,750
So sometimes I start having students emailing me like the Monday before and I'm like, We're doing it this weekend, so it'll probably be great.

552
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:34,340
All right, everybody, have see you have a great semester.

553
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:39,710
Good luck with all of the final project and have happy holidays.

554
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:49,490
You can get lots of rest, I think for next semester.

555
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:55,580
Those of you taking maternal and child nutrition lessons, I mean, that's what everybody does.

556
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:05,320
Well, there's. It's not really now.
