1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:14,549
Well, I'm inclined, although one line of consciousness usually that I think a lot of other folks are,

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:33,300
they realize and I always feel I was to do a lot of the obvious actually nice and difficult things when I went in and I did not want to black people.

3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:51,760
All right. Let's go ahead and get started with some this summer, Chad.

4
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,900
Yes, you did great.

5
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,260
So we're going to be transitioning away from your needs assessment.

6
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:19,230
Suzanne, thank goodness again. We're going to be transitioning, obviously, from your assessment was due today.

7
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,520
We'll be transitioning to talk about an intervention programs.

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,209
We're not going to go through all of the different aspects of intervention programs or program planning,

9
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:44,250
but we are going to touch upon a few key points and this actually will provide the background for your last project in this course.

10
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:55,210
And it is a project that is informed from your needs assessment based on priorities that you guys have.

11
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:06,900
So then I'll talk more about that at the end of this presentation and also Monday, a little bit more about your final project.

12
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,239
So again,

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:18,050
we're just going to be talking about certain aspects of program planning and talking a little bit more about evidence based programs and so forth.

14
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:26,790
And today, before I get started, I just wanted to give everybody a heads up.

15
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:36,270
Those of you that are going to be registering for maternal and child nutrition, I noticed they have still a remote section for that course.

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:45,420
That course is not going to be taught remote. So please don't register for the remote section because it's not going to be in in class.

17
00:02:47,100 --> 00:03:01,200
So I just wanted to let people know it's not a remote section this year and has anybody looked at so does it show up on your end?

18
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,230
Is having a remote section? Yes. Okay.

19
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,660
I need to reach out to the registrar. Okay. Well, I'm just giving you a heads up.

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,380
Okay.

21
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:31,320
So we've seen this image before in terms of change in the community, and it involves assessment, planning, program planning, program implementation.

22
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:43,080
When I say program, I'm talking interventions. Evaluation of an intervention program and no commitment buy in from the community is critical.

23
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,550
Okay. So you guys have learned about the assessment component.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,550
And again, we're going to talk a little bit about the planning and so forth.

25
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,040
And this is just another image that just highlights the role of the needs assessment.

26
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,930
Of problem. I feel like that's kind of an odd way of saying the problem, but a concern, right?

27
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:21,540
It's our notification problem. What are the evidence based practices and interventions that might be implemented that can address that concern?

28
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,940
And then evaluation is a key component of the process.

29
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,440
Okay. So I just in the next two slides, this is just going over a very basic overview of program planning,

30
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:46,380
the process of implementing an intervention in response to an event, an unmet need or priority.

31
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,340
So first we have the assessment what are the underlying concerns, conditions, characteristics of the community.

32
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,060
That was your project that you guys just submitted.

33
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,000
And then the community. Needs to determine a priority. What concerns do they want to move forward in their concerns?

34
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:20,040
Once they decide on that concern, one of the goals is their specific target population at this intervention is going to be specific for.

35
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,729
And what are the outcomes expected in order in addressing this priority and what are the

36
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,920
evidence based programs that are out there that I'm going to utilize to achieve the goal?

37
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:43,710
And then you have to plan for implementing the intervention, evaluating the program through the whole process.

38
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,470
Right. We don't evaluate just at the end to see if it was found to be effective.

39
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,540
We have to evaluate through the whole process, at least the good evaluation program does that.

40
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,370
What kind of aspects of implementing an intervention in terms of the process might be evaluated well before you even get to the end?

41
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,870
Yeah. You could see how many people enroll right away. So, like, deem it necessary for their family or just enrollment in general.

42
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:33,910
Is it what you expected? Right. You're obviously you're going into this program implementation with the expectation of X amount of people enrolling.

43
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,970
So are you seeing the numbers? Numbers? What else?

44
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:50,430
But yeah. Is that it has it has the cost actually been much more than was expected in the implementation phase.

45
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:02,450
Yeah. Like staffing.

46
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,690
Yeah. I mean, just think about an intervention that might be implemented in the school.

47
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,410
All right.

48
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:21,030
Let's assume it's something to improve nutrition and physical activity of kind to bolster their wellness policy and not just policy, but the approach.

49
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,970
So staffing.

50
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:34,590
So it was their expectations that certain staff in the in the school system was going to be able to implement certain components of the intervention.

51
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:43,320
And it's not happening. So that's actually assessing the fidelity process.

52
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:54,920
Maybe the food service was involved and maybe there's been some issue where they're not able to implement it to the level that was expected.

53
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:06,049
Right. So there's a lot of steps in the process that really should be need to be evaluated as is being implemented,

54
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:14,630
because some of those issues can be resolved and not impact the outcome of the intervention.

55
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,710
The last thing you want is, is hiccups in the process to result in, not the outcome that you expect.

56
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:29,660
So an evaluation process that is continuous through the whole implementation period is important,

57
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:40,220
that obviously an intervention is going to have specified outcomes that are measurable.

58
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:54,370
That will be part of the evaluation component. And then the really important point is, is there a sustainability plan, right?

59
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,700
You spend all this money like Lee got a grant to implement this intervention.

60
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,960
There should be a sustainability plant in process.

61
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:21,080
So that's just sort of various overarching approaches to interventions and program planning.

62
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:30,890
So I just want to go back now to think about community determines a priority.

63
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:47,210
So what kind of priorities did you guys identify in your assessment to shout out based on your analysis of the data?

64
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:58,820
Melissa. Educational attainment and the cause of that also could be tied to employment and income.

65
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:07,170
So, you know, a priority that came out of yours is concern about low level of education attainment.

66
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,450
Okay. Yeah. And also concerns about income and so forth.

67
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,400
Yep. Okay. Yep.

68
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:25,940
So lack of health care. Okay. Yeah. Inadequate physical activity.

69
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,959
Okay. These are all great. Nice. Across the board.

70
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Range of gaps and data. Gaps and data.

71
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:47,430
Yeah. Good. So a community may have funded an assessment.

72
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:59,220
They're getting the report back and there may be anywhere from four to 6 to 8 priorities that have been highlighted or determined from the assessment.

73
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:06,360
So how do they decide which priority or priorities that they can tackle?

74
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:16,630
And you have ideas about how that might go about. How would you decide which priorities?

75
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,569
Yeah, I think there was kind of an intersection of a bunch of things kind of budget.

76
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,530
Do they have available? Where can they get the most bang for their buck?

77
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:38,589
Like how many people can reach on a certain thing that would show the best results that might most impact SNAP and available for whatever it is?

78
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,700
Some of these things might be heavier people lips than other things.

79
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,340
Right. So you have to think about just even the structural and staffing component of.

80
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,620
Yeah. Kind of to go with that. Just going back to like sustainability in whatever solution you have,

81
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,320
your community and everybody that plays a role is able to keep up and decrease the issue at hand.

82
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,149
Yeah. What other issues would the community need to think about in terms of which priority?

83
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,170
Just let's assume they're just going to pick one. How do you decide what's what other factors would you take into account?

84
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,270
Like just generally, like what is the most pressing need?

85
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,070
Like there's obviously this problem with like felt like for my report anyway.

86
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,990
Like there was so much you could talk about, but you have to narrow it down to like what the most pressing issue was.

87
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,650
And for me, I felt like that was like race and how that interfered with children being able to be like their healthiest selves.

88
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:41,590
Right. So the seriousness of the concern is something that has to be considered.

89
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,980
Right, as well as how much of the population is impacted.

90
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,799
If you only have a handful of individuals that are impacted, you know,

91
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,890
it may need to be addressed in a different way than just sort of a more broadly applied intervention.

92
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,180
What other factors? Yeah, I talked about like short term versus long term.

93
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,810
I guess my report was about food insecurity. So if like some family was experiencing it because they didn't have access to a grocery store,

94
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,700
that was like a shorter term solution to some families insecurity.

95
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,029
But longer things would be like systemic barriers. Yeah.

96
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:27,999
And actually ideally you would like for that to be as part of the intervention.

97
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,900
Right. That that there would be maybe an intervention that could address it from a short term.

98
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:42,360
But then thinking about it long term, you know, in terms of food access, getting a grocery store and is not short term, that's a long term.

99
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,670
I mean, that can take 8 to 10 years of planning.

100
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,330
So that's not something you might implement immediately.

101
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,680
You might actually implement something else that can be done within a year or two,

102
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,000
but that could be one of those long term interventions that is going to be considered as well.

103
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,439
I would think what the community itself wants, the people that are affected,

104
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:16,570
what their priority is versus what may look like a great political move for a city or an organization to manage what they actually want,

105
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,930
what they want. Yes, that's actually really critical.

106
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:28,629
I don't know if any of you remember, but the Wayne County assessment actually surveyed community members to ask

107
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,550
them about what do they feel are the most pressing concerns in the community,

108
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,440
and that was highlighted in the assessment.

109
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,580
So that's a really important aspect, too.

110
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:52,330
Okay. So I think actually you guys hit on all of the key.

111
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:00,040
So seriousness, frequency of the issue, cost other resources to actually address the concern,

112
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,150
the community's perception of the importance of the concern.

113
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,520
So what happens if there is a concern that.

114
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:20,240
No. Among the health professionals, they consider that a problem that needs to be addressed, and yet the community isn't really aware.

115
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:30,690
How do we get buy in from the community? This happens more often than you realize that.

116
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Town halls? Yep. Town halls. What else?

117
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,500
I just don't like door to door,

118
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:50,240
like five people that are in the community to go speak to other people in the community about how they may not realize this problem.

119
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,470
Yeah. So I mean, part of it is getting the information out.

120
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:04,190
Another aspect to it is to also survey the sections of the community to help understand why it's not perceived as a problem.

121
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:14,239
So it could be a lack of awareness, but it also could be a perception so that you might it might be worth conducting some focus groups to learn what

122
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:23,300
the attitudes and perceptions are in the community so that then you can address it based on that feedback.

123
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:32,450
So and then the long term benefit of addressing the concern that's another aspect is informing the community.

124
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,100
What's going to be the benefit if we implement this intervention?

125
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:48,920
What do we expect to see? Okay, so who should be involved?

126
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:02,270
Okay. So Nicole already said, you know, we need to involve the community in general ethnicities, religious leaders.

127
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:11,470
Yeah. I would take depends on the population you're looking at what their needs are.

128
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,980
So I think for older adults you would want to include those working with older adults,

129
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:27,320
serving the community with food insecurity or with improving health care access.

130
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:37,910
It depends on the population. Some does. This is very much audience dependent or target population depending on audience, but target population.

131
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:46,490
So very similar to what should be involved in planning and needs assessment stakeholders than community is very much applies to

132
00:17:46,490 --> 00:18:04,730
program planning and what is encouraged is what they call a participatory approach and this is a community participatory approach.

133
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:17,300
So it's not just a closed door session of community leaders making the decision that it involves the community through this process.

134
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,720
Everything from, as Nicole mentioned, you know, public meetings like town halls.

135
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,560
It might involve a focus group, community surveys.

136
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:38,190
Any other approaches you can think of? To involve the community in decision making.

137
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,380
Or maybe just not even involving. How might you approach this?

138
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:57,270
So you have the community interested? How do you find out what a priority?

139
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,120
In other words, how do we decide a priority? Let's assume that we've sort of narrowed it down to like three priorities.

140
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:13,630
How do we then strike one? Especially if we want to involve the community.

141
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,100
So I already mentioned one approach is to conduct the survey.

142
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,190
And find out what the community feels is a priority.

143
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:34,870
And so in that survey, you would have your three priorities and you can find out based on that.

144
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:54,750
So what else? So there are approaches for ranking priorities based on a whole host of factors.

145
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,420
So you could actually do it sort of empirically.

146
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:12,300
And this link here provides some examples and methods for ranking priorities or different approaches for determining a priority.

147
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,270
Or narrowing it down to just one problem or concern. So.

148
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:35,380
So. Voting. Community surveys, drinking and so forth are all approaches to get feedback on which priority a community would want to focus on.

149
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:50,330
Okay. Best practice. Which evidence based programs will actually achieve the goal.

150
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,980
So it's very important that the intervention that's implemented has some evidence of success.

151
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,090
And I think intuitively that makes sense to all of us. You don't want to invest again.

152
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,300
You're likely going to be applying for a grant to fund this intervention.

153
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,350
And even in writing the grant, you likely are going to have to justify the money for this intervention.

154
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,760
So you need to demonstrate that it's been shown to be effective in some manner.

155
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:52,030
So this is a figure that the CDC that I got from an article at the CDC has in some of their materials for program planning.

156
00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:00,880
So what we have here is on the Y axis, we have sort of public health.

157
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,320
Action or public health implications or impact.

158
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,060
So its effectiveness reach. What do we mean by reach?

159
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,440
How many people it impacts, how many people that actually impacts.

160
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:30,040
Does it actually impact the target population that you expect and that's measurable and validate feasibility?

161
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,030
What do we mean by feasibility or how can we assess feasibility?

162
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,910
Feasibility of an intervention. What do we mean? The reality of it?

163
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,690
Do we have the money? Do we have the people? Do we have a place?

164
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,680
Just how realistic is this program?

165
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,520
Yeah. So feasibility can be implemented.

166
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,170
There can actually be a feasibility study if it's research tested.

167
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,870
So you'll often see this with intervention studies that are research based.

168
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,760
There'll be a feasibility study that's conducted first and it's scaled down.

169
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:23,250
So it's a much smaller population and it's conducted over a share, usually a shorter period of time.

170
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:34,020
But it's a way to determine if the intervention and the intervention strategies that have been proposed can actually be implemented without concerns.

171
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,990
So feasibility is important. Sustainability.

172
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,460
And then the other one. Transferability.

173
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:53,580
What do we mean by that is that if there's another community kind of going through the same issue,

174
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,820
can we take this project and move into there and see if it works with that same dynamic?

175
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:08,520
Exactly. Another example might be if it was implemented in a rural setting, can it be implemented in an urban setting?

176
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,650
If it was implemented in Detroit, can it be implemented in Phenix?

177
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:27,340
So that's transferability. And then on the x axis is the quality of evidence.

178
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,319
Again, y axis is public health impact.

179
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,480
And here we have quality evidence that ranges from weak all the way up to rigorous.

180
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,750
So what might be weak evidence versus rigorous evidence?

181
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,830
Would rigorous be like over the course of time, just like watching TV.

182
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:05,150
So, yes, actually, there can be a time factor, especially if it's one where there's multiple points of measurement and then even beyond that.

183
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,740
So let's say it's an outcome measure that we're interested in.

184
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,970
Let's assume it's, you know, one that addresses cardiovascular disease.

185
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:22,880
And maybe the outcome is is the intervention is multiple strategies, everything from diet to exercise to stress reduction.

186
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:31,700
And maybe they're measuring things like blood pressure and maybe some other kind of quantitative indicators.

187
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:40,129
You certainly would want to do sort of the baseline then after the intervention, but then there might be a period of time where,

188
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:47,900
even with the interventions no longer going on, do we see sustained outcome a year later?

189
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,710
Right. So, yes. What else would be rigorous?

190
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,140
Yep. That the result was achieved in multiple studies.

191
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,480
Yes. So it's transferable? Yeah. Yep.

192
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,330
Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:20,270
Maybe also study type. So like a controlled trial would be maybe better than like an observational study.

194
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,260
Okay. Yes. There's a lot of argument that you.

195
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,260
Right. Because with randomized controlled trials, you can establish causation.

196
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:44,030
Yeah. Yeah. So study type some aspects to the rigorous also just includes was it published in a peer reviewed journal?

197
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:52,490
Was it a study that was also included in a systematic review and meta analysis?

198
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:05,419
Okay. So all of those components that you guys talked about, as well as just being published and reviewed by peers and potentially being involved,

199
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,420
you know, included in a systematic review and meta analysis and what we tend to see for a rigorous piece.

200
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah. General question. I was just going to say like you could look at to like who was funding the research that was done.

201
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:27,040
Maybe like, I don't know, like if you're looking, I feel like there's like a lot of research like that, like Coca Cola has done.

202
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:32,500
That's like obviously it's going to be in their favor and not necessarily like best for the people sort of thing.

203
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,340
So you want to actually this gets back to the study, right, if Coca Cola funds that,

204
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:47,360
but they're not involved in the actual development, implementation and measurement of the research.

205
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,120
Right. That's independently being done by researchers at a university or something.

206
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,960
There might be less. Well, there is always going to be concern.

207
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:03,150
But so, yes, your point is your point makes sense.

208
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:11,000
It's just recognizing, too, that the methodology may be such that even though it's funded by Coca Cola, it's still rigorous.

209
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,920
Yeah, that doesn't mean it always turned out.

210
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,140
Yeah. So you'd have to look at the methods. Yeah.

211
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,170
So what do we mean by weak evidence then?

212
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:33,590
Obviously it's a company or a small nonprofit is looking at some sort of emerging technology to solve a problem.

213
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,360
That's so interesting, but you don't really know how effective it's going to be, right?

214
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,500
You there's really not a lot of evaluation.

215
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,350
You may have seen the evaluation of the process.

216
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:52,220
Um, there may be some publication from either the company or the organization,

217
00:28:52,700 --> 00:29:00,529
but it's really not really out there yet and it's not peer reviewed and it's probably very early in the process.

218
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,940
So it's really more process evaluation versus evaluating any outcomes.

219
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:05,870
Yeah.

220
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:21,170
So this continuum then results in these sort of definitions of intervention or practice types we have emerging, promising, leading and the best right.

221
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:33,049
And you can see the best is where we have rigorous evidence and takes into account things like sustainability, transferability and so forth.

222
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:38,270
So it is at the peak of what we would want to see.

223
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:51,950
For the most rigorous intervention emerging is again interventions that are just being implemented and they're not fully tested,

224
00:29:52,130 --> 00:30:00,830
but they look promising. And I know we are moving into this continuing, continuing continuum of promising.

225
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,170
So it's a gray area.

226
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:15,650
But again, merging is just those innovative interventions that look like they have some level of effectiveness that's already been determined.

227
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:28,220
So this is you see variations of evidence very similar to this figure.

228
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,620
But I just want to show you a couple other examples.

229
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,830
This is from Snap Ed. Okay. So if you recall Snap Ed is this.

230
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:52,880
It's usually implemented through extension services and organizations where they provide education on nutrition,

231
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,920
budgeting and so forth for those who are participants in the SNAP program.

232
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,749
SNAP and actually the website has some really nice resources for communities.

233
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:14,540
So these are specific to think about in the context of obesity, but the main concepts still apply irrespective of the theme.

234
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:20,509
So here we have research tested and again, it's what we've all just been brainstorming.

235
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,410
What would we expect to see with the research tested intervention?

236
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:33,140
And there's some examples here of programs or interventions, and then we have practice tested.

237
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,980
So practice tested is those interventions that are implemented by practitioners.

238
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:47,870
So one way to think about this would be primary care physician who's implementing

239
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:57,610
are prescribing a certain medication that may be a new approach to diet,

240
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:05,810
you know, addressing a particular health concern. And so this is information coming from actual practitioners.

241
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,030
So it might be in the form of some kind of informal evaluation report.

242
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:30,000
It could be a case study. It might even be a published case study of the results.

243
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,899
So again, it's just assessing individual behaviors and so forth.

244
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:45,160
And so here there is actually some examples of interventions in the community that are considered practice tested.

245
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,650
So child care centers, centers,

246
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:59,680
this first one that would make sense is coming from information is coming from those staff working at child care facilities and so forth.

247
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,860
The last one is emerging.

248
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:11,800
Again, we've talked a little bit about this one, but it can be community or practitioner driven and it's early in the phase of this intervention.

249
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:28,330
So these are some nice examples of various intervention programs and how they're perceived in terms of research versus emerging.

250
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:40,240
I actually like this one the best. This is from the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, or MTM.

251
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,550
And this is their definition of evidence based interventions. And this was a reading wasn't a very long reading for today.

252
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,710
I don't know if any of you were unable to look at it,

253
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,139
but their definition of an evidence based intervention program is anything that demonstrates

254
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,530
that a given activity is having an intended impact for a specific community or population.

255
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,930
Okay, that seems reasonable, pretty basic.

256
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,070
But then it goes on to say it's recognizing that public health occurs in real world settings and that we

257
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,040
should consider evidence should not be limited to that which comes from controlled scientific research.

258
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,770
It should be expanded to include in uplift evidence that is defined by impact to communities.

259
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:37,990
Represents values, needs and culture. Doesn't say culture here, but it basically it is implying that of those with the lived experience.

260
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,140
So what do they mean by that?

261
00:34:51,250 --> 00:35:06,250
This is we're seeing more and more of this recognition that we just can't assume that best practices is going to be evaluated and be rigorously,

262
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:14,620
empirically evaluated, that we need to broaden our expectations of evaluation.

263
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,870
So why are they including the lived experience?

264
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,849
I'm thinking like if you were the focus group,

265
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:46,030
you might get very similar experiences among maybe your target population that you can use in trying to foment or create a new program.

266
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,330
So those are important and you keep hearing the same experiences from the TV.

267
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:03,009
Yeah. And our social determinants of health class, we talk a lot about like the power of storytelling and like, yes,

268
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:11,860
it's not research, but there is a lot to be said about someone's like vulnerability and sharing their story and like that.

269
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:21,249
A lot of times, especially in this case, is enough evidence to implement a program right from our archives and scientific research.

270
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,549
We do everything possible to get rid of confounders, except those exist real world situations.

271
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,970
And so while empirically something may work in certain conditions, it may very well not.

272
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:39,130
And so you have to consider experience and all those confounders in real life.

273
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:47,350
Yeah. Yeah. I was also going to say to you that I feel like with case studies or if it's like one person's experience,

274
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,889
if you're and I agree that it's completely valid,

275
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,959
I think there's sometimes a hard translate part where you take one person's

276
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,390
experience and then trying to come up financially with the backing to say that,

277
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,900
well, this person experience this, we're going to implement this really expensive program.

278
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,120
Like, I think that's one of the difficulties.

279
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,460
And I think that's why it's important that people should be reminded that those experiences do really matter.

280
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,890
Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to clear my mind.

281
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,590
So when you talk about referring to peoples in the communities experiences,

282
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:29,110
are you talking about using their views as evidence in promoting your program, or are you looking just for their feedback?

283
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,479
And or are you also looking for like mini versions of experiments that have occurred in a community,

284
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,020
maybe in a particular school or something has occurred, has been tested, a tried and it worked well for the students in that school.

285
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,729
There hasn't been a scientific test on it, but you can talk to the people at that school and they can say, Yeah,

286
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:52,300
we did this, it's successful, and then use that as evidence toward your intervention or is it all of those things?

287
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,129
It's not. So it's a great question.

288
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,460
It's not defined what we mean by lived experience.

289
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:10,330
Right. So I think and I think one of the important points here is that they're trying to open up the definitions instead of closed them.

290
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:10,869
Right.

291
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:23,079
I think our evaluation approaches have been much more rigid and strict here, and I think we're recognizing that that doesn't work in the real world.

292
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:30,430
The real world is messy. Things happen. And does that necessarily mean that the intervention was not successful?

293
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:38,590
Probably not. So to your question, my guess is, is all of the above and be involved.

294
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:55,069
I think for me the lived experience piece is I think of when I was working in the

295
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:04,820
Southwest with indigenous populations and in interventions that might be implemented,

296
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,660
take a step back so the communities would have found.

297
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,459
So I'm just thinking of a physical activity,

298
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:30,470
intervention that perhaps was considered highly successful in the community because there was huge community buy in it consistently.

299
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,930
Every time they had a function that was related to this intervention, lots of people showed up.

300
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,000
There was great discussions and sort of motivated.

301
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:58,220
A lot of enthusiasm and buy in, didn't necessarily mean that it impacted their weight, may not have impacted their risk of diabetes, but for them.

302
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:07,240
The success of the program was much more about the community buy in.

303
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:15,100
And so that's harder to evaluate, right? It's harder to sort of quantify.

304
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:29,469
But I think for me, those are the kinds of lived experiences that we can empirically in our original approaches to evaluation.

305
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,940
We aren't necessarily going to I trying to say here.

306
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,660
We wouldn't have picked up on that with a sort of classical approach to evaluation.

307
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:59,090
Necessarily. So I personally think I liked this association's approach to the whole definition of what does it mean by evidence?

308
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:05,959
So then they go on to define community defined evidence as well as practice based evidence,

309
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,880
which again is very similar to the practice tested that snap it utilizes.

310
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:23,780
So and the other important point here is that this approach also takes into account cultural values and so forth.

311
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,090
So I think this is important. It's nice to this is the change just from last year.

312
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:41,000
So last year they had a very different approach to evidence based.

313
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,370
It was a continuum very similar to the CDC.

314
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:52,820
One is just a vertical way of looking at it. So it went from cutting edge to research testing.

315
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:58,550
So this has just changed in the last year, their policy approach to evaluation.

316
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:07,340
And I think that we're going to be seeing more of this flexibility in how we evaluate programs.

317
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:19,250
Okay. So what I want to do next is just show you sites where you can actually find evidence based interventions and programs.

318
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,530
Guys need to be aware.

319
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:31,740
If you're in any kind of community setting where you're thinking about interventions, it's important to know where you can go to find evidence base.

320
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,670
The community guide is a great resource.

321
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:52,229
If you select stories, it provides examples of where intervention strategies that have been identified by this taskforce,

322
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,380
the Community Prevention Service Task Force, which is affiliated with the CDC.

323
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,480
So you can find examples of where strategies have been implemented in various communities.

324
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:15,060
And it also reviews the strategies that this task force has has identified as being shown to be effective in some manner.

325
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,140
This is a rural health information hub. This is a great resource as well.

326
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:31,590
You just select that you want to look at interventions and then you just before you select this link and

327
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:39,480
then you can find based on topics or you can also find it based on the level of effectiveness or evidence.

328
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:53,360
And these have great topics, you know, diabetes, food security, nutrition, health disparities and so forth.

329
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:06,650
You can see Center for Health Disease Prevention has pretty as examples of interventions that have been shown to be evidence based.

330
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,879
One thing that I want to point out, so you guys are actually going to be using these resources.

331
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,140
I'll explain in a minute. But these resources you'll be using for your last project.

332
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:30,380
I just want to highlight here that up until last year, actually up until this year, there was a center for training and research translation.

333
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:42,140
It was called the Center TRT, and it had a very simple address to get to the organization's website Center TRT dawg.

334
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,690
This center has been absorbed into the U.S.

335
00:44:52,230 --> 00:45:02,640
Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. So if you select this, you are still going to see references to the center TRT.

336
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:13,200
And if you select this link, you're going to end up at a weight management site that later on has all these ads for testosterone and stuff.

337
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:24,570
So somehow this weight management site ended up with this address and it's still out there.

338
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:32,070
For this information, not for the weight management and testosterone.

339
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,870
So I just wanted to give you a heads up because I was in one of the other sites, which I'll show you.

340
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,280
And I was like, Ooh, that looks like an interesting intervention. I selected it and took me to the center trt org which I hit.

341
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,570
And it's the weight management testosterone organization, which is not where I was going.

342
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:58,709
So I just wanted to be aware that the Center for Training and Research Translation

343
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:05,760
is now absorbed into the unseen center Snapp and has some great interventions,

344
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,690
evidence based interventions. So there's a nice link here.

345
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:16,740
CDC has interventions for nutrition, physical activity and breastfeeding.

346
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:29,480
Healthy start. Epicenter. Healthy people to 2030 has evidence based resources, including interventions.

347
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,060
And then there are two links here.

348
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:42,200
The very top is a is a PDF article from Feeding America.

349
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:48,680
On page seven, it has some community based food access interventions.

350
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,629
Some of them are like food pantries. That's our we've already got those interventions,

351
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:59,870
but there are some other interventions like mobile carts and so forth that has

352
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,660
links for you that you can look at and also interventions to increase food access.

353
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:18,350
The CDC website is very useful, so the reason for going over this is one to expose you to where you might find evidence based interventions,

354
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,380
but two, you're going to be using it for your last project.

355
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:38,239
So what you'll need to do is you'll need to identify an intervention that addresses a priority from your needs assessment report so you can use that,

356
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,060
utilize the resources. You don't have to just use the resources I provided, but those will get you started.

357
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:52,550
So over the next week or two, you'll want to identify an intervention program.

358
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:02,500
It needs to be. It needs to the intervention has to have been effective in some manner.

359
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:09,250
So and the resources that I've provided you,

360
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,540
all of those resources provide either a citation or some kind of link or or it may

361
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,370
even be text that demonstrates that was shown to be effective in some manner.

362
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:31,960
Once you find your intervention, what you're going to do is your last project is developing a one pager.

363
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,650
One pagers are a tool that are usually used with policy.

364
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:50,410
So those of you that anybody worked at in Congress or the Capitol, where you have to work with these politicians,

365
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,570
that if there is a particular concern, they may not know much about it.

366
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,370
So a one pager was developed as a way to provide important information for.

367
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:19,280
Legislators to learn about. But it's an advocacy document you're advocating, and it can be used in this context to advocate for an intervention.

368
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:27,530
So you could imagine that you're going to develop this one pager and it's going to be handed out at a stakeholders meeting,

369
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,120
a program planning meeting or a community meeting.

370
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:44,060
So this is actually a skill that you can highlight in a job talk that you have developed a one pager, an advocacy, one pager.

371
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:55,040
In fact, when students in the past have applied for policy jobs especially.

372
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,570
But again, advocacy is, if you remember, Mark Kelly talked about advocacy.

373
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,700
It's important. You guys have all advocated for yourselves applying for grad school.

374
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,000
I mean, we all advocate for ourselves in various capacities.

375
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:15,620
This is an advocacy document to promote our persuade for an intervention.

376
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:21,480
But I've had several students apply for policy job internships.

377
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,810
And one of the questions to be asked, you know, if they have any skills in developing a one pager.

378
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,350
So it's a tangible skill set to be able to have.

379
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:44,030
So this is an example of a community community supported agriculture box or healthy food access for women.

380
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:48,560
So this student was interested in food access. Their target population was women.

381
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:56,210
The very top part of the one pager is really just providing background information stats from

382
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:03,140
the needs assessment that highlight the concerns about women and poor access and so forth.

383
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:09,590
And then the lower part of the one pager is information about the actual intervention,

384
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:18,230
all the different intervention strategies that make up the program, evidence of success and so forth.

385
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,170
So that's your final project is developing the one pager.

386
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,270
So that's why you need to find a intervention first.

387
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:41,570
And I will say that students sometimes get down rabbit holes with their interventions trying to find the perfect intervention.

388
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,240
In this case,

389
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:55,130
you just want to find one tonight because normally you would have plenty of time with other colleagues in the committee to find an appropriate one.

390
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:04,639
You guys don't have a whole lot of time. So find an intervention that addresses one of your priorities and be happy with it.

391
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,150
Because really the ultimate what you're being assessed on is the development of your one pager.

392
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:18,790
So you're not being assessed on, Oh, really? Take this intervention for that priority, really?

393
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,450
No, that's not the breeding process. Where you're getting graded on is your one pager.

394
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:32,239
So I see it over and over again where students are like, Oh, but I really wanted to find an intervention that address this.

395
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,950
And they just wasn't able to.

396
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:40,609
And, you know, two weeks went by, three weeks went by, and then they were scrambling because they finally just decided on one intervention.

397
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,270
But it only gave them a very short period of time to develop that one pager.

398
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,040
So don't let yourself get down a rabbit hole with finding the perfect intervention.

399
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,350
Just find one that works. Yeah. Okay. All right.

400
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:05,690
That's where we're going. Any questions? When, in fact, I'm going to go over that on Monday.

401
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,040
But it's the end of the semester.

402
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:16,640
Yeah, and it's on your course calendar, but I can't remember the specific date, but it's I think it's the first week of the summer.

403
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:24,890
That too. So. So you have the one pager and then you'll have a brief oral presentation,

404
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,690
probably with no more than four or 5 minutes where you just review your intervention and share it with the class.

405
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:42,020
So those are the last two assignments. All right.

406
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,110
That's all I've got. Have a good rest of the weekend and weekend and I will see you on Monday.

407
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,050
Monday, we start talking about cardiovascular disease.

408
00:53:51,470 --> 00:54:04,640
Rachel here will be in next Wednesday to talk about chronic disease interventions in the community.

409
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:16,090
So that's what tomorrow will be like.

410
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:23,990
Oh my gosh. It's like our certifiably science for Dave Original.
