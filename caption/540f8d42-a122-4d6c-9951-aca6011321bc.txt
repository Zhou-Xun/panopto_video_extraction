1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,319
After watching this video,
you will be able to describe the steps of

2
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:18,720
an epidemiological study,
to put it in the context of this course.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,593
I'm listing here the steps that we
follow in any epidemiological study.

4
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:26,540
So as you can see, what is going
to be covered in this course.

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,330
The first thing you do in any
study is identifying a problem.

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,420
Then you formulate a research question.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,630
Then you research background information.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,530
You elucidate a causal model,
you state a hypothesis, and then you start

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,509
designing a study, where you will
identify your measures of interests and

10
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,920
develop data collection instruments.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,461
All these steps you have learned
in previous EPID classes, or

12
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:58,357
you will learn in future EPID classes.

13
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:03,464
In EPID 602, we're going to learn
the final steps when you analyze the data,

14
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:09,030
interpret the results, and report.

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,907
So let me give you an example of
an epidemiological study from my own

16
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,290
research.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,435
A long, long, long time ago,

18
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:22,010
we identified a problem related
triggers of myocardial infarction.

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,911
Let me give you some background.

20
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,526
So as you may know, myocardial infraction
is the cute expression of a chronic

21
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:31,910
disease, that is coronary heart disease.

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,907
For years, and because of a bad diet,
lack of physical activity, smoking and so

23
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:41,770
on, people develop atherosclerosis
in their coronary arteries.

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,350
The arteries that irrigate the heart.

25
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,690
And then one day, those atherosclerosis
plaques may be disrupted, and

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,220
that's what triggers a heart attack.

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,993
Then we formulated a research question
that coffee may trigger a myocardial

28
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:57,896
infarction.

29
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:02,912
And before you think that this does not
make any sense and I'm completely crazy,

30
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:07,783
let me tell you that anything that
activates the sympathetic nervous system,

31
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:12,610
can actually disrupt those
vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,066
And caffeine happens to activate
the sympathetic system.

33
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,280
Remember how awake you feel
after drinking coffee.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,918
So then we elucidated a causal model,
that basically means to throw a dart,

35
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:29,412
with an arrow from your exposure,
coffee, in this case to your outcome,

36
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:30,438
MI in this case.

37
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:33,460
And add all your potential
confounders here, which for

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,680
simplicity I'm not doing it in this slide.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,543
Then we hypothesize that coffee through
sympathetic nervous activation could

40
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:48,112
induce a cascade of events, that result
in a myocardial infarction when in

41
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:51,960
the presence of predisposing factors,
of course.

42
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,736
And we used a case-crossover design for
this study, because case-crossover designs

43
00:02:56,736 --> 00:03:00,240
are particularly good to
study transient portions.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,428
In this study, you only use cases and
instead of comparing cases and controls,

45
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:06,115
you compare the hazard videos.

46
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:09,600
That is the period right before the MI,
with control periods,

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,053
that is periods way
before the MI happened.

48
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,929
That way you want to see if anything
that happened right before the MI,

49
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:21,220
was more frequent than in another control
period when the MI did not happen.

50
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,079
Our measures of interest regarding
this question were acute intake

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,470
of coffee right before MI, and
habitual intake of coffee.

52
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,910
In order to collect this data,
we used questionnaires for both measures.

53
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,959
And then we analyzed the data, and
got a relative risk of 1.49 with that CI.

54
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,094
So then we concluded that our findings
indicate that coffee intake may trigger

55
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:50,660
myocardial infarction, and we reported
that in the form of a manuscript.

56
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,243
Note that many times the data
has been already collected, so

57
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,829
from the identification of
the problem you can jump directly

58
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,611
into formulating your research question,
provided that you can identify study

59
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,914
that has information you need
to test your hypothesis.

60
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:09,580
This is called secondary data analysis.

61
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,903
So to summarize in this course, we're
going to focus on the analysis of the data

62
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,757
exclusively, and
interpretation of the results.

63
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,860
In terms of reporting, we're going to
assume that we're writing a research

64
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,330
article, and
our results will be reported this way.

65
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,130
In summary, in this video we learn about
the steps of an epidemiological study, and

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,711
how to put them in
the context of this course.

67
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,695
In the next video, we will learn
about the structure of an article, so

68
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:41,237
we understand how we will report
our results in this course.
