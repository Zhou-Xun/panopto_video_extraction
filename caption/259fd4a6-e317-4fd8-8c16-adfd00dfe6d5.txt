00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,340
Today, we're gonna give you a little trick to convert any question into a reflection.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,640
It's actually a pretty simple conversion.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,140
Let's start by demonstrating a question and its corresponding reflection.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,661
How frustrating was that for you?

5
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,050
And that's a good open question.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,290
But remember in general we prefer reflections to questions.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,499
So we can instead rather than asking answer it and

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,721
say it sounds like that was frustrating for you.

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,640
Now what's the trick?

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,240
Well, the trick is very simple rather than ask the question, answer it.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,289
Your reflection is your best guess for

12
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:50,040
how your client would have answered your question, skipping the question.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,351
Now you may say why bother?

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,361
Just ask the question.

15
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,758
We'll remember all the benefits of reflections that builds our poor,

16
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:56,790
it carries empathy.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,450
It establishes that I'm trying to track your story better than questions.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,131
So remember we prefer reflections over questions.

19
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,800
So here's a way to get that ratio up that question.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Sorry, that reflection of question ratio.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,940
So what do we mean?

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,840
Here's a client's statement about their addiction or about their smoking, right.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,670
I've tried to quit many times.

24
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,931
I've tried everything.

25
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:19,040
It just doesn't work.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,951
So we could ask, how many times do we try to quit?

27
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,740
We could ask what methods have you used?

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,260
Let's start on the bottom left in the direct conversions.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,140
You've tried many times to quit.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,180
You've tried several approaches to quit.

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,516
Those are substitute reflections that can be used instead of the question, but

32
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,661
remember reflections are preferred.

33
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,126
They keep the conversation rolling better than questions.

34
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:47,474
Now on the bottom right are complex conversions or deeper reflections for

35
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,361
which there really isn't a parallel question.

36
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:54,721
They're just not able questions to capture all this information.

37
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,983
So you've tried several approaches but they haven't worked for you and

38
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,491
you're getting disappointed.

39
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,440
You're getting frustrated.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,940
You wanna try to find something new that's gonna work for you.

41
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,040
You're ready for a change.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,616
Notice how those answers are far more complicated than the actual question.

43
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:15,657
Let's take a look at one other case, client says,

44
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,930
I'm very worried about my diabetes runs in my family.

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,140
I've lost so many relatives too and I wanna break that cycle.

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,401
Here's two reasonable questions.

47
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,340
How many relatives have you lost?

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,740
How have you thought about breaking the cycle?

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,551
You could see these questions are sort of lack warmth and empathy.

50
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:36,860
Yeah, so instead the reflections are generally a better response.

51
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,540
There's a lot of diabetes in your family.

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,140
You might have some thoughts about how to break that cycle.

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,540
You're scared that your diabetes might get worse.

54
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,355
It's really hard to put feelings like that into questions you can but

55
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:55,640
reflections are just a better vessel to carry that.

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,240
So let's remember that sometimes questions are preferred.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,407
Do you recall amounts, frequencies, times, dates for

58
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:11,685
those ask questions but for feelings and for behaviors and

59
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:17,240
for intentions we prefer reflections over questions.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,550
And today we gave you a cool trick for

61
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,672
how to convert your questions into simple and complex reflections.
