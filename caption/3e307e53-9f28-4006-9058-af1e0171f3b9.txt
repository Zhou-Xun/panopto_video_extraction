1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,560
So imagine if you wanted to ask the question, does getting a flu shot reduce people's risk of getting the flu this year?

2
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:22,670
What patterns of exposure and disease would you need to see in order to support that relationship or refute it?

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,670
And how exactly can you get the data on whether or not flu shots are related to flu?

4
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,279
In this particular video.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,390
What I'm going to talk about is the type of data that either supports or refutes associations between exposures and outcomes.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,360
Well, then talk through three different conceptual methods for sampling populations in order to understand exposure and outcome relationships.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,910
So in order to understand how exposure and disease pattern together, we often use a simple table in epidemiology.

8
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm sure you've seen this two by two construct many times before in other classes.

9
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,830
Effectively, what we're doing is counting up the number of people with exposure, without exposure versus the people with disease and without disease.

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,450
So if disease is associated with more or less exposure, we'd expect to see data that would fill out tables like this.

11
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,650
We'll talk a bit more about these two tables later.

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,800
But for now, let's start by asking the question how are we going to get the data that's going to inform these tables?

13
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,720
In an ideal world, with infinite time and money, we could sample the full population.

14
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,350
So basically ask everybody what their exposures are and follow them for health.

15
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,790
Of course, it's really challenging from a cost and time perspective to sample all people in the entire population.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,630
And so what we do is epidemiologists as we take some sample.

17
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,399
One way that we can look at the way that exposure and disease are tracking with one another is

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,190
to recruit people with and without exposure and then follow them for new disease over time.

19
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,850
A second way that we can look at how exposure and outcome track together is that we

20
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,230
can recruit people with and without disease and check on what their exposures are.

21
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,200
Finally,

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,570
it's possible just to recruit a whole group of people all at one period in time and look at their exposures and their disease status at that time.

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:34,540
From all three of these different designs, we can effectively count the number of people with and without exposure, with and without disease.

24
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,200
And again, fill out this type of table to look for associations.

25
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:49,620
Now let's think a little bit about what happens when disease is associated with more exposure in the situation where exposure causes disease.

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,650
We would expect to see a lot of people with exposure and disease because exposure causes

27
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,670
disease and we'd expect to see a lot of people without exposure who are also without disease.

28
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,580
That's because if exposure is causing disease, if you don't have the exposure, then you likely don't have the disease.

29
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,550
For this reason, our table might look something like this where you see large numbers of people in the

30
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,010
exposure disease box and large number of people with the no exposure and no disease.

31
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,590
You'll notice very briefly that there are some people who fall on the other diagonal,

32
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,240
and those folks are really representing either folks who are immune from getting the disease,

33
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,910
or perhaps they're people who are doomed, that they're always going to get the disease no matter what their exposure is.

34
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,530
Now if exposure causes less disease. So in other words, it's protective.

35
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:49,300
What we would expect to see is a large number of people who have the exposure and no disease because exposure protects you from getting the disease.

36
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,390
Similarly, we would expect to see people with disease being the ones who had no exposure.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,990
And so our two by two table would look something like this.

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:10,280
When sampling populations, an absolutely critical component of our study design is that we need to be sampling randomly from the to population.

39
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:19,339
What that means is that we would expect to see in our sample population the same distribution of people falling within that A not be,

40
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:27,140
not, C, not and D not cells as we would from the full population being in the A, B, C and D cells.

41
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,419
If we do that appropriately,

42
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:38,780
then we are in fact able to use a sampling strategy to accurately estimate the association between exposure and outcome in a subset of the population.

43
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,450
This notion of sampling randomly is such that people and all of the cells reflect the full

44
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,880
population as consistent with the notion of exchange ability that we've talked about before,

45
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,530
such that the exposed and your unexposed populations are not differing with respect to

46
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,150
their baseline risk of outcome for any reason other than due to their exposures alone.

47
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,319
So the key takeaways from this particular video are that there is a patterning of exposure and disease in

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,130
population that can inform whether or not exposure causes more disease or whether or not it causes less disease.

49
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:24,100
For harmful exposures, we're going to expect to see more exposed individuals with the disease and more unexposed people without the disease.

50
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,370
In contrast, if an exposure is protective,

51
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:35,050
we're going to expect to see more exposed individuals without the disease and more unexposed people with the disease.

52
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:45,370
By sampling from our populations in order to fill out the two by two table, we're able to get a sense as to how exposure and outcome pattern.

53
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,860
We can do this in three different ways.

54
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,820
One is to sample people without a disease of interest who are exposed and unexposed and then follow them for new disease.

55
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,190
We can also select people based on their health status and then examine their exposure history.

56
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,209
And finally, we can sample people all at the same time,

57
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,300
regardless of their exposure and their outcome status and just count how they fall up into our different boxes.

58
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,629
Now, in the next several videos, we're going to be talking about how these three different core concepts of how

59
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,760
you might sample a population translate into common epidemiologic study designs.
