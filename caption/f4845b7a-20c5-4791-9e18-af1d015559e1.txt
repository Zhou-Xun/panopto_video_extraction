1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,790
High class. As a recap, we have talked about the history of immunization and how immunization has been a major success.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,040
When we think about public health here in this asynchronous lecture for Session seven,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm going to talk about if the success of immunization is equally felt by everyone across the globe.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
So the learning objectives for our electorate today are to describe what global disparities look like in terms of immunization,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,410
and then also critically analyzing what are the underlying causes, implications and potential solutions.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
So we're going to set the stage by introducing the concept of vaccine equity.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,520
Vaccine equity refers to this idea that vaccines should be allocated to all countries based on their needs and not their economic status.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,870
And so the access to and the allocation of vaccines should be considered a human rights issue because we consider that

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,949
it is every human's right to be able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without distinction of race,

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,170
religion, political, belief, economic or any other social condition.

11
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:12,180
But in reality, we often see that political, social, economic and diplomatic challenges affect vaccine equity around the globe.

12
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,040
So here in this figure,

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:23,560
you see that there are stark differences in vaccination rates across countries based on their economic status in high income countries.

14
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,640
You see that around 73% of the population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of the COVID 19 vaccine.

15
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:39,910
And compare this to what what things look like in low income countries where only 24% of the population has been vaccinated.

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,680
Additionally, if you look at the red line at the bottom of this graph,

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,140
you see that there is a considerable lag in the rollout of vaccines in low income countries.

18
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:57,700
And so according to estimates from UNDP, on average, high income countries started vaccination two months before low income countries.

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,280
So now let's zoom out and see what country level or regional differences look like with respect to immunization.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:16,570
On your left, you see a map that indicates higher immunization levels in darker blue, while light yellow indicates lower immunization rates.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,340
We see that Africa and Asia are still behind in getting their populations vaccinated,

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,190
while high income countries have achieved over 74 70% vaccination rates for their populations.

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,760
On the right, you see country level vaccination rates.

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,739
That again, makes the same point that while some countries have vaccinated 90% of their population,

25
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,230
other countries are massively behind, with less than 20% of the population being vaccinated.

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,450
So till now we have focused on COVID related global disparities across countries.

27
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,230
But these disparities are not specific to COVID 19.

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,520
Inequality across country generally refers to measurable differences between countries

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,610
based on national averages that really allow us to make comparisons at a more global scale.

30
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,090
But these disparities are also stark within countries, and so within countries,

31
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,670
inequality refers to measurable differences between population subgroups in the country.

32
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,379
And so within countries, we often see that inequalities exist around social determinants such as economic status,

33
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:34,420
education, sex and place of residence. These are just these determinants were explored by what your report on childhood

34
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,050
immunization and are described in detail in the table that you see on the right hand side.

35
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,360
If you're interested, you can take a deeper look and see how the operationalize these variables.

36
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,899
So now we're going to look at some data from this study which was report on

37
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,310
childhood immunization that assessed inequalities within and across countries.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,780
This report focused on 69 low and middle income countries and evaluated five different indicators that are shown in the table.

39
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,580
On the right, they looked at the BCG vaccine, which is protective against tuberculosis.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:19,120
They looked at measles vaccine, the DTP three vaccine, which is a combined vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

41
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,500
It looked at the polio vaccine and also another variable that they call is the

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,740
full immunization coverage among one year olds other than type of vaccination.

43
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:38,260
The report also evaluated how vaccination rates varied across four dimensions of inequality that we saw in the table on the previous slide,

44
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,600
which includes economic status, mothers, education, sex and place of residence.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,020
So. So let's first talk about inequalities across countries.

46
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,760
We've already seen an example of this with COVID 19, but here in this figure, you see that each circle represents a country.

47
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:05,560
The green line indicates the median value and the shaded area represents the interquartile range.

48
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,380
So let's look at the first column where we see that the BCG, where we see the BCG coverage,

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,310
and it appears that the BCG coverage has a high median national average of around 95%.

50
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:27,880
However, we see that there are between country inequalities, which is really represented by the distance between each of these circles.

51
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:35,710
In the first column for BCG, the circle at the bottom represents a 35% BCG coverage for South Sudan,

52
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,610
compared to 100% coverage in several other countries that you see are clustered at the top within this column.

53
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,950
And so now let's see how between country inequalities look like across types of immunization.

54
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,969
So we see that BCG has the highest national average compared to all other indicators for BCG.

55
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,370
We see that the interquartile range is much shorter than the other four indicators.

56
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,770
So the interquartile range, as a reminder, is the shaded gray area that you see here.

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,350
So for BCG, we see that the interquartile range is much shorter.

58
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,139
So 50% of the study countries reported a national average between 87 to 98%.

59
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,890
So they're kind of clustered together. But if you see the full immunization indicator on your extreme left,

60
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,629
you see a much larger interquartile range suggesting that the degree of inequality

61
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,130
across countries is much larger for the full immunization coverage indicator.

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:47,600
So there are between concrete differences. And those differences also vary across the five indicators that WMU evaluated.

63
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,020
So now that we've observed a crossroad between countries inequalities here,

64
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,850
we're going to talk about within country differences across four different dimensions.

65
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,120
We observe that household income status is associated with increasing immunization coverage.

66
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,940
The figure on the right can be interpreted similar to what we talked about in the last slide.

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,610
What do you do? Divide the country's population into three different categories based on the household income?

68
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,150
So the national average represented by the Green Line tends to increase with increase in household income.

69
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,650
We also observe that there is more variation among the quintile one.

70
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:37,320
So not only is there variation within a country based on economic indicators, but there is variation within the same wealth quintile as well.

71
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:45,600
And when we think about mother's education, it is associated with improved vaccination coverage.

72
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,450
But the report did not observe massive disparities with respect to the place of residence and sex.

73
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,210
Here in this slide, I use the example of Afghanistan to show you how within country differences look like.

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,970
So the horizontal line shows the absolute difference between the maximum and the minimum value.

75
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:16,230
I think that similar to what we've talked about in the previous slide, we see that education and income tend to improve vaccination coverage.

76
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,819
But for urban areas,

77
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:27,090
we see that the coverage is typically higher in rural areas and sex does not seem to drive differences in immunization coverage in Afghanistan.

78
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,280
And so now that we've observed global disparities, let's try to identify the underlying drivers of these disparities.

79
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,580
So let's start with exploring affordability as one of the major drivers of such disparities.

80
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,700
Affordability or price is a determining factor for many low and middle income countries.

81
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,910
And this, of course, poses a significant financial constraint for low and middle income countries.

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,120
In these countries, the annual per capita health expenditure is around $41.

83
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:11,960
And to kind of bring things in perspective. Nicole But 19 vaccine was available for a cost of a cost that ranged between 2 to $40

84
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,480
and d per capita health expenditure for these low income countries is around $41,

85
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,170
which means, according to figures from UNDP, that low income countries would need to ramp up their expenditure,

86
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,590
their health expenditure by 30 to 60% to provide vaccination to 70% of their population.

87
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,630
So there's a massive financial gap that stands in the way of achieving vaccine equity.

88
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,510
It is also important to recognize that these big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca and Pfizer, are based in high income countries.

89
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,340
So in most cases, vaccine production is concentrated in high income countries,

90
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,790
which provides a head start in terms of vaccine rollout to their populations, leaving behind the developing countries.

91
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,450
Another driver of vaccine inequity is access.

92
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,150
In many cases, the vaccine is theoretically available for a population, but factors such as long commute,

93
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:13,030
lack of mobility or not being able to take time off of work to travel to a vaccination

94
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,770
clinic makes vaccines inaccessible to various segments of the population.

95
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:25,150
So with COVID 19, we saw that most vaccines or most vaccine clinics required appointments through online portals.

96
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,950
And so people without access to Internet were not able to take advantage of such initiatives.

97
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,809
And then many lower middle income countries also struggle with ramping up their health infrastructure on ground to set up vaccine clinics,

98
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:44,140
employ additional staff, and develop their infrastructure to appropriately store vaccines that require cold chain storage.

99
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,690
And then think about things like armed conflicts and political unrest in several countries.

100
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,340
That also poses a major hurdle in achieving desired vaccination rates.

101
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:02,740
There's also debate around if intellectual property protections limit access to vaccines for low middle income countries.

102
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,370
Intellectual property protections for vaccines gives pharma companies the opportunity to monopolize

103
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,800
their much needed technology while making vaccines inaccessible to low and middle income countries.

104
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,880
There's debate at the World Trade Organization should also temporary IP vapors,

105
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,460
so vaccines can be manufactured at a low cost by local companies based in low middle income countries.

106
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,129
However, there is another side to this debate.

107
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:34,090
Many people think that IP protections are also essential to spur innovation and it protects rightful ownership.

108
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,370
So if you're interested in this conversation around IP waivers,

109
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,190
you can read about it more in a BMJ BMJ article that I referenced at the end of the slide deck.

110
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,190
And then another potential driver of vaccine inequity is the vaccine hesitancy or the degree to

111
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,620
which populations accept vaccines as an important tool in preventing vaccine preventable diseases.

112
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,880
Here, it's important to recognize that vaccine hesitancy is not something that you can solely blame on individuals.

113
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,320
There are more systemic and institutional factors that result in vaccine hesitancy.

114
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:16,270
So here you see a social ecological model that looks at three different dimensions when measuring intention to vaccinate and vaccine uptake.

115
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,640
So we see there are individual beliefs, values and attitudes affect the way we think about vaccination and public health measures in general.

116
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:33,790
Outside of an individual factors related to our family beliefs, networks we rely on for information also impacts vaccine uptake.

117
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:41,950
And on a broader scale, upstream factors such as institutional policies and public health systems impact decisions related to vaccination.

118
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,559
We have seen historical medical abuses that affected vulnerable segments of the population in the past,

119
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,000
so that results in widespread mistrust in the health system in general.

120
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,260
So I guess the natural question is why do we care or why should we care about these disparities?

121
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,979
Of course, vaccines prevent serious illness. They prevent spread of disease and also prevent deaths from preventable diseases.

122
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,910
And they are important. But unequal access to these vaccines also undermines health equity and often ends

123
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,020
up disproportionately affecting most vulnerable segments of our population.

124
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:26,120
With COVID 19, we've also seen the global disparities are important to address because the longer the virus circulates in the population unchecked,

125
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:33,080
the more likely it is for the virus to mutate, resulting in new variants with different levels of virulence in the city.

126
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:40,639
And countries with lower vaccination rates for COVID 19 are also struggling with lifting travel bans and lockdowns,

127
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,260
which also means that they end up suffering an economic meltdown for a longer period of time.

128
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,660
And so coming to solutions now, since affordability is a major factor that we've already explored,

129
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,160
we need to develop more initiatives that offer fair pricing strategies.

130
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,169
COVAX is a remarkable initiative that brought together governments, W.H.O., UNICEF,

131
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,510
GAVI and other global partners to work to ensure equitable access to COVID 19 vaccines.

132
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:16,970
It's a platform that supports research, development and manufacturing of COVID 19 vaccines and also negotiates for fairer prices.

133
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,430
And so other than that, there are there is a need to develop better ways to collect data on vaccine supply and who gets immunized

134
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,610
so that we can think about resource allocation more effectively and also timely procuring vaccines.

135
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,620
Since vaccine hesitancy is also an important and evolving issue in many countries,

136
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,020
it's important to devise strategies that help to fight myths and disinformation.

137
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:54,320
So thank you. And I'll and we will meet in class to talk more about examples from COVID 19, and we will have a guest lecturer in 7.2 as well.

138
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,820
Thank you.
