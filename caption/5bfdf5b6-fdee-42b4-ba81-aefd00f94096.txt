1
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,580
So. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I do.

2
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,360
I can share them. Through the years.

3
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,350
You don't talk like. Oh, whatever. Okay.

4
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:45,140
Okay, I. Yeah.

5
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:07,620
Of. Watch how she like what she's doing.

6
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,990
You know, in the morning, everybody, we go to class.

7
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,940
If you're all having an enjoyable week, then the cooler weather.

8
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,360
Um, I just want to we're going to talk about inequality today.

9
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,680
We're going to get into one of our first student presentations. Victoria is going to be speaking after the break.

10
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,450
Before we start, I just wanted to welcome C.J to the class.

11
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,200
He's joined us. Do you want to give us a little bit of that background about.

12
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:48,140
Yeah. Um, so I'm. It stands for Christian School and I'm a medical student, so I just finished my third year of medical school.

13
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm doing a 42 credit MPH, I'm applying into emergency medicine.

14
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,940
Um, and I took ten years off after undergrad before starting school.

15
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,930
So I did. Did not know I was into medicine.

16
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,340
So I had a career in politics and then also lived in East Africa for five years.

17
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,620
But now my world is medicine and you're just raging.

18
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,470
Yes, yes. That's a wonderful thing.

19
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,660
And I think we all have similar kinds of diverse experience in your life.

20
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,640
And Lexie, I wondered if you would just take a few minutes to just tell the class about the first opportunities.

21
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,850
And for those of you who don't know about the opportunities to engage in that program.

22
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,190
Yes. So Fast stands for Public Health Action Support Team and the application actually closes, I want to say, next week.

23
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,909
So you have to apply for it. But I think as long as you complete the application, it's usually it's a little longer.

24
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:56,470
But yeah, it's a good opportunity to go out and engage with community partners.

25
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,950
This past week there was a deployment to Kentucky to complete CASPIR, so community assessments.

26
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:12,850
And so they went out and did surveys to see what the community needed after the flood, after the floods down in Kentucky.

27
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,040
And I want to say they did like 52 or something like that, but it's not just like big deployments.

28
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,750
They do things here in Ann Arbor with different organizations and.

29
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,180
Things like. Writing.

30
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:41,330
Different organizations will come and they'll say, Hey, we need help writing for like with different like.

31
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,590
I'm trying to think how to describe it. I think evaluations.

32
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,989
Yeah, like evaluations and stuff. And then we'll have meetings and things.

33
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,750
And if people want to hop on those projects, they'll work together.

34
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:03,700
Or sometimes it might be like an individual thing, but it's just a good opportunity for like public health practice and things like that.

35
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,230
Yeah, no, absolutely. Anyone else done that involved in that?

36
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,830
Even didn't someone from the country. You can talk to that.

37
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:22,559
For that. And then I was not. I think so, I think.

38
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,060
And I. I would really like to know more about it.

39
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,870
Yeah, let me see. Yeah, it is an amazing irony as that.

40
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,579
Like as a researcher as well, you often feel like it's so great to be able to use that resource.

41
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,850
If we have, you know, a community group that we're trying to work with to do and housing assessment for people with disabilities,

42
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,850
we've just, you know, reached out to the foster and safe organizers.

43
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,610
Can you help us? Is this a project that would be something that your group could help us, you know, engage in?

44
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:04,410
So it's a track that these organizations. If I look w Miss Fast, I'm like, There's a website here.

45
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,640
I just do it because I'm doing okay.

46
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:19,260
If you can post those. All right.

47
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,060
We're only half ready.

48
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,720
Let me know if any of you help. And something very convincing to try it out.

49
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,050
Thank you. Thank you very much. It's great to have someone. Well, you know, I'm always curious to see, like,

50
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,520
what the perspective is with the aging populations as well and how much interaction there is or knowledge that comes out of that.

51
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,510
All right. So today we're going to be talking about aging inequality.

52
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,679
My goal is to really situate our thinking about inequality within systems of power,

53
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,979
systems of inequality that are that are socially created based on characteristics of individuals,

54
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,580
whether they be their sex or gender or race, ethnicity or age.

55
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:13,370
And so the outline for today is we're going to be kind of going through different kinds of of health inequities by engaging by race,

56
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,160
ethnicity, sex, gender, socioeconomic status.

57
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:23,930
We'll talk a little bit about intersectionality and how these things are kind of combined together to create a unique risk situation.

58
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,670
And we'll talk as well about a little bit about immigrant status and nativity.

59
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,440
We'll take a break and then we have our first student presentation, as I said after the break.

60
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,090
Victoria is going to be presenting on one of the papers that looks at inequalities in older Asian Americans.

61
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:49,700
And then we'll have an opportunity to engage in some class discussion and some small groups as well as within the larger group,

62
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,300
to really dove in and talk about this particular issue.

63
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:00,560
So that's the overall plan. Before we jump in, are there any questions anyone had about the course, the readings,

64
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,540
the canvas site, anything anybody wanted to bring up and ask for changes?

65
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,510
All right. Okay.

66
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
So who ages? Who gets to age?

67
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,710
Who ages in good health? And why do we see differences like that?

68
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,680
So in the first class of this semester, we talked I showed you this graph, which was showing it was one for men, one for women.

69
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,680
This is the just remind me what the male graph looks like, that compared to other high income countries in the world,

70
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,010
the United States is being consistently lagging behind in terms of increases in life expectancy at birth.

71
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,110
So in general, there's been these increases in life expectancy that's been happening over time.

72
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,370
But the U.S. is slowing down and not increasing the same way.

73
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,680
And recent data that just came out in August of this year shows that that pattern of

74
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,690
declining life expectancy relative to other high income countries is persisting,

75
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,790
especially since COVID.

76
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:14,870
And so the the the link here actually takes you where you can toggle on all the other different countries, and you'll see that,

77
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,250
in fact, Australia and Japan continue to persist in having increases in life expectancy even during the pandemic.

78
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:31,610
Most other countries kind of had a dip down, but the United States has had a dip down that's more precipitous and has not

79
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,990
rebounding to the same in the same extent that it is for other high income countries.

80
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,680
So if we're talking about inequalities in aging and inequalities in health from a global perspective,

81
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,440
the United States is in a position of inequality. And we can think a little bit about why that is and what's what's driving that.

82
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:58,120
Some of the insights can kind of do that by looking at how these changes in life expectancy pattern by race and Hispanic origin.

83
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,540
This is the same data I showed you before from the same site,

84
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:10,330
but it's breaking it down by looking at changes in life expectancy at birth by these different groups from 2019 before the pandemic.

85
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,690
The first year after the pandemic and then in 2021.

86
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,140
Again, these data were just released in August of 2022.

87
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:28,510
So what do we see here? We see that, in fact, the greatest drop in life expectancy happened among American Indians and Alaska Natives.

88
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:37,240
So it's a precipitous drop in their life expectancy from 2019 to 2020 and then again in 2021.

89
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:47,270
So this particular graph is showing the groups that are at the greatest risk of life expectancy declines

90
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:55,010
and shows that there is like these structural inequalities that persist in many ways through life.

91
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,850
We talked about the life course last time, but how?

92
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,400
Inequalities in access to resources, potentially in employment.

93
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,219
American Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest prevalence of diabetes populations,

94
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,880
putting them potentially at greater risk for mortality during the pandemic.

95
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:21,100
The other population that has that notable decline is the non-Hispanic black population.

96
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,380
Again, dramatic drop in the first year of the pandemic.

97
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,050
Leveling out a little bit more in the second year.

98
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:35,390
So you can see that there's the pandemic hit the American population in different ways among different groups.

99
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,170
And this is actually attributing those changes in life expectancy to leading causes of deaths.

100
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,210
And 50% of those changes is due to COVID 19.

101
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,480
So that drop that's occurring isn't COVID 19. This is just for the total.

102
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,210
The data in that on that site that I could provide the link for gives you male and female breakdowns.

103
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,320
The other thing that's driving it as well is unintentional injuries. So once this.

104
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:13,820
It's like people taking selfies all of the time. I mean, it's like a big rig, you know, increasing that.

105
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,330
So they go up to like those abandoned buildings and take those really cool selfies.

106
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:25,579
I think it's cool that, like, they take it anyway and they go out sometimes and that's unintentional.

107
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,870
Definitely. I wonder if that's the magnitude to drive that it could be part of it.

108
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,000
Fatalities from car crashes increasing, too. Yes.

109
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,639
Yes. They decline in the pickup because people weren't on the road.

110
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,680
But then they started to increase again because I think people were saying it's because people became

111
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,819
very reckless when they were driving during a pandemic because no one was on the road at the speed.

112
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,710
And then when everyone started coming back on the road, I mean, no one knows if this is the reason, but that was in some.

113
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,910
Speculation. What else might be in this category?

114
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,410
Actually half of what's in this category is opioid overdose.

115
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,350
So that's also what is driving that as well.

116
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,530
But there have been some of those losses have been offset by less mortality in terms of influenza and pneumonia.

117
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,520
So then, you know, this process of protecting ourselves through the pandemic wearing masks has actually cut down on deaths from influenza.

118
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,590
So this just gives you an idea of some of these things. How they're playing out.

119
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:41,180
If we look at how, in fact, COVID actually is the third leading cause of death in the United States, particularly for older Americans.

120
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,760
So people aged over 65. This graph just shows you the distribution of those leading causes of death by age group.

121
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,820
So this is age 65 to 74 and this is age 85 plus.

122
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,639
So in the early phase of the pandemic, you know, I don't think you can see this as well.

123
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,150
This is coded here, cancer, heart disease coded.

124
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,760
And then for the second part of the phase of the pandemic for this group.

125
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,960
Cancer, heart disease and COVID. So COVID is the third leading cause of death in that age group.

126
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:21,750
And then for the older adults, it's heart disease, predominantly, then COVID and then cancer again.

127
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,990
And the same kind of flipping over here in the pattern here. So it's actually driving so much of the loss of life expectancy.

128
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,010
We have a new kind of primary cause of death that's occurring.

129
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:41,129
And we think of I showed you this again in the first the first class of the semester showing,

130
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:48,420
which is you're looking again at how much life expectancy people can expect to live beyond the age of 65.

131
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,210
So when someone reaches the age of 65, how many years of life expectancy do they have left?

132
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,290
There's been increases, but we see that there is this persistent inequality by race and by gender as well.

133
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,549
And so we dove a little bit more in thinking about what that means when we can look at these COVID related death data,

134
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,090
which is change in life expectancy at birth by race in Hispanic origin.

135
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,069
This is similar to the graph I showed you before, but it breaks it out by gender as well,

136
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,000
for men and for males and females across the different race ethnic groups.

137
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:29,189
So of course, we can see once again that the greatest declines in life expectancy occurred for the American

138
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:38,070
Indian Alaska Native population decline of seven years of life between 19 2019 and 2021,

139
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:50,280
by June 2020. Sorry. And then both for men and women for his very also dramatic life expectancy losses for Hispanic

140
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,140
males in the early part of the pandemic and for non-Hispanic non-Hispanic black males.

141
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:08,790
So again, why are these particular groups so much more at risk for declines in life expectancy?

142
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:20,270
During the pandemic in the early period of the pandemic. Victoria.

143
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,770
I know that there's been a lot of issues but getting access and.

144
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:33,209
Sovereignty over reservations and getting back for American Indian American Indians and Alaskans,

145
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:40,200
though that has but some have done really well in COVID guidelines.

146
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:48,710
I think the Navajo Nation have like on early cases and they were pretty, uh, had it under control.

147
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,430
But in other areas that have a little bit more of a gray zone where there's been fighting

148
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,510
or they're in predominantly red states and things like that where they can't get vaccines.

149
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,460
That's been contributing a lot. Right.

150
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:10,710
So the kind of the structures in which the segregation essentially happens to cut people off from access to resources or reduced access to resources.

151
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,830
That's a that's a really good point. And that anything extends to Hispanic black populations as well.

152
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:24,870
Due to racial segregation and historic redlining that has concentrated poor resources structurally

153
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,250
have fewer resources to access in terms of healthy food and opportunities to just have clean air,

154
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:41,940
being able to be physically active things, you know, trying to try to offset the stresses and the the health consequences of the pandemic as well.

155
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:53,480
The other additional piece of information that happened in the pandemic is that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were often part of the essential,

156
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,220
more likely to be essential workers.

157
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:08,360
So being exposed to being in service jobs and having to continue to to work, not being able to kind of be in this kind of white collar work from home.

158
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:20,750
So just being put more at greater risk through occupation. So that kind of thinking about structurally what risk factors are embedded within

159
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,450
people's histories based on how they're sorted into different kinds of jobs,

160
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,730
different kinds of employment, employment, whether or not it has adequate health insurance to compensate for the pandemic and the challenges therein.

161
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,410
These are all the processes that are kind of churning away underneath that are invisible, that actually may be driving some of these trends.

162
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:52,100
The other thing that's interesting here is that these data suggest for this data show that next to no panic,

163
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,830
American Indians and elastic native Alaska Natives,

164
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:06,630
the second greatest drop in life expectancy in this period from 2020 to 2021 is, in fact, among white Americans.

165
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,670
So we can see this here, these bars here, these light blue bars are the drop.

166
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,280
So we can see that this is the biggest light blue bar dropped for this appeal to the American Indian population.

167
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,990
But over here, there's this larger drop here that for white women is in fact, greater than for black women.

168
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:41,049
This was a pretty kind of, I don't know, a shocking finding that a population that has been typically considered to be more advantaged in society is,

169
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:47,590
in fact, having the greatest loss of life expectancy next to American Indians and Alaska Natives.

170
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:56,560
So what do you think is driving that? Nobody really knows, right?

171
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:07,760
We're just going to speculate. I remember that Justin was saying, so Justin can't stay in a class anymore.

172
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,969
But he remember in one of his previous classes,

173
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,630
he said that in the emergency room they were seeing so many more white patients with COVID more recently,

174
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,919
whereas in the early stages of the pandemic, it was just so you know, it was just everybody.

175
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,580
But then it was really cutthroat among the white population.

176
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:35,690
What are you what are the potential reasons for that? My tendency to wear.

177
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,650
Political leanings. Yeah.

178
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,670
I think that's what people kind of well, that's certainly what our data show.

179
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:04,980
We've done some work looking at political partizanship by neighborhood, by counties and how the case rates over time.

180
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,969
And we see specific there's different phases of the pandemic.

181
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:16,740
In the early days of the pandemic, in fact, Democratic counties were the ones with the highest rates of COVID,

182
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,220
and that was typically because they were in more of the concentrated urban areas.

183
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:30,060
But as the pandemic involved evolved and vaccines started to come out, the, um, the areas that were that are actually at greatest,

184
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,870
had the greatest prevalence of the, of the virus were in Republican leaning counties within Republican led states.

185
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:48,840
So where you have state policies that might not be mandating, you know, business closures or mask wearing,

186
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:56,040
and then if you have a very concentrated county that's Republican leaning, that's where the high case numbers were.

187
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:04,740
Um. The vast majority of Republican of the members of the Republican Party are non-Hispanic white.

188
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,090
And so, you know, that's again, it's not causal, but that's what people are thinking is is what's driving some of this.

189
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,220
It could also be that unintentional injuries as well, the opioid overdoses.

190
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,130
But it's something to think about as we think about aging and what it could mean for

191
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:29,910
future cohorts coming through and sort of who's at greatest risk as well as older people.

192
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:36,160
You know, this is this isn't broken out by age. Any questions on that?

193
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,930
We just we were just asked to give a commentary on this in the Journal.

194
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,569
So it's interesting to see it's quite it's a bit of a contentious topic,

195
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,400
but it's the data are very, very interesting for understanding the health of this this country.

196
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,840
So what are the pathways by which race ethnicity can impact healthy aging?

197
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,790
We talked a little bit about this, but really, you know,

198
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:15,310
local economies that are reliant on lower wage jobs as essential workers and large proportions of the community lacking health insurance,

199
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:25,330
adequate health insurance, segregation, restricting access to resources, but also increasing exposure to air pollution and polluting sites.

200
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,020
Access to quality medical care. Marital status and tenancy.

201
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,910
You know, whether people who are black women are more likely to be single and single parents compared to white women.

202
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:46,599
How does that shape their trajectories of aging with respect to being able to accumulate wealth in

203
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,320
pensions across the life course and then psychosocial psychosocial factors such as racism and vigilance,

204
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,140
stress, but also resilience, which is the, you know, that sense of being able to just break that.

205
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:10,440
One of the most interesting ways in which I think health is patterned by race and ethnicity is through the role of education.

206
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,750
So we know that the quality of education over the life course has changed dramatically, and it's also very different by different race ethnic groups.

207
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,850
So in 1900, about 53% of whites were enrolled in school, compared to only 30% of blacks.

208
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,670
And then by 1940, we see that it increase and that enrollment has increased more for blacks and for whites.

209
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,500
And that gap has narrowed, but it's still a difference.

210
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:48,110
About 80% of the blacks that are age 65 and older today actually were born in highly segregated Jim Crow South.

211
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,420
Regardless of the region of residents now, so they're sort of early life exposures.

212
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:01,480
Data show that their school year was, in fact, significantly shorter than whites in the earlier part of the 20th century.

213
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:07,610
So a lot of data going back and getting the school records and understanding school

214
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,800
characteristics for blacks compared to whites show that blacks had shorter,

215
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,020
had less school, shorter amount of number of months in school, that shorter school days,

216
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:26,360
fewer less access to quality education resources and the consequences that for that for aging are important to think about,

217
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,590
especially with respect to something like dementia and cognitive function, which is so highly and strongly patterned by education.

218
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,620
So education is one of the greatest factors that contributes to dementia risk.

219
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,549
It's thought that it's something to do with many different mechanisms,

220
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:48,410
and we'll go into it when we talk about cognition and dementia later in the in the course.

221
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:59,120
But you can see that this graph show this is data coming from the health and retirement study from 2000 to 2014 and that over time,

222
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:12,110
non-Hispanic blacks aged 75 plus have a much higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic whites of that age.

223
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:19,280
But then looking at the differences, those differences are less pronounced for age 65 to 74.

224
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,970
So again, this is where we see the cohort difference, right?

225
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:31,780
So. Black Americans that were exposed to segregation in their youth and their poor quality education have a much

226
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:40,660
dramatically different trajectory and prevalence of dementia compared to those who aged a little bit later.

227
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,600
And we didn't export exposed to that same level of risk in terms of educational disadvantage.

228
00:27:50,110 --> 00:28:01,139
Questions. Comments. All right, so now we're gonna talk about inequality by sex and gender.

229
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,100
So women have a greater life expectancy than men.

230
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,810
Women live longer than men.

231
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:16,260
However, they also experience more stress, poor health and more areas of disability compared to men across the life course.

232
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,019
So here's a graph showing you differences in the prevalence of disability.

233
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:28,770
It comes from the National Health Interviews Survey, disability, two different types of disability,

234
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:34,110
difficulty doing errands alone and difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions.

235
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:41,130
So more than a cognitive disability and the yellow bars are the women and the blue bars are men.

236
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:49,409
And you can see that across all age groups, especially when they get into the older age,

237
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:57,900
is that women report more difficulty with cognitive function and they report more difficulty with things like doing errands alone.

238
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:10,410
Doing errands alone is a marker of function. It means the capacity to be able to be mobile, to get somewhere, to navigate a grocery store or a bank,

239
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,990
to communicate, to just be relative, just to be a marker of independence.

240
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:25,860
So why do you think that women have more disability than men then when they're over the age of 65?

241
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,810
Is it because they are in worse health? We know they live longer.

242
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:56,770
Is this is this a selection bias that because women live longer, they are more likely to become in worse health and disability,

243
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:02,380
whereas the men, because they're dying earlier, don't actually reach this point to become disability.

244
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,100
Victoria. At this age, women also go through greater biological changes.

245
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:19,550
So menopause and changes in hormones that we know cause biological issues like cancers or are less pregnant or osteoporosis,

246
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:30,290
things that impact mobility, whereas men are generally fine through don't die and in that way hormonal changes.

247
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Yeah, that's a good point. But I thought. Things.

248
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:50,290
Tends to retire. My cup of tea and saucers.

249
00:30:53,010 --> 00:31:01,480
And people who are aged tend to live in a society that tends to be the dominant.

250
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,790
And that's why when people in the younger group is more.

251
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:15,750
Is sexual equal to this little girl, more like having to with status in your family but for the older situations.

252
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,890
Yeah. Those are good points. I think one of the readings today was talking about aging and gender differences in retirement in South Korea.

253
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:35,480
Points to that. And it's very similar in thinking about the United States context is that women are typically not consistently in a career role.

254
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:46,170
They're moving in and out of the workforce to do unpaid labor in child care or family care, which can disrupt their earning potential.

255
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,090
And that then can have consequences as they age later in life,

256
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,970
particularly if they age as a single woman and without the resources of a men's pension,

257
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:07,590
potentially their husbands pension or or even if they they just don't accumulate the same wealth.

258
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:15,570
So that's that's certainly a structural issue that's shaped women's opportunities for socioeconomic position, which could be driving this.

259
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:35,120
Anybody else have other thoughts? And when the men retire, as they often have nothing to do, so they can just add and go play and have fun.

260
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:46,820
But they may have to focus more on their health and keep focused on their household or educating their grandchildren.

261
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,620
Yeah, there's a lot of interesting ideas in there, and I think that's really useful to think about, especially next week,

262
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,640
we're going to get into this idea about sort of what the expected role for people when they retire and what do what is sort of men's,

263
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,389
you know, stereotype of about, you know, going off golfing and women's stereotypes.

264
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:14,210
So we'll get into some of that and how they may or may not be, in fact, the reality.

265
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:21,080
Good thing. Yes, the question is, so how do they really like qualify as being like disabled?

266
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,310
Like it is even like one like let's say like hip replacement wasn't causes like disability.

267
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:36,560
So these are self-reported disabilities. So if someone's saying, I have trouble doing something, I have difficulty walking across the room.

268
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,090
The reason that's the that's the disability is a self-report.

269
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,020
The underlying reason for that could be the hip replacement.

270
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:51,709
The knee replacement could be arthritis. It could be that I have, you know, amputation.

271
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:58,520
I only have one leg. So the underlying reasons are what is the the potential source?

272
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,970
But the disability is a difficulty in doing something that that is partly due

273
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,150
to the condition but also can be modified by social supports or other issues.

274
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,380
Yeah,

275
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:21,080
there is like a higher prevalence for like such like replacement surgeries among like female patient and elderly female patients are higher than like,

276
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,250
you know, male patients for sure. Right. And what is why do you think that is?

277
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,670
Oh, I honestly think it's just like a biological thing.

278
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,430
So like arbitrary. I mentioned like menopause after that.

279
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:37,310
There is like I think there's if I remember correctly, I'm not guaranteed for that.

280
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,920
There is like a sufficient new stuff like, you know, like bulk quality.

281
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,880
So that leads to like they're like, let's say, like hip problem and the problem.

282
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:57,229
Right. Right. Exactly. And I think also, you know, women as they get older, tend to be living alone because they have a greater longevity.

283
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,810
Their spouse might die like before them.

284
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,980
Living alone is a greater risk factor for falls, which is the great, you know, is the leading cause of the hip fractures.

285
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,570
So those could be some of the other processes. So you said these were self-reported, right?

286
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,920
Yeah. So they there could be some under-reporting,

287
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:25,640
especially like in like there is that stereotype of like men or like I happen to feel like this stuff kind of thing.

288
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,730
Yes. Yes, exactly. That's a good point.

289
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,690
So men's now, I don't have any difficulty doing errands alone, even if they they might.

290
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,030
That's a good point. What are the other things that.

291
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,680
Go ahead, C.J., can I just ask the big clarifying question? With most, what pension plans do you think your partner dies?

292
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,130
Does that stop? I know with health insurance, that's typically the case.

293
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,800
The health insurance stops. Yeah. Is that the same with pension?

294
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:59,130
Pensions? It's. It's different in different countries. The United States, the year you can receive receive the pension of your husband.

295
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,720
If you're divorced, you've received some of the pension of your husband.

296
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,710
I think compared to South Korea that we read about in the readings today, it's much less there.

297
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,050
So the system is actually not to give as much of the pension from the men.

298
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:19,720
Even if you're divorced to the the surviving spouse. Yeah.

299
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,050
So different systems of inequality in different countries.

300
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,640
The other thing that's driving this I think as well is the different kinds of health

301
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,700
conditions that men and women have over the and the and at the particularly in later life.

302
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:43,010
So men more likely be, you know, die from a heart attack or a stroke and more sudden, whereas women,

303
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,750
which is what only we're seeing as well, will end up with these kind of more chronic conditions like,

304
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:56,389
um, you know, arthritis, which can then sort of progress to make people have more challenges in just getting around and doing things,

305
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:04,790
getting to the grocery store. And that's what we see in this, in this plot, which is just showing the prevalence of selected conditions by age.

306
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,580
The blue line are the women, the red line or the men. So women are more likely of this, you know, to report.

307
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,600
This is data from the National Health Insurance Survey. Things like headaches and arthritis.

308
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,760
This is the thing that's driving, you know, really driving disability and functional problems,

309
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:30,020
whereas men will be more likely to have cardiovascular disease and emphysema.

310
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:40,460
So those kinds of things can shape people's functional health at later life and it can also shape their self-rated health status over the life course.

311
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,399
So this just says, you know, this is your self-rated health.

312
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,230
When someone asks you, which is a classic, powerful question, how would you rate your health?

313
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:56,270
Excellent. Very good. Good, fair or poor? It's a very simple measure, but it's very strongly tied to a lot of health outcomes and mortality.

314
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:04,400
Women rate their health more poorly than men over most of the life course.

315
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:12,010
We've talked about this a little bit with depression, but it's you know, it could be that they are experiencing more of these kind of chronic.

316
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:22,610
Mild conditions like the headaches or, um, you know, the arthritis that can kind of wear you down but aren't so dramatic.

317
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:29,810
You know, the ones, the kinds of men experience which are more sudden than the lead to mortality so that you don't experience this poor health.

318
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:39,710
All this to say is that there's a lot of differences in health for men and women, and the reasons are biological, social, psychological, multifaceted.

319
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,050
And they play out over the life course in terms of systems of opportunities.

320
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,870
And then the issue you talked about this, which is, you know,

321
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,460
what is the also sort of underlying reason for some of these health disparities by gender in terms of earnings?

322
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:09,260
Women earn less than men. There was a recent article that came out very recently that showed that even graduates,

323
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,010
recent graduates from university, I think they looked at them three years after graduation.

324
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:21,350
Women are earning less than men in very similar jobs.

325
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:30,620
So this is still prevalent. It's still an issue. And so that can actually have obviously consequences for subsequent health and subsequent late life

326
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:39,739
ability to to be able to access the resources that you need to be able to access quality health care,

327
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:49,370
to be able to access and, you know, live in environments that can provide clean air resources for maintaining health.

328
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,090
So this is just summarizing that women do have a lower earnings.

329
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:04,460
They have shorter periods in the workforce because typically they are responsible for the family responsibilities and pension contribution.

330
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,720
This is what C.J. was asking, that much of the income in old age, such as Social Security, is based on years worked.

331
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,090
So how many years you're in the workforce actually tells you how much money you're going to get when you retire?

332
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,660
For women who have to cycle in and out of the workforce, we may have to say going out of the workforce for childbearing and child,

333
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,870
carrying both for children, but also for their their parents.

334
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:35,870
Actually then cuts in to that ability to accumulate income in later life, even though they're having to live longer with it.

335
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:44,450
And in the U.S., women can receive the Social Security benefits of their husband's earnings in Korea,

336
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,990
in the paper, that shows that they're actually getting somewhat less.

337
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,280
So there's actually very different kinds of patterns of eligibility in benefits based on age and histories of working.

338
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,620
So talking about money and cash in such economic position.

339
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:09,139
Let's talk a little bit more about this. So part of the reason why, you know, race and ethnicity and gender are systems of inequality.

340
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,420
And the way that those structures manifest in terms of poor health outcomes is related to a lot

341
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,790
of the ability or the structures and the consequences for educational and income attainment.

342
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,349
Some of the early studies looking at differences in health by socioeconomic position were the White House studies,

343
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:34,069
and these are going back into the sixties. But it was the first evidence that people in different sort of occupational classes,

344
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:40,220
professional versus sort of more administrative classes, had very different health and different life expectancy.

345
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,330
So this was a sort of opening up this new idea of thinking about health with respect to socioeconomic status.

346
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,840
But what is socio economic status? It's such a bundle of different people say it's a bundle of cognitive,

347
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,590
social and material resources that can help you acquire advantages and avoid adversities over the life course.

348
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:08,120
We typically measure them measure X by education, income, occupation or wealth.

349
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,559
So I'm going to dove a little bit deeper in here to think about how we might measure this

350
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,180
with respect to older people and what how what's the best measure to try and capture this?

351
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:27,680
So income, right? That's cash. That's what we have is variable in U.S. society, a very powerful commodity.

352
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:36,979
It captures the ability to kind of cope with illness, control, progression, to be able to access the gym, have a gym membership,

353
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:43,170
to be able to be physically fit, to go to healthy food stores, which are often more expensive than going to Myers.

354
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:51,860
It's it's useful in being able to model differences in income over time because people's income changes.

355
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:59,090
And so you can actually then look at how trajectories of income are affecting trajectories of change in health.

356
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:08,030
Sometimes people will use measures of proxies of income, like whether you own a home or whether you rent, whether you own a car.

357
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,360
These are typically these are measures that are in the census, actually, and many people use them as kind of proxies for income.

358
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,280
Disadvantages though, try to use income to capture socio economic position in later life is that you've got to make decisions

359
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,780
about whether you're going to be talking about household income or someone's individual income.

360
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,899
And you, you know, you may be part of a household where there is a large household income,

361
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,969
but you may not have access to that as an individual either because you are the spouse of that

362
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,220
person who has a separate bank account or you are an older person living with your family,

363
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,520
but you don't have access to those same household income resources.

364
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,000
Something to think about income versus wealth.

365
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,870
So when people retire, they typically don't have the same income,

366
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:01,320
but they have a lot of money that's held in things like their house or their car or their second home.

367
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:10,800
One of the big challenges with for using income as a measure of SARS is that is frequently missing in a lot of data sets.

368
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:17,360
So those of you that work with datasets like the Health and Retirement Study or the National Health and Aging Trends,

369
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:24,560
that or other studies, if you ask somebody in a survey how much income they have.

370
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,549
Americans do not like to answer that question. So that's frequently missing.

371
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,960
And there's different ways that we try in our surveys to get around that.

372
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:43,900
You know, when we we have a whole protocol that we ask in the Americans Changing Life study, it's a form questionnaire, phone interview.

373
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,340
And the interviewer asks, you know, what is your what is your annual household income?

374
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,260
And then the respondent says, We prefer not to answer.

375
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:58,669
So the interviewer says, I know that you don't want to answer this, but can you tell me, is it over 100 or less than 100?

376
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,820
And then people might be more inclined to say, okay, I can answer that.

377
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,620
And then you can push them even further. If they say it's less than 100 or is it between 50?

378
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:12,440
And so you can see how far you can push them to at least get a number and number because it's such a powerful driver of health.

379
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,530
We need to know what their income is. So that that is that is one of the challenges.

380
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:25,580
And so when they do such like research about income and the health outcomes, do they take into consideration,

381
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,510
like most of time, the household income because it does make a big difference?

382
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:36,050
Why do you think that makes a difference? I mean I mean, when you guys are applied to you,

383
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:42,560
when they ask about like household income so they know like if they ask for zero income, it's probably going to be zero.

384
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:50,810
Yeah. But when you ask for household income, it can be like, you know, like a half million or sometimes higher.

385
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,500
Yeah. So that's like, of course, like, you know, zero.

386
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:04,220
And let's just say that does like where in terms of like research, it does make like a big difference in terms of like the association.

387
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,170
Yeah, I agree. I think most people do use household income. Typically, that's typically what's used.

388
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,379
And the way people get around missing data, by the way, also is multiple amputations.

389
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,000
And that's typically what you'll see. But then you get into the issue of having multiple data sets and using.

390
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,910
Techniques to account for that.

391
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,370
The other issue with you is looking at the relationship between income and health is that there could be issues of reverse causality.

392
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,629
Right.

393
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:35,260
So someone who's got a reasonable income is going at a long time and then all of a sudden they get in a car crash and they have a spinal cord injury.

394
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:44,440
They're not able to work anymore and their income plummets or they get into what could look like the you know,

395
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,710
your income is predicting your risk of your low income is predicting your risk of having a spinal cord injury when in fact, it's the other way around.

396
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:58,210
And so that's one of the challenges with with income is being able to know how it sequences over time.

397
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:07,090
So well, we just talked about as well captures more than just income. It's especially relevant for people post retirement.

398
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,640
It is a little bit challenging to measure. So this is the question in the Health Retirement Study, which asks about wealth.

399
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:21,760
So the interviewer, again, this is over the phone. Do you or your spouse partner have any real estate other than your main home and your second home,

400
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:28,420
such as land, rental, real estate, a partnership or money owed to you on a land contract or a mortgage?

401
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,080
And then someone says, yes. If you sold all of that and paid off any death, how much would you get?

402
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:44,030
How I mean, how accurately can people say, this is a thousand different things here and I'm trying to think if I sold it all.

403
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,490
How do you know? Same things with stock. So very difficult to to capture.

404
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,480
Well anybody use any wealth variables in their analysis I in their work.

405
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:59,139
Yeah I use the American changing lives does that for my master's thesis and we are

406
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,990
fortunate in that they have gone through the pain of aggregating every measure of wealth.

407
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:11,350
So there is like an income on. But because the population is I think the lowest age now is like 55.

408
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,440
So a majority of the remaining participants are retired.

409
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:22,000
It makes my job a lot easier because it's like total wealth instead of just income, which includes income,

410
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,610
but it also includes pension, it includes Social Security and homeownership and things like that.

411
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:36,669
So, yes. But there are, I think, 400 variables over the six waves that relate to wealth over the years.

412
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,930
So there's a lot of parsing. Yeah.

413
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,420
Yeah. Did you find that it was more important than income?

414
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:51,790
Yes, because by the time we get to 86, I and my subset is much smaller, it's 299 people.

415
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,800
We have six income is missing 185 entries.

416
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:04,450
So the refusal to answer yeah, so we are using we kind of had to create a variable that looks that way five which is a lot more,

417
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:12,790
but it's way less nothingness. And then also like a value as a title, while it's kind of a it's a proxy variable.

418
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,190
Yeah, it's hard. It's really hard to try to capture this subject.

419
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,200
Do you think that this first question is a good proxy for inherited wealth?

420
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:23,860
What do you mean by that?

421
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:35,590
Um, I think well, in the US, I mean, my understanding is that there's a lot of like consolidation of wealth and personal wealth between generations,

422
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,599
which is one of the things that makes it why we have such a big class divide in this country.

423
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:53,409
It makes it difficult to kind of like jump between classes. And I'm just I'm curious whether inherited or generational wealth is, like,

424
00:49:53,410 --> 00:50:01,720
adequately demonstrated or like and especially if it's like future inherited wealth that's not currently in the form of like my real estate.

425
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:12,670
Right. Right. So this is getting at your spouse partner and you so, you know, so you're saying is that actually a proxy for inherited wealth?

426
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,350
Do you think people are factoring and thinking about that?

427
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,270
They might be, you know, and then also thinking like,

428
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,390
can this be used as as kind of thinking about what actually can be passed down to their children?

429
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:41,330
Yeah, sure. When I was in China, we did like this questionnaires and also like if you sell your apartment, I of course, how much would you get?

430
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:48,960
And some people will say, like, I buy, I bought this apartment, I build this house like long time ago.

431
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:55,380
And if I want another similar house right now, it will be like much higher, much expensive.

432
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,610
And it's like it's a time very variable sometimes.

433
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,399
So I think, yeah, this kind of question is like really difficult to answer sometimes.

434
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,670
Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. No, that's a good point.

435
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:17,020
This is just showing you, you know, a quick means procedure,

436
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,090
looking at the different measures like SARS and health retirement study showing you some of the differences.

437
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:32,440
This is based on 26, which was just something I grabbed. But this is the individual how individual income is on average about $13,000.

438
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,810
The household income is much larger at 61,000.

439
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,220
And the total of all assets wealth, which is being summed up, is about over 500,000.

440
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,599
So depending on what you want to pull to say, let's see which one is related to health.

441
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,670
They're very, very, very different. Right. And so, you know, something to think about when you're working with these different measures.

442
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,979
One of the other ways of getting out, I suppose,

443
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:04,000
you got a position is occupation because it really captures what people have been exposed to and over the work life in terms of occupational risks,

444
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,460
but also occupational benefits. It captures both social and economic position.

445
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,739
It captures things we're going to get into this morning.

446
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:19,740
We talk about dementia risk, but occupational challenges that are intellectual actually have been shown to protect you from dementia in later life.

447
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:25,300
And the more active you are with your brain earlier and throughout your life, course can actually protect you from dementia.

448
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,329
Obviously it's not relevant for those not in the workforce.

449
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:36,580
So that's for many for many women who move in and out of the workforce as well and becomes less relevant once you are retired.

450
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:44,080
Education is actually, you know, also relatively easy to measure in this.

451
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:51,100
One of the reasons why it's used most often to capture socio economic position, it's relatively stable from early adulthood.

452
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:56,770
So people generally get their education up to about, you know, 2025 and then it stays.

453
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,979
You don't change your education and you can't go up and down.

454
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,890
It sort of basically stays at a certain level for the most part.

455
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:07,720
So that makes it very useful in terms of preventing this issue about reverse causality.

456
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:14,110
And it's very powerful in preventing it. It's a you know, it it's a it's a social capital.

457
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:23,049
It's more than just money. It's a, you know, ability to navigate systems, to navigate the health care system, to navigate the social policy system,

458
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:28,780
to be able to be to know what to do to prevent poor health in terms of health behaviors,

459
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,950
the disadvantages, it's difficult to compare across countries.

460
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:39,070
The United States is very much based on, you know, college education, high school education, less than high school.

461
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,490
The British system is very different with all levels and levels.

462
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:47,410
Other countries. What's it like in other countries?

463
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,520
You know, very, very different systems of education. They make it difficult to compare.

464
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:59,530
But it is powerful education. This is looking at health literacy by education.

465
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,180
Again, this is coming from the Americans Changing Life study in 2012.

466
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:11,380
These are people aged 50 and older and health literacy is this question How confident are you feeling out medical forms by yourself?

467
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,760
Medical forms are things like for a doctor or a hospital or insurance provider.

468
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,629
Very simple question, actually very powerfully related to health.

469
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,560
And we'll get into that in one of the other classes later and the semester.

470
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:29,140
But you can see that people who have a college degree are extremely confident filling out those forms.

471
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,469
People with less than a high school didn't graduate from high school,

472
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:36,730
which is actually quite a substantial chunk of people in America's Changing Lives study,

473
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:41,080
you know, are actually only somewhat comfortable in that challenge.

474
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:48,280
And what that's picking up on is a barrier in actually understanding how to, you know, process health information, navigate the health system,

475
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:57,190
interact with health providers to be able to understand what medications, what behaviors, what preventive actions you should take.

476
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:01,540
So a real, you know, sort of driver of that is education.

477
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:11,709
When I was just a teacher, I was with education, you know, visual skills and five levels, a lot less than high school.

478
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:17,520
And then the to the general education department like technical school and.

479
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,040
School, some college and college and above.

480
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:28,470
So my career is, is how what people usually analyzes and understand is five levels.

481
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:36,580
What I do is I combine what you do with high school, but I really think is about is there any systematic differences between the two levels?

482
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,770
I think they're different. I don't know how to kg them. That's an amazing question.

483
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:46,270
And I whoops, let me see whether I can show it here. This is exactly it.

484
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,100
So many people, many questions are sort of questions and asking people about their education.

485
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:59,480
Ask how many years of education do you have? So there's typically, you know, the maybe I can show you actually better here.

486
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,270
So 16 years or more is a high, higher education.

487
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,940
So 16 years or more usually means that you've got college education,

488
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:12,780
you've got 12 years of high school, four years you to your degree, that's 16 years of education.

489
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,250
We consider that to be a college degree.

490
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:23,739
It may not be you can take five years to get you know, maybe it's five years to actually get your or maybe you did your degree in three years.

491
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:32,560
And so you actually got a college degree, but you wouldn't be considered to be having a higher education because you have reached a 16 year mark.

492
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:40,900
And then we have the this zone between you graduated from high school, but you didn't get a college degree.

493
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,960
You got some college. You have like a, you know, a associate's degree.

494
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,930
But it's not quite the same power in society as having a college degree.

495
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:59,410
And then there's the less than high school, which is the group that is historically being the most disadvantaged.

496
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,330
But going back to your question, there is this this group here,

497
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:10,240
which is this some college which is you graduate from high school, but you have only just a few years of education.

498
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:19,120
A Beyond that, in the college system, your health is pretty much the same as people who got a high school.

499
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,910
So that is not giving you that much benefit in terms of health those extra few years.

500
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:34,030
What's giving you the benefit is the college degree, bachelor's degree, or this benefit getting high school, right.

501
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:39,520
So this less than high school is the greatest risk. This is disability prevalence.

502
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,960
There's this big jump that falls when you get high school. So that's very protective.

503
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:50,350
These are about the same. And then there's another one here, which is a big fall when you actually get that college degree,

504
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:59,259
which suggests it's not the number of years of education per say, it's the credentials that you get from it, right.

505
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,469
So that you get this. I had a college degree. That's what you have.

506
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:11,140
It goes out in the world. I have a high school degree that gets at your question about high school diploma versus two g, g e d.

507
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,490
Yeah, those are people who don't deserve it.

508
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:21,070
Another way of getting a high school diploma, that's not that's more after the fact.

509
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:27,100
I think that is kind of like training for some specific skills.

510
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,530
I think it's a high school is still a high school degree,

511
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:37,370
but it's something that's more like you didn't manage to graduate from high school and you're kind of then kind of catching up afterwards.

512
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:47,329
But it does raise the question, are those people disadvantaged in any way compared to people who graduated from high school?

513
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:53,030
Kind of in the sequence and on time. Or are they just more resilient because they didn't get up?

514
00:58:54,950 --> 00:59:02,480
And looking at this graph, identifying this reference, but now they can be hesitant about putting some college and college together.

515
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:07,399
I don't want to put that together. So I think that yeah, yeah, it's hard.

516
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,530
It's hard to think about it and it's important to remember those are really great questions and good things to be thinking about.

517
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:20,180
Okay. And then the other thing, and I think I think you raised this in the very first class in the semester,

518
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,969
this idea of people's own perception of their socio economic status.

519
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:29,960
So subjective social status, this is your own perception of where you stand in society.

520
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,780
It's been shown to be a very strong predictor of health.

521
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:41,000
And in fact, when people do analysis, education, occupation and income do not fully account for the effects of this on subjective social status.

522
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,839
This measure is in the Health Retirement Study as well as other studies.

523
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,490
This is the question. This is this question is part of the Leave Behind survey.

524
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:58,760
So when they're doing the physical assessments about gait, speed and hearing tests in the home with their participants, when the interviewer leaves,

525
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,700
they leave behind a packet which is called the Leave Behind Questionnaires,

526
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:06,200
a psychosocial questionnaire, and it's a self-administered like just a packet of questions.

527
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,920
And then they're asked to send it in and it's, you know, after they complete it.

528
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,450
And one of the questions is this,

529
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:20,480
which is think of this latter is representing where people stand in our society at the top of the ladder are people who are the best off.

530
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:26,810
They have the most money, the most education and the best jobs at the bottom are people who are the worst off.

531
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,920
They have the least money, education and the worse jobs or no jobs.

532
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,030
The higher you are, you are a higher up you are on this ladder.

533
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:39,440
The closer you are to the people at the very top and the lower the closer you are to the bottom.

534
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,650
So they ask people a it's a really simple thing, right?

535
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,640
Put in x one of these boxes where you see yourself or you rent yourself.

536
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:56,570
This is the some of the results showing how this can be predictive of health,

537
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:07,550
looking at changes in functional capacity or death between 2004 and 2008 for people are in the highest subjective social status category,

538
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:14,090
which are the people here on the left. I know this is a fuzzy graph, but it gives you the idea that that actually is protective.

539
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:19,459
So people in the high and the middle are less likely to be progressing to functional decline

540
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,020
or death than people that perceive themselves low on the socioeconomic status ladder.

541
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:33,620
Women persistently as well see themselves as lower on the social status hierarchy than men.

542
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:40,550
So the orange bars are women, the blue bars are men. Again, this one from rest is the 2008 wave.

543
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,620
Older women see themselves as being, you know, not quite up that social ladder.

544
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:54,410
It's all very and this is quite you know, this is actually a really simple thing to administer to people that ask them,

545
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:00,080
you know, you're excellent in this lot or where do you see yourself? And it does it does actually relate very strongly to health.

546
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:07,600
Anybody use this kind of measure? It's it's it's really it's really interesting.

547
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:19,370
And then intersections. Of course, this is a gerontologist, Julia McMullen, who says that age, x,

548
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,860
gender and age and ethnicity and race must be conceptualized as power relations.

549
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:30,430
So there are interlocking hierarchies of power. We've talked about these things really separately, you know, age, gender, race, ethnicity.

550
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:36,130
They actually are actually systems of power that actually operate together.

551
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,010
This term intersectionality was coined by a legal scholar named Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989.

552
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:47,590
She used the term to explain how she saw any interplays of inequalities.

553
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,930
So that is basically saying that the experience of people over the life course and as they

554
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:59,760
emerge into older age are part of a whole system of of inequalities that magnify that.

555
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:09,519
They aren't just simply a matter of just being a woman or being a black woman or being that there is there's something that is magnified by having

556
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:19,930
multiple statuses together that simply aren't captured by looking at one single status alone in terms of its impact on health in later life.

557
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,780
Old age is a disadvantage position in general. And so it's often sufficient to deny individual social participation.

558
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,350
White women have lower poverty rates in old age than black women.

559
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:43,420
Again, we talked about how Social Security benefits are targeted upon that and how black women are more likely to be single parents and also to be

560
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:52,000
divorced and have like a partner and have required to actually carry their incomes without the support of a supportive spouse through later life.

561
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,490
So essentially that no one system of inequality is more important than any other.

562
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,270
They are intertwined in people's lives and their experience simultaneously.

563
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:08,290
Even though we try to analyze them one at a time. And this brings in a lot of complexities about how we actually model intersectionality.

564
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:14,379
And there's a whole wealth of literature on this. Nash is doing this in her dissertation and really kind of thinking about how we

565
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:18,459
actually capture multiple identities analytically in our statistical models.

566
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:24,160
And it's it's very challenging. A lot of people say it can't be done in terms of empirical, quantitative work,

567
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,800
and it needs qualitative research, but it is an important way to think about systems of inequality.

568
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:34,450
And then finally, on nativity and immigration status.

569
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:41,380
So migration actually is at one of the highest levels than it's ever been for many countries have policies that encourage immigration.

570
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:50,260
So Canada is a country of immigrants. Germany has had a dramatic increase going on in their country as well.

571
01:04:51,010 --> 01:05:01,240
In the United States is not so necessarily more recently being so open to the immigrants with a lot of the political issues that are occurring.

572
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:12,130
This is just a news clip from 2017 about ICE raids causing anxieties and that just even if you're not experiencing this kind of raid,

573
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:21,280
the knowledge that it's occurring among your peers is something to create stress and have consequences for health.

574
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:33,290
And I think when we think about immigrant health, experiences of race and racism are often based on language as well as nativity.

575
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,990
And when we talk about things like securing our borders, it continues to have kind of racial overtones.

576
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,969
So there's a need to think about not only race with respect to race and ethnicity,

577
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:48,549
but also immigrant status and to incorporate to fine measures and incorporate immigrant

578
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:53,140
status within our typical measures that we use for discrimination and vigilance.

579
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:02,379
This is just some quotes for this paper by Thoroughly Fuentes for 2012, which said,

580
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:09,220
we need to think about structural racism with respect to immigrant health and that it's not just differences in culture,

581
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,860
but that there's in race, ethnicity, immigration status are often conflated, but they're quite unique things.

582
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:27,570
And it's important to separate out that piece about immigration and immigrant status and how that may be part of this whole intersectional,

583
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,240
multiplicative, multiplicative effect on health.

584
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:39,610
This idea of becoming American. I certainly you know, as I said, I'm a recent immigrant to the United States.

585
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:46,000
You always feel like you're quite not sure if you are doing what you're supposed to be doing, saying what you're supposed to say.

586
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:55,290
You're kind of kind of had this this feeling of othering, you know, sort of identifying experiences as discriminatory is also a learning process.

587
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,450
So understanding whether you are being discriminated against or not.

588
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,030
You know, there's a process of trying to figure that out.

589
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:07,340
That's a whole another layer that's going on that's completely distinct from race, ethnicity or gender.

590
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:14,650
But this sort of experience of being othered. I just wanted to wrap up.

591
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:20,860
Just look at this differences in how we talk about and how we think about measuring race and ethnicity.

592
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,330
These are questions from the US Census. On the left hand side in the 2010 census and the census.

593
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:35,290
On the right is the more recent one that occurred in 2020. So these questions are quite similar, but starting off by asking about Hispanic origin.

594
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:44,530
That's the first question, which is, you know, just identify yourself as either Hispanic or Latino or Spanish origin or not.

595
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:50,270
And then there's a question about race. So in 2010, the question is, what is the person's race?

596
01:07:50,290 --> 01:08:03,190
There's white, black, African American or Negro, American, Indian or Alaska Native, and then a whole host of other races in here in 2020.

597
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:15,510
We have a little bit of some changes that occurred. Previously we asked was it there's a box for white here.

598
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:23,550
We have a box for white, but there's a specific field to write in to say, Are you German, Irish, Lebanese, Egyptian, etc.

599
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:33,030
Again, here for black or African American, American Indian Alaska Native asks for the principal tribes that they're a part of.

600
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:38,310
And then we have the whole other categories here.

601
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:44,310
And what's interesting is how they are describing who might actually be in these different boxes.

602
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:48,420
So for White, it actually specifically says Lebanese and Egyptian.

603
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:57,030
And there was a big push before the 2020 census to add a category for Middle East and North African.

604
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:00,990
So Mena having that to be a box that people could check on the census.

605
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:09,060
But a coalition of groups really, really pushed for this by sending a letter to the Census Bureau for this separate category.

606
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,750
They had a big campaign. Check it.

607
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:16,590
Right. You ain't white to really try and bring that in there.

608
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:23,190
It did not happen. So it kind of thinking about how do we even measure race?

609
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:30,690
What what is considered to be categories that we identify with or we are allowed to tick off on?

610
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:36,540
The census can also just shape sense of belonging.

611
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:43,139
It can shape data that's coming out of the census and understanding differences in health by different

612
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,510
groups in terms of having a lack of data and all the so the richness that we might be missing.

613
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,840
So that's a whole quick overview of all different systems of inequality.

614
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,999
We'll take a break and then we'll come back and we'll dove into Victoria's

615
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,270
presentation and discuss some of the work that she's going to be going over.

616
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,440
All right. So will we zoom in about 10 to 12 minutes?

617
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,150
Why is your sentence today? I don't know.

618
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,740
I you know, I don't know why there's been so many different.

619
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:33,799
Is used for movies. Yeah. And what about the other reason why I wonder?

620
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:42,610
Like, you know, kids have been very good at that, but how much time do they get through that?

621
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:45,400
You just like that? Well, we started after the 2010 census,

622
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:52,760
but then it really sort of given us what's happening with like around 2018 was when it was very

623
01:10:52,760 --> 01:11:00,940
active then we actually did that in the to do list as like it's a World Series this week.

624
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:04,790
So I'm like my process, you know, like.

625
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:08,150
Yeah, yeah. I think there's no excuse. I wouldn't happen on Twitter.

626
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:14,809
But yeah, I just I'm curious, like, why is it if it was just administrative?

627
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:21,770
Like, I like what it was like, you know, like a deliberate rejection would be like, yeah.

628
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:25,820
I mean, if you look at the difference in the sense of like something different words that change,

629
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:32,360
like the use of the white people in 2010, you know, I think that's changing.

630
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,870
You know, product categories increased.

631
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:46,340
So it seems well, they use commercial time that's somewhat similar.

632
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,420
That's probably in the process, you know, to identify.

633
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,510
Yeah. See what happens. Yeah.

634
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:05,350
Yeah. So I gathered from that was just lots of attention on it.

635
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,710
I'm just curious, like, what type of person? He's a pulmonary.

636
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,930
Oh. Quicker. Like I said. Or I thought.

637
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:33,100
Making sure that, you know, okay, this is just really, you know, he didn't you know, he was very much.

638
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:38,370
Yeah. You know, I think he's here.

639
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:43,190
Here you are. Yes. Yes. You.

640
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,580
Me. Wow. Wow.

641
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:56,370
That's amazing. Yeah. That's just not.

642
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:04,290
That's all there is to it here.

643
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,550
And I was like, you know, you're talking about my family system.

644
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:16,410
It's just that huge. It will bring the opposition to the summit.

645
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:27,210
Jill Dougherty, should they know that the event has, you know, like an eye open and type of stuff?

646
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:38,840
I think he probably would be probably just like I don't know what to be like 20 to 30 hours for years with time.

647
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:51,580
And that's just like really just like a broad definition of public health issues that it's not so much a chance to really get to the surgeon.

648
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:56,410
How do I know how much exposure my students get to produce?

649
01:13:56,410 --> 01:14:06,340
This is I education, just like how it sure be.

650
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:12,460
There's 20 hours and you don't have to have one person.

651
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:16,200
Yeah, for sure. For sure. It's like, definitely not. I don't know.

652
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,110
I think it can be done better. I think a lot of little things.

653
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:31,470
I think they're still trying to figure out how to do it, but it's not a ton of goodies in there.

654
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:43,170
And I think there's a pretty clear discrepancy between students who like to play soap opera,

655
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:48,089
kind of already aware of or deep concerns among students who really like.

656
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:54,880
It's very clear they're not drawn. They're just never thought of apparently before, which is great.

657
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:59,100
It's like there's like a little bit of a frustration. No one size fits all.

658
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,370
Right. It's just it's so short term and they do the best.

659
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:09,690
It has to try to catch everyone.

660
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:17,719
But it's definitely. Let's talk a little bit about that.

661
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:27,590
So, I mean, that's tremendous progress. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I don't know, cause, like, 20 years ago, they hear, like, horror stories.

662
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:34,580
I'm just glad to be alive. They're glad to be in school today.

663
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:40,550
Yes. Yes. You waited? Yeah. For, like, ten years.

664
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:58,450
Did you send them to them? No, I was going to try and figure out how to post that.

665
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:05,190
Are you able to post something on the announcements? I don't think I can unless I reply.

666
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:09,450
That is brilliant. Okay, let's see how to monetize this.

667
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,660
Yeah. You know what I'm going to announce, but I know what you have.

668
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:26,600
Looks like it's. What's your work on that?

669
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:36,830
Well, I I've gone to some meetings and like I said, something about a blood drive.

670
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:43,520
And like last year, the CDC was coming and they asked for volunteers because they didn't know what

671
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:51,410
was going on in the first set because it wasn't as attractive or something.

672
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,500
They're asking for volunteers helping with that,

673
01:16:53,510 --> 01:17:03,110
but then something like they needed us to go get funding for and something didn't get coordinated too.

674
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:11,150
So I didn't go. Yeah. Yeah. I do not care how the girls were recruited.

675
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:20,270
And then what was it like plugging them? Yeah, yeah.

676
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:24,760
Sounds great. Yeah.

677
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:32,860
And then each year they do have a deployment either like I think this past summer they went to Mississippi.

678
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:40,169
So we're going to. Yeah.

679
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:45,920
Every year. And then we just.

680
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:56,560
So this. Okay.

681
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:08,020
So I did my slides for the assignment. That's a little diploma from there, actually.

682
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:12,450
Yeah. Which is?

683
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,860
How old are you? I know how to.

684
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:24,050
How I know this is. I was. You if it were.

685
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:36,210
But yeah, this is the emerging. And, you know, I get everything I need to be in high.

686
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:39,840
I mean, you are so you are not used to it.

687
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:46,450
Yeah. So, you know, I think I get it, but, you know, I just think.

688
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you are.

689
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,600
Do not have to necessarily. All right.

690
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,010
Good, good, good. That's right.

691
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,600
So I just watched that online, huh?

692
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:09,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was like, Oh, I love this one.

693
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:14,890
Maybe there's some, you know, that that is a good idea.

694
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:24,150
I think you have to bring it to. Yeah, that's true. I think at this point it makes it like, yeah, I don't have more of an introduction.

695
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:37,750
It's not 600 with like the most popular or all of what we see a lot significantly is this.

696
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:45,060
And I did open it several times and it was just really high.

697
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:52,110
Well, I was just, I was like, oh, well, that was.

698
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:14,760
Yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah. I just wish that I could to help with that because what happens is when a computer has, you know,

699
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:34,360
a manager and they want to tell you how to push the trigger, I'm not trying to do that in my own voice.

700
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:42,600
And like just that, you know, I, I also just share them with you.

701
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:50,510
So I might just show up in a Google slides something because something that,

702
01:20:51,950 --> 01:21:03,180
that you share them with me that would be like, okay, let's see, that is the history that people can meet.

703
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:10,870
And I think that is wonderful.

704
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:16,480
Why do you do that?

705
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:26,990
And the genetics. I know this because once again, you got that right.

706
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:35,150
So nice to see you. I know exactly what I'm doing.

707
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,790
Okay. There you go. There it is.

708
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:44,330
Yeah, I know. Think you're great. Now we're learning.

709
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:50,000
Progress isn't happening. Yeah, apparently so.

710
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:54,340
I have to tell you, you have to. To.

711
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:01,130
People know of those things.

712
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:05,930
I thought you ever do that.

713
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:11,630
I know. Okay. All right.

714
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,980
It's all yours. Okay.

715
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:36,990
Oh, no. That's. Oh.

716
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:52,840
Okay. So I'm Victoria and I will be presenting one of the readings addressing health disparities among older Asian American populations,

717
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,520
research data and policy by Beirut and Chunky from NYU.

718
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:03,370
For both dental or oral health public health professionals.

719
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,160
So I'll start with a general overview and go through some of the themes,

720
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:18,190
a comprehensive summary of the paper and what it contributes to the study of aging and the strengths and weaknesses and of the discussion questions.

721
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:25,480
So some of the themes that were most present in the paper are really about

722
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:31,810
subgroup diversity in aging populations and specifically the term Asian American.

723
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:38,380
And as we can see, these are two graphs from some of the source material that the paper drew on.

724
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:45,940
But there's an enormous range of diversity based on origin and household income,

725
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:52,360
which we just talked about influences, a lot of aging and health outcomes in life,

726
01:23:53,200 --> 01:24:01,509
and then as well as those living in poverty and the just the massive the range of diversity

727
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:07,839
there where we see that only 6% of Asian Americans who are Indian origin live in poverty,

728
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:16,750
but 25% of Mongolian or Burmese and Bangladeshi are also very high, with the average being about 10%.

729
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:25,510
And then we also see that they are the fastest growing, fastest growing population in America.

730
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,890
And this is not just Asian populations, this total from this graph here,

731
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:43,360
but what the pilot and red are since 2000 have grown double or in some cases up to like 11% or 358% increase.

732
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:50,560
So there are sorry, it's 21,358%, 11,000%.

733
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,880
So very rapid growth in the last 20 years of the sort of this.

734
01:24:55,270 --> 01:25:01,330
So clearly, there is a lot of subgroup diversity which is not captured in the term Asian American.

735
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:08,890
And then kind of the reason that this is really important, in addition to all the things that we learned about inequity today,

736
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:14,709
is that early understanding or the current scientific knowledge and the demographic reality of the United States,

737
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:20,470
where those gaps are happening and just is really important for population shifts,

738
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:28,930
that because this is the largest, the vast US and largest growing immigrant and origin population,

739
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:36,130
it's going to have a lot of implications for later when we are like with our health care and things now,

740
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:43,600
as well as the potential for more culturally informed outreach so that we can reach these people who are falling into these gaps.

741
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:53,829
So this is kind of a lot of text apologize, but the so the paper specifically, it's not a traditional scientific, rigorous scientific paper.

742
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:59,760
It's more of a it's published in Public Policy and public health, a journal.

743
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:08,350
So it's a report review of sort of the state of the research, looking at disparities among older adults across racial ethnic groups.

744
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:14,200
There are a couple studies that are offered where they look at differences in gender as well.

745
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,970
But the primary focus is on how Asian-American populations are not included.

746
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:26,110
And as I said, it's a report. So the methodology is loose in the traditional or the sense of a scientific paper.

747
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:31,510
But it does discuss the methodology in other papers,

748
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:40,900
reports that they use to sort of create this argument or present sort of the state of population aging research.

749
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:52,090
So urban is their own research to illustrate a very specific example of how these how we're failing certain populations in the United States.

750
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:59,080
So they found that in addition to egregiously low numbers of Asian-Americans represented in study

751
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:05,200
cards and also the recipients of funding to look at health disparities in Asian-Americans,

752
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,850
the term Asian or Asian-American hides a substantial subgroup,

753
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:16,870
diversity and disparities in health outcomes especially, and suicide and dementia as they show in the paper.

754
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:27,280
So two of the breakout points from this paper really look at the myth of the stereotype of the model minority.

755
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:31,690
And so, as you can see here, highlighted in red, they consistently,

756
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:41,829
Asian-Americans consistently have the greatest disparity in poverty, as well as all of the related factors.

757
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:45,010
So disability and depression and cognitive impairment.

758
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:58,600
And they this sort of goes against what we think of as the model minority for Asian Americans and how it's harmful to perpetuate that.

759
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,830
And I think that's what I wanted to talk. Let's see.

760
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:14,750
So, yeah, with this giant large disparity really of races under the myth of the model minority,

761
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:18,470
it really erases those who don't fall into that stereotype.

762
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:24,500
And there's a lack of data and health care and poor health outcomes for those who are not addressed.

763
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:35,389
And then the other sort of flipside of that is the kind of can not provide but continuation of that as the there's really an

764
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:44,360
incomplete picture and that those aggregation of subgroups just sort of perpetuates this myth because as a larger group,

765
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:50,610
Asian-Americans tend to outperform other racial ethnic groups in health outcomes that live longer.

766
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:54,200
We saw earlier today that they have a higher, healthier life expectancy.

767
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,070
They're generally wealthier. And this is because some of those.

768
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:07,820
So that in one of the earlier graphs, you see that these top six that's not in this one.

769
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:19,130
The top six groups make up more than a million American residents in the United States, and they make up 85% of the Asian-American population.

770
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:26,990
And these groups also tend to have higher. You can see over here, they tend to have higher income, lower percent in poverty.

771
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:35,510
So this contributes to a lack of data of everyone who isn't included in that in those groups.

772
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:43,819
And another reason that the picture is incomplete, the authors know, is that a lot of the studies are often only administered in English.

773
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:51,560
And these I think it's something like 60% of this group are immigrants and have limited English proficiency,

774
01:29:52,220 --> 01:30:01,190
especially in the aging older populations of Asian-Americans. So huge lack of data in terms of reaching those populations.

775
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:06,670
And then also there's sort of a lack of acknowledgment of cultural differences and attitudes toward certain diseases,

776
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,900
especially dementia and suicide, as I mentioned,

777
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:20,270
where older Asian-Americans are less likely to seek health or help or health care because perceptions of mental illness or

778
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:31,740
sort of dementia or insanity or burden things that really keep them from being accurately assessed or counted in data.

779
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:38,170
So they have lower statistically have lower prevalence of dementia, but that probably isn't actually true.

780
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:46,339
And here we see from this systematic review that the paper talks about of the top,

781
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:53,209
here are all African-American studies on dementia and these are Caribbean, these are white American.

782
01:30:53,210 --> 01:31:00,200
And then these are the only studies that were pulled that talk about Japanese Americans specifically as a subgroup.

783
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:09,830
But that's the only one. There's no other subgroups of Asian-Americans produced in the systematic review of dementia.

784
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:16,730
The paper has a it's because of the report.

785
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:19,340
Nature is a little bit difficult to think of strengths and weaknesses,

786
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:24,560
but it does highlight a really important job in the research that needs to be addressed,

787
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:28,459
and it also draws on a really wide range of disciplines to demonstrate.

788
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:31,790
So it touches on socioeconomic issues in common.

789
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,140
So I'm more of like traditional census or Pew Center data.

790
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,469
It pulls from their own discipline,

791
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:46,310
which is oral health and how oral health speaks to greater systemic issues and health care and access and inequity.

792
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:57,559
It looks at dementia and suicide and two other also sort of indicators of systemic inequity and how I

793
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:04,130
would say some of the weaknesses of that in the policy section at the very end it doesn't address,

794
01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:15,230
it suggests community driven efforts to tackle these issues, but in a way that I think kind of doesn't,

795
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:21,380
it feels insufficient to address the issues that were highlighted earlier in the paper.

796
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:28,229
And then it kind of in the same way falls prey to our conclusions of a lot of other papers that are sort of this general sweeping remarks.

797
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:34,219
So we need better communication, which is a little bit disappointing because earlier in the paper they talk about how they've

798
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:39,770
created a framework that includes immigration as a central factor for health and health outcomes.

799
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:46,040
And I think having more of a specific outline or sort of insight into how a

800
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,699
framework like that was created would be really helpful for hammering home their

801
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:57,830
point that this is something that we really need to focus on and really need to start changing instead of kind of a general like this needs to change.

802
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:02,600
And I think the title of the paper is also kind of a weakness because.

803
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:06,139
The point of the paper is that we don't have data on the subgroups,

804
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:16,250
but they talk about subgroup diversity and the title of the paper and it seems to be a little bit maybe aspirational in a way that I think

805
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:27,440
could almost be flipped to it to position like lacking data in subgroups leads to like unknown health disparities and things like that.

806
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:34,669
So really positioning for the crux of the issue more than the aspirations.

807
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:41,749
And then in the course of building this presentation and writing the summary paper,

808
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:46,639
I went through some of the source material to find some of the statistics and look for some of the graphs.

809
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,400
And I noticed that a lot of the statistics, especially around the prevalence of dementia,

810
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:58,430
are a little bit overemphasized and kind of cherry picked to make the to make their point,

811
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:03,679
but in a way that the original papers that they're sourced from don't and in some cases the

812
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:09,260
statistics are not actually statistically significant for the groups that they claim that they are.

813
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:13,819
But that is not to say that the trend doesn't exist.

814
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:21,559
It just was a little bit, um, I was hoping for something a little more rigorous or so.

815
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,790
Those are some of the weaknesses and strengths. And I.

816
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:32,930
Can I ask your question. Yeah. First have you go back to the graph, the, the other one is this one.

817
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:42,080
So, so what it's showing is that, you know, Asians have a lower prevalence of.

818
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,940
Disability, depression, cognitive impairment than the other groups.

819
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,580
But poverty is more likely.

820
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:56,200
There's much more differences by poverty in the Asian American population than in the other groups.

821
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:08,540
So that poverty is more strongly. Training or that probably is much more of a risk factor in Asian populations.

822
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,220
Is that kind of the interpretation?

823
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:19,219
That's something I interpreted a um, especially since I think if you were to aggregate them so that it was not, it was just Asian, just white,

824
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:27,620
just like not just stratified by poverty, you would find that the Asian, the average for Asians would be lower than all the other ones.

825
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:33,530
But when you break it down by poverty, you see that that's very, very much not the case.

826
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:39,350
It is still the exception of cognitive impairment. It is still the lowest or in, I guess depression.

827
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:45,080
They still show some of the lowest amounts, especially with related to poverty.

828
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:50,209
But that illustrates more of the the myth, right?

829
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:54,830
That as a grant is a grant group, an umbrella term.

830
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:59,149
Yes, they're showing on average lower. So we don't need to address them.

831
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:02,389
They're fine now. They're not seeking help. Actually, no, that's not the case.

832
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:10,100
We've completely forgotten these other people who don't fall into this myth of the stereotype of the Hmong minority.

833
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:17,590
Any other questions before? Yeah.

834
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:21,149
I think this is such this is really an emerging area of research.

835
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:26,760
I think there is going to be there is I see a lot more attention focused on Asian American overtones.

836
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:33,480
And I think that's going to be it's becoming a really more it's a recognized as an area that it's a need.

837
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:36,840
And as you say, that sort of gap in knowledge and understanding.

838
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:43,530
And I think whether we can actually ask the right questions to governor, you know, to identify subgroups is something.

839
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:49,010
I didn't actually put this light in because I kind of put it in, but I couldn't really figure it out.

840
01:36:49,340 --> 01:37:00,110
I was really wanted to share this one, um, because I last year did a lot of research on genetic testing for early onset Alzheimer's disease,

841
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:03,649
which is an aging disease process because it's primarily genetic.

842
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:11,420
But there's a lot of contrasting research with dementias generally and cultural perceptions.

843
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:21,379
And in the course of the the research project that I did in almost every study included in my research,

844
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:26,630
there were no Asian Americans who were enrolled in study participants, which is just incredible.

845
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:37,280
And I actually completely redesigned my paper and research project around that issue because it was so egregious.

846
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:41,180
But the numbers are just so low and no one addressed it.

847
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:43,910
And I mean, that has a huge implication,

848
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:53,660
is that that sort of in the inverse way the authors talk about their work with Chinese-Americans and potential ism.

849
01:37:54,420 --> 01:38:01,309
All right. The total loss of teeth, but they admit that it has limited generalizability or in the case of dementia,

850
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:04,520
testing for Alzheimer's and cultural significance.

851
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,460
None of the papers even remotely address that.

852
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:14,920
It has like generalizability issues and it's just like, okay, you forgot, you know, 60% of our population,

853
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:21,620
not just any only nonwhite non-Hispanic or and so that was it was interesting to see that,

854
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:27,350
you know, there's only two one, one for Mexican-American and one for Ashkenazi Jewish.

855
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:35,569
But the others point out that this has a lot of implications for even white immigrants from eastern

856
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:39,350
Russia or from the Mino population that we just talked about and how you just aggregate those.

857
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:49,370
And so it's I mean, the only have Japanese-Americans that's, you know, indicative of a very small percentage of everyone here.

858
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:54,770
So yeah. Three points.

859
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:01,460
Yeah, just one at a time. When I was doing my research for the race or ethnicity groups,

860
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:10,310
there's always that white and then African-Americans, Hispanics, and then the last group, usually others.

861
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:16,610
And I was like, okay, but there's no way I can analyze this other space race because I don't know what they're racist.

862
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:25,700
I understand they're a minority. So sometimes there's a good difficulty collecting data due to like the limitation of language or access.

863
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:32,030
But there are some communities, there's actually a big aggregation of that specific groups.

864
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:38,060
So I think hopefully that will be a good understanding of the social construct of that group.

865
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:42,530
To some extent. That's why. Just a comment. Yeah, no, I agree.

866
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:46,399
Yeah. That's part of the reason why I think that their suggestion for like community

867
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:51,049
driven partnership was a little flat because like these communities exist and

868
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:54,800
they have like these infrastructures are already built and a lot of immigrant

869
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,890
communities are very tight knit and have these resources and it's not works.

870
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:08,659
So every time I read a paper that's like marketing outreach or better communication is needed, I will know that like, like it's definitely needed.

871
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:13,940
And we know that community driven partnerships really do work, but at the scale that we're trying to get at,

872
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:18,709
which is this is, you know, national level surveys, it's kind of like, okay, so like something else is going on here.

873
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:22,250
Like, we need less talk and more action.

874
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:34,460
Yeah. So some of the discussion questions that I came up with were about, um, I don't see these as, like, I have the answer.

875
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:37,520
So these are questions I was pondering all last week.

876
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:44,240
Why are myths like the model minority harder to break than this knowledge that like we just saw with the poverty disparities?

877
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:52,460
Like, why are they why are they harder to break? And why do they continue and not enough?

878
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:56,130
Research Policy Implications Section They discuss only community driven partnerships.

879
01:40:56,150 --> 01:41:02,840
And what would a national level policy look like? I don't know what I don't know policy, but I'm sure people have done a lot more work.

880
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,420
Um, and then what are some of the lasting intergenerational effects of failing to properly recruit and address?

881
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:14,239
As we often think of some of these things like a dementia, suicide, an older age or a dental,

882
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:18,920
it's almost like, Oh, those are like or aging or older population issues.

883
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:26,420
But like, what does that mean for interventions at all points across the life or or even, you know, the next generation?

884
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:34,130
And then the bonus question, like, what point should we stop delineating ancestry specifically?

885
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:37,910
Like, is there a clinical reason?

886
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:46,700
Do we just for whatever population we're looking at, you know, how at what point do we stop or what point is it not that too much work?

887
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:50,620
So just something to think about. Interesting.

888
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:02,160
Let's keep the discussion questions up there. And, you know, I let's we get we have about 7 minutes or so.

889
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:06,520
And are there any questions here that you have thoughts about?

890
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:10,660
These are great questions. We could probably talk about this for like an hour.

891
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:21,760
And so going off on your first question, that same like like Asian-Americans have the largest income to divide.

892
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,169
And I think that has a historical like cultural reason.

893
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:35,560
So if you go back to like, let's say like early eighties towards like late nineties, that portion of the immigrants,

894
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:41,560
which is like, oh, of course they're like they're the Asian group right now with that group, it's mostly like labor groups.

895
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:47,980
So but at that time you probably know, like Chinese economy is, it was definitely not a story like right now.

896
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:56,380
And most people are, you know, either like actually like illegal immigrants that ask for like opportunities,

897
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:00,610
you know, like labor opportunities in the Western land.

898
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,660
So most of them, they actually illegally enter the country.

899
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:11,140
And of course, that leads towards the outcome that most of them go to do, like labor work.

900
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:15,160
So it's not like it's most like towards like blue collar work.

901
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:24,670
And because the the nature of the illegal status of their, you know, residency.

902
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:28,300
And so that leads to them to like a lower income group.

903
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:33,010
And I think that's like why was there such a large income divide?

904
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,270
Because later on,

905
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:44,940
a lot of like immigrants also including like the Asian the immigrants from China bill like investment visa that was a huge portion of the you know,

906
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:48,730
immigrants after 2000 and also, you know, visiting scholars,

907
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:55,300
a bunch of like other reason which actually brought them to like a higher level of income in the society.

908
01:43:55,750 --> 01:44:01,210
So I think that's a reason that my last one was this study conducted 2022.

909
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,889
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it definitely captures.

910
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:10,120
So when they say like they were like gathering data from like the, you know, the actual like Chinese immigrants.

911
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:19,480
So that definitely captures both of the groups. And I think that's like the main reason why you well, see, like such a large income income gap.

912
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:30,280
I also learned recently that earlier this year the predominantly Chinese and Japanese governments and like you want to say,

913
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:39,880
more like postwar forties and fifties. So back then, families eligible for immigration based on their education and income status.

914
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:50,349
So you have this like the first wave of Chinese immigrants who have basically enslaved to build the relatives in South America and the West Coast.

915
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:57,040
Right. And then you have the second wave of affluent immigrants and then you have the way that you're talking about blue collar.

916
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,559
And now we have this sort of flip back to education and investment.

917
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:07,400
So it's really it's really interesting history that I don't, I really don't know ton about.

918
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:16,750
Um, I mean, I mean you're pointing to cohort differences, right, because of like some of the differences in poverty, but, but also,

919
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:24,670
you know, what does that mean in terms of differences in health and and differences within, you know, just within communities?

920
01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:29,049
It's yeah, it's very interesting to hear the historical side.

921
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:37,000
Yeah, I think it'll be fascinating if they can like I mean, I haven't seen any research really like, you know, addressing the issue between like the,

922
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:45,850
we say like the newer wave against like the old ways, you know, the, the only wave is like pre like year 2000.

923
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:49,599
So most of the research just come places like Asia.

924
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:55,900
Like, like I think somebody mentioned that even sometimes they don't mention Asian, they just mention like others.

925
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:03,209
So with that in mind, like, I mean, I feel it's important to like address this gap,

926
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:08,200
but I haven't seen any like scholars, researchers actually paid attention on it.

927
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:13,330
Yeah. And that's an issue right here like that.

928
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:20,739
I mean, the difference what are the what are the ways that we can actually then think about policy

929
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:26,560
level on improving Asian-American health disparities or and thinking about the data issue,

930
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:36,070
you know, about what we need to do to make sure we actually collect better data and solutions in diversity within that.

931
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:48,490
Will continue to improve it. Yeah. You know, you definitely put the survey trees down.

932
01:46:50,450 --> 01:47:00,080
That's another problem with them. All the elderly, like, you know, Asian Americans, like the immigrant from like China or like Taiwan per se.

933
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:09,410
And actually, you'd be surprised by like how many people that they can even like they can speak, but they can't even like reading this.

934
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:15,250
It's a large portion. I don't, you know, the insurance, which is.

935
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:19,830
It's. It's just English and Spanish.

936
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:30,870
Right. Yeah. That's a really good point. You never going to actually meet a representative of the older population to change and diversify the way.

937
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:38,970
Then the strong, very strong in our community support their churches like the Chinese church.

938
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:48,360
Or some other public services or in Chinese. But I so I'm speaking as I go to outside with people from a knitting club.

939
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:57,780
So I receive that kind of social support from other people outside of the transport, but from the general perspective.

940
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:12,239
But in other I know in a speech I don't really have that organized support from an NGO like in Asian elite to like go to you and say,

941
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,959
hey, we have a support for you. And then we are like Asian organized.

942
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,050
No, I saw that for African-Americans and Hispanics.

943
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:29,190
I don't see that from Chinese. So I think I think we need to establish some kind of like strong support for that.

944
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:37,830
And then we can speak out to voices, to the community level and to outside of the Asian countries.

945
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:47,250
I don't know how to do that. Know that they do like Asian Christian society or something like that.

946
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:53,849
Are you aware? I saw them not like last year, but yeah, I think it was, yeah.

947
01:48:53,850 --> 01:49:00,649
Yeah. Religious and other things lately, but not everyone has as a religious beliefs.

948
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:04,380
So what about those that don't have that? They don't go to church.

949
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:05,680
So what?

950
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:19,120
We have some pilot student optimization policies and the optimization of Chinese students, and we're going to find some Chinese student as well.

951
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:25,570
You see some. Yes. Like that. And also like International Semester.

952
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:36,930
But when I was using it to do some research, like the company do function, that's for years.

953
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:45,480
And because people speak in different languages, so we could respond to those questionnaires where they're good on more on that.

954
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:54,450
But I remember that EPA has they have this kind of particular question asking you which languages are you speaking?

955
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:58,900
Like if you speak Chinese or other languages instead.
