1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,250
I don't have first thing like that.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,170
Yeah. Did you ever think about this much like.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:26,790
Oh, no, it's like it was basically they are doing and you can't do it if you don't get in.

4
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:35,110
But if they like, we love them. So for me to be told that that by an [INAUDIBLE] by leaves, you know.

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,150
Yeah. This one, it's like, what's going to be the last two falling apart?

6
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,610
Yeah. So today we have our methods, presentations.

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,420
We have three. We're gonna have three groups today and then five groups.

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,620
That's next Wednesday. Cigarets and a basic device.

9
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,370
So I have this group come up here and, and kind of get set up again today.

10
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,259
Our present, our methods from nations are just a chance to show your your ideas,

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:22,410
how you're thinking about the analysis and get something that we have to see right once you come on them and everything's set up here.

12
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,800
So we'll have some presentations that I'll just. Yeah, okay.

13
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,320
Yeah. So go ahead. Go ahead and get it set up here.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,150
Anyone have any questions about anything in the labor. Sorry. Sustainable model.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:53,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think most people would recognize that I should have found a really good chapter on time.

16
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,110
I don't have any questions or anything kind of generally in the class. Do you remember me?

17
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,530
Like, I don't know.

18
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,840
She's not just kind of like I said, we find some students here, so nothing will change.

19
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,930
What? You know, I don't know yet.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:35,140
Okay, well, I think she's not coming back.

21
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,730
I want to go straight to my wife.

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,919
That would say that would be.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:53,280
But you don't recognize that when I was like, oh, my God.

24
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

25
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,000
I was in my head. That was big. Obvious.

26
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:19,340
No, no. Yeah. There's got to be some way to use a little room for some of these things, you know?

27
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,059
I'm sorry. What's happening to me?

28
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,880
To it? Yes. You're not just mentioning celebrity anyway.

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, you don't know what's your take on this gentleman?

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,850
You know, whenever you just you just.

31
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,930
Good morning, everyone. My name is Shannon, and this is my group.

32
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,090
We have beyond belief, honey. And then Tricia is also in our group, but she's not here today.

33
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,530
And our topic is on banning cigarets in the US.

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,330
So in 1964, there has been over 40% of American adults who have reported that they've smoked.

35
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:16,570
But today that number is close to 12%, and that's primarily due to public health and the great reductions in the smoking area.

36
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,360
However, despite the massive reductions, as you can see, as I noted from 1964 to today,

37
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,610
smoking does remain to be one of the biggest threats to both mortality and morbidity,

38
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,440
and it's estimated that it is responsible for one in five deaths in the US.

39
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,569
So New Zealand has taken a massive step towards alleviating this disparity and

40
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,520
they implemented an age based ban for cigarets for anyone born after 2008.

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,630
And we'll kind of explain how we can implement that in our study.

42
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:57,299
So the ordinance, the CIGARET ban policy has a potential to test because the CDC's research has

43
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,630
shown that most smokers initiated the tobacco use during their adolescence.

44
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,739
So we're going to come back to the cost effectiveness of the stimulus freezed in national debt of

45
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,940
tobacco product in the United States relative to the status quo of the existing tobacco control policy.

46
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Our policy was targeted to the people who were born after December 31, 2008.

47
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,580
So these people will never be able to purchased a cigaret.

48
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:38,670
At the same time, we will allow the current smokers to continue smoking because they may already be addicted to the nicotine.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,370
So our aim is to ensure there is never a next generation of smokers.

50
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:56,910
However, there may be some substitution effect where young people may pick up smoking through illegal packets or substitute tobacco with the alcohol.

51
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,800
So we will include this group of teenagers analyzed, and this will be the important part of our analyzes,

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,870
because we will attempt to quantify and analyze the potential tradeoffs involved with this age based policy.

53
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:24,240
Another group that may be affected by the policy are the people at those who are engaged in the illegal cigaret distribution.

54
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,620
So we will be performing a cost effectiveness analysis by looking at the predicted costs and mortality of the two options.

55
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,140
So either implementing the CIGARET ban or staying with the status quo at current CIGARET sale levels.

56
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,740
So to do this, we ultimately define the predicted health costs of smoking for each of the two scenarios.

57
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,590
And then the mortality from each of the two scenarios. Since we're taking a societal perspective,

58
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,849
we don't need to take into account the lost tax revenue from lower cigaret sales

59
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,300
because ultimately that's a transfer payment within society rather than a cost.

60
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,430
So we're just looking at direct health costs from smoking.

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,370
Because this is a ban that is come into effect for anyone born after 2008.

62
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,059
We're going to model the band for each of the next 75 years.

63
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,630
Between 2020 and 2095 until almost 100% of the population is covered under the band.

64
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,580
So essentially each year between now and 75 years in the future,

65
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,499
we will multiply the predicted costs and mortality of the population under

66
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,180
the band by the percent of the total U.S. population who are born after 2008.

67
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,580
We're then going to multiply the status quo costs and mortality by the percent of the population that you were not born after 2008,

68
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,580
and then add those two together to get the costs for each year and the mortality for each year,

69
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,200
which they're going to apply at 3% discount rates about the costs and mortality.

70
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:04,379
And then at the end, we're going to sum each of the cost on mortality for the 75 years that under this study will then go

71
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,760
to where they're going to sum the costs and mortality for 75 years under the status quo as well,

72
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,960
too. But this is then complicated by three other things.

73
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,890
First, we have to add the predicted costs of enforcement to the cost of the band.

74
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,130
Second, we have to take into account the fact that some people will continue to smoke illegally.

75
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,750
We have some estimates on illegal smoking from a mental cigaret band simulation

76
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,830
that we can then extend to the percent of the population who are under the band.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,200
And third, we have to predict the number of people who will leave smoking, but then we'll replace that by increased alcohol use.

78
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,500
And we're going to look at the costs and mortality increases from that increase alcohol use.

79
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,370
And from there, we can then work out the incremental cost effectiveness ratio using the methods that we've done in this class.

80
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,850
So just to give you a bit more detail about our calculation, again, for each of the years between one and 75 years in the future,

81
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:10,470
we will be looking at the population who are the percent of the population who are banned from smoking in each year,

82
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,880
the cost from illegal smokers, substitution and enforcement.

83
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,710
Then we will add that to the percent of the population who are not banned multiplied by the status quo costs.

84
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,249
Then we'll apply the discount rate. Then we will sum that together.

85
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:33,870
To get the total costs of implementing this will then do essentially the same calculation using mortality.

86
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,420
And the reason we're doing it this way is because of mostly because of data availability.

87
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:48,050
There's estimates on the costs and mortality of cigaret use in the entire population and the effect of a ban on the entire population.

88
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,580
But as yet we can't find any information about stepped and staggered bans like the ones that we saw in New Zealand.

89
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:03,660
So as far as I know, this is one of the first times that this sort of age stepped ban is being used in this way.

90
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:16,190
So are there any questions about the methodology? The consequences.

91
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,120
We just know that this is perfect.

92
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,580
So if I can make sure I understand this properly.

93
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,590
I think in some of this you're looking at in the previous slide, I think you had.

94
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Like the percentage of an age group who becomes smokers or nonsmokers.

95
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,660
So are you looking at the entire population or are you just going to focus on people born after 2008?

96
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,110
So in each of the years between the zero, between one and 75, in the future,

97
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,569
our plan is to look at the entire population and then say what percent of this population

98
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,200
will be covered by the ban and what percentage will be not covered by the ban?

99
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,610
The ones who are covered by the ban will then be split feather into that.

100
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,300
Maybe 95% of you will not smoke in the 5% who wants to.

101
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,420
Do you think the ban will affect people? You know my age.

102
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,790
Your age? No. So do you even need to do you even need to calculate numbers for the people born before 28?

103
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:32,250
The point if you're if your analysis goes in the end, if you want to look at the incremental costs between the two.

104
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,750
If if the cost of all the smokers who were born before 2008 are all going to be the same under the status quo or under the ban,

105
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:47,400
you could ignore them and just look at the incremental difference of what's happening to the people born 28 and later.

106
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,079
Yeah. Okay. That might make things a little bit simpler because now you won't you won't get

107
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,620
the aggregate spending on Cigarets or something like that if you do it that way.

108
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,050
But you will get you should get the incremental differences both in terms of cost and health effects if you.

109
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,420
And that might make it a little simpler for you. And you could just focus on that cohort of people born 28 and after.

110
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,770
And then the next slide here, I guess.

111
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, actually, even before you have. I think your lifetime costs of becoming a smoker.

112
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,390
So you have you have that data on lifetime cost of becoming a smoker.

113
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:48,499
So I guess you're going to. Say if someone is born in Norway or you're let's see, someone born in 2008, the ban is going to affect them in 2026 or so.

114
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,090
Is that right? Points.

115
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,840
326 Yes. So.

116
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,740
So you mean you could start your summation in 2026? Right.

117
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,810
And so in 2026, under the status quo.

118
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,030
X percent of 18 year olds become smokers.

119
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,950
And then under your policies, it's something less than X percent become smokers.

120
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:27,880
And then are you saying then if you know they're a smoker, you know, their lifetime cost the lifetime health effects from these these CDC sources?

121
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,030
Is that right or. Yeah. Okay. And so then and yeah.

122
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,929
And so then in that and then you can do the same for for people born in 2009 and 2027 or whatever.

123
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:47,320
And so and every year thereafter, you and you have. So you have my ten course of becoming a smoker.

124
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,520
You have mortality, increase of becoming a smoker. How do you calculate the qualities lost then from that if someone becomes a smoker?

125
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,930
I guess we see most of our data that we could find was on mortality.

126
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:11,680
So. So far we were thinking of just. Calculating the mortality rates and the incremental cost effectiveness of life saved,

127
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,630
but that if we end up we're going to do more research on all the sources,

128
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,680
if we end up being able to find more estimates on quality, then we'll add that in as well to why some so.

129
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,479
So what do they mean when they when they say the mortality increases, what are they what do they mean?

130
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,190
Is that like you have a 2% higher chance of dying or.

131
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,909
Yeah,

132
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:44,649
they essentially the estimates the estimates are the the difference in mortality based on becoming a smoker based or this is not the case but this is

133
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,700
what they're what I am getting at is I think you want to do a conversion maybe

134
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,389
with a marco model or something to see if they give you a mortality rate.

135
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,799
You're saying smokers death rate is twice that of a smoker?

136
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,580
Let's say that doesn't tell you how many years of life are lost or gained.

137
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,220
So you might have to use it with the American child.

138
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,979
Example, there was a 25% increase in mortality with the film or procedure, but that didn't tell you how many years of life were lost.

139
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,160
You have to actually run the mark about figure out how many years of life were lost.

140
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,470
So I don't know, maybe maybe they maybe CDC gives you seven years of life or loss per smoker or something,

141
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,100
or maybe they give you a mortality rate increase, which you might have used.

142
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,560
Mark a model to calculate the years of life lost.

143
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,379
I think it was a the some of the analysis were actual years and some of them were just mortality rates.

144
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,650
So the mortality rates. Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

145
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,849
Okay. I've been asking if just some questions.

146
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:49,510
Anyone else have questions? Yeah.

147
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,000
Now I think there are even a lot of other interesting things you're looking at here and a class of implementing and so forth.

148
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,970
So those would be interesting things to explore. Thank you.

149
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:15,150
Thank you. Okay.

150
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:21,270
So our next group is the End of Life piece.

151
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:46,140
It's such a terrible instrument to.

152
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,360
Which is. I will say for the record,

153
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:06,810
I think you'll have some interesting things there where you'll be aggregating together outcomes for a variety of different age cohorts.

154
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:12,140
So you've got, you know, the kids born in 2008 and people born in 29, 2010.

155
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:23,210
That's a lot of it. And you're looking at the you know, and the impact of on health and cost for all those different cohorts.

156
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,850
And you're probably making a big investment maybe in enforcement.

157
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,220
But then over time, you're affecting more and more people with that enforcement.

158
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,519
I don't know if the enforcement cost scales with the number of people affected by it,

159
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,979
but as probably I would assume, it's probably pretty fixed in terms of enforcement costs.

160
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,330
But that over time you're impacting more and more people see things work better.

161
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:59,300
Hey, good morning, y'all. So my team and I are going to be presenting an end of life period in palliative care analysis.

162
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,170
I'm just going to give a quick introduction to the project.

163
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,560
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer in the United States and around the world and the United States.

164
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,340
Around 46,000 people suffer from pancreatic cancer.

165
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,720
There are two main cancer treatments curative and palliative care and curative care's goal is to extend life.

166
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,250
Our palliative care goal is to reduce the pain of the patient.

167
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,370
Currently, research shows a patients diagnosed with a static pancreatic cancer pursue

168
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,890
expensive treatments to extend life primarily in comparison to palliative care.

169
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,119
So our project will use cost effective analysis to compare the societal cost of curative palliative care

170
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,359
with respect to the benefit that patients receive from treatment of only curative or only palliative,

171
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,390
or the combination of both. And then the purpose of this is going to give patients kind of relative information,

172
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,130
I'm thinking which treatment they should pursue, either just palliative, just curative, or both.

173
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,960
So as I mentioned before, we are doing our city of creative cancer, which is one of the deadliest forms of cancer.

174
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:20,370
And currently what is known in this disease is that the time span or the time horizon for this disease is around one year,

175
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,740
as it's one of the most deadly forms of cancer.

176
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:31,230
And in order to do the study, which is an analysis of others, it is to you're basing it in the United States.

177
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:41,220
And as this is a terminal disease, we are it would be to the the setting of this is in a clinical setting.

178
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:51,569
And in order to understand how it really affects in order to really see like the cost effects of this on will,

179
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,750
we will be doing the study from a societal perspective.

180
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:06,760
It going into what the actual interventions and outcomes will be like is that magical times cured of positive and then a combined care approach,

181
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,000
curative care. One of the common methods of doing that is chemotherapy, radiation therapy,

182
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,510
kind of like a lot of what you're going to think of initially when you're thinking about cancer treatment and for a kind of care,

183
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,180
it's more pain medication, steroids, nerve blockers,

184
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,840
a lot of medications that are intended to ease the pain rather than really extend the life of the patient and of the cancer patients.

185
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:36,220
And then, of course, a combined curative palliative and this is actually going to be what is mostly happening is

186
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,570
you're going to have those pain medications along with the chemotherapy and radiation therapy,

187
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:48,880
because those type of therapies can be pretty rough. But with the as we all know, the cost of treatment is just so incredibly high.

188
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,469
We thought it would be worth it to look at just one or the other versus combine to see where the cost effectiveness kind of lies.

189
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:05,260
Looking back for health outcomes, it's going to be quality of life that's going to be mostly associated with palliative care and extension of life,

190
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,459
which is going to be the curative care.

191
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,630
And then, of course, we can combine those, get quality adjusted life years, but those are going to be the main health outcomes that we're looking at.

192
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,410
And then of course, the cost that is going to be associated with that.

193
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,000
So then we get some really tricky parts of actually measuring how effective the cost is in achieving this.

194
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,490
So we're look at three key metrics when considering us versus monetary costs.

195
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,839
How much actual expense would be incurred by the patient through insurance or a bucket like look extended?

196
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,110
Of course. So how much are they getting for their money, right?

197
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,220
How long are they living? And then how much pain and suffering endured?

198
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:52,250
That's also part of the cost, right? How much my going to have to endure this pain through a curative treatment?

199
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,020
Variation isn't exactly a breeze. And to do that, there's a few ways to do it.

200
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,080
But one one thing I saw that I thought was wrenching is the multiplier method,

201
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:07,940
which will look at the monetary costs incurred and then expand that based on a sliding scale of how much pain was injured.

202
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,169
So we plot estimate costs, expenses of resources using historical averages,

203
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:19,100
looking at how much past patients have put out for curative or palliative care to get a sense for how much it costs.

204
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,040
And then for this kind of future cost costs. In our model, the discount rate I'll be using is around 3%.

205
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,190
And then the last thing is measuring valuation of preferences based on outcomes that will prove pretty tricky.

206
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:40,520
I think, of course, people will kind of show their preferences in their actions, which is a really neat little thing that we think we can use.

207
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,510
But that data might be tough to come by.

208
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,540
So one way we can actually do this is just by looking at the choices individuals make when given the information and deciding what's worth it to them.

209
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,380
So hopefully you find that data and use that to better our study.

210
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,559
So when it comes to the trade model,

211
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:06,209
we don't really need to consider a stochastic model because this is more of a chronic disease that isn't really infectious between patients.

212
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,400
Right? One patient's care is not going to affect another, so we don't need to account for any randomness in the model.

213
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,880
The real decision between decision tree and market model is looking at what our unit of time will be if we're just going to use the time as one year.

214
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,770
Then a decision tree would probably be a little bit easier. But if we want to go per month, we don't want to keep asking, you know, what is?

215
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,230
You know, how many people survived? How many people died per month in a decision tree?

216
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,700
It just kind of gets big and bulky. So if we wanted to do that, we could just do a markup model.

217
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,100
It's a lot simpler, but really what we're looking at is for each treatment regimen,

218
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,370
whether it's strictly palliative, strictly curative, or a combination of both.

219
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,300
We're going to have, you know, costs and quality adjusted life years for each.

220
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,890
But within each group, you know, a certain amount people are going to die per Typekit You know, the five year survival rate is around 3%.

221
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,590
And every year, about half of the patients that had metastatic breast cancer died.

222
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,390
And because of our model, we're going to have certain assumptions, whether it's a decision tree or a markov model,

223
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,960
for to keep the costs and qualities associated with treatment regimens constant per unit of time.

224
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,760
And we're specifically only following individuals with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

225
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,590
And like I said, because we're using the surgery markup model, prevention to the model is independent of the progression of other individuals.

226
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:30,469
And we're also going to keep transmission rates from treatment to death constant, as that's what's provided in the literature.

227
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,670
It's really just a concentrate,

228
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:37,670
not necessarily evolving over time and we're not going to allow for between treatment regimens because although in real life,

229
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,950
maybe you get switches from, you know, strictly curative, strictly phased in over, maybe both.

230
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,150
First, we want to look at just the effectiveness of these compared to each other within the group of

231
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,650
metastatic pancreatic cancer individuals and allowing for transition between those groups.

232
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:58,520
But compared to looking at how one treating regimen is strictly effective against another

233
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,530
and other analytical method analytical methods besides our cost effective analysis,

234
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,999
we haven't really determined because we have a necessary guy with all the data to know what are

235
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,620
the appropriate measures going to take to handle the data so it can be useful for us to analyze.

236
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,820
And if there are any questions, we'll be happy to answer them. Right.

237
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:30,340
Thank you. Anyone in the class have any questions? So I just have a few comments questions.

238
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:36,790
First of all, I think the choice of a Markopolos team is reasonable. And I think for someone with advanced metastatic cancer,

239
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,590
I think it makes sense to probably just have two health states, like basically a lot alive and dead.

240
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,920
You probably know the whole data about very specific, you know,

241
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,870
advanced age between advanced metastatic cancer and death about that would have different costs or quality of life associated with them.

242
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,799
It sounds like maybe you're thinking about monthly transition cycles.

243
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,880
I think that sounds, you know, something on the order of months or weeks or something, that sounds like a good time unit to use for that.

244
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,460
Oh, I think you mentioned a one year, one year time horizon.

245
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:20,740
I think, you know, it sounds like your average life expectancy is for people with this advanced cancer is pretty short one year or less.

246
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,069
One thing to to consider would be though even even though the average is about one year,

247
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,490
it might be useful to think about a longer time horizon to simulate.

248
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,840
And the reason being,

249
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:41,560
I think the reason that someone might get curative treatment is because they really might believe that if they get this treatment,

250
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,340
I'm going to live longer than one year. I might live five years or ten years longer.

251
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,840
Now it's probably very rare, but if, you know, let's say let's say we have a population of ten people,

252
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,550
nine of them immediately die and one is for ten years. The average length of life in that population is one year.

253
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,170
But if you ran a model and only had a one year time horizon, you'd see nine zeroes in one one, and your average would be just a 10th of a year.

254
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,889
So if there if there is and I'm not sure if this is true,

255
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,640
but if there is a possibility that the cure of treatment might let you live for five or ten years,

256
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:21,670
that could make your average look a lot better for the curative treatment arm.

257
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:28,299
Now, again, I'm not sure if that's actually possible that that treatment could could, you know, let you live for that period of time.

258
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,020
But that might be useful to run the model out a little bit longer than one year,

259
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:40,780
just to do to give the curative treatment and option an opportunity to accrue additional life years if that if that possibly is the case.

260
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,150
Um. I like how you're really interested in the preferences.

261
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,310
I think that is an important part of this is, is understanding how does someone view quality of life with radiation and chemotherapy,

262
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,120
which is tied to care versus combinations of these things? Um,

263
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:03,680
I would say it might be good to look in the medical literature and looking at Tufts New England Medical Center Cost Effectiveness Analysis Registry.

264
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,420
See if there are any studies that look at quality of life with various cancer treatments and palliative care

265
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,180
search of that and see if you can find any existing literature on quality of life with those conditions.

266
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,420
In the end, though, as you mentioned, actually, you could look at people's choices and you know,

267
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,560
in the real world we observed some people choosing palliative care and some people choosing chemotherapy.

268
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:30,350
It's unclear how well informed they're when they make those choices, but it does suggest that there might be some heterogeneity there.

269
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,240
Different people might have different vision,

270
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:41,720
preferences or feelings about having radiation and chemotherapy versus having these other medications and medications.

271
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,409
And so one other thing to think about when we talk about this next week in sensitivity analysis is to do some sensitivity

272
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:55,070
access and say what if someone has this kind of preferences for chemotherapy and this kind of preferences for palliative care?

273
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,290
Because everyone is unique and different and there might be some patients in whom cure.

274
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,310
You might find that with certain combinations of preferences, you know,

275
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,900
curative therapy is right for some people and palliative care is right for other people.

276
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,089
So that could be something you could examine in sensitivity analysis. Final question.

277
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:22,490
I guess so. I can just say on many questions here, what what kind of perspective are you thinking of taking the perspective of this you this else's?

278
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,420
We were just thinking of taking societal because, you know, that's just what he kind of recommended, that is.

279
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,160
And as a coach, I was just within the health care system itself.

280
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,090
It just depends on whether or how easy it is for us to quantify the non health care costs that are included.

281
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,340
Yeah. So it's good. Thanks.

282
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:54,530
Thank you. That's true.

283
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,670
Because we do a great job of.

284
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:22,390
You know, specialist cases like suicides.

285
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,880
It's like it's good material. I think.

286
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,960
I think that's a big issue for them.

287
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:43,530
I mean, I wish I could do that.

288
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,700
I'm not thinking circumcision.

289
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,530
I think I was just like, oh, I'm sorry to embarrass that.

290
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm just.

291
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:13,520
Oh, what is it with you guys? You know, I have a position where I think, you know, which is one thing I want to emphasize.

292
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,990
Yeah, I don't know.

293
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,180
All right. Hi, everyone. I'm Noah.

294
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,820
And Margaret can be here today. She's also part of our crew. We are looking at the cost effectiveness of tools.

295
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,729
And to begin, I'll kind of just give you guys a background on what tools are the benefits of dual care and our population focus,

296
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,280
and then we'll go into our methods.

297
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,870
So to begin what our tools, birth tools are defined as someone trained and experienced in childbirth who provides continuous physical,

298
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,339
emotional and informational support to the mother before, during and just after birth.

299
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,329
Typically up to 30 days postpartum. And this is a non-clinical aspect.

300
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,970
So they don't actually help with the physical birth itself. They're more there for the support for the mother.

301
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,850
And then there's a list of care that this can include. So this is like creation of a personalized birth plan with the mother,

302
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,670
education on breathing techniques, nutrition, breastfeeding, provision of massage massages,

303
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,990
and other techniques that can help reduce stress and trauma often experience with childbirth

304
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,459
and then just support during the birth process and then at least one postpartum check in.

305
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,720
But like I said, most studies find that do care consists of 30 days postpartum.

306
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:38,540
So there's a lot of literature showcasing dual care can reduce C-section and preterm birth rates, as well as reduce postpartum depression.

307
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:45,680
Doulas have also been shown to reduce assisted vaginal delivery and epidural rates and improve the overall experience of helping these women.

308
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,800
Their ability to affect labor intervention rates positions them as a part of a cost effective strategy for healthy births.

309
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:58,729
So in this bottom section here, you can see that childbirth is the most frequent reason for hospitalization in the U.S. and charges for maternity

310
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,340
and newborn care exceed those for any other category of hospital expenses for both public and private payers.

311
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,600
For example, C-sections cost twice as much as twice as much as national deliveries,

312
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,220
and infants born preterm have medical costs up to ten times higher than full term infants.

313
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,760
Doula care alone is estimated to save about $1,000 per birth.

314
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,770
And then kind of what makes our analysis different. So previous is the impact of duels concluded that the presence of a train dula

315
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,460
during a woman's delivery can lead to decreased costs and increased qualities.

316
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,860
In many of these studies also found potential cost savings associated with offering coverage for birth style of care.

317
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,010
However, they focused mainly on Medicaid beneficiaries, leaving out a large portion of the US with private insurance.

318
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,910
And then additionally, racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of C-section delivery and worse birth outcomes than their white counterparts.

319
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:54,209
But most analysis did not account for that disproportionate burden. So our group finds it important to focus on this population.

320
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:00,120
Since patient centered providers such as us advocate for patients who are systemically discriminated against in health care settings.

321
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:07,710
Black pregnant people are more than twice as likely as white pregnant people to experience severe pregnancy complications and worse birth outcomes.

322
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,280
And most of these complications are preventable. So increasing access to do care may provide a significant investment return for payers,

323
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,100
while also reducing the rates of pregnancy and childbirth complications and helping bridge gaps in maternal health disparities.

324
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,800
So now we're going to move on to our most ads and a really quick overview, as we mentioned.

325
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:33,479
Our analysis focuses on the cost effectiveness of delay care compared to know delay care and our population of interests,

326
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,209
racial and ethnic minorities. And as we have mentioned, this population has a high risk of delivery related complications,

327
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:46,710
worse birth outcomes and higher rates of C-sections, which obviously increases costs and decreases positive health outcomes.

328
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,340
And through our analysis, we want to understand how to look at impacts,

329
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,390
health outcomes for both the mother and the child, whether it is positively or negatively.

330
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,530
And our time horizon is from the beginning of pregnancy to 30 days for them.

331
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,680
And this is based on our research where we found out that to last provide a minimum of two prenatal visits,

332
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:11,550
one visit during active labor or 38 during the entire labor process, and at least one visit within the first three days postpartum.

333
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:19,020
But this all depends on what the specialty is and what the mother prefers for her own version journey and.

334
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,760
We will focus on three health outcomes, which are maternal mortality and morbidity,

335
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,220
infant mortality, morbidity, and a number of complications during the pregnancy among the women.

336
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,330
Have you guys got costs do care. And our costs that we are focusing on, in addition to the cost of obviously high dollar,

337
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,450
will be the cost of reducing the need for clinical procedures during labor and birth and reducing birth complications,

338
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,260
at least in addition to these prenatal and postpartum costs.

339
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,640
And so that is to advise and educate the mother prenatally and postpartum.

340
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:59,840
And we will analyze our health outcomes and caused by estimating them from results from previous cost effectiveness studies that focus on doula care.

341
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,660
And based on the trends that we know this from past data,

342
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:09,230
we will want to estimate and predict future outcomes for the effectiveness of due care and estimate the reduction in the cost of care.

343
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,030
And then we will use that data to calculate improvement in quality and compare the

344
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,080
icer of the mothers who are provided with the care versus the mothers who aren't.

345
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,760
Yeah. So the perspective we'll be taking is the perspective of the insurance companies in the United States,

346
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:33,490
since they generally have the most power and resource allocation when it comes to either covering dual care or reimbursing for dual care.

347
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,880
And in our cost effective analysis,

348
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:48,550
we hope that it Pru will support in providing important insight regarding data for dual carriers and the benefits of maternal and infant mortality,

349
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:54,790
and prove the value for insurance companies to cover or reimbursed or care services for mothers.

350
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,969
For our methods, we are hoping to start with an informal literature review that will focus around

351
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,730
at least 10 to 15 previous studies post 2013 so that it's generally newer data.

352
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:17,290
If we need to expand two 2010, we're focusing on the U.S. populations and racial and ethnic minorities who are able to get pregnant.

353
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,629
Many studies do not focus on that.

354
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:31,300
So I look for that information studies to do our cost analysis, and we'll also be using a decision tree, hoping to start with this tool of care.

355
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:40,990
And then use that to support information on cost effective analysis and reduce need for clinical procedures pertaining to dual care.

356
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,560
It's compared to the rates between those two and those without.

357
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,930
In the issues, in questions we're still working through, we're just hoping that we find enough data on this.

358
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,120
If not, then I guess we will have to come up with our own.

359
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,399
And second question is do a care coverage reimbursement something that insurance

360
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,650
companies would even be interested in and how can we improve value of it?

361
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,760
Thank you for listening and would love to hear your feedback.

362
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:25,590
Anyone have. So typically here I've been saying many of the questions are pretty quiet and then I ask one or two questions.

363
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,989
Feel free to add to that if you have questions.

364
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:34,590
And as I ask my questions, feel free to raise your hands and interject to a few things as you're going back into the previous slide here.

365
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,190
You're saying is dual coverage reimbursement something insurance companies would be interested in?

366
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:48,180
If I'm an insurance company covering someone who is pregnant, that's a really expensive proposition for me.

367
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,430
And I've showed you guys slides and, you know, it's tens of thousands of dollars, maybe four for cost of delivery.

368
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,040
So that's that's expensive for the insurance companies. That's an expensive event that the insurance companies are paying for it.

369
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:06,629
You know, I would say if you could show that Dula coverage, you know, keeps that cost where it is or what was it,

370
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,510
I think that could be incredibly motivating to the insurance companies to to support it.

371
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,960
And I can imagine that if you said, hey, we save $1,000 per birth or something like that,

372
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,740
the insurance companies would see like, oh, I see a prenatal visit for that patient.

373
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,660
I'm going to give them a call.

374
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,210
Hey, we've thought about the dollar, you know, because that's really valuable for them to, you know, someone to get it and do all of that.

375
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,340
So, you know, I think I think you I would think that if you could demonstrate that it's it's really valuable,

376
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,390
that could be something insurance companies would be would be interested in.

377
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,070
I think you do have some good questions here about, you know, is there enough data?

378
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:48,720
I mean, there clearly is data on just in general maternal mortality and infant mortality rates are higher.

379
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,180
But, you know, precise information, I think it's out there, but you'll have to, you know, look around a little bit.

380
00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah. And that's kind of what we want you to learn from for mostly it's just to make sure that as much information as possible,

381
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,629
especially regarding people, ethnic and racial minorities.

382
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:12,120
Yeah. And that may affect how you how you do your analysis based on the kind of data that you have available to you.

383
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,340
You know, I was thinking, I mean, you just said, you know, bipoc and racial ethnic minorities,

384
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,490
you might divide that up into different, different populations depending on the, you know, being able to function.

385
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:33,179
Yeah. The previous slide you had, you know, decision tree and I think and you mentioned also in in previous studies,

386
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,330
you know what makes our analysis different to you clearly looked at some other studies here.

387
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,900
If you had if you had a, you know, today and I've asked you today if you had to kind of diagram your decision tree what it was like.

388
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:49,860
Yeah. So I know I can do it, but I, you know, I sorry, I'll be honest.

389
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,989
We're going to start with the intervention,

390
00:40:51,990 --> 00:41:02,000
which is to do like air and then treatment circles and then we're going to go and do like care is provided in our decision tree.

391
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,180
We will see what the differences in the costs are and the reduction in the complications

392
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,640
and taking it on from prenatal to all the way through postpartum of that.

393
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,450
Yeah, I you would start with like is it provided or not?

394
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:22,500
If it's provided or if it's not provided, what is the total costs of the pregnancy?

395
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,490
If it is provided, then I think it would go from.

396
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:34,770
Like When did it start? Like when the war began covering the individual.

397
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:42,990
And then see if there's any differences between like, you know, the first trimester, first third trimester,

398
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,549
any differences there that kind of build up there and then like measure the costs that

399
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:53,340
we can find for each part mean for C section that's in most of the literature we found.

400
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,520
That's a highly noted piece of data.

401
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,040
So it may be need for C-sections, preterm birth rates, need for epidurals, stuff like that.

402
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,299
So yeah, I mean my and reading the literature to that it's a big thing is is what's the chance

403
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,170
of a C-section with and without a dula and if you can reduce the C-section rate,

404
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:18,120
like you mentioned earlier, you know, C-sections are many, you know, 10 to $10000.

405
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,290
And so and so that's a big driver of costs and of course, quality of life as well.

406
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:33,820
But yeah, it's also. So do you think that if someone has a duel early on, that it might reduce the risk of preterm delivery as well?

407
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:40,719
I think so, yeah. So then I think that's interesting to, you know, to look at, you know, when does the dual get engaged?

408
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,740
And you could think about that as as either an uncertainty or a decision.

409
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,060
You know, do you do you recommend to do in the first tranche, second, third?

410
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,800
You know, maybe it's more expensive if you start started the first because there's more time that the dual spends with the mother.

411
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,970
But maybe it's also more beneficial.

412
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,479
You know, if you start in the first trimester, it reduces the rate by this much.

413
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,880
If you start in the third trimester and maybe just reiterate all of this, if you're starting in the third trimester,

414
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,799
maybe part of that depends on the kind of the data you're able to find it and effectiveness and and how all that works.

415
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,170
But that, you know, that could be interesting thing. Yeah. So that that would be something I would start thinking about, you know,

416
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,940
in the next week or so as you're working on your the method section is to kind of diagram out what

417
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:28,000
are the key things you think are going to be happening that might be affected by a do a again,

418
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,270
preterm delivery C-section rates? I mean, those are probably some big things.

419
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:35,830
I don't know if there are other things to think about, but those are important things that would drive,

420
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:42,610
you know, costs and quality of life and mortality for both the adult and the infant.

421
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,070
You know, and I think I will say one interesting thing about this type of study that's different from many other

422
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:55,510
studies we'll hear on this class is you really have two patients to think about that are going to be,

423
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,969
you know, having costs and quality of life.

424
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:03,830
You've got, you know, the mother and the child, both of which, you know, maternal mortality, child mortality.

425
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:10,120
Obviously, those things affect a lot of, you know, quality of life qualities.

426
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,360
And and then, of course, then, you know, events that have costs and so forth.

427
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,069
So anyway, you get a lot of, you know, a lot of things to pick on here.

428
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:24,230
But I would, you know, start with the previous literature and see how they did this and kind of build upon it.

429
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,960
That's kind of. Okay. So other questions related to the price.

430
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,090
Just one final comment. I like that you've had this. What makes our analysis different side of.

431
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:45,629
I guess my expectation that is is is that if a previous study found this is cost effective and you're saying that was in a general population,

432
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:52,020
but this is an even higher risk population, my initial assumption would be you're going to find that this is even more

433
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,100
cost effective because there's a there's more benefit to be gained from that.

434
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,140
So that's something to look at and one potential thing you could look at.

435
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,810
So my initial belief here is that you'll probably find a more cost effective.

436
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,240
So one thing you could. So then the question to me as well, why aren't people doing this already?

437
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,060
If it's going to be coming, is this a package that is more cost effective?

438
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,610
Well, any need to have insurance coverage, something like that. That's a separate kind of structural issue maybe.

439
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:26,640
But you could ask some questions in sensitivity analysis.

440
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,030
What if? So let's say a dual it costs $3,000.

441
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,129
You say what if you spend $5,000? Is it still cost effective in this population?

442
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,830
And then. And that could guide insurance companies to say, well, this is a special population.

443
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,640
For whatever reason, dual rates are utilization is really low.

444
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,890
Maybe we pay more for duals to encourage dual use in this population.

445
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,629
You might find that it's if you find it's even more cost effective, then you can say,

446
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,800
well, we can invest more in it and it would still be cost effective.

447
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,180
You know, you think of anyone else.

448
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:06,870
Okay.

449
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:18,060
So today I also wanted to, um, you know, just talk about the results section of our paper also just briefly talk about that and then I'll let you go.

450
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:25,440
Set us free to work on your projects for a little bit. Time to. Oh.

451
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:40,130
My mouth is like I can't hear.

452
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,580
I was like, I just got in this thing.

453
00:46:51,620 --> 00:47:04,160
I was like. But.

454
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:25,650
Thanks. You have to be.

455
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,660
Previously. Yeah, that's true.

456
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:43,860
And hopefully the atmosphere here, when we have what kind of results here,

457
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:51,410
this will remind you what this is all about and why why you're doing all these methods just to get the results.

458
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:57,360
How are the results presented? And in the end, you want to be able to produce a table like this.

459
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:03,150
You want to be able to produce a table that has interventions. AB I can see here, you know, you only need really,

460
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,330
really two if you're doing more than two grade minimum here is is two and then

461
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:13,020
you want to show costs and quality adjusted life years for each intervention.

462
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,220
You want to organize this with the lowest cost intervention first and then the next one and the next one.

463
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:25,460
Increasing in cost, you are able to produce, you know, the net lifetime costs and qualities for each intervention.

464
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,700
And if you find the one is more expensive but also has more problems in the other, you calculate incremental cost effective treatment.

465
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:37,910
That's kind of the minimum you want to show up. You can show more, though, in your in your final table.

466
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:45,290
And sometimes it's interesting to show more information. So here we have cost inequalities, but you could show, you know, treatment.

467
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,820
Costs. And maybe disease costs.

468
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:05,960
And then total costs. If it's interesting, you break it out, you could put in cost to the patient and cost to the insurance company.

469
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,330
Societal costs. You can break things down if you think that that's interesting.

470
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:14,610
You could. You know, while these loss from side effects require gain from disease averted, you know,

471
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:19,140
you can you can break out things if you find that that is it's interesting enrollment.

472
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:28,799
You also report, for example, the cigaret smoking example you're going to show costs of quality but you could you could maybe show under the

473
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,770
status quo will have 30 million cigaret smokers and under with this new policy you only have 29 cigaret smokers.

474
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,900
You know, you could present other additional results that you think are interesting and relevant.

475
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,730
And then even though in the end we want to be able to plot our interventions on the cost effectiveness plane here.

476
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,569
So all these and costs, how are these things related to each other?

477
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:57,660
And I like to see this visually. It gives you a sense of, you know, are any of these interventions maybe an intervention up here?

478
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:04,290
This intervention here would be dominated. It'd be worse along the directions of costs of all these compared to something else.

479
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:12,320
So you know that if that intervention is out there, we can, you know, it's dominated.

480
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:17,760
We don't have to consider it. The only important interventions we want to consider are these ones.

481
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,990
Out here on this efficient frontier.

482
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:32,150
The cost, I explained, is another important thing to report in your in your results section, and then something that can be helpful here too.

483
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:42,290
Is this Cheers checklist? This is helpful. Don't worry that if you're hit for these next few checklists here, I want to show them to you.

484
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,940
You can include them in your in your in your analysis.

485
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,690
I think they're helpful for your cost targets, policies, class projects.

486
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,930
If some if some parts of these things are too burdensome or difficult.

487
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,800
Just make a note of that. But I think this is useful.

488
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,349
And then again, there are some valuable things in this class for your class projects.

489
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:08,780
But as a consumer, I again, I think a lot of people will be consumers of these analysis in the future.

490
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,590
You know, it's important to understand, you know, what a good analysis should have.

491
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,640
And if it's missing something, understand the why. One of the problems with being missing.

492
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,140
So there are some just basic things here about including a title and abstract,

493
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,910
why it's important in that in the introduction methods to describing all these things,

494
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:34,400
you know what is being prepared with time rising discount rate, what outcomes are being examined.

495
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:45,590
How are you measuring the effectiveness or the health outcomes? Specifics about the costing and the model analytical methods.

496
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,650
Some of the things that you should show in the results and then discussion.

497
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:00,549
So this checklist is handy. And actually I think most of these things you probably want to include in your analysis.

498
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,790
And so that's a good checklist to remember what you want to include in it.

499
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,500
And again, as a consumer, though,

500
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:13,780
realize what are some of the if you're reading an analysis and it's missing one of these things like the comparators,

501
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,600
that would be a big problem if a study didn't mention what the comparators are, then you're not really sure.

502
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,980
What are they comparing this new interaction to? Some one other thing, three other things.

503
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,049
So some of these things are, you know, critical to having an analysis.

504
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,440
And if they're missing, it really makes it much more difficult to interpret.

505
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,050
And this is another checklist.

506
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:54,530
This is from health and medicine, also showing.

507
00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:00,340
Each of these little pieces where they put it.

508
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,549
And this is a lot of this is very similar to the cheers checklist I've noticed here though

509
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,060
here they have there is some good in the journal article or in technical appendix.

510
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,440
So that's if you're looking for something in a cost effective analysis, you might not find it in the main paper.

511
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,910
You might have to search a technical appendix to find some of the details of certain things that cost resources.

512
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,290
Hopefully, when people are publishing these cost resources, the most important things, most relevant things are in the main paper.

513
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:29,449
But if you're really interested and you're like, I don't I'm not sure I like the way they did this or this or this.

514
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:38,660
Oftentimes, you can look at a technical appendix to that information as you guys were looking at some of these checklists, if you have any questions.

515
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,330
And then the final thing here is this this impact inventory.

516
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,220
Know, I think this is this is also a new kind of kind of checklist as well.

517
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:07,220
And I want you to kind of think of different things that could be included in a cost effective analysis.

518
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:12,530
You don't have to include everything that is best in your cost benefit analysis for this project.

519
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:17,629
But I think it's good to just expand your thinking about what maybe could or should be in a cost benefit analysis.

520
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,459
So here we have, you know, things in the formal health care sector,

521
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,200
those are probably the most important things that are often included in cost of our facilities.

522
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,120
Like does our intervention change longevity?

523
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:36,170
Does it affect quality of life?

524
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,909
Are there other health effects like adverse events or transmission infection?

525
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:49,490
And we have medical costs of health outcomes, health effects, medical costs paid by a variety of different people.

526
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:57,320
And it's that the things that are directly relevant to the disease, but maybe some unrelated or future related or unrelated medical costs.

527
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:06,680
And there's the informal. So those are ones that we always we typically think about, but then also think about the informal health care sector.

528
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,620
So like the palliative care group, maybe you have some patient time costs to go to all these medical appointments.

529
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:22,100
They have unpaid caregiver time costs. So if someone is is sick and bedridden, they might have a spouse or child who takes care of them.

530
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,170
That is a that is a real cost. That's part of the societal costs.

531
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,800
So unpaid caregiver time. So transportation costs, these are other things to potentially consider as part of that.

532
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,240
The costs of that are affected by interventions.

533
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,680
And then we have all these other things to potentially think about.

534
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,080
You'll also notice here, there there are these checkboxes, your health care sector and societal.

535
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,410
All those first things we talk about are clearly part of the health care sector.

536
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,590
All these other things. There are more societal costs things, two things to consider, and then things like productivity.

537
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,390
So again, if someone has some sort of advanced cancer, they might not be able to work.

538
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,250
So there might be some productivity costs, probably not different.

539
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,040
The palliative care example, there's probably a difference in productivity costs,

540
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,360
whether you're getting palliative or cure of care or the combination thereof.

541
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,990
But if you're thinking about some maybe some sort of cancer prevention intervention,

542
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:22,070
that might if you prevent cancer, maybe you improve productivity in the future.

543
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:34,190
And we have consumption social services that are part of an intervention of criminal justice costs, education, housing, environment or others.

544
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,590
So there are a lot of potential things to consider.

545
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:46,160
I will say, you know, 99% of cost effective analysis really focus on just these these things here at the top, maybe include productivity.

546
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:54,500
These things the bottom most are rarely included because most medical interventions probably don't affect, you know, housing or the environment.

547
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,249
But potentially there are certain interventions where you could.

548
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:05,390
So maybe if we're think about mold remediation, you might think about housing costs and improving,

549
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,170
you know, spending money on more remediation, improving ventilation at home.

550
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:09,860
It's like that.

551
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:19,460
And so your depending on the type of intervention, some of these things at the bottom of the list are really addresses, education, things like that.

552
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:28,020
They may be relevant most cost is probably not all of but there are some where it is relevant and might be an important thing to include.

553
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:40,420
Any questions? Yes. If we find costs that like they're not exactly what we're looking for, is it best to just not.

554
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:45,759
Like, how much should we manipulate existing costs to try and fit it to our product

555
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,300
versus just like excluding it because there's not enough data around them?

556
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:56,140
I mean, I would say so that's a little bit of our question of our, you know, do we include this or not?

557
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,700
And it kind of depends, I guess.

558
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:11,380
So for that, let's say the dual example, you know, they want to look at racial, ethnic minorities and let's say a C section is important thing here.

559
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,090
So maybe you can get data on here's what a vaginal delivery costs and a C-section costs.

560
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,370
Now, maybe, though,

561
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,910
whenever a data source it is doesn't break out the costs for an African-American getting a C-section versus African-American getting better.

562
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:32,740
Or maybe it's just special delivery and C-section. Now, I guess there might be some differences by racial and ethnic minorities.

563
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,950
You know, given that you have a C-section, maybe your costs are slightly different.

564
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:44,050
I don't know. But I would probably assume that it's the same and we're just going to use the general C-section costs and not worry about that.

565
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,200
Did they specifically disaggregated by race and ethnicity?

566
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:54,220
So I'd be totally fine using just general C-section and general vaginal delivery costs there.

567
00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:01,030
But, you know, did you have some but there could be something where you're really doing a lot of manipulation.

568
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,940
So it's like, well, I didn't I couldn't find any cost.

569
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,680
So but I did find this study in Bangladesh where they had costs of vaginal delivery and C-section delivery.

570
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,339
Well, and that I could I could do a currency conversion.

571
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:19,660
And but I'm sure bachelors degree and C-section costs in Bangladesh are very different than here in the U.S. So it it probably would be really,

572
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:28,210
really suspect to try to take those costs and try to apply them in a U.S. health care context.

573
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,650
Did you have something in mind or a question you were thinking about specifically?

574
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,730
Not specifically right now. I was just wondering, like, there are some things where, like,

575
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,870
we could tweak and I just like what links it was best, like how far you should go to tweak to get it.

576
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:49,300
Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, I guess I would I would enter on the side of of going forward with it and making some adjustments,

577
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:53,110
just being very clear and say, okay, you know, we couldn't find data for this.

578
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,900
We use Bangladesh numbers, we did the currency conversion.

579
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:05,739
And then and we decided that Bangladesh wages are also half those of U.S. So we then double the cost and just make it very

580
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:12,129
clear what the assumptions you're making as you're doing those translations and then doing a sensitivity analysis on that.

581
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:19,360
So saying, look, we went through a lot of manipulations of these numbers and because of that, we're highly uncertain about that.

582
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,950
This final number is the right number.

583
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:30,430
And so we'll do some sensitivity analysis on that and saying, well, we think it's roughly $20,000, but maybe it's ten and maybe it's 40.

584
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,640
I mean, have a really wide range to explore there because you're highly uncertain that all those conversions were appropriate and accurate.

585
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:44,469
And again, I think a lot of this, too, is being clear and transparent about everything that you've done.

586
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,770
So you're not hiding that you manipulate.

587
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,429
It's something that you're very clear and you say, look, we we didn't have very good data,

588
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:57,730
so we took this not so good data and we did these adjustments and manipulations of it to get something better.

589
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:02,680
So I'm working on a project right now with the CDC where we're looking at respiratory

590
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:10,100
syncytial virus interventions and the data that's CDC has on a data on risk positions,

591
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:19,179
this virus infections in their surveillance network. But they realize in this way, if these hospitals reporting RSV infections to them,

592
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:24,520
but they realize that not everyone who has RSV actually gets tested and reported into the system.

593
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,499
So they have a kind of fudge factor for underreporting based on some other, you know, good studies and so forth.

594
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,060
But it is still kind of a fudge factor.

595
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,240
And so we're going to have to, you know, take this number and then, you know, vary it up and down in sensitivity also to see,

596
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,170
you know, what, that number is not right about the burden of RSV in the community.

597
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,069
What a time where it's lower. You know, we can we can test for that.

598
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:54,010
And you we just have to be very clear about any kind of manipulations of that as the numbers are adjustments for for the questions.

599
01:01:56,370 --> 01:02:04,410
So anyway, for free projects, you know, feel free to make those kind of adjustments if you if you think that they are helpful and reasonable.

600
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,230
But just be very clear about how you are to those.

601
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:14,730
And I would say, you know, many times it's probably better to take a bad number and make some adjustments than then totally leave it out entirely.

602
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,480
I mean, that's that's also an assumption. If you leave it out entirely, you're assuming that the cost is zero or whatever it is.

603
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,340
That rate is zero. Which also which might be even a worse assumption.

604
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:42,910
So that's. Well, we've got another 20 minutes here, but I'm going to let you guys work on your give you guys some project time.

605
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,830
I know that's valuable for you. And so I'll just be here up in the front.

606
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,800
If you have any questions, come on down. Happier.

607
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:59,500
And so next next class, we've got the other five groups and we'll spend most of that time with presentations that.

608
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:27,820
You want to turn your head to think, you know, it's just it's really it's really kind of like it's just like the Punisher, you know, it's a privilege.

609
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,209
It's like it's been like a lot of shuttle was in the airport in a way with the TSA.

610
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,790
It would be this anyone's linen bag over there.

611
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:45,460
And these are pencils, duct tape and those like all these are back to their cells.

612
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:53,170
And, you know, they got to Detroit and they're getting shells and trying to say, we are based only on the papers.

613
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:08,110
Okay. So I looked at the devices and they all like, yeah, yeah.

614
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:14,800
I mean, it's not like we should care about the 5%.

615
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:29,460
So I think, you know, like I said, I just don't I don't know, I guess there's all kinds of things.

616
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:35,550
So I might say something like that.

617
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:45,180
I might just say that like universal marketing was around like, you know,

618
01:04:46,870 --> 01:05:00,969
would you rather have the issues of are we going to sex toys, you know, whenever you get chance at the mothers?

619
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:10,990
Because I think it was like holding her freshly curled hair or like I think our troops are going to be released.

620
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:17,010
This is really inspiring survival.

621
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:35,799
And just like, you know, I just I like, you know, like sometimes we live in a time where the powers can use work or something like that.

622
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:45,940
But yesterday's one that was like that, you know, it's like actually one day, like every other day.

623
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,440
I think so, yeah. I'll talk to you when I get back home.

624
01:05:50,650 --> 01:06:06,310
And just on how they're going to change areas about like it's almost like this like, you know, really for 20 years we're all civilians.

625
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:17,620
So at one point so different because I don't think that it was like this is like how we are here to be

626
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:33,070
a little more like looking at each other like it was just like the scope of the difference between,

627
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:40,060
oh, you do have to push it out into the world.

628
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:56,060
And I think the most amazing thing is just how many people what is it that we're seeing here or to create those?

629
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:07,490
Yeah, I'm trying to sort of a check on the kids.

630
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:18,770
If I know you're looking for something like someone else's, which prepares you for the U.S. doing it.

631
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:25,870
So I think it's like, yeah, I think it's inspired me.

632
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:33,760
I would go, but I just you mean I don't think I knew about this.

633
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:46,590
I was I just like going with this Indian driver to try to just try to figure out what is going on.

634
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:53,920
And I was just like, you give anybody to be good.

635
01:07:54,250 --> 01:08:02,110
You know, like I said, that mentality is like on board the London bombings.

636
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:09,590
And I just went. But I'm sure they could find out what it is.

637
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:37,740
Really not so much about what they do about it, you know.

638
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:47,220
Right. And I'd be like, Oh, I love getting to work together.

639
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,250
Yeah. Yeah.

640
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:11,880
But there's so much because you think got to have the right to be there.

641
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:22,090
Right. It's so. It's so good to see you.

642
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:32,760
I don't know. Yeah. So it comes in your true to that.

643
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:42,420
In fact, this is really interesting.

644
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:58,140
You have you have you are able to learn how to talk to people who are going to have to work on outcomes.

645
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,530
You think otherwise. I when this started it was kind of like.

646
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:25,600
Yeah. I'm not exactly like, you know, what I do is I do like grinds and reduce, which is a reduction in a lot of these qualities.

647
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:44,730
So once I start, when I look at the point, I think like I just, I mean,

648
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:58,100
I think that's those are things that I asked her how to find out and bring out something like radical spending,

649
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,760
but also other things are probably affecting mortality.

650
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,680
So. Well, I have you know,

651
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:24,150
you might think about your decision tree I mean you could have is almost universally

652
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:40,409
is is your decision not yet there being no be and I guess there are models that CBS

653
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:46,050
News it's like you know that right you had the injury and that's the costs that are

654
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:53,510
in this country might change but it's also saving with the screening in the case.

655
01:11:53,510 --> 01:12:06,260
And we're just look at the circumstances and I think you know you could do it is like I don't know I think it's almost like some sort of paperwork.

656
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,360
Yeah. And then it just happened to your wife or it something like that.

657
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:28,670
I watched it on the plane and don't have time for some sort of fluctuation because then you might want to call and say that someone wants to do it.

658
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:34,890
If I paid, I have a baby chance. So I just haven't been interested in screening.

659
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:42,000
Talk about reading options. How do you think the disease manifests itself and what kind of do you have for outcomes like this?

660
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:51,980
All we can say to you or if you think it's some sort of if you want to see the process you can always find is right.

661
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:59,070
Um hum. Yeah. I have heard about it with some friends, interesting interests.

662
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:03,630
And as I say, sometimes these things don't work.

663
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,270
Then people might get out and I'm going to get the.

664
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:13,960
And so I'm just that was just for me, it's like out of surgery, a surgery to remove a whole lot of work like this.

665
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:20,530
And I don't know if that's something that these studies look at pictures and that's just the rates in classroom.

666
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:35,070
I think that's what that's what I'm supposed to be able to grasp because I think you're

667
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:45,560
just going to be are looking for people like me early that they might be thinking that.

668
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:55,060
I really don't think that part of the heart is just and I was I was just I'm just trying to be is just to be in disorder.

669
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:59,360
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's a good question.

670
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:14,829
Because what it was just like in recent weeks, I was like, do you like it or not?

671
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:18,070
Or frustration? I don't know.

672
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:28,690
I think that also drives medical spending. Like if I have the opinion, I probably don't have to see my doctors all over the place.

673
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:36,390
And of course, but I think it's just like, yeah, I could just like people with symptoms ask me to spend thousands more.

674
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:47,019
Yeah, yeah, that's like that. So that's not what I want to make.

675
01:14:47,020 --> 01:15:03,879
No problem. I mean, you are not necessarily something useful, for which there are not, however, but when you're walking out like that,

676
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:15,850
even to get out of these states and the district attorney there and there's like it's the war on terrorism now.

677
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:31,270
And so all of my girlfriend, which is an American thing we have some serious Ben Stiller on so our various bills and you meet like a

678
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:44,680
lot more and more secrets so let's say you write back and then you put out another one and excellent.

679
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:51,590
So that each one of your friends are great.

680
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,880
But it's you got to get out of this.

681
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,140
And by the time you do, do try to make good assignments.

682
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,879
It's like if a guy that you think about.

683
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,050
Yeah, and actually maybe tomorrow you can't do these else.

684
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:17,560
So Yeah. I don't know what else to do you know.

685
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:29,520
Yeah. I think we should definitely look at this marriage like this without a doubt concerned about it.

686
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:43,659
So, yeah, you know, I don't even think I would I would try to look and see what the results are.

687
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,880
You shouldn't say, oh, you're here.

688
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:54,880
But there's a lot work that I was up or down because you're with me, because this child is going to die.

689
01:16:55,510 --> 01:17:01,680
I mean, we didn't have anything to instill.

690
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:13,570
So I think it's like you just said, I just I was just, like, 70%.

691
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:21,129
It's gonna be pretty easy. I was, like, talking to you, so that that might be too much trouble.

692
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:25,960
You should get some of the good stuff. I just have a no longer.

693
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:47,980
So we were thinking about we had such things as well because anymore you just, you know, that's how I went to Costs of a boy in 2008.

694
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:58,690
And as we do our studies and when I say what it costs what he it yeah so it was a good start.

695
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:03,190
So what I want you to structure. Yeah. Like I said.

696
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:08,790
From the outside.

697
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,749
Thank you so much for your work. And I guess it really will probably cost that home.

698
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:18,780
The attorney for the defendant.

699
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:24,580
Multiply that by what is appropriate and what I mean, I was planning something like that,

700
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:54,000
like so and so this is this is not how much the industry takes so I'm just gonna try to on in if in 2017

701
01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:08,740
okay so and so you can just like and I don't have the passport so I think so much so that you're like,

702
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,530
okay, we would hear your cost is your cost is from the entire U.S.

703
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,520
That's right. Yeah, those are the estimates.

704
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:25,690
But I guess it would be projecting out because it's just like like the most common ones with your study information.

705
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:30,399
So we're just I guess when I was an individual basis,

706
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:37,809
so so we're just saying where we collections that exist or whatever is going on and this is the

707
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:48,760
entire of we have to adjust the hospital like I'm just trying to every year to start those outside.

708
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,420
So we're trying to be like this year to take that totally useless.

709
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,510
Yes. Yes. Was.
