1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,930
And we're taking your questions.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:14,300
You ready to? I'm actually ready just to get roasted lyrics from Max from now on.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,300
Absolutely not. I would that be his name? I'm the management fellow.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,670
He's my manager. Because I've left. I'm not your manager.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,950
God, it's been such a this week. It's been so tight, just like scheduling things around my own schedule.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:37,349
Like, I'm not even going to do research. I am. I'm seeing somebody I remember he was talking to because, you know, somebody said,

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,860
if I could just get a quick look around and a lot of people think it's, you know, the guys, we think it's because.

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,320
I feel like a huge deal. Yeah. Yeah. I say either like, you know,

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,569
I have we first met was expected to be more steady like last week on Monday it was in

10
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,620
the order that I don't look at such things we might not have been like I was like,

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm going to show up because that's what I'm told.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,780
So I have noticed this, but on the title also because I mean, it's just all just my, you know, my cost intellectually.

13
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,080
I mean, the cost was going to like what I said to the other page.

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm sorry, I didn't, you know, I really liked it, you know.

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,969
So I was like, I was really interested because that's what it was actually.

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,520
I was very focused on your methods.

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:51,120
I mean, this text was just whatever. So I also wanted to the text and that I was going for last year.

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,110
But I think the text on this. So I mean, I know I just made a table where I didn't text.

19
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,070
I was like, Oh, because this was just like over and do we have the bike lanes group?

20
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,490
Okay. A little small gas station today, but I don't know what's going on.

21
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,790
All the papers are here, so presumably they'll show up.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,350
Hopefully. I'm like, well, articulate will articulate hearing, but we don't want to think about those people.

23
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,870
First of all, I it's. I'm going to give you something today.

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,930
Yeah. I don't remember. Okay. Yeah.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,000
So I had like a weird in a way that I didn't know you had.

26
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,120
So, I don't know. I find myself thinking, Oh, well, I can, I know what I'm going to do.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I also think I, you know, I felt I don't know, I didn't think that transportation actually is.

28
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,690
And I was like, just ask everyday, you know, we just have different reasonably high intensity swimming.

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,590
I was like, I got it right.

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,310
You're not supposed to do that. No.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:23,010
This is the data that you see in relation to this decision, soon to be more top notch.

32
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,040
Is there a way to speak on that? That's. Yeah. I don't know how that might be similar to another world.

33
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,570
Yeah, that's at least that's how we think.

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,680
You're not going to be able to do your best.

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,230
So used to the topic. Have you seen a lot of plastic other people? I don't know what it is.

36
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,629
I mean, we have great chemistry, but there's no way to make this like not duplicate.

37
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,830
But like, if you want to, you can be critical because I'm going to be able to see them here.

38
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,259
It's like it's like I mean, I am I think you're going to do it and we can just read it off here.

39
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,870
The episode begins. Thank you all for your patience and thank you.

40
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:26,460
Okay. Do you think this is okay?

41
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,420
Is our committee okay? Hi, guys. Thanks for coming today and our project is going to be unlikely.

42
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,350
Okay. So our our objective that we're trying to determine is the cost effectiveness of protected bike lanes compared to unprotected bike lanes,

43
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,790
specifically in the city of Detroit. So there's different classifications of bike lanes.

44
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,479
So the things that we're more so looking at is considered a class one.

45
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,820
So there's like a physical separation from the traffic. So there's different buffers and ways to do that in a protected bike lane, but.

46
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,180
We're just looking at that as a whole. But there's like an existing buffer. And so the population that we're doing, the city of Detroit.

47
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,840
So over the last few years, Detroit has invested 14 million in bike lanes, but only 50, 50 miles of them are protected.

48
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,799
Majority of them are unprotected. And the reason we are curious more about we're curious about Detroit's was

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,140
because they have some of the highest fatalities from injuries and accidents.

50
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:36,130
So when just in the year 2020, they had 53 bike accidents and then found a study that looked up bike accidents over the years.

51
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,300
So from 2008 to 2017, there was see the distribution of bike accidents that occurred in a protected lane versus unprotected lane.

52
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,729
And there's lots of other research that backs up this map here, the specific city of Detroit.

53
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,730
And it shows you just like a heat map of where more of the accidents are.

54
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,360
Right. And then the reason why this is kind of important,

55
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,700
why we wanted to do a cost effective announced for this is bicycle crashes actually cost the hospitals us as a whole a lot of money.

56
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,790
So it's 237 billion and medical cost is what they found from 1997 to 2013.

57
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,680
And that's what we paid due to bicycle injuries.

58
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,570
And then, of course, these events have lasting economic impacts on the individuals themselves, not not just the hospital society,

59
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,790
but they also have, you know, loss of income due to medical bills on time, off the bus employment.

60
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,870
So this is an example of one of Detroit's it's a picture of Detroit. This is one of their protected bike lanes, looks like.

61
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:41,380
We found other studies that showed that you can have anywhere from a 28% to 40, 50% reduction in injuries if you have a protected bike lane.

62
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,620
And then this is an example of what their unprotected bike lanes look like.

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,610
So as I said, Detroit has the highest bicyclist fatality rate of any city in Michigan.

64
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,209
It has one of the higher four metro areas. Sure. Yes. And in total, it is a higher fatality rate than Grand Rapids.

65
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,700
Ann Arbor advancing the morning combined, free sandwich, chocolate muffins.

66
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:13,840
So we're going to do a cost effectiveness analysis to help us determine how to best use our resources and allow us to understand

67
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,260
the benefits of bike lanes versus unprotected free riders by calculating health outcomes using quality just like your sleep.

68
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,180
And so Abbott has talked about Detroit has been increasing and investing more in bike lanes.

69
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,500
So we think that this is an opportunity to target protected bike lanes specifically.

70
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,130
Yes. And we are going to use a societal perspective in our time horizon is over ten years.

71
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,940
And then just like the basic adjustment factors will be used in the development.

72
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,930
So we made this decision trying to just kind of get started thinking about this.

73
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:51,310
So you can see protected versus unprotected and then like there's an injury or they hospitalized and then do they die or survive?

74
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,290
So we started this project thinking that this is going to be the best way to think about this.

75
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,510
But the way that we've gotten into it and I've talked more about it, we are thinking about a market model might make more sense.

76
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,720
Just being able to kind of like move through states like if you're injured,

77
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,300
then you can be uninsured again and then you have to get hurt if you're hospitalized or whatever.

78
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,940
So I think that's one thing that we would like feedback on is if a more hub model makes more sense for this context.

79
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah. And then we're going to get into a bit more about this. Yeah.

80
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,660
So it's kind of going over the health outcomes and kind of just generally prefacing this.

81
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,300
A lot of this kind of methodology is pulled from a specific study that is said by the good at all paper that was done in New York City.

82
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:42,160
Kind of a similar analysis with some some nuanced differences, but an overarching methodology was pretty similar.

83
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,060
So we thought that was kind of a good study to emulate in a different context here for Detroit.

84
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:54,280
So what they did in that study is they kind of had a hospitalization due to like injury or kind of overall health related quality of life score.

85
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,099
And this on the far right side, there was a kind of developed by these Columbia researchers that was kind of calculating

86
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,150
the average health rate of quality of people who are hospitalization for a bike injury.

87
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,129
So kind of a rough proxy.

88
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,590
But yeah, that was what was put together by a team of researchers, researchers who were, you know, familiar with these types of accidents.

89
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,500
And that was their best estimation of reduction in quality of life that results from sort of injuries and I guess just giving out.

90
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,700
So we're using this specific h.r.

91
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,470
Tool score is it's a 0 to 1 scale because, you know, different metrics kind of different scales.

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,760
So, you know, point one being, you know, perfect health and zero being just an idea.

93
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,750
And then another assumption kind of in this paper that we thought we would also bring over is that, you know,

94
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,410
for minor bike injuries where no hospitalization was required, oh,

95
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,209
we're not going to really factor in the assumption in health related quality of life just because,

96
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,300
you know, you've also got to try and maybe scrape your news or something like that's not really going to dramatically alter your,

97
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,100
you know, long term health related quality of life.

98
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,220
And it's not really the purpose of analysis or worth, you know, kind of quantifying in a major way.

99
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,640
And so that was the approach is in that paper as well. And then of.

100
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,990
If there's no injury, there's not going to be a reduction in health related quality of life and death with, you know, pushed down to zero.

101
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:18,029
And then so kind of just another. No, we would also have to account for or adjust for, you know, age specific risk of death.

102
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,229
So there would be, you know, in this New York City paper as well,

103
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:30,480
they had a kind of a methodology where survivors are gaining a structural adjusted life year from the kind of average age of bikers.

104
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
And they had a kind of a metric for the average age of bikers in New York City.

105
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,839
And we found some similar numbers for Detroit that we kind of want out of that a little more.

106
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,520
But, you know, that's the general approach that there's just kind of an average age range that you would use.

107
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,950
And then, you know, it's just kind of a calculation set up where if the riders are meeting healthy, you know,

108
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,240
you're citing no cost except the implementation costs and maintenance costs of the bike lanes and then and then of the riders.

109
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,750
You're citing the medical costs associated with the injury and the decrease in

110
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,630
alphabetical order of life over the remaining life expectancy of the cyclists.

111
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,190
And then yeah, so getting into some of the costs. So yeah, so these costs are from a societal perspective.

112
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,340
So they were kind of already aggregated to include medical costs, work loss and quality of life losses per case.

113
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,030
So yeah, so these are just some, some of the costs we found from doing research and therefore from the eyes the Consumer Product Safety Commission,

114
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:37,440
its injury costs model for accidents. And then, you know, the the bike lane costs are just those are from the Department of Public Works.

115
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,270
Those pretend pretended Detroit specifically, you know, just standard implementation and, you know,

116
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,850
protection costs of the bike lanes that we would have to interpret into the model as well.

117
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,650
Thank you, Mark. So based on our decision tree, soon to be a marcos model, I think.

118
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,549
Here are some of the important probabilities that we have identified.

119
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,310
So starting first with my credit rating, Detroit, that's probably going to be related towards our population of interest,

120
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:17,960
our MN and that comes from the 2022 national likely the other subsequent ones are told from the Office of Highway Safety Planning 2018 Report.

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,299
And understandably, they go over some of the nuances related to injury rates and that corresponds towards

122
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,770
hospitalization rates as long as up and along with the fatality rates as well.

123
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,380
And then with respect to hospitalization, collision or perceived as a collision,

124
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:43,400
those data are pulled from the 2015 2021 aggregated publicly available crowdsourced data from Phenix, Arizona.

125
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:52,280
Yeah. So those kind of go over the properties that we have identified and their sources and then moving along to some of our assumptions.

126
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,270
So with respect to population, again with vacancy rate,

127
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,030
we were thinking that we would generate that number based on the percentage of the traders who used

128
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,480
to from their daily living is multiplied by the city population or just use the average number

129
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:15,860
of citizens that like the second one being future loss productivity injury are also included within

130
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,140
the level of care costs that we've calculated the spa and then with respect to minor injuries,

131
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:29,540
we want to account for or assume that minor injuries that do not result in hospitalization do not result in a decent trees and QOL.

132
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,720
And then again going back to that aggregated data source, I talked about four collisions.

133
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:45,200
We were assuming that the crowdsourced data pulled from Phenix, Arizona for hospitalization and emergency visits are assuming going to be applicable

134
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,670
because both of the data sets come and can apply to large metropolitan areas.

135
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,880
And then lastly, we're also assuming that national medical costs are also going to be the same as medical costs.

136
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,400
That's what we've seen in a couple of the other studies, much like you at all.

137
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,770
One, they pulled a bunch of sources from all over the country and also applied it to New York.

138
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:10,250
So we're also going to be applying that assumption as well. And then here are some of the questions that we have for you and for us as well.

139
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,610
Again, clarifying whether or not we should use that a decision tree or a markov model forward.

140
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,070
Should we look at hospitalization rates versus E.R. visits? Is a data dependent?

141
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:30,890
And again, going back to the Arizona data, is it okay to have aggregated data versus, say, like most recent or like over a long period of time?

142
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,520
And then for our beginning, our analysis of whether or not we should start back in 2011 versus 2022.

143
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,820
Great. Thanks. Anyone in the class have thoughts? Questions?

144
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,520
Okay. So run through the try. Oh, sorry.

145
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,739
I do have a question. I was just thinking about if you already said those or not, I might have missed it.

146
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:03,800
But did you. Did you happen to look at the amount of people who, like, comply with bike lanes when they're available?

147
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,480
I don't think we looking at the data just strictly from what I can tell from Detroit specific data.

148
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,690
It was if an accident occurred when you were in a protected lane or if you were

149
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,380
in any other lane you didn't like about like they were really in the lane,

150
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,130
right? You know, like off to the side, like on the sidewalk.

151
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,610
But I do think that that's like a really interesting. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,410
Because there's also evidence that like, you know, the average Detroit rider is either 45 or 12 years old.

153
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
So like there might be like some other, you know, 12 year olds.

154
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:41,749
Are they listening to the road race of sort of go to your first question decision here versus Markov model?

155
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,960
I think Markov models are useful for thinking about things over time.

156
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,709
Markov model could be useful if you wanted to look at, okay,

157
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,910
this person had an accident and then the next year they got another accident and the next year they got another accident.

158
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,600
And that kind of cumulative effect of several accidents and things like that. With that said, I don't think you have to worry about that too much.

159
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,690
I don't think there are going to be that many people in the population who can have multiple exits from each other and worry about complex conditions.

160
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,550
Like I broke my left leg this time in the right time. And then that compounds itself.

161
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:19,700
I think you actually probably could get by with just a decision tree. Use that to figure out how many accidents there will be in a single year,

162
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,260
how many costs and qualities there would be in a single year with just bike lanes without.

163
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:32,470
And then take that and multiply it over 20 years or whatever you think a lifetime horizon is of a bike lane or something like that, right?

164
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,820
Lane That might be easier than having to cycle through a bunch of different cycles.

165
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:45,470
Any questions about the. Well, actually, to answer the questions here.

166
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,660
I mean, I think you'll have, you know, both hospitalization and E.R. visits here.

167
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,950
Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about that.

168
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:04,360
The most recent data, typically, it's better to have recent data, but every data can be fine, too.

169
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,600
And then the last one that I think this is relevant for the entire class here,

170
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,680
the way I would think about these cost analysis is you're trying to help give guidance for future decision making.

171
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,020
So I would think about a 2020 start date. And yes, use some data from past to inform that.

172
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,750
But think about, okay, in 2022, if we did these pipelines today, what would be the impact in the future?

173
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,450
So that's kind of how I would go back to your analysis here.

174
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,739
So you're talking about protected by lines versus unprotected pipelines,

175
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,840
are you and I think you said there were like 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 200 miles of unprotected pipelines.

176
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,640
So are you considering kind of the status quo versus converting all the unprotected ones into protected bike lanes?

177
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,070
How are you thinking about that, what the intervention is? I think our original thought was converting all the affected to protect it.

178
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,150
But yeah, it's about the status quo just being the current status.

179
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,830
Yeah. Yeah. And then so what is.

180
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,350
What is the risk reduction?

181
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,250
Or how do you how do you think that would changing those 200 something miles of unprotected flights into protected bike lanes?

182
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,450
How do you think you quantify that reduction in accidents?

183
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,600
I mean, I think there's a New York study that said it was a 40% reduction.

184
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,380
Is that what you're going to use or is there or is there something from the existing rates that you would?

185
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,559
Yeah. So it's been a lot of studies. You know, there's always slightly different rates, but there are just kind of a lot of average,

186
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,840
you know, a protected bike lane reduces crashes by, you know, 40 something, 30 something percent.

187
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,969
So that's kind of who we try and like make our own from, like Detroit.

188
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,740
Like given that there was like in that time span, there was ten protected bike lane incidents out of that many.

189
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:54,379
And so that's what I was thinking is, is is there some evidence from that that you can really now to me, well, you have to make a lot of assumptions.

190
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,050
But if if people are equally likely to use protected and protected bike lanes, given their prevalence to the population,

191
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,320
looks like, you know, one out of five miles with bike lanes is protected versus unprotected.

192
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,770
But it was like one out of 100 accidents were in the protected bike lanes was not protected.

193
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,450
You know, that suggests a dramatic reduction, but of course, that is in a very controlled study.

194
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,190
And it's just, you know, you're making a lot of assumptions. So maybe the 40% reduction for New York is a better.

195
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,550
I don't know if they if they if they if you think they did a good analysis to to make that projection of what that risk reduction is,

196
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,279
that's something that's something to consider because that's I think that's a key driver of your the value of these

197
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:40,560
bike lanes is precisely how much do you reduce accidents with these protected bike lanes versus unprotected ones.

198
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,720
Presumably recurrent diminishing returns can reduce a lot of this.

199
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,150
Well, I know that it's unclear if if Detroit was strategic when they made those 50 bike,

200
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,629
50 miles of bike lane, protected bike lanes in the most dangerous streets.

201
00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:00,530
And then maybe if you have diminishing marginal value in that last unprotected widening could bring it to protected.

202
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,780
So those are sort of just some things to consider.

203
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,370
Maybe you can't precisely quantify that, but you could at least explore that in sensitivity analysis.

204
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,140
You could say, well, New York said 40% or whatever. In Detroit it's only 30 or 20% reduction.

205
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,730
Is it still customer? And it's going to be other questions from the closer.

206
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,390
Well, I have some additional thoughts. Thank you.

207
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:33,740
Thanks. Move on to our next group here, the favorite teams.

208
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,140
I think for those who don't know what they actually did on Monday, who came here today.

209
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,809
But I think I gave all the right notes and verbally but I think we got a lot of groups to go through today.

210
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:55,230
So I might not get every last response to you today about some of these.

211
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:04,360
If I don't get on this, we should take action.

212
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,380
Newt Gingrich.

213
00:21:44,430 --> 00:22:02,700
Just. I get the 50%, call everyone Clinton's era, and I'm here today with my group checking it out.

214
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,890
Elizabeth is also a part of our list. She's not here today.

215
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,710
So we're in the favorite business group and art.

216
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:22,499
And our group wanted to investigate the cost effectiveness of the interventions a little bit background about an

217
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:31,020
inherited disease caused by the mutations in the gene which is responsible for producing the alpha gal enzyme.

218
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:39,510
As you can see in the figure here, this is the healthy aging which produces the hormone level of alpha enzyme in cells.

219
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:48,570
At the system you tend to charge patients, which would lead to a low level of alpha enzymes in cells,

220
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,400
and this would cause a buildup of a type of fat called globo.

221
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:01,650
She also thermite, also known as GP three. And this would lead to organ diseases and life threatening conditions.

222
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:12,330
So fever disease is estimated to affect about one in 20,000 males and one in 20,000 females across all ethnic and demographic groups.

223
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,960
This buildup begins in childhood and causes signs or symptoms that affect the individuals body.

224
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:27,420
And there are some identifiable features of disease, including episodes of pain, clusters of small, dark or rough spots on the skin,

225
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,890
decreased ability to spot cloudiness or streaks in the front part of the eye and ringing in the ears or hearing loss.

226
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:43,020
As the disease progresses, patients could develop life threatening complications, including filler, heart failure and stroke.

227
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,990
And that's what we want to focus on. So given that there's no cure for our favorite disease,

228
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,989
we want to investigate that through current interventions that focus on slowing down

229
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,120
the disease progression which art enzyme replacement therapy and oral therapy.

230
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,880
So our research question is that we want to investigate which treatment for a favorite disease

231
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,580
would be the most cost effective while alleviating an organ damage and subsequent death.

232
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:21,160
Our analysis is important because the disease can progressively damage blood vessels and lead to life threatening problems, including death.

233
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,920
Given that it's a rare genetic disease, the amount of research conducted is severely lacking.

234
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,100
So a better understanding about the available interventions and focusing on early diagnosis is very crucial

235
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:41,560
to just give a little bit more detail about the two current interventions for enzyme replacement therapy.

236
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:48,100
It's a lifetime treatment with bi weekly infusion of recombinant enzyme alpha gal

237
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,440
eight into Lysosomes to basically restore the deficient level in the patient.

238
00:24:53,770 --> 00:25:00,600
And so the patient can continue the breakdown of the B three that is involved for oral therapy.

239
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:07,360
It uses small molecules that selectively binds to and act upon unstable enzymes to

240
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,990
help identify both correctly and ensuring that normal enzyme activity is restored.

241
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,940
Compared to the enzyme replacement therapy, it's administered orally every other day and has no severe side effects.

242
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,980
And now I'm going to talk about the method and we want to use Markov model to do the analyzes.

243
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:38,480
And these are the four stages of our markup model at symptomatic renal disease, cardiac complications and death.

244
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:46,910
And our target population is Fabry disease patients and our study perspective as a societal perspective.

245
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,040
And for the time horizon, we select one to apply fears because this is the average of American life years and we will

246
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,840
examine which intervention brings the patient's life expectancy closer to eight years.

247
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,110
And if we disease happens, it happens in the childhood.

248
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,670
So this is why we select these five years, and these are the four assumptions we made for our analyzes.

249
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:16,070
The first one is that we select, we go step as the oral chaperon therapy.

250
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:25,040
And the second one is there is no distinction was made between the goals of this alpha and beta of enzyme replacement therapy.

251
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,280
And these are the two ends up replacement therapy.

252
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:36,169
So why we assume that they're interesting is because the outcome in population is even the third one is only a renal

253
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:42,590
and cardiac complications will lead to death because these two are the major complication that will cost them.

254
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,790
And the last one is no drop out and resume in the process of the treatment.

255
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,340
And for the measure of health outcomes,

256
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:57,530
we choose the renal disease and cardiac complications and we will measure that how these two intervention alleviates the complications.

257
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,730
The third one is quality of life, and the last one is cost.

258
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,930
MTV. Let's come to the cost part.

259
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:17,009
Our plan is to sink into two dimensions to help us to measure the burden at the societal

260
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,680
and the patient level and what part of that can be reimbursed by the insurance.

261
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,470
So there's Medicaid, Medicare, or of all commercial interests.

262
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,050
This part is a direct cost route to the medical care and also considers the

263
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:40,320
loss of functions or what's already determined to cost by the thyroid disease,

264
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,640
which reduces productivity. So it will cost losses.

265
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,860
That's a path to not be reimbursed by the trust will be paid by the patients.

266
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:03,390
And the other part will be closer to us to patient cost or indirect expense that are not to be all of our tissues.

267
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,730
We're choosing between a different out of it.

268
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,570
Next up, we'll pick down details of all the factors they will consider in terms of direct and indirect cost.

269
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:24,649
You use two and you call me further per patient as a unit of measurement to bring the latest socio

270
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,530
and the patient's differences in synch with the enzyme replacement therapy and oral shapiro therapy,

271
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:42,170
prescription drugs and medical treatment, as well as professional services at CARE, which includes inpatient and outpatient care, visits, etc.

272
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:50,180
Apart of the indirect cost, the different indirect costs come from the loss of productivity and cost by the different treatment outcomes.

273
00:28:50,900 --> 00:29:01,220
Also, patients have low medical cost, which with their disease, such as the transmission cost, do vary according to the privacy of doctor visits.

274
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,930
It's our part. Anybody have questions? The participants.

275
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:24,380
Questions. So I guess the presumably there are clinical trials that were done to get FDA approval for these medications.

276
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:32,120
What did the clinical trials have to say about the relative effectiveness of these two therapies or relative harms or side effects of these therapies?

277
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:41,750
For research. The enzyme replacement therapy has more severe side effects compared to the large therapy.

278
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:52,480
That's the main thing that people. And do they have equivalent efficacy or how is the how is the efficacy?

279
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,140
And I mean, in the clinical trials, maybe I should rephrase this.

280
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,150
In the clinical trials, what kind of outcomes did they look at when they were studying these medications?

281
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,150
I think because the disease develops in childhood very early on,

282
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:11,320
I think a lot of the the goals is to kind of achieve in the initial symptomatic stage,

283
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,050
because once it gets to the renal diseases or the cardiac complications, it's going to lead to that.

284
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,100
So both treatments kind of focus on slowing down the disease progression.

285
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,060
I'll try to jump back to the initial symptomatic stage.

286
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,260
And so when you say slow disease progression,

287
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:36,640
how do they measure disease progression in this in this visit with a favorite disease or like how many light years that they stay in the initial,

288
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:44,110
initial symptomatic stage? So I guess what's the definition of initial symptomatic versus something more severe?

289
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,960
I think that doesn't involve organ damage like we know cardiac.

290
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:58,330
So they might give 100 kids the medication and they study them and they count how many children get organ damage, either heart or kidney damage.

291
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,610
Okay. And so, so and then that directly relates though to your mark on model.

292
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:10,720
So, so the clinical trials then are reporting rates of development of kidney and heart disease, heart problems.

293
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:21,850
And so you can from the clinical trials you can directly get those rates of of damage to the kidney and her that's and that's

294
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:34,090
good to know and so one of the thing is you were I think you mentioned you're looking at side effects and productivity.

295
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,370
What are some of that? How do you want let's see.

296
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:48,630
What are the things that would cause a loss in productivity? Dozier could develop some severe symptoms because they will have cardio.

297
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:59,230
I know they will be not be qualified for the job or devoted to see to visit the doctors.

298
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,340
So do of course, there are laws like they can't be work on time.

299
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,780
So that's kind of like what happens if they are lost.

300
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,730
Okay. Yeah. So it's directly tied to those mark of health status of kidney disease and heart disease.

301
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,060
So it's one thing to think about is if someone moves from the symptomatic to, you know, kidney disease or heart disease,

302
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,130
something to think about is, is what kind of level of productivity reduction is there?

303
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,160
You know, do they think they can work completely easily? They have 100% productivity loss or they maybe they only work part time.

304
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,390
There's 50% productivity loss. So that's something to think about.

305
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,800
And I can send you some an article that has some estimates of of productivity.

306
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:49,480
Maybe I already have class, but that has both market productivity and non-market productivity for people of different ages.

307
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,840
Because I think that might be important for your your analysis here,

308
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,549
that when a child is five year old, five years old, their productivity loss might not be that much.

309
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:02,410
But when they are 30 years old or 40 years old or their productivity might be higher.

310
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,899
So that might be something. And the total productivity, not just what they the work they do at home,

311
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,270
but also their their non-market productivity, their ability to cook for themselves and clean and things like that.

312
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:21,040
So I think we have difficulties to fill in our markup model because there's no like specific data

313
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:27,580
like how many percent of every favorite disease will cost to renal disease or cardiac complications.

314
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,800
So maybe we have to do some assumptions. Yeah.

315
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,750
So I, I would rely on the clinical trials to the extent possible about the rates of people developing those conditions.

316
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,829
But that is it's important that you're dealing with a rare disease.

317
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,760
There isn't a whole lot of huge literature on this, I'm sure.

318
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:53,049
And so you will probably have to make some assumptions, like you said, about, you know, the cost,

319
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,959
the annual cost of having cardiac disease or renal disease or or precisely what do you mean by cardiac and renal disease?

320
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,110
I mean, there are many different levels of severity for that.

321
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,200
So you may have to make some assumptions about the severity level, for example, for cardiac and renal disease.

322
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,890
Again, dealing with a rare disease, you're you're limited by the data you have available to you.

323
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:22,690
But that's okay for this class. In these analyzes, you know, you can make reasonable assumptions, just try to justify them to the extent you can.

324
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,559
And then as we'll talk about next week, I think sensitivity analysis will be important.

325
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,650
Part of your analysis is is exploring what if some of your assumptions are wrong or that,

326
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,820
you know, you don't really know precisely what the what the real rates are.

327
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,900
For example, you could use a wide range and say, we think it's this rate,

328
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:49,330
but what if it's this rate that's lower or this rate that's higher than the other questions for an average?

329
00:34:52,430 --> 00:36:15,120
Thank you very much. Sure.

330
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:34,650
Hi, everybody. So today we're just going to talk to you a little bit or I guess first off, begin with talking to you guys about what our topic is.

331
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,979
The question we're going to be addressing is the cost effective cost effectiveness of expanding Medicare,

332
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,809
substance use disorder, coverage for residential and outpatient services.

333
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,410
And the reason we're studying this is because of coverage.

334
00:36:49,410 --> 00:37:00,000
For us to do services is currently limited. Under Medicare, they typically only cover the least and then the most intensive services.

335
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,700
So another way to think about this is imagine if Medicare only covered like either stage four are being stage one or stage four of cancer,

336
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:17,820
but didn't do anything for stage two or three. And then this kind of these beneficiaries who need intermediate level levels of care without services.

337
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,589
And we can see that kind of with the statistics, with the statistic here.

338
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,930
There are 1.7 million Medicare beneficiaries that have some type of substance use disorder.

339
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,840
Only 11% receive treatment.

340
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:39,479
And so in assessing this cost effectiveness, we're going to be considering cost savings from study related hospitalizations.

341
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,040
And this is actually a measure that we'll be looking at is for people who maybe

342
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,610
don't receive treatment and then some kind of accident related toxicity occurs.

343
00:37:53,550 --> 00:38:02,640
Okay. So the methods that we were going to use are finding articles that quantify utility costs.

344
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,800
So basically like a literature review, we haven't decided whether we should do a decision tree or markup model yet.

345
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:16,110
That's also a question that we have. We're leaning towards decision tree overall from a societal perspective.

346
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,280
We plan to use the cost savings from reducing substance use disorder,

347
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,470
related hospitalizations and emergency department visits in a study that we found.

348
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,320
And these also include utilization estimates of emergency department use.

349
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,829
And the data that we will also use includes an estimation of the price per day of

350
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,850
residential treatment and the estimated price per day for outpatient coverage.

351
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:50,760
And this information will be useful for when you compare the prices of acute services to the emergency department services.

352
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:59,070
Overall, the main outcomes that we will examine are the utilization of substance use disorder, related hospitalizations,

353
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:08,550
qualities relating qualities related to expanding treatment and mortality, which relates to overdose and suicide rates due to substance use disorder.

354
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,180
And then the populations that we're focusing on is like,

355
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:18,169
so you're mentioning the Medicare beneficiaries and we want to evaluate the health

356
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,620
outcomes of the net cost increase of expanding services services coverage.

357
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:35,080
That's a one year, five year and ten year. So so far we this is our draft of our decision tree.

358
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,620
And as you can see, starting with Medicare, we look at the status quo and then the option of adding a study coverage.

359
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:47,620
And we found one study that has already kind of calculated the cost of these things.

360
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:56,320
So in that particular study, they looked at residential programing, intensive outpatient services and incorporating licensed and certified counselors.

361
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,910
So those were kind of the three main services that we looked at expanding coverage for.

362
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,210
And then from there, we would look at quality of life and the net cost for each of those categories.

363
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,780
And we would evaluate these outcomes after one year, five years and ten years.

364
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:28,509
But since we are looking at impact over time, we did also consider doing a combination with a markov model, but we have some questions about that.

365
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:35,889
So we already talked about the decision tree and we're not sure about like with mortality rate,

366
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,180
how to adjust the mortality rate into quality adjusted life years.

367
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:51,220
And we are I mean, our first step would be maybe to find studies that have already done that and then we would be looking at the net costs.

368
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,090
Another thing to consider is in one of the studies we found,

369
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:01,690
they indicate that if 100 receive 100 people receive treatment, 50% are likely to relapse.

370
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:10,059
So we were thinking about how to incorporate that into the Markoff model because we obviously can't track the same people over time.

371
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:18,670
But with a Markoff model, we may be able to take a deeper dove into analyzing the that 50% of people who do

372
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,040
relapse and what services they would utilize after incorporating this coverage.

373
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,240
I will go through some data we find and have a discussion on that.

374
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,520
First is also overall data.

375
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:45,630
As we talked, we mentioned there are 1.7 million people get diagnosed event Medicare beneficiaries, diagnostic business, beauty.

376
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:58,899
And we are going to see the cost effectiveness of these two groups aged over 65 and up, always arms and disability, age and not 65.

377
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:12,280
But we need to wait how much people in each group because to all comes up we need to fund studies to see what's the outcomes different for age groups.

378
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,510
All if there is not a defense for receiving treatment for these two groups.

379
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:31,330
So this these are we need to do more research on it another below the ribose we need to consider about is the the expansion

380
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:38,560
the coverage expansion because in the previous and the previous study we found for the cost or the cost analysis we based,

381
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:47,770
they assumed this amount of episodes of visits for receiving for the coverage.

382
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:58,060
So the coverage of a study suggests but this are only episodes and visits instead of per person because as Katie mentioned,

383
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,540
140 people received a treatment, about 30% overlap.

384
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:09,970
So we need to specific this number into therapy purposes.

385
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:18,870
And to calculate in the comment I just called you just what use and then is put these up.

386
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,659
We found the cost of expanding this coverage for residential per cent of our

387
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:31,210
patient program licensing for canceled per year and five year and ten years.

388
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:38,049
And also they have the cost savings from expanding this program, expanding this service,

389
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:50,020
which means if we cover more people for student treatment, they will have less cost for any visits or other medical treatment.

390
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:59,830
So this all cost savings, we're expanding this program and our analysis based on the net cost of adding this average for per year,

391
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,299
for ten years and these are 2020 US data.

392
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:11,680
So we need to use the Jamie to suggest that this 2020 U.S. dollars in current currency.

393
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:20,190
Based on this concept, we are looking for song surveys to quantify the past outcomes.

394
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:31,620
We are initially want to look at the mortality service to give the quality of life saved for reducing the mortality rate.

395
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:44,490
But we fund other studies that used use this measurement to measure the quality of life improved for receiving the inpatient as a unique treatment.

396
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:57,930
But they found that our 0.06 quality of life improvements by receiving that inpatient treatment for six months.

397
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,250
But our study is based on the based on the cost analysis.

398
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,460
We are trying to look at the long term outcomes for a year, five year and ten years.

399
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,960
But this measurement is only for six months.

400
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:22,140
So one of our question is how can we try to use this data to fit into our costs and to make us make several assumptions?

401
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:30,190
And this is the quality of life. You know, we are looking at and we are in the next step.

402
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:37,680
We are looking at quality of life improvement by providing intensive,

403
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:48,690
intensive outpatient services and licensed certificate counseling services to to to to put into our parametres.

404
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,780
And this is basically the purpose of our project.

405
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:06,030
And we have some questions, but we first of all like to appreciate any suggestions, questions to improve our study.

406
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,940
It will open it up to the clients and has. Questions or comments.

407
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,300
A question for you. Slash them.

408
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:24,700
Would you give them the same advice you gave us for they should sit on the decision tree rather than a markov model or like for theirs.

409
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,470
Like there's a chance of people like overdoses twice.

410
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,900
Well, yeah. So. So for this group, yeah. It's a it's a good question about Markov model versus decision tree.

411
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:42,000
I think if you're for this, I think your.

412
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:49,680
Well, let me stop. So you you've already found a study that you think has done a pretty good job of figuring out costs associated with this.

413
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,900
And that's all the stuff in the lower right hand corner here. So your key contribution is adding quality.

414
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:03,240
Well, just to step back, it looks like they found that there that this program doesn't pay for itself.

415
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:10,260
It offset some of its costs, but not all of them. If you look in the last three rows there, there is there is a net cost.

416
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,860
If you do this for a year, it's going to cost you $362. It's not going to save you money.

417
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:20,550
Well, it's going to cost you, you know, several thousand dollars or whatever.

418
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,120
You'll save 5000 dollars. Net cost is $362.

419
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,630
Right. And over ten years, it's going to cost you $3,000.

420
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,790
Question is, is that a worthwhile investment? And so you're going to look into how many qualities are gained from this.

421
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:39,810
So and if you go to the next slide, I think you're you're trying to figure what are the the quality gains now?

422
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,669
And it sounds like there's a study here that's looking at kind of before and after and,

423
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:51,239
you know, before and then after they had an improvement in quality of life. But you are asking a good question here.

424
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,800
Is, is that a kind of durable, long term change in quality of life?

425
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:03,870
Actually, another question, too, is before after a fair comparison, there might be some regression to the mean.

426
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,680
We'll talk about that a little bit later. Maybe we already hear of that in other places.

427
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,470
You know, it's possible when someone is starting substance use treatment, they're in a pretty bad place.

428
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,770
And maybe even if you didn't give them substitution agreement and treatment, their quality of life would have improved naturally anyway.

429
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:28,770
And so, you know, really what was the effect of substitution treatment versus just them naturally kind of getting better but anyway.

430
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:34,920
So but you'll you'll have, you know, you have maybe some sort of assessed assessment of what is that the impact of treatment.

431
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,260
One thing you mentioned in your earlier slide, though, is there could be relapse. So maybe this isn't a long term benefit.

432
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:46,260
You know, there is quite a bit of relapse in the world of substance abuse, even following successful treatment.

433
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,480
And so this is where actually a markup model could be useful because you could say, okay, look,

434
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:58,379
maybe we do see an improvement of, you know, 0.1 or point two qualities six months later or something.

435
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:04,380
And so maybe you have a markov model with six month cycles or year long cycles, something that says, okay, you get that benefit.

436
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,170
But I think earlier another slide, you said 50% of people relapse.

437
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,490
So maybe maybe that I don't know if it's every year or every over a ten year period or something,

438
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,870
but let's say that's every year 50% of people relapse.

439
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:20,640
And so you might have Markov model with people who are who are, you know, not relapsed or relapse.

440
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,950
And every year, if you if you're not relapsed, you get this quality of life benefit.

441
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:35,160
But maybe if you relapse, you don't have that benefit anymore. And every year, 50% of people move from not relapsed back into relapsed.

442
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:40,350
And so you could use that to to make a projection of what the long term quality of life benefit is.

443
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:51,040
So that's a case where a markup model might be useful to look at this kind of long term evolution, or in this case, evolution or whatever it is.

444
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:59,100
Going from not relapsed back into relapse. And and so over time, people would slowly leak back into that not relapsed group.

445
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,989
And then and then no longer have the quality of life benefits of this potentially.

446
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,460
I don't know. I don't know precisely how that works.

447
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:11,820
Now, you could also have something else where if someone relapses, there's a chance they go back into treatment and then get this benefit again.

448
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:18,060
So you could have kind of a cyclical process here that you're looking at that evolution of people having,

449
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,159
you know, quit substance abuse and then go back into it and then then out again.

450
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,110
And so if you have that kind of cyclical repeating process, then a market model might be useful for that.

451
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:36,750
So do you think a Markoff's model is best overall or doing the combination with the decision tree, too?

452
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,110
Well, really, any time I guess I'm saying a decision tree in this class is oftentimes any time,

453
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,370
any single market model in the past, typically it is a decision tree with a market model.

454
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,310
So typically you do have a decision tree at the beginning, which is do we do we keep the status quo or do we do this new substance abuse proven?

455
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,730
And then the market model is used to calculate the long term qualities,

456
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,650
given that you made that kind of initial choice of the status quo or this new, new treatment practice.

457
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:12,540
Okay. And then some of the other complexities we were thinking about and we kind of talk to you about this,

458
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:20,490
but with the fact that this particular study that we keep referring to does show a nominal cost increase for Medicare,

459
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:24,899
we also thought about do we want to look at the cost?

460
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,280
Maybe it would save money in Medicaid because there are so many dual enrollees.

461
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,629
So if we do, do you think we need to incorporate that?

462
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,010
We also like with, you know, looking at insurance, there's just a lot of complexities.

463
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:45,749
And then also we're looking at an illness that has a lot of nuances. And same thing with scope of emergency services.

464
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,770
Like we kind of just had a dial in an emergency department instead of looking at,

465
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:55,409
you know, paramedics and first responders and how that impacts cost and Medicare.

466
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,950
But yeah, what do you think about those things?

467
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,320
I want to go back to the cost study. I mean, I guess I don't want to encourage you to expand the scope of what you're doing too much,

468
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,600
that it makes it difficult to complete within a semester.

469
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:19,620
But you could potentially try to look at the methodology that they use to do this calculations and then adjust it so and recreate what they did,

470
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:26,970
but with some adjustments for Medicaid. How is Medicaid different from what they did, if that's such a difficult if if it is,

471
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,640
you could maybe just do some kind of bunch of factors, if you will, like say, okay, I think Medicare,

472
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:40,499
Medicaid costs are 30% higher and just change a few of these numbers to be higher or lower based on just vary their overall results,

473
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,840
maybe up or down a little bit depending on how how you think Medicare and Medicaid is different from Medicare.

474
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:53,400
Enrollees are different from the standard Medicare enrollee. Okay.

475
00:52:53,620 --> 00:53:06,370
And then a question. And for like our volume measurement, we wanted to look at mortality and we were wondering if we should hone in on one type of,

476
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:10,800
as you do, related death, for example, over and over versus all,

477
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:18,700
as if you really think that's like an accident that you could you could look in the in Saudi literature and try to understand, you know,

478
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:29,290
how is and the key thing here is how is mortality different for someone who is currently using these substances or or is in recovery?

479
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:36,340
And then maybe if you have a more color model of, you know, currently using versus recovery and the rate of mortality is,

480
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,739
you know, 1% per year with people using these substances and half a percent per year.

481
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:46,270
If they're not, then you could also calculate quite lost due to mortality as well.

482
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:55,420
And I think you had a question earlier about how mortality rates, mortality rates might relate to qualities.

483
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,959
I would encourage you to to look at that for more in rank and shine.

484
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:06,820
Example we did in class two, there was a case where, you know, the rank and shine procedure in some ways would be similar to someone in recovery.

485
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,610
There is no additional mortality, but the more procedure had a 25% increased risk of mortality.

486
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:22,330
And and you can use that markup model to calculate how many qualities each group gets with with either a lower or slightly higher mortality rate.

487
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,460
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

488
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:49,340
Next, we have the true. What do you think?

489
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:12,310
She's pretty. Yes.

490
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:40,780
If you guys want this gentleman, let us. You.

491
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,140
To get going again.

492
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:17,370
She's. A great.

493
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:39,630
Actually reasons you see.

494
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:44,260
Got me thinking.

495
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:57,210
You or something.

496
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:10,530
There's no news because of orange juice.

497
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,660
Yeah. Yeah. All right, so off. Hi. And good morning, all of you.

498
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:23,880
So me and my team, we are presenting this project on cost effectiveness analysis for moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

499
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,860
This is more of a traditional form of analysis where we're like sort of comparing

500
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,140
one drug intervention with the ones that have already been approved long ago.

501
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:45,090
So the question that we are proposing to initiate this discussion would be the you know, what would be the cost effectiveness of currency,

502
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:51,780
which is a fairly decent approval for moderate to severe Crohn's disease in comparison to STELARA,

503
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:58,410
which was approved maybe four or five years ago and chop it up, which was approved in 1008.

504
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:08,190
About Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is it's basically an inflammation of the GI tract, the lower section of the GI tract.

505
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,990
The cure, I mean, sorry, the cause of Crohn's disease is unknown so far.

506
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,680
Some people say it's genetic. Some say it's because of smoking.

507
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:24,840
Some say that it's an autoimmune disorder. So it causes essentially a swelling in the tissues in the GI tract,

508
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,450
which can the symptoms can progress from like abdominal pain to diarrhea to

509
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:35,550
weight loss and even abdominal bleeding because the cause is not exactly known.

510
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:43,470
There's no known cure for Crohn's disease now, but the therapies can greatly reduce the symptoms and bring about like remission of,

511
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,460
of, of the disease and symptoms and healing of the inflammation.

512
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:56,640
Some of the cures that we still some of the treatment methods that we still have are like minus salicylates, which are like inorganic molecules.

513
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,479
We have treatment with organic molecules such as the corticosteroid therapy,

514
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:10,290
but then we also have surgeries which may or again may or may not be 100% treatment because so in cases after one surgery,

515
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:15,660
they still require more forms of surgery. So that is still not a reliable method.

516
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:25,140
We are talking about biologic that it be because biologics have proven to be the first line of defense against Crohn's disease.

517
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:35,100
And then based on the stats, it's estimated to affect more than 300,000 patients in the U.S. with any form of treatment,

518
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,380
specifically from surgeries and biologic therapies.

519
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,290
Many people with Crohn's disease are able to have like a better quality of life than they would without the treatment.

520
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:52,170
So as I said, we're specifically focusing on the the biologic treatment and we are big skybitz

521
00:59:52,410 --> 01:00:00,690
and large humidor and humidor are more of are these products under a sky instead?

522
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,730
Are they work by the same mechanism of action? Humana has a slightly different mechanism of action.

523
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:16,700
And then the cost effectiveness of the tree is what we try to show you with a greater focus on sky do.

524
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:25,840
Because again, as I said, it's a reasonable level and analysis is going to be taking like a Bayer perspective because what a sky to see there's not

525
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:33,190
enough information available on sky to see you know Scott the sky disease action on Crohn's disease patients as of now instead

526
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:43,030
of still on the Schmidle and these are pricey medications so I mean with this analysis we hope to add on to the Bears

527
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:49,509
knowledge of how his guidance he can be a cost effective treatment for Crohn's disease and get the drug adequate formulary.

528
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:52,560
And now Mehta is going to be talking about the decision to use.

529
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,880
Yeah. So this is just like a rough outline of a decision tree. It's the very basis for what our model is.

530
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:04,969
So obviously we're studying Crohn's disease. And so the first option is if you're going to go through treatment like those medical treatments

531
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:09,620
or no treatment and then within those treatments is skyrocketing HUMIRA and STELARA.

532
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:15,830
And then for each medication that you would hypothetically take, there's either pain or no pain because these medicines can't grow.

533
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:19,370
Crohn's disease is incurable, but they can help minimize symptoms.

534
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,990
So the main factor we're looking at for these drugs is whether they help with the pain or not.

535
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:28,580
And like, if there is pain, is it high pain so there's just no change or is it like reduced pain?

536
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:35,420
There's a lot of what the patients see is that not that it actually goes away into remission, but their pain is lower, which is already a benefit.

537
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,480
And one of the things that we're looking for is reduced and eliminated pain.

538
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:46,639
So we're looking at that for all three drugs. And obviously, you know, it's very subjective, but they're very consistent ways to measure that.

539
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,500
And we're also going to talk about surgeries and stuff. And then obviously some people die due to complications.

540
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,710
So that's another implication in our decision tree and part of models.

541
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:03,440
Based on our outcome. We also drop another decision tree based on different days and macro models in that these

542
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:11,059
interim chief model patients with moderate to severe calls with Ida's Dorothy Ella Okumura,

543
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:18,930
a patient who looks past folks who respond to two biologic realities coming due to AIDS,

544
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,320
or enter into the model for assessing the maintenance therapy.

545
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:32,389
Conversely, a patient who did not respond to conventional treatment or other biologic treatments and

546
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:37,580
was deemed a decision cheat patient with a clinical response to conversion therapy.

547
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:43,120
Enter to a model for assessing to maintain maintainers treatment drugs.

548
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:48,319
Whereas those who did not respond to conventional adjustment offices in moderate to

549
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:55,879
severe disease help stage until they require surgery and for assessment of therapy,

550
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,620
several options were included in the model to compare to cost effectiveness.

551
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:08,180
We would use to cause disease active activity in test to classify patients different stages.

552
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:23,360
CDI, smaller than 150, would be defined as remission and 150 to 2220 will be mild and 220 to 450 would be moderate,

553
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:32,330
larger than 450 would be severe and patient transferred from one palisade to another with a certain probability that depends on the

554
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:40,940
patient's health status and treatment that could occur at any circle and patient can transferred to help state from any other state.

555
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:51,200
And we plan to calculate a cost from eight years because back to take Scalzi as an example for any insurer patients

556
01:03:51,200 --> 01:04:00,080
described for Windows is more than $18,000 for Medicaid and Medicare Part D and Medicare low income subsidized patients.

557
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:08,809
The price for praecox would be more acceptable, but still it depending on states for an annual coverage basis for first year,

558
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:17,600
patients need to take 11 doses while from the second year they take every eight weeks, which is estimated to be six doses per year.

559
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:23,210
You keep searching to cost for Stella and Kudrow, which prizes are also transparent.

560
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:28,790
Another perspective for of cost is the health related costs of each stage we will look at.

561
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,490
So all of these drugs, although they're both all targeting the same disease,

562
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:41,600
they both different factors the community defined so like STELARA but promotes lasting remission so

563
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:49,070
there's just no symptoms entirely but ones which I think the purple one is still Laura or Laura.

564
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,500
Yeah. And that one is just talking about how after the injections there's a series of injections get less pain.

565
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,800
So instead of just remission, just oh the immediate less pain.

566
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,510
And then HUMIRA is just talking about like clear skin is obviously an inflammatory disease.

567
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,830
There's a lot of information not only internally but externally.

568
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:10,130
And so that's like the number one component that they're boasting about is having clear skin.

569
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:16,879
And then some of the health outcomes we are considering are important to note are things like clinical remission,

570
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,610
reduce inflammation and then endoscopic results, which is like inside your that area of your body.

571
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:27,800
It's the inner lining is inflamed or not inflamed or even just reduced inflammation,

572
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,580
reduced volume and frequency, because that is another symptom of Crohn's disease.

573
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:37,100
And then rapid relief like those other drugs were boasting. So relief from symptoms that six weeks earlier.

574
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:44,960
And obviously the main component is quality is that's what we're looking at is all of those combined waking qualities versus like money.

575
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,820
And that's all we got. So if you have any questions, go ahead. Thanks.

576
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,560
And actually, since we're running a little bit more time,

577
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:01,080
why don't we do questions and we'll have the next group for genetic screening come on up and get it set up for blogging,

578
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,460
because I know that it can take a little time. So thank you.

579
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:11,820
So you have quite a bit of complexity, I think, in your decision tree and your markup bottles there.

580
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:25,709
Do you think you have a good sense of where you would find data to parameterized that the mobile industry for like fourth

581
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:33,160
dollar and we already have a lot of data before it's currency we only have the data on the clinical trial outcome.

582
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we're going to modelers after that because obviously parity is pretty new for this treatment of this disease.

583
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,190
But the other two have been around for some time. So there are some cost effective analysis.

584
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:47,270
So we're going to kind of not copy exactly, but like use it as a model.

585
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:55,649
Yes. Okay. Yeah. So that's something I would think about is is how can you take these arity clinical trial data and use that

586
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:04,799
to inform your the parameters of your model so that the rates of the being and the different pain levels.

587
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:11,190
And you know, and if you and presumably though you can use data for other trials about if you're in the worst pain,

588
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:15,570
what's the chance you need surgery and palpation rates and surgery and all those kind of things too as well.

589
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:22,800
Sounds like also you want to include information on side effects. So that's something to think about, is how do you incorporate those side effects?

590
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:27,420
Are they short term or long term and how much, you know, pain in your injection site?

591
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:33,420
That's annoying, but it's probably not really supportive like that much, and it might only be for a few days or something like that.

592
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,990
So the quality's lost might be kind of minimal compared to some of the other outcomes that we have.

593
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:42,710
So those are things to think about, how you quantify them as well. Thank you.

594
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:56,759
Thank you. And we are the genetic stranger and we are doing a cost effective analysis of

595
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,720
cell free DNA screening and second trimester screening for fetal antibodies.

596
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:09,839
Okay. So just a little bit off topic introduction. By definition, no aneuploidy is extra or missing chromosomes,

597
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:17,880
and your DNA aneuploidy is responsible for around 50% of loss in early stages of pregnancy and are present in 20 to 40% of consumptions.

598
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:26,580
So pretty broad range of diseases and the current genetic screening tests that we have are subject

599
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:31,190
to individual specificity and sensitivity levels to detect the presence of genetic abnormalities.

600
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,670
So essentially each test is kind of detecting different levels and.

601
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,930
Substances in the mother's blood to detect for these genetic abnormalities.

602
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:48,770
So our primary question for analysis, which of these to test the cell free DNA screening and the second trimester screening

603
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,770
is the most cost effective intervention for the efficient pair perspectives.

604
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:57,020
So current medical guidelines for genetic screening only emphasize aneuploidy screening for risk.

605
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:06,830
So that is patients with a family history or previous tendencies that had a presence of genetic abnormalities as well as the age factors of parents.

606
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:12,710
This is an increased risk with age. So increased maternal age is a higher risk group.

607
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,850
And the two most common screening tests use, there's a plethora of them,

608
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,450
but the most common ones are the cell free DNA and the second trimester quad screen.

609
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:26,030
So those are the basis of our analysis. And just a little bit of background as to what the two are, the cell free DNA.

610
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:32,659
Both are noninvasive blood screenings, but cell free DNA is looking at the fetal DNA that is kind of free floating in the

611
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:37,879
pregnant patient's blood where the quad screen is looking at the four substances,

612
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,270
which is alpha, beta, protein, human contact.

613
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,080
So I'm going to butcher all of these as they're all in heaven.

614
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:52,040
So it's looking at the four levels of those to indicate the presence of these genetic disorders.

615
01:09:53,570 --> 01:10:02,240
And for some reason, I'll say it's how we population we are facing as a general pregnant women cohort in the United States.

616
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,920
And we use a cohort of life four in the United States in 2020.

617
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:15,530
Want to do the estimate of our target population, which is like 3 billion, 3.6 million.

618
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:20,479
And this data was pulled from the National Center of Health Statistics, national vitals.

619
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:31,459
That is a system and analyze. And we are doing as the lifetime and stable perspective we chose what patient and payer and outcome

620
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:39,440
measures we have as are incremental costs with a pipeline to U.S. dollars and quality adjusted life years.

621
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:45,410
And you might be curious about why we choose those study perspectives.

622
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,300
So I'm going to go ahead and cover this.

623
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:56,150
So most of our previous studies that we looked at from 2015 and 2019 study and both of those looked primarily at society.

624
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:00,020
So what is the impact of society on whether or not we do those tests?

625
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:07,249
And that's a great point of view to have by the end of the day, the people that are going to be most impacted or the reflected by the outcomes.

626
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:12,020
So we're looking at costs. Who covers those costs? And then the quality adjusted life years as well.

627
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,440
So who's going to be suffering those? That's going to be the patient. That's going to be that family.

628
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,669
So we're going to really focus on that because we found a gap in the literature towards that idea.

629
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:23,550
So that's why we're focusing on the patient. And then why payer perspective.

630
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:30,649
So in the United States, which is the cohort that we're focusing on, the payer does have a lot of influence on what kind of treatment you get.

631
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:35,420
That does limit a lot of the doctor's options. And they are the people that are going to be covering the costs of these.

632
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:39,390
So a lot of us are aware of this and that is really important.

633
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:44,020
So that's why we're looking at those two ideas as well as that kind to shifts

634
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:47,900
into this beautiful decision tree which Kat and I are going to walk you through,

635
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,990
which is the good time, isn't it beautiful and do amazing job.

636
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:59,930
Yeah. So Kat but you know, so this is our simple model three based on the previous literature in this we're looking at for health

637
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:04,670
outcomes essentially which is in anybody live birth life for termination and spontaneous fetal loss,

638
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,620
which are the four most common outcomes of these trees.

639
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:11,570
So this is just to sort of walk you through what we're going for.

640
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,550
So we're looking at the decision of whether or not screening was accepted or declined.

641
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:22,390
And this is the initial patient decision. So this is why we're looking at the patient and then we're going to walk down and this is one over.

642
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,430
The peer has more of an impact on these other issues as well.

643
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:32,690
So, yes, so as I mentioned, as of now, the screening is only recommended for high risk groups.

644
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:38,659
And the decision between screening tests is really subjective to patient and doctor conversations.

645
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:45,470
There's not really a go to screening test. So you're trying to do the analysis to see which of these could perhaps be a broader spread suggestion.

646
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:52,190
So for cell free and blood screening, they really follow the same path. Essentially, we're looking at the positive indicators and negative indicators.

647
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,450
If there is a positive indicator from your screen, you do have to go forward to do diagnostic testing.

648
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:00,530
And from there, you can confirm whether or not the pregnancy is viable or non-viable,

649
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:05,090
needing to be in a library, library and termination and spontaneous fetal loss.

650
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:17,179
It's a pretty common and it's said there and probably we have we're obviously right now and we will as you see around this is entry.

651
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:28,100
So we have a lot of branches for it. So DNA indicated positive and for aneuploidy like birds, we need those probably for those indicators.

652
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:35,000
So we basically separate our probability summary into trisomy 21, trisomy 1813.

653
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,250
And that's yeah, monopsony.

654
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:49,160
And we discovered their prevalence termination rate and we also found the self to be a tax rate and the fostering tax rate for those four diseases.

655
01:13:49,370 --> 01:14:00,290
And with having those, we also had the probably thinking parents screening, which is the first branch of our system trained.

656
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:07,870
We also have the probability of taking cells with DNA screening and possibly testing, and those are at a second rate.

657
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,680
We have in our decision to do discover our outcomes that we need the cause and qualities.

658
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:19,720
We haven't searched for quality yet, but we have our cause.

659
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:30,770
They are pulled from two major studies published in 2015, and those cause are right now adjusted to 22 U.S. dollars.

660
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:38,450
Those are all basically up 20 13 USD in 2014 years already, and we'll do further adjustment later on.

661
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:42,530
And a lot of there's there's I know there's a lot of questions about like the

662
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:46,879
statistical looks looking at it and what about stochastic stochastic society.

663
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,500
I can spell it, but I can never pronounce it.

664
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:55,280
But a lot of these studies, they use the Monte Carlo simulation to actually take into account, and that's where we're drawing our data from.

665
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:01,879
So that's initial and then also our cohort size. If you saw that number, that's a huge number that's going to help us out a lot as well.

666
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,050
So something you can combine statistics, slides, and that's your brain or your brain in that.

667
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:16,460
Okay. And then they let us know if you have any questions or feedback from across.

668
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,220
I like your perspective. What? I like your perspective.

669
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:33,700
Thank you. Now for Decision Tree. I have a comment about that.

670
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,220
A couple slides here. Which slide?

671
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:45,340
Well, this one maybe first issue of termination is that the spontaneous termination rates or if they exist, the prevalence is 0.25%.

672
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:54,829
Does that mean that point to 5% of pregnancies have, let's say, trisomy 21 and then 80% of those have a spontaneous termination?

673
01:15:54,830 --> 01:16:03,380
Or is that termination after after someone gets it, the families choose termination after getting a positive diagnosis of 2121.

674
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:08,180
I think that is the termination after that. That's okay.

675
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:11,780
So we have you're going to add in the spontaneous fetal loss.

676
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:15,020
Okay. So so is there is the prevalence then? Is that.

677
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,580
You said that before or after spontaneous fetal loss, the prevalence.

678
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:29,440
It's a thing is for I don't post like spontaneous Beatles.

679
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,830
We are going to take probably like stillborn.

680
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:41,610
So those first methods population wise, I know that for trisomy 21, specifically, 80% of conceptions are non-viable.

681
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:47,220
With that diagnosis, I don't know if that accounts for another 20% and result in like spontaneous fetal loss.

682
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,930
I'm not sure how that accounts for 20% are viable.

683
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:57,000
I'm not sure that I have the termination rate. So that can be incorporated in the draft at the moment.

684
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:01,900
I mean, that's something to think about, I guess, is this prevalence. And then you're you're doing great.

685
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,900
When are you doing the testing? Is it like that at the second?

686
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:15,870
So that's another component that we need to adjust for, is that the cell free DNA screening can actually be performed at ten weeks of pregnancy.

687
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:21,330
And second trimester is, I think around 15 to 20 weeks is the recommended.

688
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:29,010
So so if it goes a little earlier, quite screen has to wait a little longer to get an accurate estimation of those presence about mortalities.

689
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,830
Yeah, I guess and I'm not sure, you know, when, when the spontaneous few losses are occurring.

690
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,300
I mean, if it's if it's at week six or something like that, that's before you're you're even doing the testing.

691
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,380
So you don't worry about that for this analysis.

692
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:48,480
But if it's occurring at week 36 or 40 or something like that, then then then it's relevant to your urinalysis here.

693
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:56,999
I believe there's both. As far as I'm aware, with my limited medical knowledge for my research, there was research,

694
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,620
there was both the early spontaneous loss, which I cannot tell you the exact timeline for that.

695
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:10,469
But then there was the intrauterine loss later. Know one of the thing I guess I'll say about this decision tree.

696
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:18,900
So this decision tree, the way you structured it, I think it's it makes sense in how the patient kind of views it.

697
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:24,150
Right. Patient says I'm going to get it on screen or whatever and then it's going to give me a positive or negative.

698
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:32,889
And then after I get positive or negative, I'm going to experience, you know, diagnostic testing of this positive and it's becoming non-viable.

699
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:36,600
And then then I'm going to experience the my birth or termination or whatever it is.

700
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:45,060
One thing to be careful of is that you want to have kind of a fair comparison between all of these different arms in your tree.

701
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:53,610
And so one thing you might consider is, is at the beginning, after you choose your genetic screening, your screen declines.

702
01:18:53,610 --> 01:19:04,830
Being accepted is to have kind of the truth here of what is do we have the an appointee or not?

703
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,570
Is this is this fetus truly have this or not?

704
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:18,930
And then if you go to your next slide, then you have your your cfdna detection rates, basically.

705
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,859
And so it's the first branch in your tree is do they really have it or not?

706
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:27,720
And that's going to be the same across all arms because you you don't change the prevalence of that whether you do this test or not.

707
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,719
But then it's a question of do you detect it or not? Right.

708
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:38,459
So if they if they do have it, you have your detection rate here is 50 or 60% or 80 or 90%, whatever it is you're doing, detect it or not.

709
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:49,380
And then if it's if it's detected, then you then you have the likelihood of the confirmatory testing actually to show it or not.

710
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:55,090
And then if you go back a slide, I guess so your your your here.

711
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,320
So your your.
