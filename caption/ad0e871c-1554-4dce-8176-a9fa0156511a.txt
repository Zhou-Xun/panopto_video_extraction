1
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:10,271
Understanding the ethical challenges that public health practitioners

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:16,155
face now is an important part of becoming an effective public health practitioner.

3
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:22,746
And really an effective spokesperson for improving the community's health.

4
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:27,338
It's important to understand that not every challenge public

5
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:31,159
health practitioners face would be an ethical one.

6
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:36,725
For example, some are political problems, some are legal problems.

7
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:42,394
In fact, in research that some of my graduate students conducted

8
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:48,379
we found very clearly a blurring between law, politics and ethics.

9
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:52,630
As a result, public health practitioners need to try to think

10
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,651
through what aspects of the problem they need to address.

11
00:00:56,651 --> 00:01:02,373
Some decisions require normative judgement and moral consideration.

12
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:04,520
That is, what should be done?

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,670
In a particular circumstance, as opposed to what one might do objectively.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,404
Is one alternative more right than other?

15
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:18,901
And it's interesting to think about this in the context of what we

16
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,924
discussed in the previous module about policy analysis.

17
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:27,649
Sometimes you got to think about the unethical

18
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,658
implications of a particular policy.

19
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,429
In contrast to biomedical ethics, or bioethics,

20
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,055
there has been very little empirical research about public health ethics.

21
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:46,732
In that sense it's a nascent field that doesn't have a lot of

22
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:52,092
agreed-upon frameworks or strategies or approaches.

23
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:56,019
And again, when you're making decisions,

24
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:02,219
you need to determine whether the problem you're facing is one of law,

25
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,267
one of policy and politics, or one of ethics.

26
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:11,794
Some of the public health ethical challenges practitioners face first are,

27
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:15,885
how do you set the criteria for spending public dollars?

28
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:21,915
Remember, everything that a public health practitioner does is based on

29
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:27,275
the public health code of the state and the resources allocated.

30
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:33,070
And as a result, each health department has to account for

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,860
how it spends public health dollars.

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,304
Second concern is the concept of paternalism.

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,324
One of the critiques of public health has long been that,

34
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:49,358
the government acts paternalistically.

35
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:55,091
Tells me when I can wear a helmet if I am riding a motorcycle or a bicycle.

36
00:02:55,091 --> 00:03:01,701
When and where I can smoke cigarettes and similar legal products.

37
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:06,399
Third, surprisingly enough, you have to be thinking about

38
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,738
the ethical challenges and collecting and using data.

39
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:14,653
In public health this is really about making sure

40
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,477
that all facets of the population are covered.

41
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:21,913
And you're not just collecting data and

42
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:26,571
focusing on one particular subset of the population.

43
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:31,082
Another challenge is that you have to make sure you're not

44
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:34,774
disclosing any individual's health status.

45
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:40,216
Even if you are attempting to protect the population's health.

46
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:44,434
Just as we saw when we talked about policy analysis, and

47
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:49,734
one of the major ethical challenges that public health practitioners

48
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:54,255
face is making trade-offs among vulnerable population.

49
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:59,677
Are you going to invest in more in opioids and preventing opioid addiction?

50
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:04,900
Are you going to invest more in the obesity epidemic?

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,192
Are these populations overlapping?

52
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,422
Are they different?

53
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:14,506
If you're allocating a lot of your budget to preventing the crisis,

54
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:19,678
dealing with opioids, you simply won't have enough money to focus on

55
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:24,954
the long term, non-communicable diseases of diabetes and obesity.

56
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:27,698
You're forced to make those trade-offs.

57
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,268
What the ethical challenge is,

58
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:35,607
to develop the criteria that allow you to make those trade-offs.

59
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:40,007
You're improving population health with limited resources.

60
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:44,791
Resource allocation is a fundamental ethical challenge

61
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:49,283
that public health practitioners face all the time.

62
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:53,215
Finally, we talked earlier about paternalism.

63
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:58,496
The idea here is that you have to balance the protection of

64
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:06,428
the public good without intervening unduly into an individual's civil liberties.

65
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,760
People have the right to take risks with their lives.

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,410
And really within intrusive governmental intervention,

67
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,432
the classic example as I alluded to before, is whether a state or

68
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:25,489
local health department should require motorcycle riders to wear helmets.

69
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,735
Another one involves distracted driving.

70
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:33,408
Is it legitimate from the state to prevent people from using

71
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:36,970
their smartphones, while driving in a car?

72
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,669
Protecting the public's good, but

73
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,556
you're intruding in a person's individual decision-making.

74
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:50,894
That's always a problem that public health practitioners need to be aware of.

75
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:56,449
One way to deal with this problem is to think about the criteria for

76
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,197
how you're going to spend public dollars.

77
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:04,125
Some of the trade-offs you can talk about, or

78
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:09,162
one that's driving a lot of the federal discussion now is,

79
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:13,797
do we invest in the elderly through Social Security and

80
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:17,344
Medicare, or we can invest in children?

81
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:20,988
If we don't have enough money to do both.

82
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:26,573
Do we put money into helping the uninsured gain insurance,

83
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:31,822
or are we better off focusing on economic development so

84
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,074
that everyone can buy insurance?

85
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,380
How do we assess the severity of risk?

86
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,020
And how do we use cost-effectiveness analysis to

87
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,893
help shape our ethical decision making?

88
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:51,882
It's really important, and I can't stress enough this issue

89
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:56,023
of the balance between protecting the public good,

90
00:06:56,023 --> 00:07:03,191
improving the population's health without unduly restricting individual liberties.

91
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:10,231
Remember, we're dealing in an era of a pretty intense distrust of government.

92
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:16,058
The public resents government officials who tell them how to live.

93
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:19,744
And what kind of choices they need to make.

94
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:27,144
Individuals, stakeholders have moral claim to choice, to personal freedoms.

95
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:31,609
Something so obvious to public health practitioners

96
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:36,470
as vaccinations is less obvious to individuals who have,

97
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,728
what public health practitioners are rightly convinced are,

98
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,616
inappropriate scientific understandings.

99
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:50,647
Let's say the role of vaccines in causing autism,

100
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:56,976
with the parents' obligation to protect the child's health.

101
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:02,436
We have a fundamental conflict between the health care system of treating

102
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:07,465
individual patients relative to keeping the population healthy.

103
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:10,404
How do we integrate those two?

104
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:15,661
And finally, there's an important overlay of religious freedom and

105
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,537
freedom of conscience.

106
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:22,649
Public health practitioners tend to focus

107
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,335
more on the broad population health and

108
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:33,867
tend to limit their focus on individual conscience and

109
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,720
potential religious freedom.

110
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,245
Those issues are not likely to be resolved at the local level.

111
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:47,885
But you need to be aware of them as a guiding ethical debate

112
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:52,939
that's ongoing, and will affect certain aspects

113
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:57,892
of the policies that you want to develop in an act.

114
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:03,543
Keep in mind, the population health differs from medical care.

115
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,781
Population health focuses on the upstream determinants,

116
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:15,075
medical care focuses on clinical treatment for individual patients.

117
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:21,105
As a result each of these has different ethical standards.

118
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:25,874
There's a well-developed bioethical framework for clinical care.

119
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:30,799
As I alluded to earlier, there's a far less developed set

120
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,128
of criteria for public health ethics.

121
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:37,926
We'll come back to that in a couple of minutes.

122
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:45,416
But keep in mind that paternalism is applicable to both realms.

123
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:50,771
For years physicians have been charged with making paternalistic decisions for

124
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:51,957
their patients.

125
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:57,955
Just as public health practitioners are charged with making paternalistic

126
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:03,772
decisions about what individuals can do or not do in their private lives.

127
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:09,510
Both forms of paternalism are facing limits and

128
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,102
push-back from the public.

129
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:18,430
We know that when we're thinking about public health ethics that there

130
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,135
are real differences between biomedical ethics and public health ethics.

131
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:30,821
For one thing, the public health sector is accountable to the public.

132
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:34,325
It must make decisions transparently.

133
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:39,366
There's a process for that, issuing regulations,

134
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:45,871
you have to have hearings and opportunity for the public to comment.

135
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:51,327
And as a matter of retaining trust in the community,

136
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:56,296
the public health system must be transparent.

137
00:10:56,296 --> 00:11:03,871
It also, fair policy making is an essential value in public health ethics.

138
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,964
If the public perceives that the decision making isn't fair,

139
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:12,336
then there's going to be a lack of trust.

140
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:16,712
A good example of that is in the recent Flint water

141
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:20,557
crisis where residents of Flint rightly,

142
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:25,148
in my opinion, don't view the policy making under

143
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:30,091
the state-imposed emergency manager as being fair.

144
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:36,543
Mean, decisions the emergency manager made led to the lead poisoning for

145
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:42,804
Flint's children and adults and to outbreaks of Legionella disease.

146
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:43,446
Why?

147
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:46,819
Because it wasn't open and transparent.

148
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,280
There was no no fairness.

149
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,816
The community's desires were subordinated to fiscal realities.

150
00:11:55,816 --> 00:12:02,487
The public's health wasn't protected, there was no fairness in the process.

151
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:06,873
Thus, the role of government is very different from the role of

152
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,374
the private sector.

153
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:13,430
And the attributes of a sound public health ethical framework from

154
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,315
bioethics will be different from that of public health ethics.

155
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:23,341
So, as I've suggested earlier, there are some macro-level public

156
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:28,470
health issues that all public health practitioners need to confront.

157
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,087
Resource constraints, you simply won't have enough money to address

158
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,986
every public health problem, therefore how you allocate the resources,

159
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:45,056
becomes a source of tension, but also a source of opportunity.

160
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:49,450
And this is where the role of policy analysis comes in.

161
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,785
Because you have to make trade-offs, because you have limited resources,

162
00:12:55,785 --> 00:13:02,034
your allocation decisions must be based on a fair and transparent process.

163
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:05,130
Hence, the importance of policy analysis.

164
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,734
And third, public health deals with social and economic determinants of health.

165
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:14,884
These are large ethical issues.

166
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:21,488
How do you address housing, sanitation, food, and the like?

167
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:22,585
You can't.

168
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:27,452
But you can alleviate some of them by allocating your

169
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:30,667
resources to the major problems.

170
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,775
And then define which of these problems presents

171
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:39,089
the greatest threat to the population's health.

172
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,940
And how can you allocate resources to them in a way

173
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,739
that is fair, open and transparent.

174
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:52,788
There are also micro ethical issues that you need to think about.

175
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:57,191
What's the role of private partnerships and collaborations?

176
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:03,353
It's inevitable that you want to and need to collaborate with the community, but

177
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:08,813
it's important that the private not overwhelm or crowd out the public.

178
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:14,928
Going back to our discussion of resource and transparency.

179
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:21,134
If you allow the private to subsume the public, it won't be transparent.

180
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,586
How do you set priorities?

181
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:28,731
What's the role of ethical decision-making in priority setting?

182
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:33,451
Once you've set your priorities, how do you collect and

183
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:38,476
use data in a way that leads to effective decision-making?

184
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:44,251
And you have to keep in mind the potential political and legal constraints.

185
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:49,315
Even where you think one policy approach is more ethically

186
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:54,906
appropriate from the public health perspective than another.

187
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:59,601
In the end, it's really important to remember that

188
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:04,508
you're operating on a set of values and assumptions,

189
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:09,628
in the public sector, that drive public health ethics,

190
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:16,800
in a way that's very different from the private sector's focus on bioethics.

191
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,412
In the public sector we have to be concerned about,

192
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:25,200
the fairness of process, the underlying values of public health,

193
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,832
such as social justice that's addressing the social determinants of health.

194
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:33,540
The need to be open and

195
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,957
transparent at all times will lead you to,

196
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:44,526
will be what results in successful policies

197
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,915
to improve the public's health.
