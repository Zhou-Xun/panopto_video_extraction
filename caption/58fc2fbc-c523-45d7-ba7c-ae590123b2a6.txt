1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:01:11,050
Thank you. I get out of your way. Obviously, Simon.

2
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:22,170
I must say, maybe I'll just do it for my laptop. It's probably easier to it'll someone else in the system such.

3
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,520
So it's a we have a holy verse to be as we go to this link and sign it might need a wait a minute until we get it set up on our side,

4
00:01:30,520 --> 00:02:31,730
but I think it feels like a lobby to join or something. OK, now it should work.

5
00:02:31,730 --> 00:03:00,950
Summer, just get it, OK? We still need to go to the length of time here, and I think if we just pretend.

6
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:18,790
Yeah, yeah. It's not like.

7
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:36,620
I'm just going to. So your laptop, your.

8
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,490
Chose the best of luck or doesn't have this.

9
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:50,570
I got it. I think I might be able to give you a chance to fill it out.

10
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:56,770
That's it, cut the response. OK, well, I'll just hold up my screen credits here.

11
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:09,950
That's correct. This did not work, and I wanted this to be a little word cloud, but it does not look like that's what happened.

12
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,490
Did it ask you guys to put anything? I think that might have been the issue.

13
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:23,950
OK, well, let's bring everyone wants to like just state what they think of when they think of fire safety, just like shout out or raise your hand.

14
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:30,880
Yeah, because like when do you think about viruses or how often and I was like only when my dad's

15
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,220
lighting fireworks in the backyard or something really trying to light a fire like everyone,

16
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,360
everyone's three times of summer and I'm a little bit concerned about it.

17
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,570
Yeah, that's the results from that question. Can just get the first one.

18
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,710
So most people said sometimes or never, which is kind of getting out, I guess,

19
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,040
thinking about what we just learned from the intro, the doctrine of unscathed,

20
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,950
how it's obviously like, not something that we think about, but is very present in our everyday lives, whether we think about it or not.

21
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,510
So just to kind of control that what we want to start with.

22
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,520
So the next couple of slides kind of go a little more in-depth on some of the background of the TED talk gave.

23
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,380
So I know when I came into doing this project, I knew nothing about flame retardants or fire safety.

24
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,340
So but it was good to kind of build a little background.

25
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,570
But essentially, as one can imagine, the primary goal flame retardant is either to prevent or slow the growth of a fire.

26
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:37,030
So the California ban that all the readings were on focused mostly on like looking at flame retardants and the children's products,

27
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:46,060
mattress bowls and upholstered furniture. But it's in basically everything so furniture, electronics, building and construction materials.

28
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:55,060
So there's actually a lot of building code laws that require flame retardants to be in the construction materials, which is kind of interesting.

29
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,440
And then transportation products.

30
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:05,140
So when you're on a plane, essentially everything is just covered in flame retardants or any sort of like mass transport.

31
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,520
So that's something that I knew. So I thought that was kind of interesting.

32
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,590
So there's a lot of different types of categories of flame retardants, depending on what chemicals they contain.

33
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,040
So the brominated flame retardants are like the most commonly used, and they're used in electronics,

34
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,340
furniture, building materials have been winter and endocrine disruption, which we'll get to the next slide.

35
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:35,230
Also, the a bunch of us poly brominated diphenyl, others, either this or the baby tees,

36
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:41,560
these are the types that don't chemically bind and are semi volatile,

37
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,920
and they're also used in furniture and electronics and have been associated with,

38
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,900
like lower birth weight of children and neurological development issues.

39
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,060
And then finally, there's I'm not even going to try this one HBC to use.

40
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,230
These are what are mostly used in building materials and are kind of included in like the building code type things,

41
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:12,520
and they've also been found in food products as well. So getting into some of the health impacts like it was talked about in the video,

42
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,830
endocrine and thyroid disruption is one of the primary health concerns associated with liver targets,

43
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,410
as well as impacts to the immune system and cancer.

44
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:31,480
Um, there's a lot of effects on young children, which can be which, as you can see from the video, like kids are always playing around on the floor.

45
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,610
There's a lot of like hand-to-mouth behavior,

46
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:42,310
so flame retardants will get into like the dust in the home and then children will, like, ingested, usually accidentally.

47
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,180
So advanced puberty delayed mental physical development,

48
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,480
as well as like memory learning issues and like lower IQ associated with children who have very high levels of these light retardants.

49
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,860
So they kind of got into it.

50
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:04,420
The video but the there was a lot in 1953, a federal standard about like the manufacture and sale of dangerously flammable clothing.

51
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,590
So that is why there's so many flame retardants put into children's pajamas, which first I thought sounded kind of ridiculous.

52
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,220
But in the 70s, they realized that the slimmer transfer damaging the DNA of the animals and obviously we

53
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,870
don't want our children's DNA to be damaged by the pajamas that they sleep every night.

54
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:30,700
So in 1977, the brominated tress, which just like a type of flame retardant, was banned from the use of children's pajamas.

55
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:39,160
But still, there's a lot of other flame retardants found in the home on couches and carpets and plastic casings of things.

56
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,470
And since they're somehow volatile, which means that they can fly off the products very easily,

57
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,230
they can stick to surfaces some of the dust even by just like the heat of you sitting on your couch,

58
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:58,500
they can release or the heat of your TV being turned on. So very accelerated release in the home.

59
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,440
Wondered then somebody also kind of got into this the effects of fire toxicity.

60
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,280
The real danger in fires isn't necessarily like the burns that you're getting,

61
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,430
but like the chemicals are like the carbon monoxide that you're inhaling along with like and smoke and other things.

62
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:23,610
So the whole automated flame retardants, when exposed to flame can like, release these toxic gases.

63
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,140
And even like with the brominated according correlated flame retardants that can kind of prevent this reaction,

64
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,310
there's still more carbon monoxide that's being released.

65
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,050
There's this kind of tradeoff between, well, there's less risk of the fire.

66
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,410
There's like more time until the fire is the combusting.

67
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:48,780
But at the same time, there's more carbon monoxide that's being released that's arguably even more dangerous to human health or life risk of death.

68
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:56,390
So. Risks associated, yeah, and so first of all, it's kind of covered this,

69
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,480
but so Americans actually carry the highest concentrations of flame retardants in their bodies than people anywhere else in the world.

70
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,850
And so I guess it's almost kind of an example of suffering from a that's where thanks to your policies and consumption,

71
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,940
we are perhaps the most impacted from flame retardants and so on.

72
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,400
There's several populations of interest pregnant mothers, children, firefighters and interestingly,

73
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:28,010
college students and so children, pregnant mothers, children in particular, their much lower body weight and had frequent contact.

74
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,780
So they're much more likely to be accumulating dust and just kind of be more exposed overall.

75
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,570
The government understands that in pregnant mothers already being a more vital population for many reasons,

76
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:45,440
but in utero exposure is especially with Energreen disruptors is a very bad combination.

77
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:53,240
And so firefighters, I think people would expect almost all their gear to be flame resistant and dust and flame retardants,

78
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,070
which might be one of the most sensible applications of these materials,

79
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,720
especially since they're far more likely to be coming into contact with heat and flames.

80
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,790
I think that makes sense.

81
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:14,090
However, there's been many studies on dust in fire fighter fire houses, and so they usually find very high concentrations of these chemicals.

82
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,670
And so there's a very interesting study from $.10 in Twenty Seventeen,

83
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:26,420
where they took ninety five samples from two different campuses from like dormitory common areas and like the rooms themselves.

84
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,300
And they found the highest reported US concentrations for a number of flame retardants, including DDT,

85
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,600
and the only place they found a higher concentration were actual fire houses and so on.

86
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Quite possibly, unless any guys go going to become the fire marshal or go work at a fire department,

87
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,430
the highest amount of exposure you'll have to flame retardants was if you lived on student housing as an interesting way.

88
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,720
One of the freshmen at Michigan State, the state government, and we wanted to get some new chairs for our common area and so on.

89
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,850
We're looking at how to do it. And so apparently through facilities and this is there are many college campuses,

90
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:14,270
you can only go to select merchants where the furniture is pretty vetted to be like break safe and lick resistant and durable more or less now.

91
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:22,790
But also, fire safety is a big part of that. And so we were literally in buy furniture that wasn't the flame retardants and so on.

92
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,600
College administrators or college administrators, obviously,

93
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,820
college students have a much higher propensity for partying and smoking, drinking, potentially breaking things.

94
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:39,620
However, college was very interesting that we are potentially a population of interest for flame retardants and so on.

95
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,920
This kind of gets onto the next point, however,

96
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,870
but the bromine industry is particularly notorious for being a cartel, particularly in the early 1800s.

97
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,920
There's a lot of price fixing nasty stuff, and that is kind of a byproduct of the way that bromine is made chemically.

98
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,020
And so it's price dependent on brine, which is a pretty kind of rare thing to get.

99
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:09,620
And so pretty much almost all modern bromine is made near the Dead Sea area or in the US.

100
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,220
And so it's very like chemically intensive process.

101
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,300
It's not like you can become a mom and pop producer of bromine and just the

102
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,320
transportation of bromine you have to transport wine takes is very volatile,

103
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:29,300
so it's very expensive. And so there's this pretty much for companies account for over 70 percent of gold production and is based in just two regions.

104
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,720
So it's many chemical industries already are like almost all the lot, or they're very highly centralized.

105
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,040
But bromine industry in particular is a highly decentralized industry,

106
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,120
which then kind of gets into this centralized power of production and really gets

107
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,680
into their lobbying power and their ability to influence not only production,

108
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:55,250
but how it's sold, where it's sold and what should be sold and so on.

109
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,150
It was funny. It was brought up the time of like his very being from twenty to 2010.

110
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,480
And so this is a John Oliver clip from which I thought was pretty recent, but it's actually from 2018, which I guess is four years ago.

111
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,880
And so he's speaking about astroturfing, and so astroturfing is basically the production of a fake grassroots campaign for things.

112
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,790
And so this coming does turn into our topic, I might add.

113
00:14:22,790 --> 00:17:41,340
Let me get to respond. It.

114
00:17:41,340 --> 00:19:31,770
Although. So that's premature.

115
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:39,970
But I found it particularly a good example of how egregious the lies are and the fact that a doctor who should know,

116
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,510
well, I imagine there's ethics violations that go with going on congressional record.

117
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,280
With this completely fake testimony, I'm sure that could be some kind of ethical violation,

118
00:19:50,280 --> 00:20:04,030
but I saw was a really good wrap up with kind of that case and.

119
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:14,110
So. So this brings us pretty obviously to the next topic that we're going to cover the about lobbying and policy and the controversy

120
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,720
that's kind of surrounds it or that has emerged in the past several years surrounding specifically flame retardants,

121
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,710
which since obviously most of us, I don't think had heard of us until we done this class.

122
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,080
The controversy, I wouldn't say, is like so strongly in the public's eye that we all would know about it.

123
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,810
But it is pretty notable, especially given those jokes that we just heard that it's that ridiculous like Josh just said.

124
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,350
So a little bit more background on citizens for fire safety.

125
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,370
So like they mentioned in the video, it's allegedly a coalition of people who you would think would be interested in fire safety.

126
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,930
So classic firefighters, educators, community activists, doctors.

127
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:56,290
However, there's pretty strong evidence or like it's pretty well accepted to know that it is actually

128
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:02,380
backed by those three chemical producers that they listed and that we talked about earlier.

129
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,330
And it is also known to be associated with American Chemistry Council.

130
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,010
And yeah,

131
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:19,630
so it was initially created in response to the initial introduction of the California bill that was looking to ban flame retardants back in 2007.

132
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:29,260
So again, here is Dr. Heimbach that was paid off or paid by the Citizens for Fire Safety Group to give those testimonies.

133
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:37,420
And I guess there's also been some instances of planting stories in smaller media outlets that are also,

134
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,000
you know, kind of looking to change people's opinion on flame retardants.

135
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,180
And I think it's important to point this stuff out and like the role of the media

136
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,860
and like how people can be influenced on their opinion by flame retardants.

137
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,550
Because of course, when you hear that, it sounds like a good thing.

138
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:01,300
So there's a lot of work that needs to be done and lobbying for safer like measures that are not using flame

139
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:09,370
retardants or not using toxic flame retardants to kind of undo the confusion that's there in the first place.

140
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:15,880
So this is just some more examples of kind of the history or like origin of where all of this came from.

141
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,770
So if you think about these chemical companies, which we mentioned or just mentioned it or kind of like,

142
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,070
they have a very specific market that they're selling to a very specific products that not a lot of no one else can really make,

143
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,960
and they don't really want to try to start making other things, especially if it's been, you know,

144
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,790
we saw that with the band of flame retardants has increased over the past several decades.

145
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,470
So it's obviously making the money. But so it originally or not originally.

146
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:48,910
But part of where this came from, it was a push to making cigarets smarter or not smarter, safer.

147
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,100
And they kind of came to the conclusion that they couldn't make a fire safe cigaret that people

148
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,500
would actually use or that made any sense in the first place since the cigaret is supposed to burn.

149
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:09,040
And so they kind of pivoted to doing flame retardants as their main source of business and promoting it to be just sprayed on just about everything,

150
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,910
which we have learned was pretty successful. Yeah.

151
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,010
And so it kind of goes back to how necessary are flame retardants because whenever this Congress,

152
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,700
this gets brought up and then people may be misguided,

153
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,170
they think we need flame retardants to stop fires, how we're so we're going to keep fires from happening.

154
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,570
But we have to manage fire risk for many years without the use of flame retardants.

155
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,850
And so there's many nontoxic, completely effective ways of balancing that certain I mean,

156
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:43,240
sprinklers, sprinkler systems, smoke alarms, highly effective solutions that work really well.

157
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,600
So there's this false dichotomy of this choice between either we're going to have fires,

158
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,560
are going to flame retardants, and that's just not that's not the it's not binary choice.

159
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,120
And so we're kind of going to demand has been induced by the industry as it kind of gets.

160
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,070
Do more of this conversation of what our risks that we're willing to take and what outcomes are less desirable.

161
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,840
And so fires is a very flashy, scary phenomenon. Everyone knows about that.

162
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:13,750
But people don't know about the widespread, prevalent toxic poisoning of not only us, but animals, the environment and future generations.

163
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,360
And so it's a lot harder to have news work on that or feel understand that and that risk value.

164
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,900
And so whether you buy flame retardants or not, you're being exposed to it.

165
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,440
And so that kind of gets to the ethics of consent and who is really making this choice an informed choice.

166
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,120
And so it just is a really complex issue that I think more often than they know about.

167
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:44,730
Yes, and now you get into what has been done, what is currently being done and what could be done policy wise to address this issue of the retarded.

168
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:51,430
So in terms of the first thing currently in the U.S., customers hold the most responsibility in addressing their exposure,

169
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:57,190
which just left a really large burden on customers to determine what service for them, what safest for their kids.

170
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:05,610
So. In the video we had watched, we saw that she asked the question that who like she was just asking the question of the audience.

171
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,660
And was like, Do you expect that the products that you're using are safe for you?

172
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,290
And I think that that audience may be highly educated like many of us.

173
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,260
But most people in the US are taking courses like this where they're learning about those dangers.

174
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,350
So most people would assume that the the clothes that they're buying for their children,

175
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:28,810
the couches that say that they won't catch on fire are actually really safe for their children and would prefer to buy those things.

176
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,800
So putting that responsibility on the consumers is just not working right now, and it's making it.

177
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,020
So those who are now educated about these dangers are having to look underneath their couches

178
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,900
underneath all their products and see what is actually safest for them and their families.

179
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:53,550
As that goes into the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is one commission in the United States that is in charge of regulating this area.

180
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:59,170
And then there's the EPA. So both of these both of these entities are in charge of risk assessment.

181
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,800
So they are collecting a lot of information. That's kind of what they have been doing for a lot of years now,

182
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,450
like collecting a lot of information about what is the relative risk of that fire

183
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,200
versus the flame retardant and then also putting recommendations for consumers.

184
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:21,000
So I was looking at the latest EPA fact sheet with from 2015. So that's a long time ago, a lot of times in 2015 and a lot of products,

185
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,160
a lot of pounds of flame retardants have been created since then and been utilized.

186
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,620
Another policy solutions preventative regulatory measures.

187
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:35,580
So like we talked about before, there is smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, fire safety, education.

188
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,080
There's a lot of things that could be more preventative as opposed to just pushing out all these retardants in different products.

189
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,290
There's also the Stockholm Convention that determined they were going to have a global phaseout of HP CDs,

190
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:56,250
which you talked about earlier in the presentation. That's normally an inflation, you thought a construction of different buildings.

191
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,440
So over 100 governments of different countries agreed. The U.S. did not sign on to this agreement.

192
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:12,060
So the Stockholm Convention, if he's not aware, is basically this global treaty and trying to address the issue of persistent organic pollutants

193
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,820
and these are the HP cities was one of the ones that they were going to be focusing on from that.

194
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:25,260
So just for some greater context. Ninety nine million pounds of HP cities were used in the U.S. over the period from 1988 to 2010,

195
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,480
and most countries are not saying that's not safe to use. We want to completely phase this out from being felt.

196
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:39,180
And it has continued to be developed in the U.S., although many of the government entities, dances and federally have said,

197
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:46,560
Try not to do this or like be warned of this in your products, but that, as we know, doesn't really go very far.

198
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,930
There's also been an increased interest in future international policy treaties and agreements.

199
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:56,910
So as we read in some of our readings, as we know a lot of the technology that we use cell phones,

200
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,920
key things, laptops, TVs have a lot of these different flame retardants in them.

201
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,570
And instead of being properly disposed of or disposed of in a way that would create the least amount of harm,

202
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,480
it could be sent off to a lot of developing countries and causing great amount of harm there.

203
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,300
So there's a lot of interest or some interest, especially from the developing countries,

204
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:26,380
and creating new treaties and agreements that would allow or that would force countries like the U.S. to dispose of these products themselves.

205
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,440
And then the state level policies, and he said this map is a little bit dated, but they do differ greatly.

206
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,480
So obviously we talked about California being more progressive when it comes to Michigan.

207
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,300
Two of the current policies are that they determined are they created a committee to just determine risk,

208
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,820
as is what a lot of the EPA does a pbdes to human health and environment.

209
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,770
And that was in 2004.

210
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:58,060
And then the next thing was banned in one tenth of one percent of the flame retardant powder, which we talked about in the Earth,

211
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:06,430
which she talked about in the videos of pets as extremely dangerous and is basically not,

212
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,960
not extremely used in the U.S. and in most other countries is not used at all.

213
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:20,660
And so that is not doing that much either, and we haven't had any significant policies since before 2003.

214
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh, I they animated something. Oh, we could figure out if we could just start from the bottom and go, Oh, what's the problem?

215
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,280
OK, so we have some discussion questions and obviously it kind of leads into a different area.

216
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:41,510
We don't have to be constrained. But I guess to just starting know overall, what was your reaction to this or was this a topic you heard about before?

217
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:49,910
And kind of what elements of issue are the most or the least concerning to you?

218
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:56,120
I don't really know anything about this topic before this, and I feel like it's like pretty frightening.

219
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,380
Like, I had literally no idea that it was like all of these things that I use in everyday life and also seems

220
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,740
like pretty in excess of all to like kind of learn about it like or like you really have to like,

221
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,930
do your own research like nobody's really just telling you. Um yeah,

222
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:20,570
I feel like probably what's most concerning also is that there's doesn't seem like there's much regulation on

223
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:27,560
it like other than like outside like researchers like the lady in the TED talk like taking it upon themselves,

224
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,940
like an open government. Also interested in your videos from 2010?

225
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,800
Because I mean, it's been 12 years now, and there still really hasn't been much movement.

226
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:51,730
I mean, the science is only more solid, but. I only heard about the professor doing this other class last year.

227
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,580
That was like the first I ever heard of it,

228
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:00,510
and I think they emphasize a lot like she had in her TED talk about like in furniture and in clothing and stuff like that.

229
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:07,140
But I think like like revisiting the issue I'm more concerned about, like in electronics now,

230
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,640
just because like you're surrounded by electronics, like every day, like you literally have them on your body all the time.

231
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,040
It's like, that's more concerning to me now,

232
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,520
rather than like the furniture because they made more progress like furniture, clothing, children's clothing.

233
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,710
Well, that sounds like the technology area.

234
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,410
Yeah, when I saw that it was actually better my phone every single night and people talked about like other issues of that,

235
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:39,850
and this was a whole nother thing to know for sure. But I hadn't thought about before.

236
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:47,260
And even like I mentioned earlier, like building codes that require like use of products like with flame retardants and how

237
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,870
that is like one of the major contributors to like flame retardants like sand and dust.

238
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,810
And obviously, like there's dust everywhere.

239
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:02,530
And like Josh was saying, like in college, like buildings, I'm sure all of this flame retardant all over it.

240
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,610
So whatever my professors burned toxicology,

241
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,170
he mentioned that they were redoing like one of the big lecture halls must be message one and on the other.

242
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,760
Like for fun, just wanted to measure like how much flame retardant in the room.

243
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,600
And it was a ton. But I was like, I'm not super surprised by the whole college dorm thing because I went to Central Michigan.

244
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,430
So I don't know if this is true here, but there is definitely a spices in the dorm and they just kind of like,

245
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:33,110
put it in this like little booklet that no one read, like when you moved in with no one, really?

246
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:39,190
Otherwise, the book they just said, like, don't bump the ceiling like everyone like, slept in law.

247
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,000
So it didn't really make a lot of sense. But yeah, that's not surprising to me.

248
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,110
There's probably so much in so.

249
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:59,470
I don't have a reaction. I think also like when it gets more concentrated as generations go,

250
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:07,860
I was also thinking about like impacts it probably could have on children or even like my mom was born in fifty nine, so I got all parents, but still.

251
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,910
Like, she was born before, like she was a grown up before 1977 or whatever rolled around.

252
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:20,950
So I'm like and I was breastfed, so I was like, Oh, I wonder if this could possibly mean.

253
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,890
And it's like, I remember I was reading after we were talking about led like all boomers have certain amount of lead poisoning in them.

254
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:35,440
And then there is that joke going around like, that's part of the reason why, like, you know, you have less empathy in our time.

255
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,640
Yeah. But it's like, Oh, what sort of chemicals are we carrying that our parents passed on to us?

256
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,530
And how are they impacting how our brains work? Which just so exciting.

257
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,910
I think that's an excellent point,

258
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,900
and I think that one of the most frightening things about any of this kind of chemicals is it's one of them to be like,

259
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,480
Oh, great, I just gave myself like an increased cancer risk.

260
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:02,390
But like we were talking like, it's in the watershed, it's in the whales, it's in us and it gets so much.

261
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,960
The choice is always bigger than ourselves. Like, we are making this decision for our future descendants and we look back.

262
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,380
We're like, Oh, wow, all these people use this best. It's like they kind of didn't make the right decision, and we're kind of doing the same thing.

263
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:21,400
And like in this kind of case, like not making a decision is making a decision where the longer we just let this happen, it's going to keep happening.

264
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,760
And so I guess the next question, how do you decide what chemicals to use and it can impact everyone?

265
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:39,460
And like, what criteria should guide this decision making process and how can we ensure ethical considerations are looked at?

266
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:46,120
I feel like there should be a lot more extensive testing. I like the government because like you think, like in your mind,

267
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,120
like the government should be able to say more citizens like they should be testing everything.

268
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,440
But I feel like there's not as much like regulation as you would assume.

269
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,060
It's like like we're the greatest country in the world or whatever people say.

270
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,970
But yeah, it's like this stuff happens. I'm like one of the other thoughts that I've had is like,

271
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,390
we put so much money into the cancer research and finding cures for cancer and like treating cancer patients.

272
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:20,650
But like we don't really put as much money into solving the issues that actually do cause cancer.

273
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:33,460
It's like, you know, we're not that they don't care, but it's like not as much of an issue as like actually curing cancer.

274
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,520
I mean, I think that kind of gets into what you're saying, like the Rolling Currents album,

275
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,590
which I think is also a great way to put it is like we are technically run by a government.

276
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:49,190
But when our government is led by corporations and lobbyists on behalf of corporations like who is actually running our system,

277
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,730
which is not like an oligarchical body at this point,

278
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,680
I think it also raises the question of like,

279
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,640
where did all the expenses go when we took it out of our ceilings at our side and all of our family and things like, where did it go?

280
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,140
It didn't disappear, right?

281
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,920
So it's like, I think also like kind of going back to your question of ethical considerations, it's like we're probably just shipping it off.

282
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,210
So it's someone else's problem at that point, which is that even better then also like who has access to the ability to,

283
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:26,560
let's say, rebuild all of our buildings that they have, obviously the president who has the money to do that.

284
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,190
And it's like, maybe we can do it in Ann Arbor, but can they do it in Detroit? Can it be done in other cities?

285
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:42,880
Are usually how it's like predominantly folks of color or folks with lower socioeconomic status, which you know, intersections that.

286
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:53,620
Just some food for thought off of that, the quote that Claire was reading about the like allegedly planted quotes in local media was

287
00:36:53,620 --> 00:37:01,990
actually a to quote from a public housing like tenant organizer in favor of flame retardants.

288
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:07,750
When a bill in New York was looking to be passed to meet some of the same standards

289
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,760
that California was in terms of like banning flame retardants and mattresses.

290
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:21,040
So I think it's important to look at now what words were putting in people's mouths and who is being impacted by that.

291
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,610
So I don't know if anyone has any thoughts about that as well. But your point,

292
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:33,280
Victoria is going to tie in your commentary of the previous kind electronics where one of the interesting findings from the reading on the ship,

293
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,120
what we're trying to be used in electronics. Um,

294
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,600
not only did the use of flame retardants reduce the recycling fraction because it made

295
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,630
recycling of the plastics of electronics a lot harder because it's a hazardous process.

296
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:53,590
Um, it's like it's it's such a multifaceted issue where like you're talking like, even if we got rid of this, where does it go to?

297
00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:01,090
And like e-waste is already an issue and it's in the e-waste and like, we need to recycle to reduce our time to climate,

298
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,880
to that to like we need to recycle a lot more to reduce our emissions.

299
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,760
But all of this is wrapped up where, like the toxins in our plastics only make it harder to deal with.

300
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,040
And one of the reasons why I thought the John Oliver put this off good was it really ties into who are we making?

301
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,540
Who's making these decisions? Because it was the topic of the video was astroturfing.

302
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,540
And so it's very easy for a company just to make a fake says.

303
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,760
And it's very been. People are busy. Read the news. This is for fire safety.

304
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,170
Oh, like, and there's so many issues that it's such a huge tactic and it's very successful.

305
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:44,370
And so it's crazy. Also kind of going off the John Oliver looks like we only know he was wrong because

306
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,110
he got caught like how many people testified before Congress on the lesser issues.

307
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:54,330
I don't get as much coverage and don't get caught in their lies.

308
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,450
So that's also add onto the pile of whatever we're doing.

309
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:06,900
Yeah, they also kind of want to add, I still just keep thinking about the graph that has like the beluga whales of the artwork that like the killer.

310
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,270
All of that like having these high concentrations of it.

311
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,010
And it just makes me think again about how the victory sort of thinking about like, where does it go?

312
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,060
And the answer is it goes everywhere, even if we're not trying to deliberately get rid of it.

313
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:27,480
And that again goes to like authority and like thinking about should like if they're there already is some international discourse about this.

314
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,130
But what are how do we like try to inspire the United States?

315
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:40,380
Like take more responsibility when clearly we are like a major, if not like the top contributor to the issue?

316
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:47,400
I don't know. I just think like, I don't even know how to feel about it, really, because it feels so far out of reach,

317
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,360
but just something kind of add on like the global implications outside of like, OK,

318
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,360
even if we fix our own decision making processes and start making better decisions.

319
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:08,940
You know, how does that change or how how do other people hold us accountable?

320
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,230
You can answer that. This is really interesting.

321
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:20,320
The FDA and regulation are good and stuff. There's a very long period where they're analyzing it.

322
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,510
You sure like the drugs or whatever it is doesn't even help.

323
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:30,100
But I feel appealing to the thing is that they can't really do that for every single chemical, every single product made with the same.

324
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,860
We don't want be putting out condoms. They're really dangerous came out.

325
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:43,570
So I think maybe having that bit like me creating policy that creates that separation between industry and government regulation because,

326
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:51,040
you know, obviously with that one organization, all of the industry, the big companies, we're kind of enforcing their own toys and rules.

327
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,780
So I think be trying to separate that so you can have a completely unbiased perspective

328
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:03,270
when deciding how long things need to be tested and when and where and all that stuff.

329
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,890
Maybe it is more like something of like there's a patent office,

330
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:15,090
like there's so many new inventions like every single year that have to be patented because it's in the interest of the people who make it right.

331
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:20,400
And I can only imagine that's probably about the same number of products that are released each year that are now just like,

332
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:29,040
why isn't there a body like the USDA, like the FDA for products that like even just for like babies like baby products specifically,

333
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,820
like maybe like screw the rest of us who are old like bottles, baby bottles, like what's like looking what's in them?

334
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,040
Or even I know, like as someone who has like a uterus and various like some of the body products,

335
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,290
like the amount of things that are in tampons and pads that no one regulates or IUD or really anything else, it's like.

336
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,800
Is there also like no larger body? The looks of things that are implanted inside of you?

337
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,110
Like, is there any do you know of any specific reason why we don't?

338
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:05,430
Yeah. Well, great question. And I don't want it to go too far, but it's actually a really nice contrast.

339
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,060
Maybe I can circulate some material following the class period,

340
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:19,060
but Europe's regulatory framework is a really nice contrast of study compared to what we have in the U.S. They have a paradigm called reach.

341
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:29,700
It's an acronym, but it it basically puts the burden on the producer to demonstrate that their product is safe

342
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:39,120
and doesn't cause harm before it can be widely distributed and applications that that paradigm,

343
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,720
for the most part, you know, hasn't existed in the US or for a long time.

344
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:55,590
And for, you know, kind of some of the reasons that the group has been discussing, it's like pulling together some thoughts,

345
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:04,170
you know, like, uh, the question was posed about why isn't you know, why is there a government in place to protect these things?

346
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,560
Well, just sticking to this story, this is where it started, right?

347
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,540
It was from a government, you know, health based entity that said, we want to protect people and things from fires.

348
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:23,370
And so we're going to put these standards in place to limit the fires and limit, you know, deaths and injuries and so forth.

349
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:29,280
And in hindsight, right, it, you know, caused some some bigger problems.

350
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:38,660
And then you're getting back to yes, there's it's now built, whatever the bromine cartel, I like that as well.

351
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:48,240
There is this, you know, massive three headed monster out there now that it's got deep pockets and there's tons of lobbying.

352
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:57,690
And with this, this issue in particular, right in in Dr. Bloom's video, you know, she showed the imagery of that was countering, you know, her claws.

353
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,870
And this one is just it's so tar, right?

354
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:08,820
Because it's showing a picture of a house burning was the thing that says every second counts below resonates with, like every human being.

355
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:16,840
Right? Easily without some long winded explanation about the even if rate and all this kind of stuff.

356
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:26,640
Um, and and then add in. I mean, you know, yeah, there's the there's the botched discoveries of like untruthful testimony.

357
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:33,150
But all it really takes is you don't need experts like there's thirty seven people a day that are dying.

358
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:39,750
Just bring a family member right to testify. So I don't know if we if we just would have had a few extra seconds, right?

359
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,340
I wouldn't have lost, you know, my family member to the fire.

360
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:51,850
Like, that's real. And that resonates with with a lot of people in decision making positions.

361
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:56,970
Right. So this is we've sort of, you know, we we talked about this last week.

362
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:06,220
It's us, right? We see the government. Many of you are going to be in the government, probably, you know, as part of your career.

363
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:13,560
Um, and it's it wasn't. It was a human caused, uh, situation that we're in.

364
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,660
And it's it's an uphill battle to where I thought it wouldn't distract too much from discussions.

365
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:25,390
All of that thought, you know, but great question and hopefully sort of an answer to respond.

366
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:33,030
That's really good in like a kind of the back of victories in a second by a gun, the the Pentagon, maybe the IT systems for fire safety,

367
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:42,640
like the the materials was very effective as a campaign tool, but the testimony was so lazy words if you stuck to the same story.

368
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,520
I mean, I don't think anyone would question. Oh yeah, like the one candle story that could have definitely happened.

369
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,490
And like you, I mean, in some of the regions you found actual fire marshals who were pro flame retardants.

370
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:59,190
I mean, you could you can find those people, I mean, whether they genuinely believe it or misunderstanding.

371
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,020
But you can find actual people for that. I'm like, That's kind of the fact that I a.

372
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,410
Just three corporations in a trench coat, like it's like a grassroots campaign,

373
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:17,400
like like there's so much more effective ones if you just get like 10 people on board or something about going back to the restaurant for a breach.

374
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,220
And so I guess we're talking about new chemicals. We have Tosca, which is the Talk Substance Control Act for the EPA.

375
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,480
But on so many, I believe probably all the flame retardant certainly grandfathered in.

376
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,630
And so like, there's a preliminary new process for a link.

377
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:36,390
If they were newly invented now, they would have to go through like a preliminary process and maybe they'll get caught.

378
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:41,850
Maybe they wouldn't. I don't. Personally, I don't think it's probably as selective as it should be, but like,

379
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:47,810
maybe they would get caught if they're new chemicals now and the like, the cats are the better because like a lot of chemicals are grandfathered in.

380
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:54,510
And going back to your John Oliver, all of your biotech implementations and stuff,

381
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:00,690
there actually is a John Oliver bit about FDA approval of like replacement hips, similar kind of stuff, which is interesting.

382
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:10,770
But going off of all that, I think that just speaks to one of the core issues of all of the issues that we talk about in this cause.

383
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:14,790
It's just really short term versus long term risks in the fisheries because of how

384
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:20,550
human minds work is that if someone thinks about a fire versus like this thing,

385
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:26,640
that's going to be built up in themselves and their children and animals throughout a long period of time,

386
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,630
they're going to be like, I don't want the fire to burn my child or to like speed up.

387
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:37,530
Like if I get three extra seconds versus kind of a few years, potentially off of my life in the future,

388
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,370
they're going to choose the few extra seconds and potentially save a life right now.

389
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:45,360
So I think that it kind of goes to that skipping over the policy question.

390
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,610
But how do we balance all risks with new unknowns?

391
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:54,570
It's like, I'd love to hear all of your opinions about that as well, but it's really a question of how do we balance this thing?

392
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,990
It's very familiar to everyone that's easily approachable,

393
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:04,500
understandable and marketable by things like the citizens fire safety versus this new unknown,

394
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,630
complex, not fully understood risks like flame retardants.

395
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:17,000
So anyone has ideas that.

396
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:28,630
Yeah, yeah, so I like putting it on the ground major, and so I like I look like me from an internal perspective of what the hospital system and like,

397
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:34,210
like you were saying, that the human mind is very like now for this and really for this.

398
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:42,490
And that's what they do. And like the whole system seems like very much on the acute care, in fact and very downstream.

399
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:48,610
And like everything happens before the like out there and she turns the thing.

400
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:54,100
So it's like I am like a person in the county health department.

401
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:05,800
And she was like most of the um, like the reason people do things is because of the fear that they have, like unknown fears, drive everything they do.

402
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,430
And so I think it's like very interesting,

403
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:16,930
like it's very much up to public health people that actually have this understanding of the whole spectrum of somebody's life.

404
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:26,420
And like every day about, Oh my God, you were like in that I'm not being a class is like all about everything that factors into the equation.

405
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:33,900
And the reason is so complicated that I'm so it's like, it's like, it's really hard to do that, but you have to like,

406
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:41,440
here's the thing you have to focus on one thing at a time, but you need to have this collaboration between like everybody like health care.

407
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,670
People understand the the aftereffects of it.

408
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:54,310
And then you have plumbers and engineers who understand like the equipment and with the chemical processes like,

409
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:02,590
I barely understood that in this class. So. And then you have like guys who are working with the product people,

410
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:12,750
so you need to collaborate a lot and target the specific things that we are targeting, but you can do it better together.

411
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,220
I don't know what's going on with this thing,

412
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:27,100
but the thing is this this huge group of people working together and you have to know you don't really know what you're talking about so that you can,

413
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:35,810
you know, it's not actually true. So I think that's a fantastic point.

414
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,010
I mean, like I remember reading an article about plot and like, I'm too quick,

415
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,810
a lot like it's used oftentimes in like combat or like like if you have a trauma

416
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,010
like you need to immediately start plotting like you use it and like the long term,

417
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:56,720
like whatever cocktail of chemicals in that like, it's pretty bad for you, but like if you're bleeding out, you're going to use that.

418
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,500
And so it kind of gets to like risk management as a whole as like,

419
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,920
I'm sure they're completely justified using the flame retardants and like like an outright ban like might be good for consumer products,

420
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,040
but like, I'm sure a nuclear power plant, maybe they want a lot of all the flame retardants in the world or something and so on.

421
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:21,050
I mean, like like, we don't have a full picture of like the if we can have a statistic for the risk of fires,

422
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,130
just to see which is all can stop is all encompassing for all flame retardant risk.

423
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,720
Like that'll be wonderful to have, but we always have this gray area. We don't know the full picture.

424
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,240
And then there's all these different ethical stuff judgments.

425
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,400
And some people might say like fire deaths are significantly worse than anything the flame retardants could do.

426
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:43,280
And so it's just like it's such a nuanced discussion and like, I'm I'm kind of against flame retardants,

427
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,630
but also I can easily see why people could maybe be against the legislation and then just get into the nicer policy.

428
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:57,600
And it's just it's really multifaceted in history. It's it's crazy.

429
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:05,070
I'm curious as to what people think about, like just hypothetically, if you were against flame retardants,

430
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:11,100
what type of strategies would you use to like kind of combat that, like very easily digestible,

431
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:17,370
like anti fire kind of framework because I feel like there's a lot of different facets that we discussed,

432
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:25,380
both in terms of like human health, but also like environmental health and what would work best in order to reach the broadest audience.

433
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,700
Because I think that that kind of framework can be paired with any sort of like environmental health issue.

434
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,680
So just curious of what kind of strategies this isn't like a super well

435
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:45,390
developed idea of like the flame retardant people are like fire versus no fire.

436
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:53,940
So like, if you wanted to take like their approach, you'd be like cancer or no cancer or something like that, like just like acquainted with cancer.

437
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:00,860
So it's very simple. People know what cancer is usually, but like some of the other health effects are harder to describe.

438
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,200
But you'll tell someone the health effects of it, and I'll just like going over their heads.

439
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,000
They don't know what any of those words mean.

440
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,160
So if you could equate it to like one health risk a symbolic cancer and make it like cancer or this, I don't know.

441
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,020
So I think that's a good point. And also, like you could say, like talk like fire, like a very toxic fire.

442
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,880
I think that that would also get people's attention to say, Oh yeah, I was going to say,

443
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,570
I think that the main point is that for me and I'm doing like policy or legislation stuff,

444
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:40,020
the first thing we have to do is educate the public because you need that public support to pass those laws because like with the internet and stuff,

445
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,120
people didn't really understand that those libertarians were there for you. And it is counterintuitive,

446
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:51,510
but I think that maybe if they improve to focus more on like spreading awareness of how and why it's an issue and then working on that policy,

447
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:58,720
we're in a lot more difficult for them to have hindered that process.

448
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:08,440
No global health promotion, something like this, and I would imagine, like probably the group, you'd want to target the most like mothers.

449
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:15,400
So I would imagine putting pamphlets or signs and pediatrics offices and saying like, Hey, do you?

450
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:21,940
Does your child often look all around on the ground? Have you checked to see the levels of these different chemicals in your home?

451
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:30,040
And then list like the health impacts I would have under try because like that same sort of thing I think was used with BP.

452
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,140
If I remember correctly of like you shouldn't like your plastic should not be in it.

453
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:42,160
Maybe because it's terrible for you. So I would imagine, like if you started there, then that could start to kind of cause a figure change.

454
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,610
And then I think that's a group that we all agree is like should be protected as like you should protect babies and pregnant mothers.

455
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:54,250
Obviously, there is always time to be like cloak and dagger about it.

456
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:00,430
But I was also trying to think like people, if you give them something big to be afraid of, like with the Flint water crisis on the last week,

457
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:08,060
the doctor kind of using anecdote of like Flint Water was breaking down engine parts like What is it doing to your body?

458
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:15,100
But that sort of same for me, the question. I think this gets out what you were saying, as well as like, can you scare people a little bit?

459
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:21,490
You probably shouldn't do that, but you can. It's effective like it's weird talking about.

460
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:27,880
I forget in another course, but like wear your car, seat belt and all those ad campaigns in the 90s that were, like horrific.

461
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,710
Mm-Hmm. But it worked to an extent, probably not the best choice.

462
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:40,820
It's a notion that makes me think too like even something as simple as, like not really trying to like when you brand it, almost.

463
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,010
It's not. It's not flame retardant. It's just all these scary chemical names you don't like.

464
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:49,720
Say why we use them. You just say, like, they're in a bunch of things that they're not good for you.

465
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:57,000
And that kind of like distracts from the other side's argument, at least like all the chemical brands like animated cartoons.

466
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:06,730
All right. I mean, yeah, I don't know if any of you had it in like seventh grade science class for the whole day hydrogen monoxide spreadsheet.

467
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:12,070
I was given like a fact sheet is like document oxides in like 99 percent of food and found in all water and like,

468
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:17,710
I guess like X chemicals found in all of your couches. I don't know why someone like that.

469
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:23,860
But yeah, know I want to come back to a comment Claire made a few minutes ago that I think is,

470
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,870
I mean, yes, there's the whole laundry list of all of these potential health effects, right?

471
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:33,820
They can. They can occur because it gets in the dust and it gets distributed around the globe.

472
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,110
But it there's a very strong argument that's not even effective.

473
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:46,750
And it's our original intention, right? Just the fire toxicity part of it is like something to weight tremendously, right?

474
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:55,990
Is that you you have an increased chance of being injured or dying from exposure to what the fire

475
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:03,460
produces when it's while it's burning flame retardant versus without flame retardants present.

476
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:10,000
Yeah, that's something I don't think really this whole time is like if it's at its core, like a fire safety issue,

477
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,820
this is kind of like the situation where the solution is very simple, like prevent fires.

478
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:23,290
But then we just like threw chemicals and things, and we're like, Yes, this is better when it really wasn't even doing what we set out to do.

479
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:27,910
So with more emphasis on like fire safety.

480
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:37,300
I don't know it would make more sense in this situation. Go back to your original data on Lego's number one amount of fires with cocaine.

481
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,830
The second amount of fires was smoking, but the most fatal fires are smoking related.

482
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,580
And like the original purpose for a lot of this was so smokers.

483
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:54,130
If they fell asleep wanting to get a reduction fire, so like take a step back, like maybe don't smoke or fall asleep on your couch.

484
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:59,740
And like, I mean, like, that's like easier said than done. I guess for some people, but like going back and being like, what?

485
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:05,470
How do we start? Fires like instead of being this very specific should be the next chemicals that fire like.

486
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:11,800
We have so many things that we know that work. And so even with like the John Oliver summed it up really well.

487
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,330
Why was the candle next to the baby? Yeah, and obviously the fire wouldn't have happened.

488
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:21,490
The baby, by the way, lived in this like big scenario if there wasn't a candle there.

489
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,600
So it's like a fire safety thing. You didn't need to be a chemical thing.

490
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,640
Maybe this is a pessimistic view, but when you kind of look at the nuts and bolts of this whole issue,

491
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:40,150
it just seems like flame retardants are just a really great product for, like these big chemical companies to be selling because it's profitable.

492
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:49,570
And that's why they're making these, you know, fake activist groups to lie about babies dying with candles in their cribs, which never even happened.

493
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:57,880
But I mean, it's hard once you get the industry rooted in the issue, like, how do you take it out?

494
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,770
Because the fire safety is the issue. And we've made it a chemical issue.

495
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:11,410
How do you get that money out of the issue? And maybe that's too broad of a question, but could it also take a stab at it?

496
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,810
And I mean, just to piggyback on that, that's not just the issue for flame retardants, right?

497
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:22,150
This is like every issue in Typekit discussed in this class and beyond its class.

498
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:26,050
I was I just I just keep thinking of it. So I have to say it because I think it's so interesting.

499
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:30,770
Has anyone ever watched King Kong in the documentary? Oh, OK.

500
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:39,290
So basically, porn in America is crazy, and it's actually like a weirdly similar situation where like basically,

501
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:45,580
if you go back like there is a lot of surplus corn and they didn't want all the farmers to, like, suffer.

502
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,470
And so there's now all these corn subsidies,

503
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:53,140
and that's like the origin of why there's like corn sirup and everything and why it's an additive in so many foods,

504
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,540
even though it's also like sort of like,

505
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:01,270
that's marks the beginning of where we start to see like the obesity crisis or epidemic, whatever you want to call it.

506
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:09,160
And like the rise in like type two diabetes being diagnosed. But it's a similar thing where it's like it's being added because it's there and because

507
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:15,490
there was an industry interest in protecting that being like continued to be consumed.

508
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,950
And I guess that kind of point back to to like authorities role in it and governments, really.

509
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:22,930
But I would totally recommend you guys. It's a really old documentary, but it's super interesting.

510
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:26,290
And it's just, yeah, a really weird thing.

511
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:32,290
It's also the reason why I like cows get fed corn based food. Even though cows aren't supposed to eat corn, they're supposed to eat grass.

512
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:36,280
So all the cows are sick eating corn, I intended.

513
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,820
But that kind of here is that.

514
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:48,270
I mean, it's always a little bit of like hyper capitalist practices are actually bad for us.

515
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,820
Crazy. Imagine that. I mean, I like the policy level.

516
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:55,810
Just the momentum of entrenched industries is really hard.

517
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:00,940
I mean, you see that with climate change and corn and flame retardants and chemicals.

518
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:11,500
And it's just once when the perspective of the ones like the view of the issue in Seattle is, Oh, there's a next product to solve it.

519
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,460
There's a lot of financial interest astrologers of tied into that.

520
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:20,460
And it's like there's not a lot of money you can make from telling people to not put candles near their bed.

521
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:29,130
Maybe you could do a cool gadget or something, but like, it's just it's crazy.

522
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:34,260
And there's I mean, there's a big we're talking about government, there's a big part of our government leadership,

523
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:41,760
a big component of it that wants to minimize the role of government oversight and everything

524
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:50,340
because it's it's cumbersome and prohibitive to property and efficiency in manufacturing.

525
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,280
And, you know, all of all of the above which striking back to Victoria's Point about the hyper capitalism.

526
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,680
But that's that's the American dream, right?

527
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:11,460
Is the, you know, if you if you're born here, great, if you come here to be successful and to profit and live well and you know,

528
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:20,490
a lot of these government regulatory agencies that are in place are just barriers to achieving that.

529
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:36,300
There's a big component of government leadership that has that has that view.

530
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,500
So I was going to have you seen much progress on this issue in the first couple of

531
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,300
years because I guess I've always just seen it from like news every now and then,

532
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,990
it's mostly been ads at state levels. Right.

533
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:55,870
So California has made progress. I know that Massachusetts in the last couple of years is also taking it up,

534
01:02:55,870 --> 01:03:01,510
and there is legislation in the works that may have already had passed by now.

535
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:08,950
But right at the at the federal level, it's just kind of frozen, I guess, at the science level as it kind of like.

536
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:12,620
We've pretty much known some of the health effects for a while now. Or is it?

537
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,270
Yeah, yeah. I mean, we've known for a while.

538
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:24,220
We yeah, there's there's a um, I mean, Dr. Bloom was showing examples of 2009 conferences that he attends and papers and stuff.

539
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:29,560
But yeah, there's another 12 years worth of, you know, scientific literature,

540
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:43,790
exposure and health studies on mice that just further, you know, document the adverse impacts and.

541
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:52,400
Did we hit on you just wanted to make sure we had it and not on your third volume and tougher on a little bit?

542
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:02,670
Look, we talked about it very broadly in terms of policy, but in terms of like actionable, tangible steps.

543
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:10,490
Let's just say like the state level, because nothing is getting done at the federal level anyway.

544
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:24,170
What would be Celek first step solutions, potentially both related to like flame retardants and maybe like fire safety generally?

545
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,050
And I think this is where we get back to work,

546
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:33,820
right where Victoria was suggesting going to pediatricians offices and distributing pamphlets and literature.

547
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:40,690
I'm a little bit pressed did come up with what the content of the literature would say.

548
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:48,980
Right, like, where would the suggestion be to basically import all of your furniture,

549
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:57,290
this product from produced overseas producers that don't have this flame retardant requirement?

550
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:05,110
I don't think so. Really even label like if you buy a house, there wouldn't be a label on it saying, this has this flame retardant.

551
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:12,310
I bet it would. You know, it wouldn't be, you know, you'd have to look like underneath and it would be,

552
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,710
you know, kind of silly holding it like she showed in the video.

553
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:21,700
Like a little weight, kind of like a piece of clothing, and it would be very small letters that you know are hardly legible.

554
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:30,100
But yes, yes, it's horrifying. I suppose the interesting component of it that I didn't think about is if you're looking at manufacturing,

555
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:35,020
they're going to have to follow whatever laws. I mean, obviously, federal law, whatever state laws are in place.

556
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:43,390
So if all of your manufacturing is centered in one state or a couple of states like that, legislation is almost more important than whatever.

557
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:49,660
You know, your home state's legislation is if you're focusing on, you know, furniture or baking products or whatever.

558
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,750
So, yeah, this is like kind of a tangent,

559
01:05:52,750 --> 01:06:01,270
but like I bought a sleeping bag once like on a discount and like in the description online is that this product that

560
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:07,180
contains a chemical known to cause reproductive harm and I'm kind of like whatever like it was a zero degree sleeping bag.

561
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:11,530
I got a really good deal on it. They still sell this stuff that they make.

562
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:17,830
They just like, ship it elsewhere, put that they can still sell it right?

563
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:24,730
Yeah, the I'm kind of skeptical of like education is like a behavioral solution.

564
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:30,520
Built like education start up as a way to generate momentum, to create structural change.

565
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:36,550
And in that vein, I'm very much more optimistic of that solution because it's like there's behavioral

566
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:42,220
problems or like there's some public health issues that can be solved by, like behavioral education and stuff that helps.

567
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:48,400
But like especially when you start talking about like different socio demographic groups like,

568
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,390
I mean, like first of like try finding a lot of stuff that doesn't have flame retardants,

569
01:06:52,390 --> 01:07:00,700
then then you start going to like, what's the time and the money to figure all that out and like it just as like education as a way to create change,

570
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:12,590
like a pamphlet on the danger, it's like, that's all you need. But know.

571
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:17,880
Hmm. Yeah, it's like Clorox, wipe the stuff.

572
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,310
Oh, right. That would. Yeah, right.

573
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:25,030
I thought of that as well. Thank you. Yeah.

574
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,600
And you know, I couldn't think of like a relevant statement to make.

575
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,520
But, you know, just the start of the pandemic, there was like a big focus on surface contamination,

576
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,110
right for virus transmission, and it was like Clorox wipes and wiped out everything.

577
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:47,320
And then I think it was, you know, I think Apple even put out guidance on like how to treat your Apple products right?

578
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:55,900
And Clorox went to was not the solution or I think it was alcohol wipes or with a friendly way to wipe your phone in your laptop and whatnot.

579
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:05,870
But yeah, it doesn't. It's not wiping away the damage or you just market newer products to sell that well.

580
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:09,610
My point, I think about it like so at the end of it,

581
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:14,470
that's really the struggle with a lot of products is that companies are not required

582
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:19,090
for the most part to tell you what's in like a couch or a mattress or anything.

583
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:27,320
Well, you know, we like the issue with privacy, right? But now, since there's been such an uproar about people as more companies are hardening

584
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,910
their pots and pans as like this is manufactured without us letter cadmium.

585
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:43,150
So companies. So in a way, the market is following it a little bit, but it has to have the notoriety that Fox got last like three years, right?

586
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:58,640
Well, that could be the policy like more clear and coherent and simple to understand, like lettering and warnings on those steps for insurance.

587
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,080
And we yes, we are. Thanks so much, everyone, for the great discussion.

588
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:21,960
Bravo to the group leader. Thank you so much. That's the business news on our card electronics because of cancer.

589
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,166
And like this one, like regular, you know, sorry, all.
