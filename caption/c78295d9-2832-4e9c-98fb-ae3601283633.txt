1
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,920
Hey, Melissa and Malcolm, pin you hear me? Fantastic.

2
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,260
Good afternoon. So I'm going to classroom that has all kinds of gadgetry going on tech wise.

3
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,150
We can see you and hear you. You can hear me and you'd be able to hear any of the students.

4
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,460
But I can't get the camera to Zoom to accept the classroom camera.

5
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:56,510
I could mess with it for a long time, but that's probably not the best news that everyone. No, not at all, not at all.

6
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,220
So folks are just gathering still in the classroom,

7
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:08,780
we'll give them maybe another minute or so and then we can go ahead and get started now, introduce you and so forth.

8
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:46,850
But I can give you the controls here, I'll make both give you a.

9
00:02:46,850 --> 00:03:04,810
Awesome. That's a whole.

10
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:21,600
It's your choice, actually what what do you find works best? Okay.

11
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:38,900
Yeah. I.

12
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:48,180
Right. Yeah. OK.

13
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,060
OK. We're I know you can't see anything, we're in a relatively small ish classroom.

14
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:03,060
And even though I can't get the camera to display on Zoom, we have a pretty high tech one of these old video camera audio systems,

15
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,190
which is really too bad that you can't see everyone because it is translocated to

16
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,250
where the voice is coming from and orient the camera right at the person speaking. It's pretty cool.

17
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,030
But I think we're going to be OK. I'll keep an eye out.

18
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:31,800
I'll keep an eye out for hands, going up for questions, or I'll just rudely interrupted you, right?

19
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,890
And apology. Apologies for the muffled sounds, we all have masks on, of course.

20
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:53,520
All right. So I would say, let's go ahead and get started. So, uh, perhaps not what you were expecting today, but the pandemic continues,

21
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,350
and our guest speakers who had intended to join us in person today have some quarantine issues going on so far.

22
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,970
As I'm aware, everyone's doing OK, but of course, following the protocol here,

23
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:15,480
so they've been so kind to join us virtually today and still be able to provide a presentation,

24
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,800
kind of a virtual tour around our university central power plant, which you're going to hear a ton about here in a few minutes.

25
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,920
But for those who maybe don't know what we're talking about,

26
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:34,260
this is if you walk out of space and head back to Observatory Street and kind of go around whatever dorm you choose,

27
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,700
you see kind of this smokestack and the other side of the athletic field.

28
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,200
And that's the university's natural power plant. It's a fantastic facility.

29
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,510
You're going to learn a ton more about it.

30
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:53,310
I'll give a quick intro and then I'll offer you the chance to kind of give a more detailed self introduction if you'd like.

31
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,050
So joining us today are Malcolm Tambling and Melissa Theodore.

32
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:12,890
And again, thank you so much for your willingness to run with the logistics here today.

33
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:28,930
Welcome to.

34
00:06:28,930 --> 00:07:11,010
All. I.

35
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:51,820
I had. And.

36
00:07:51,820 --> 00:08:53,300
And what you're. And I.

37
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:51,680
And. Right.

38
00:09:51,680 --> 00:11:17,400
I. Of.

39
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:27,390
Yeah, we can see the slide that you have a, you know, it's just it's Zoom.

40
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,440
So can you? Could he go to the next slide? I'll tell you the changes I can see.

41
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:53,510
Yep. So it just went to the. That's perfect.

42
00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:22,920
And. I.

43
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:40,410
Special. And.

44
00:12:40,410 --> 00:14:20,620
And. I was.

45
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:53,700
I know. And.

46
00:14:53,700 --> 00:16:12,330
Right. And.

47
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:46,880
It's. Her.

48
00:16:46,880 --> 00:17:34,070
And. I think it's.

49
00:17:34,070 --> 00:18:14,880
Well. And.

50
00:18:14,880 --> 00:19:14,300
I think. Well.

51
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:40,060
Okay. Oh.

52
00:19:40,060 --> 00:21:08,570
And. I.

53
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:44,340
If you take.

54
00:21:44,340 --> 00:22:31,030
I. But let me prompt both real quick here, does anybody have any questions so far?

55
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,350
I think we do have one, Josh. Go ahead. I think your voice will project OK. Oh yeah.

56
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:42,340
Can you guys hear me? Awesome. So I went to Michigan State and actually did a power plant expansion kind of a similar way.

57
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,260
I think it also was a gas turbine and it was to actually increase efficiency.

58
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:56,140
However, it was kind of an uproar on campus because some students first saw a permit for an increased amount of carbon emissions,

59
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,770
and that was the first thing they saw. And it wasn't communicated to the student body at first that it would end up being

60
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,630
a long term reduction and that there plan to move turbine to increase efficiency.

61
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,130
And so I guess I'm kind of curious of how do you balance transparency and being

62
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:26,470
open about what's going on and kind of just community input in the process.

63
00:23:26,470 --> 00:24:30,770
And. I.

64
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:54,170
And. They.

65
00:24:54,170 --> 00:26:02,540
And. And.

66
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:11,900
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

67
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:48,700
Well. Obviously.

68
00:26:48,700 --> 00:27:03,980
And. Thank you.

69
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:26,490
That sounds good, thanks. There.

70
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:46,260
And. And.

71
00:27:46,260 --> 00:28:09,320
And. You're.

72
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:55,240
Yeah. That's.

73
00:28:55,240 --> 00:30:00,470
And. And.

74
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:55,230
And. Yeah, we do have a question, Melissa.

75
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:26,730
Go ahead, Brigid. On the last slide, can you explain like the difference between eliminating carbon neutrality and net zero?

76
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:47,140
I. And.

77
00:31:47,140 --> 00:32:32,760
And. Our.

78
00:32:32,760 --> 00:33:33,540
Is it? It's.

79
00:33:33,540 --> 00:34:09,870
It's. I.

80
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:16,240
All right, thank you. And Malcolm, we do have another question.

81
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,550
So can you describe kind of where these sources of purchased energy are coming from currently or like

82
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:30,850
within the past few years and kind of where the goals are in terms of what sources for the next?

83
00:34:30,850 --> 00:35:26,490
Until twenty twenty five or twenty twenty or twenty four. I'm.

84
00:35:26,490 --> 00:36:01,200
It's also. It's full of magical.

85
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:57,470
Well. All.

86
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:09,680
Yes. Yes, thank you. Many others before we move on.

87
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:25,910
All right, I think we're all set for now. And.

88
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:39,730
Know. Know.

89
00:37:39,730 --> 00:38:09,790
Actually. And I am.

90
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:33,570
And. And.

91
00:38:33,570 --> 00:39:06,400
I. I.

92
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:27,770
And. And.

93
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:35,200
There. And I.

94
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:46,990
Just. And.

95
00:39:46,990 --> 00:40:13,690
And it's. Have.

96
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:39,590
I. I.

97
00:40:39,590 --> 00:41:09,860
I. And. Am.

98
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:45,750
And. I.

99
00:41:45,750 --> 00:42:03,850
I. All right.

100
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:41,440
I. And.

101
00:42:41,440 --> 00:43:33,050
Yeah. But.

102
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:40,550
Any questions? Yes, we have one. So I guess I have a question related to efficiency and so on.

103
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:45,410
There's the grievance paradox, which as efficiency increases, consumption also increases.

104
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:51,320
And so I guess I'm kind of curious, especially in regards to like ADT or a for profit company.

105
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,300
How do you really try to have a profit incentive to sell more energy?

106
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,390
How do you really make sure that the efficiency gains actually reduce costs?

107
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:16,590
I was kind of curious of how how good is energy efficiency in hindsight and all those factors?

108
00:44:16,590 --> 00:45:20,540
For instance, it's always more than to.

109
00:45:20,540 --> 00:46:24,030
Think. This is.

110
00:46:24,030 --> 00:47:02,240
The My.

111
00:47:02,240 --> 00:48:16,560
Mr. And that.

112
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:42,120
And. That's.

113
00:48:42,120 --> 00:49:11,270
Is. I think this.

114
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:29,710
Often, thank you. I think that was it.

115
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:45,100
It's. And.

116
00:49:45,100 --> 00:50:43,180
It's not hard. And.

117
00:50:43,180 --> 00:51:37,110
That's. I have.

118
00:51:37,110 --> 00:52:44,000
Well. And.

119
00:52:44,000 --> 00:53:03,510
And. And.

120
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:40,470
Well. All.

121
00:53:40,470 --> 00:54:06,820
Yeah. Anymore.

122
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,960
It's a really quick question.

123
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:15,880
The photo, the image is great just to give it some physical dimension perspective since we're not actually in the power plant right now.

124
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,600
What would be your relative, you know, rough physical dimensions.

125
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:40,380
Similarly, for one of the boilers, that's that's over at the CFPB.

126
00:54:40,380 --> 00:56:46,470
Well. Think.

127
00:56:46,470 --> 00:57:01,280
All right, great, thank you so much for that. It's.

128
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:28,860
And. And.

129
00:57:28,860 --> 00:59:14,570
And. What would happen if people.

130
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:54,510
And. So.

131
00:59:54,510 --> 01:00:20,030
And. I.

132
01:00:20,030 --> 01:01:19,020
And. They have.

133
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:41,440
And they.

134
01:01:41,440 --> 01:02:07,710
I have. Again and again for.

135
01:02:07,710 --> 01:03:12,180
And. And.

136
01:03:12,180 --> 01:04:01,520
Yes. I.

137
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:38,410
I don't know. Well.

138
01:04:38,410 --> 01:05:23,290
I think. All of.

139
01:05:23,290 --> 01:06:13,680
And. And.

140
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:29,540
And. OK.

141
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:47,940
And. And.

142
01:06:47,940 --> 01:07:09,270
Fantastic, thank you so much, Melissa and Malcolm, do you folks have questions and it can be about anything at this point?

143
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:18,740
I'm seeing a couple of hands go up. Let's start in the back and then we'll move to the front.

144
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:23,590
You really did. Absolutely. Yeah, that one general question.

145
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,740
You tell us which building or which regional campus consume the most energy.

146
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:37,400
Overall, the whole.

147
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:53,620
Rich region or building whatever specificity you might know about.

148
01:07:53,620 --> 01:08:57,310
A special. I mean.

149
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:57,680
And. And.

150
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:40,410
I have. I haven't.

151
01:10:40,410 --> 01:11:04,810
Yes. So.

152
01:11:04,810 --> 01:12:04,830
I. Of all the.

153
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:46,150
Yes. But.

154
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,480
And I think we have another one, another question. Yeah.

155
01:12:49,480 --> 01:13:18,170
So early in the pandemic, when candidates like shut down and you still had to supply steam the hospital, did that affect your efficiency greatly?

156
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:51,090
And. All right.

157
01:13:51,090 --> 01:14:47,480
You. Whole.

158
01:14:47,480 --> 01:15:02,470
I. OK, thank you.

159
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:23,140
Any other questions that folks have? Yes.

160
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:37,020
Yes. And.

161
01:15:37,020 --> 01:16:17,470
And. For.

162
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:41,660
For. The.

163
01:16:41,660 --> 01:17:36,070
The form of.

164
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:50,630
All right.

165
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,180
And they see one hand up.

166
01:17:53,180 --> 01:18:01,640
I guess I not know how optimistic or pessimistic are you in the usage of batteries for making this transition, because I know that's a huge,

167
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:52,560
huge part of the problem in energy storage and obviously batteries themselves have a carbon footprint along with renewables.

168
01:18:52,560 --> 01:19:13,690
And. And I hope you will.

169
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:49,960
It's. That's.

170
01:19:49,960 --> 01:20:14,810
Home before. That's.

171
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:57,410
Often. All.

172
01:20:57,410 --> 01:21:32,790
That's. And.

173
01:21:32,790 --> 01:22:03,410
Most of the people.

174
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:23,100
And. Well.

175
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:47,900
Thank you. And the other questions.

176
01:22:47,900 --> 01:23:07,640
And. And that sounds good.

177
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,900
Well, hey, Malcolm and Melissa, thanks again, so much to you both.

178
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:19,040
And with the last minute wrench thrown in with the logistics here for going with it, I think it worked really well.

179
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:28,040
Since you can't see us, I'm going to encourage some applause. Thank you so much.

180
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:34,100
I hope your whatever managing quarantine, you imagine you're not the only one.

181
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:39,380
You know, all of us here in the room of on a week by week basis are just kind of rolling with it,

182
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:44,490
and hopefully everyone stays healthy and safe and hope to see you in person soon.

183
01:23:44,490 --> 01:24:01,060
You mentioned the future opportunity for a tour, and I can't wait. Thanks so much for my.

184
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:07,630
All right, so how about if we do a quick five minute break? We're way over that, so it's like two two.

185
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:17,960
Let's come back at 2:27 and we'll try to be patient with the few minutes that we have left in the class session.

186
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,090
And it can someone in in the back as you go off with the light switch to get those lights second.

187
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:34,191
Thank you so much, Arianna. And.
