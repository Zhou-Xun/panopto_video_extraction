1
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,782
Vaccination is a major public
health achievement, yet

2
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,900
not all individuals can be vaccinated.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,740
However, luckily because of herd immunity,

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,470
individuals who are not vaccinated can
still be protected against pathogens.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,630
Herd immunity is a phenomenon
that demonstrates

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,600
that when we have large groups of
individuals who are vaccinated,

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
in other words the herd, transmission
of the pathogen will decrease.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,510
And thus, individuals that are
unvaccinated will also be less likely to

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:44,050
be infected with that pathogen despite the
fact that they are in fact susceptible.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,075
To demonstrate this fundamental
concept in public health,

11
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:49,520
let's looks at this schematic.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,120
First, assume everyone in a population
that is shown here is healthy,

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,262
those individuals are shown in dark blue.

14
00:00:56,262 --> 00:01:00,500
And then let's consider the case in
which one individual is entering

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,740
into the population who is contagious with
a given disease, they are shown in green.

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,630
If no one in the population is
immunized against that pathogen,

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,120
that one contagious person introducing
the pathogen into the population

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,430
will induce high levels of transmission
throughout the population.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
These levels of transmission will
occur because all of the individuals

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,750
in the population are susceptible
to that pathogen.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,930
And the population then
quickly becomes infected and

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,060
contagious to other
individuals in the population.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,660
Let's assume instead, however,

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,990
that the population now has several
individuals that are immunized.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,610
Those individuals are shown
in orange in this schematic.

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,700
These individuals are not susceptible to
infection with the pathogen because they

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,100
are immunized.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,680
And so
not only can they not become ill but

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,410
they cannot transmit the pathogen
even if they encounter it.

30
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,610
However, we see in this schematic that
there are few vaccinated individuals

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,310
in the population.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,870
There are still many individuals,
in fact, that are susceptible, and

33
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,230
so can transmit the pathogen when they
receive it from the contagious individual.

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,596
So we do see, in fact,
that many individuals become ill,

35
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:21,729
except those who are vaccinated.

36
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's assume now instead a third scenario.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,780
The majority of the population is
vaccinated against the pathogen.

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,770
In this case,
even though there is a contagious person

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,280
introduced into the population, there is
little transmission of that pathogen,

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,340
because most individuals
are vaccinated and

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,890
thus do not transmit it to
the non-vaccinated individuals.

42
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,618
This phenomena is called herd immunity.

43
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:54,378
Understanding and predicting levels
of vaccination needed to achieve herd

44
00:02:54,378 --> 00:03:00,350
immunity are dependent on the R0, or
the reproduction number of the pathogen.

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,840
This number is critical in our
planning for public health campaigns

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,415
because we do understand that not all
individuals are able to be vaccinated.

47
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:13,740
R0 is how many people in
unprotected population,

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,390
one infected person can
pass the disease to.

49
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,470
So for example if the R0 not is high,

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,770
the pathogen is easier to transmit and
so more susceptible individuals

51
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,130
may become infected when they
are exposed to that infected person.

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,450
Based upon this R0 we can
calculate the vaccination coverage

53
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,790
needed to achieve herd immunity.

54
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,570
This diagram here shows us the R0 for
several different diseases, and

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,940
the corresponding vaccination coverage
required to achieve herd immunity for

56
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,630
those diseases.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,500
We see that the R0 from measles is
approximately 12, and so we require

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,655
greater than 90% vaccination coverage for
measles to achieve herd immunity.

59
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:04,100
For influenza A,
the R0 is between two and three, so

60
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,830
the herd immunity threshold is just over
30% of required vaccination coverage,

61
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,800
and we see that rubella
is somewhere in between.

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,860
This information on the reproductive
number is available for

63
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,030
many different infectious diseases,
and helps guide our goals and

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,968
our planning for vaccination campaigns.

65
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:27,945
Questions about herd immunity
are incredibly relevant because we see

66
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:31,900
that childhood vaccination rates
are decreasing nationwide.

67
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,990
But at the state of Michigan where we
are right now is particularly affected.

68
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,810
Although vaccination is required for
children entered school in the state of

69
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,520
Michigan, parents or
guardians may request a waiver for

70
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,786
medical reasons or
because of religious or other exemptions.

71
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:57,370
In 2013-2014, almost 6% of children in the
state of Michigan had vaccination waivers.

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,270
However, we see from this figure
that the waiver percent is higher in

73
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,698
Southeast Michigan where
we are here in Ann Arbor.

74
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:09,206
Up to 15% of children in
the Southeast Michigan area had

75
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,875
requested vaccination waivers.

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,982
And if you think back to our vaccination
coverage necessary to achieve

77
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,905
herd immunity for
certain infectious diseases,

78
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:23,219
it's clear that we may be very much in
danger of not achieving that level of

79
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:29,000
vaccination coverage needed to protect
those individuals in our population.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,230
In this module, we reviewed
the differences between active and

81
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,920
passive immunity.

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,610
Active immunity is that which is
produced within an individual,

83
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,580
the individual them-self
initiates an immune response.

84
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,680
This type of active immunity can be
triggered through exposure to natural

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,890
pathogens in the environment or

86
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,360
it can be triggered by artificial exposure
to those pathogens through vaccines.

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,450
Passive immunity is when
the immune response is

88
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,530
given to an individual through
the transfer of pre-formed antibodies.

89
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,460
So the individual them-self does not
initiate that immune response, but they

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,940
are able to respond given the antibodies
that they have been transferred.

91
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,060
In this module, we also reviewed
different types of vaccines,

92
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,130
which are part of our
active immune capabilities.

93
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,650
Different vaccines that
we reviewed include live,

94
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,530
as well as inactivated vaccines.

95
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,100
And because vaccines are so
critical to our immune capabilities and

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,590
the ways in which public health has really
harnessed the power of understanding.

97
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,150
Ways in which immune function works to
improve health at the individual and

98
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,790
the population level.

99
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,800
We reviewed herd immunity, a fundamental
concept in terms of understanding

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,790
required vaccination coverage for
different types of diseases.

101
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,220
And so as you are entering
the world of public health, and

102
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,850
particularly epidemiology,
this is a classic example of how these

103
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,065
fundamental basic biology concepts
are critical to developing

104
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:02,722
large-scale interventions that
are of public health importance.
