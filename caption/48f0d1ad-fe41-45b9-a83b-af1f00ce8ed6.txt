1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,750
Same as mine. And then it was like.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,330
Pretty. Who's she?

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:31,820
So I see that everybody knows everybody. But it's funny you said three questions about that 23 shows.

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,779
Okay. So so you probably know that exact example.

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:48,000
One will be posted today after the process. And so someone can just go like take a look, you know, you can't see there's something wrong.

6
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,740
So you have a week to complete that. It's due next Thursday before class to keep yourself time to work on it.

7
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,629
Most of the problems we are similar to what we did in the primary process pieces,

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:14,070
but just make sure to give yourself time to work through it and don't remember not to discuss that between yourselves.

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,170
If you have any questions, email me and I'll get back to you in 24 hours or less.

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,000
And my questions about the exam? Yes.

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,020
Are you going to post the answer? Key for problems at three at times, yes.

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,940
Yeah. So I'll I'll do that. I'll, I'll post everything that you might need.

13
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,259
So we have some practice problems from today because I think it just important there's a question on that on the exam.

14
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:50,999
So I'll post the practice move to the practice problems the Yes three and then please is the quiz for answers.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,400
We'll go through them in custody and outsource them. Questions.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,889
Okay. So today we'll talk about Lincoln's equilibrium.

17
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,990
And that would be, as I said, we'll see him.

18
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,510
And then starting next week, we would move to something slightly less quantitative.

19
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:26,770
So we'll be doing newborn screening. So the format will shift slightly and we do not have prerecorded lectures for you to watch.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:36,850
No quiz, no quiz for next week. So all that is required is that you do those two readings and it's important that everyone does those two readings.

21
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:44,710
So so for next week, you just have to work on the exam, do those two readings for week six.

22
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,960
Okay. So you see this squeeze.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,970
Okay, so we could just equilibrium, you know, sort of watch the videos that might be from last week.

24
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,959
Last week or early this week, there was a quiz.

25
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:17,650
So we'll go over over some of the prerecorded lectures, kind of like look to see if you have any questions completely over them.

26
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:25,780
There's a new set of slides, but nothing. So something like a new lecture that will go over the leading genetic association studies.

27
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,970
And then for the math part of the lecture, I have the practice problem sets for people, for them for.

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:04:01,479
Any questions on the ME before you start from from watching the few reported lectures or the quiz or oh so oh well briefly over LTE.

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:09,790
So probably the easiest way to think about LTE is the correlation between two between two

30
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:18,340
wheels that are at different clubs that are located nearby and certain genomic features.

31
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,660
So it's somewhat similar to what we talked about in terms of linkage.

32
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,630
But the big difference is that in as in LTE, we're talking about yields.

33
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,650
So specificity of the yields.

34
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:42,220
And then the biggest difference that you need to be mindful of is that LTE we're talking about population levels versus linkage.

35
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,510
And linkage analysis is more restricted to families.

36
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,629
We're looking within pedigrees across generations and we're looking at linkage between two genetic locations.

37
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:03,400
So we don't really matter when we're whenever we talk about linkage versus linkage, just equilibrium,

38
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,080
which is a more of a population concept where we describe whether wheels are correlated in a certain genomic region,

39
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,930
and that can have some implications on how we do association studies.

40
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,829
It can be helpful for us as we will talk about in terms of kind of filling in

41
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,860
the blanks because we know that most people have those to alias correlated.

42
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,580
So if I know a person has the alias, look at this map.

43
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,400
And based on reference reference genomes, as you probably watch in the lecture,

44
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:48,550
I'm able to predict that they probably have this at a certain genomic and another snap nearby.

45
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,740
So so we'll talk about those as we go through the slides.

46
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,729
And we do have a weak association like genetic association studies.

47
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:07,030
So this is just kind of a brief overview of the difference between linkage studies that

48
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:15,009
are best at detecting rare emails that have large effect sizes and that and mostly

49
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:21,010
between in families and genetic association studies that are best for common variants

50
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,979
that have smaller effect sizes and are associated with cognitive complex disease.

51
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:35,890
So think hypertension and kidney disease, and these are usually caused by many,

52
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:46,150
many illegal's that are common and each of them has a small effect size on your disease or on your chain of interest versus things like.

53
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,520
Like Mendelian Mendelian diseases that we talked about earlier,

54
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:05,669
Huntington's and dwarfism that are usually caused by a specific l'oeil that has a strong

55
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:12,810
impact on the few few leaves that have strong effect on the outcome of age or the disease.

56
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,879
So as we move to genetic association studies,

57
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,180
it's important to know that if we could look across the genome and have information on every single snip,

58
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,740
then then we would be able to test all those appeals or all those snips and test their association with disease.

59
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,430
But for the last and we can now do that with sequence data so we actually have the full read of the genome.

60
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:55,710
But for all that, the last decade or so, we would be only able we would only have information on certain markers of certain snips.

61
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:06,690
Snips, you can call them that. We hypothesize that they could be linked to the to this plot.

62
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:17,280
So we have information on certain text snips that we think that they are associated with the actual functional mutation causing the disease.

63
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,630
And then we look at the association between what we have measured.

64
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:31,980
So a genetic marker and a disease, and we assume this based on linkage, disequilibrium, disequilibrium that they are associated or inherited together.

65
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:44,659
Is that clear? And those genetic markers are kind of chosen to represent those old blocks.

66
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,190
That sense, I think it's in part three of the prerecorded lectures.

67
00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:03,170
So whenever I say elderly, that means correlation so as to loci or to allow yields are in l d that means they are correlated.

68
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,459
If they are in linkage equilibrium. That means it's similar to what we talked about in linkage that they are segregating

69
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:17,420
separately like they can be broken apart by recombination and inheritance separately.

70
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,500
It doesn't matter.

71
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:33,200
They're not like being kind of inherited together and lda is is the extent of d reflects population history and distance between markers.

72
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,780
So distance between markers is kind of like what we talked about theta, like how close they are together,

73
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,299
how likely they are to be separated, due recombination and population history.

74
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:55,340
If you recall when we talked about African ancestry and kind of variation where older populations will have more time to have variation

75
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:09,800
kind of move down the ancestry kind of so biggest factor in this is just showing a list of factors affecting linkage disequilibrium.

76
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,560
The biggest factor is recombination, which breaks up associations.

77
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:26,909
And this is showing what kind of framework we apply in a device that is our genetic associations.

78
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,370
That is where we might find an association between a marker and a disease.

79
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,250
This marker might not be might not be necessarily causative.

80
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,970
It might not be what is causing new disease of interest. It might be just correlated with it or an LDA with that.

81
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:54,330
So more studies like when they have a finding, they would look at nearby regions and look at LDA blocks, 24 blocks to kind of pinpoint the.

82
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,490
Because it ends on a positive note.

83
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:15,220
Within the system or two. So. So we talked about what is L.D. is like a measure of correlation between two wheels.

84
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,500
And then this the second part of the slides introduces how we can measure Audi.

85
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,870
So measures of linkage, disequilibrium.

86
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:35,590
And then the recorded lectures talk about kind of draws the parallel between LDA and how do one improve this equilibrium.

87
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,010
So both are population based concepts. So that's kind of similarity.

88
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:50,109
But hardly one broken member that we are trying to look at the frequency of the genotypes

89
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:58,870
based on the frequency of the based on the frequencies and and linkage disequilibrium.

90
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,990
We're looking at haplotypes instead of genotypes.

91
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:11,170
And similar to what we did in Hardy Weinberg, we, we would have observed and then expected and.

92
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:21,009
So expected is based on is based on independent independent probabilities.

93
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:32,819
So probability of a times for ability of B is equal to P eight times B So if if two areas are independent so they are being inherited separately,

94
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:42,540
then we would assume that this equation would hold. But so this this this equation would hold.

95
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,090
But when that doesn't hold, then that's when you would have this equilibrium.

96
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:04,160
So. So basically, if you have the frequency of the eight of the big eight at this first name and then the frequency at the B,

97
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,550
then the haplotype frequency of A and B is simply a product of A and B.

98
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,590
So that's the expected based on assuming independence between the A and B loci.

99
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:27,990
Is that to any questions? Okay.

100
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,650
So if we look at dele then can.

101
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:48,790
So then the D here, which is one measure of disequilibrium coefficient is the the difference between the expected versus the minus the observed.

102
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,070
So this is the one measure of disequilibrium coefficient.

103
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:03,640
So D. But as you've probably learned from watching the recording D, it's kind of hard to interpret,

104
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,730
doesn't have a sign, and then it shows that it depends on the little frequencies.

105
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:21,220
So there are two other measures that are commonly used and reported in the literature D Prime, where the absolute value of D prime and R squared.

106
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,040
These are somewhat frequency normalized.

107
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:32,079
So the frequency of the of the aliens that we're talking about doesn't really affect affect at least the R squared.

108
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:41,530
The D prime school is slightly affected. And we'll go over the math of this of how to calculate d prime.

109
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:49,600
You have two scenarios basically depending on the first D that we calculated the difference between the expected and the observed.

110
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,460
And then if it's less than zero, then you would choose the minimum of those two terms.

111
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,540
If it's larger, then you,

112
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:13,690
you you look at two different terms and then a D prime of minus one or one implies that one potential haplotype was not observed.

113
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:22,660
So if we look back at this, so if you have two haplotypes, so you have this,

114
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:32,200
this locus that could have either and C and then this Clovis that can have the glial, you can have a mutation that changes the G.

115
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,370
So here you have like to have some types of member haplotypes.

116
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,480
It's a combination of SNPs along the same strand.

117
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,600
So a G haplotypes, CG haplotype.

118
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,050
And then you can have a mutation that introduces a mutation here.

119
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,060
So you have a new sort of haplotype.

120
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,660
And then by recombination you can have a mix where you also have another haplotype.

121
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:07,840
So this is this, this, so in this situation we have the four possible haplotypes that you could have for four, two loci.

122
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:25,930
And then. So prime is is a measure of how how much those two two elites are correlated or are kind of inherited together.

123
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,920
And this this shows how that is distributed along the chromosome.

124
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,070
So as you can see here,

125
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:46,540
we do have this this plot shows but based on the D prime that a lot of the snips are kind of correlated

126
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,710
or inherited or being passed down together by a member that the prime is not a perfect measure of that.

127
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:03,960
It is whenever you have one or a or a minus one that could be a result of your frequencies being the minor,

128
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,050
a little frequency of one being low or being fair.

129
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,540
So that's when like in this scenario here you have a new mutation.

130
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:24,520
So this haplotype didn't have time just to kind of recombine or it didn't have time to kind of spread if you want.

131
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:34,420
So that's when you would observe three haplotypes versus when they are not really linked and they are really kind of recombining.

132
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,290
And that's when you would observe all four haplotypes.

133
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,010
And then r squared is. This is the formula for R squared.

134
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,410
It's kind of a little more intuitive. So you probably all are somewhat familiar with the correlation coefficient.

135
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,739
So. So this ranges from 1 to 0 one being that they are identical information.

136
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,170
So really similar information between those two appeals.

137
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,450
And this is not affected by any frequency as as much as D prime.

138
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,160
So if we look at the same genetic region,

139
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:29,200
we can see that a lot less labels are showing correlation based on R squared because they aren't it's not affected by these sequences.

140
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:39,310
And the closer business together, the closer the bigger the R squared is.

141
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:50,250
Okay. Then this is just putting information from the deep pride or the absolute deep pride in our square together.

142
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,740
When you have deep crime, absolutely crime high and our square is high,

143
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:04,470
then that indicates tendency towards presence of two haplotypes and similar frequencies of the two loci.

144
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:17,700
And then if prime is high R squared this low, then we're looking at a scenario where we have three haplotypes, one being young.

145
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:26,910
So remember that mutation that kind of happened recently and then large differences in other sequences which is driving the D prime high.

146
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:37,680
So whenever you have differences in the other frequencies, that's when you have G Prime High in addition to possibly being correlated as we see here.

147
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,160
And then if D prime is low, R-squared is low, then they are not correlated.

148
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,920
They're still there's recombination happening and you have all four haplotypes.

149
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:57,060
They're kind of randomly coupled. They're not correlated. Okay.

150
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:07,780
This is just showing these like loaded locks or so loaded slots.

151
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,430
So our square, deep prime. So if you want to, you know, the R squared between this this is a snap.

152
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,470
Another snap. Then you would look at like the value here.

153
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,810
So these two like the first and the third, they have an R squared of one.

154
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,260
All right. So it's actually very small. This is like maybe 2.1 or something.

155
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:39,310
But the darker they are, the the shading, then the the more uncorrelated they are typically.

156
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,440
So and this is the same for the prime.

157
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:58,750
So one last thing for for this class is an equation showing how linkage this equilibrium decays over time.

158
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:07,270
So this is the factor of theta. So again, how much recombination is happening and separating them and time.

159
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,559
So like how many generations?

160
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:22,420
Because the more generations you have, the more likely that two loci would be kind of separated by being combination of the two wheels and of course

161
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:30,520
the factor of the initial l d coefficient or the initial how much disequilibrium you had to start with.

162
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:42,920
Mm hmm. So this is some networking site on.

163
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,270
Then you talk about this last piece is kind of introducing the idea of haplotype blog.

164
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,549
So we know that certain labels are being inherited together and we have a measure

165
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:08,440
of how much they are correlated or how much they are inherited together.

166
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:15,770
Then we can kind of create this map of LDL blocks and recombination hotspots.

167
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,310
So so this is like a chromosome, this is the centromere.

168
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:28,659
And then we can see that there are certain genomic regions that are likely to be

169
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,300
inherited together and then certain regions that we could have recombination.

170
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,340
And then this is just showing how LG locks can look across on a chromosome.

171
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,230
The top part is the R squared, bottom part is the D prime.

172
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,830
And then remember the darker is indication of association.

173
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:06,460
So we can see here that we kind of have two logs that are kind of passed along, like doing meiosis passed together.

174
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,300
So that's kind of a lot. This is a clock. And this part here is where you could have recombination.

175
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:30,440
And then this. This here shows how we can make use of this information.

176
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:42,560
So. So this is this is showing like l d blocks on certain genomic regions of chromosome five so we can break down that region into LDA blocks.

177
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:56,780
So these are the blocks, blocks one through 11. And the idea is that you can have almost no variation within that block except for the haplotype.

178
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,860
So let's look at block seven. You have four different haplotypes, four possible options.

179
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,770
So an individual can be either I have this this one or one of those fours.

180
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:19,040
And if I'm looking to to to get the wheels for this genomic region, then just by getting one of those L yields.

181
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:27,130
One or two, maybe then I'm able to fill in the reminder of the of the haplotype block.

182
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,180
Is that fair or not? So let's see,

183
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:45,360
let's look at this block seven so individuals can have like on the same this first step so

184
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:54,450
cc cc and then by picking a few markers like let's say I think the C maybe this one here,

185
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:04,889
the GHG, those two snaps would be representing, would be representing the whole variation across this whole leap log.

186
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:14,580
So like I have few letters and then just by kind of guessing, oh, this person has G here, then they're more likely to have CC log of law.

187
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:24,540
This, this plot here kind of shows it better. So assuming that these are haplotypes, these four are haplotypes.

188
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:34,350
Just by looking at those two steps, we're able to kind of fill in the remainder of the illegals at this haplotype log.

189
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:46,320
So if a person has let's see, yellow, blue, blue, yellow, then that's kind of a unique variation that I'm able to fill in the helpful from type block.

190
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:58,939
That. Clear. What's up, Major O'Neill?

191
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,610
And I'm like, you know, so. So I remember when we first talked about Major League.

192
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,780
Minor League, that's like based on the frequencies.

193
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:15,920
And so the frequency you see, this is just showing the difference between those two deals I think could be major or minor.

194
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:40,880
There's good. So I think it's like kind of using two steps, one or two steps to kind of capture all the variation within the block.

195
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:51,930
Like, if I know that a person has at snip one, snip one and two has yellow at snip one,

196
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:58,530
blue adds two, then that's kind of a representation of all the variation within that block.

197
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,960
If they are blue blue, then the remainder of the snaps or the reels in that block would look like this.

198
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,880
And then the same for the other two scenarios.

199
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:20,900
And we use that information like instead of having to genotype all the haplotype, all the block here,

200
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:29,180
we're just going to genotype step one and step two and fill in the information for the block.

201
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,640
I mean, it's going to come with certain errors, but that's what that's what genetic studies do.

202
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:43,249
We would genotype certain markers and then say, oh, this marker is in this block.

203
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:52,909
And we have based on the reference panels, which I talked about recently and after that, after the slides based on the reference panels,

204
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:58,700
then I would know that the variation along that haplotype log would look like this,

205
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,560
this, this, and I'm able to fill in the labels for that haplotype block.

206
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:16,680
So the last part talks about. Reference panels that we use to kind of identify those haplotype locks.

207
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:30,120
And that kind of improved as the technology got better and we're able to sequence or genotype more and more people.

208
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:42,600
So the first the one of the first ones was the have not phase two was just based on to 70 individuals, somewhat limited representation.

209
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:51,270
And then so we found out that just looking at 500,000 tech snips,

210
00:28:51,690 --> 00:29:00,960
it would be able to capture most of the common variants and in the European, Japanese and the Chinese population.

211
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:12,010
And then we needed almost double that for to capture variations and Africans remember they are ancestry older there's more

212
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:22,049
the the lady blocks had more time to kind of break apart so you would need more text snips to capture those old blocks.

213
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:29,280
They are smaller in size than what you would see in more newer populations.

214
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:37,650
So you would need more text themes to kind of truly capture the variation in Africans and individuals of African ancestry.

215
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:48,830
And then the thousand genome project which has sequencing technology.

216
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:59,760
So we're actually looking we having every single breed and it's representative of it includes 2500 people.

217
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:08,130
And as you can see now, we have I think the most recent one is based on top methods,

218
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:18,149
which is so it's basically information based on more than 100,000 people and they have overrepresentation of minorities.

219
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,860
So so it's kind of like having more.

220
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:32,060
Detailed view of the genome based on those one recent reference panels.

221
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,390
Okay. Any questions on that? No.

222
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,490
Okay. So a few short slides.

223
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:52,620
Now, this was not part of recordings. And then we would work on the problems that.

224
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,530
So we all talk about empty and generic associations.

225
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,270
That is how we kind of need to take that into account.

226
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,940
So as I said, whenever we're doing genetic association studies,

227
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:16,590
if we can test every single genetic variant and look at its association, that would be a direct approach.

228
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:25,350
So I'm like, now we can maybe do that, but in most cases we apply an indirect approach where we are testing specific

229
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:33,270
markers and looking at the association with having a disease or a certain outcome.

230
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:43,290
And then we we pick those markers to be so correlated with nearby genetic alleles

231
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:50,370
nearby so that we are kind of capturing the variation in that LDA block.

232
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,500
So this is what we just talked about and we saw that in the previous slide now.

233
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:10,230
So reasons why we might have a little correlation within a sample of people, it could be true linkage, disequilibrium.

234
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,850
So you can have a mutation and then those two ALS are kind of inherited together.

235
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:24,500
They are. They're in close proximity and they are just through the A.T.

236
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,530
Now, another reason that we could have LDA is due to population substructure.

237
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,650
And that could happen. You can think about it as two way.

238
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:44,340
So population stratification is that when you have two distinct subpopulations that you are analyzing together.

239
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,080
So, say analyzing African-Americans and European-Americans together.

240
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:56,010
So you have those two populations in your sample and you're analyzing them together without adjusting

241
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:03,479
for the fact that they come from different populations and you're analyzing them together.

242
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,230
And in that case, you might see that you have LDA between emails or a little correlations.

243
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:19,389
Okay. And then admixture is that is sort of when you have to find in populations

244
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,970
who have interbred and you have an individual who has genetic material from.

245
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,230
I don't know, like Colombian.

246
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:39,049
They could have genetic materials from Africans, from European, from the native ancestry, and then this person would have admixture.

247
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:46,160
So their genetic makeup is composed of different genetic material from different populations.

248
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:57,409
So. So population stratification happens due to nonrandom meaning.

249
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:06,480
So you have kind of certain populations feeding together and that could cause at least frequencies to drift apart.

250
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,640
So think about how we talked African-American Africans leaving the African,

251
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:23,090
some people from African out of African ancestry, leaving the African continent and moving to European regions.

252
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:29,390
And those two populations would drift apart in terms of aliens frequencies.

253
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,319
So that could be random, like not due to selection or not due to specific reason,

254
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,470
but they would just have nonrandom meaning and the alien frequencies would drift apart.

255
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,850
So the figure here shows like for one snip.

256
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,470
So this is how we do you know that snips or s number.

257
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,430
And then in Europeans and Africans we can have either in Europeans we could have the T or the C and

258
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:05,959
then in Africans we could have the C elite or the T alone and the minor aliens and the is different,

259
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,470
although the frequency is the same. So it's about 45.

260
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,740
So there's the how the buzz cut off of the frequencies is similar,

261
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:25,630
but these people could have a C Africans are have the T as the minor Leo and that could not be related to anything,

262
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:32,270
could be just how kind of alien frequencies drifted apart by random.

263
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:42,530
Now, the problem is that when you do a study and you do not take that into account, that could lead to false associations.

264
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:51,540
Watch the example here kind of shows in using some math so.

265
00:35:51,790 --> 00:36:03,600
So if we have one population with and we're looking at two two steps and we're looking at the haplotype we are given,

266
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,050
these are the haplotype frequencies. So the probability of having a haplotype is point one.

267
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,310
The big A, small B point or nine and so on.

268
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:22,620
And then and we have population B with different haplotype frequencies.

269
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:35,800
Okay. And then if we do the the least frequencies for each for each of those elements, so big A, big B and then the same here.

270
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,980
I remember we said about we talked about how the observed versus the expected.

271
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,850
So if we do, let's do the math.

272
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,370
So if we're doing that, at least the haplotype frequencies based on the aliens frequencies.

273
00:36:54,370 --> 00:37:02,170
So the probability of a times, the probability of B would be 0.9 times .99.

274
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:08,800
And that would be point a point. Well, this this population is in link with linkage equilibrium.

275
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:15,910
We do not have a difference between the observed, which is the point h one and the predicted,

276
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:21,520
based on assuming that the A and B are being inherited independently.

277
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,850
So point eight. 1.81. That's near.

278
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,460
So that maybe that measure of linkage, just equilibrium is zero.

279
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:46,700
Okay. And then the same four population two based on what we observed before.

280
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,040
And then point two times 22 is also .04.

281
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,520
So there is no disequilibrium. So the A and B are.

282
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,020
I randomly segregating. They are not correlated.

283
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,820
Okay. So this is just a given scenario.

284
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,480
And then if I'm doing a study and I sample 500 people from each population.

285
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,730
So these two populations, for some reason, they have different illness frequencies.

286
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,930
It's not related to anything. It's just random.

287
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:32,830
But I go ahead and sample 500 people from here, 500 people from here not paying attention that they come from different populations.

288
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,710
Um, and then this.

289
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,930
So we have total thousand haplotypes. Remember, because you would have two copies.

290
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,980
And then we calculate the expected relative frequencies based on the aliens frequencies.

291
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,419
And here the aliens frequencies since we sampled 500 people from each would be just an average of those populations.

292
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,990
So 0.9 times plus point two divided by two.

293
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:11,940
So then the less frequencies would be .55 for the big A, and then this is one minus the big and the same for.

294
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,310
For me, it's just an average from the two populations. So I got the aliens frequencies.

295
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,450
Okay. And then I'm going to measure the disequilibrium.

296
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:33,680
So. So I observed 850 people or 850 haplotypes.

297
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:48,850
With that big A? Big B. So 850 divided by 2000, and then this is the expected relative frequency.

298
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,620
So this is observed minus expected 2.3025.

299
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,710
And you can see that just by analyzing those two populations together,

300
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:09,190
you end up with G being not zero anymore, which is the situation you had before.

301
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:29,350
Right. So clear. And the reason we have to worry about that is that so underlying population structure,

302
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:37,520
so here we didn't have to live between that and B we establish that they were not correlated between in population one and two.

303
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,800
But when we analyzed them together like those two populations together,

304
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:53,930
then we did end up with a situation where we had LTE where it looked like they are correlated just because we actually have population stratification.

305
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,030
I think this exaggerated example is kind of helpful.

306
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:06,290
Helpful. So if an illegal occurs only in population to make think about that scenario and then any

307
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:11,780
trait that has a higher prevalence in population two will look to be associated with this.

308
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:21,910
Elio. So it basically can lead to false positives like you could have.

309
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,170
You could make a conclusion that like let's say that A is actually.

310
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:44,530
Think. Let me see. I think in my example of how. So you're going to basically see an association.

311
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:50,320
That is not true. It is just based on the differences in the frequencies between those.

312
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,730
So it's like you matching difference in aliens frequencies, difference in disease prevalence, and you're kind of like putting them together.

313
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:04,300
And then you would end up saying, Oh, I see a difference in other frequencies here and different frequencies prevalence.

314
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:12,210
They are related. And so I'm going to say that this is what is causing the disease, but that's not really true.

315
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:32,030
Set clear any questions? So it's a I don't know if you have epidemiology backgrounds like a confounding issue, like you have to kind of adjust for it.

316
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,260
And or sometimes in genetic studies,

317
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:45,830
we have more students that would analyze populations separately to kind of account for differences in frequencies.

318
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:57,650
Any questions on them? Okay.

319
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,900
So I have printouts of the practice problems.

320
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:16,520
So if you want to pick up one, look at it and maybe 10 minutes, maybe start working through the question, then then we'll work together.

321
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:31,180
And let's see if I just say.

322
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,940
Well, maybe one or two extra. It's just one sentence.

323
00:43:44,630 --> 00:44:18,420
I can be more than happy to help little one behind that one phrase.

324
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:43,520
Yeah, I suppose. I don't know what I'd call it, but, you know, I think I might have three extra copies here anyway for the extra money.

325
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:54,320
I do have to write a bunch of these, so I'm going to give you some of these.

326
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:20,620
Do you think to do what is the only way you can do that?

327
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:35,630
Well, there's a third you go and you never really know, I think, because each year I have no problem.

328
00:45:36,510 --> 00:46:06,950
Yeah. It's like, really, we're in line with everything the United States and see what's going to get down the looting.

329
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,680
So this is talk of the nation.

330
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:32,460
Sorry, we got tired and all this.

331
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:49,520
I don't think I was clear on any of that, which makes sense.

332
00:46:49,930 --> 00:47:03,890
So I think. Yeah. Yeah. Born and raised in the United States.

333
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,750
Would you. I'm assuming that.

334
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,380
Great. Yeah, I'm sure you guys are. I just didn't know if that was in Germany.

335
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:33,810
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I think we do for each other.

336
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:42,950
I mean, my have to change, but it's not all like.

337
00:47:43,040 --> 00:48:04,050
No, no, no. Some good some next year.

338
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,680
Oh, yes.

339
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:31,230
Well, I think so. It's been 15 years since 19.

340
00:48:51,500 --> 00:49:04,040
So I guess that's like something I need to people.

341
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:27,130
Yeah, I'm looking for something that, you know, doesn't make any sense to me.

342
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:57,740
Which me? We were actually do research.

343
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,690
The area to clean out was one.

344
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:25,160
I would say, oh, the.

345
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:44,800
And. So.

346
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:53,960
The first three to. It seems to me it's not confusing to me and I know that one day I'm still here.

347
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:12,160
So I just need to find something and do everything I can to get around me that makes me

348
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:37,040
want something which I may not do as much as I was supposed to do to you right now.

349
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:57,660
And therefore. It's like that because there's something you get so to the script and then we use it all to see, you know,

350
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:18,990
this happens and it's either based on so I didn't through 76.270 this one movie interested

351
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:43,170
this the person is approaching this or okay that's what they would give to game where you.

352
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:56,000
I like to think it is still a very easy idea.

353
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:32,170
Sorry. So we do it to the students so we know that do 70 and if okay we're not going to do it again 87 to 77.

354
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:44,780
And so I think it's just like.

355
00:54:50,080 --> 00:55:04,460
But I know you think supposed to do something.

356
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:13,660
Been so long.

357
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:21,970
Yeah. Yeah. Because it would be so.

358
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,980
Yeah. So like.

359
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:51,620
Yeah. So, like, if you made a little. Is just as much as.

360
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,970
That's it. So I know how to swim.

361
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:23,940
I figured it out. Even if it's like she reaches into literally just the people, present everyone.

362
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:36,480
And at least one big reason is because it's like.

363
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,830
That used to be that. She used to, too.

364
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:59,460
Used to. Oh, is that right? I know you don't like to.

365
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:34,820
So I think if he wants to change where he sticks and I wouldn't like to talk to my wish, we would go for it.

366
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,170
So we go through this question.

367
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:50,780
We're told that we have 1500 people who we genotyped at two loci.

368
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:56,710
So the G and H, at least at each locus, there's two earlier.

369
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,990
So big G, small G, and then big H, little H.

370
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:08,540
And then these are the results showing the frequency of each of those two locus genotype.

371
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:19,970
Okay. So for the first part, we asked what was the number of people with each to locus gene and type.

372
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,750
So anyone able to work through.

373
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,160
Since we have the frequency and total number of people.

374
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:36,339
So how many people would have the big, big, big H?

375
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,520
Big H? 150, 150. Okay.

376
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,739
And you get that by multiplying it point one times.

377
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:51,430
The 1500 people, that would be 150 people.

378
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:58,210
Okay. Is that so? You. Okay. So you do the same for all of them.

379
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:34,800
Just going to fill it in because we're going to use that. And then accuse them of all of these things up to 1500 times.

380
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:54,870
It's not clear. Oh. So for the second part, in the interest of the number of observed g, h, h, o, h haplotypes.

381
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,360
So now we're not talking about people. We're talking about haplotypes.

382
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:08,370
Right. And then. So each person would have two copies, so our denominator would change.

383
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:18,090
Now, so we're looking at 300 total and 3005 haplotypes.

384
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:25,350
So these are the possible haplotype options that we have.

385
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,520
H So how do you go and get the number of haplotypes?

386
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:49,420
Like, let's look at this person here. They have, they have a big g h haplotype and they have two copies of it.

387
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,580
It's not one person's 150 people that have this haplotype.

388
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,610
So what do you think in someone with that?

389
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:12,830
Right. So would you multiply it by two because it's two copies?

390
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:19,740
Yeah. So I'm going to look through my sample and see how many people have this kind of haplotype.

391
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,190
So for this top part here, they have these 50 people have two copies.

392
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,350
So it's 150 plus 150.

393
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:39,060
Then let's look at this one here. How many would those add to the haplotype pool that I have?

394
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:51,900
20201. Yeah, because the other haplotype is little G, big h this haplotype.

395
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:55,590
I'm not going to count because it's little G, big h.

396
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,970
This haplotype will contribute.

397
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:19,140
All right. And all of these haplotypes here would not contribute because they they either have little G or small h, so these would not add.

398
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:28,760
And then I have this haplotype here. The big g g, big h, little h.

399
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:35,700
So this haplotype. I'm giving a a tip or hint in the in the question.

400
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:43,800
So for this genotype, we know that there are 217 who are big g h.

401
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:50,410
77. And then the rest of them would be g.

402
01:02:50,920 --> 01:03:00,130
H. So if the total is 389, then 270 are in this configuration here.

403
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:08,210
So then that would be 190 to small H.

404
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:23,060
And this is just as important. And so similar to the phasing issue we would talk about in the in the leakage analysis,

405
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,340
like we cannot tell if it's the big G with the big H or the big G with the little H.

406
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:38,540
So that that's why we there's the hint in the in the in the question that tells us what is one haplotype combination, how many we have.

407
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:54,140
So, so for the big g h haplotype, I'm going to add this to 70 to 70 people now with the 950 to.

408
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,830
Okay. Is that clear? Yeah.

409
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:05,010
Why wouldn't you take 389 times two and then take 270 minus?

410
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:10,940
Because don't you have to have the full amount of time? So don't you take the genotype times, too?

411
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,850
Well, it's. It's already kind of. So 389 people.

412
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:19,409
Oh. But it's not. It's not doubled.

413
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:24,870
So it's 389 people. But I know that they are broken down to 270 and 190.

414
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:33,760
Okay. Oh, people. Yeah. Yeah. Any questions on that?

415
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:43,990
Well. So let's try the big g little h haplotype.

416
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:56,410
To what? What would I? Who was the first one.

417
01:04:56,410 --> 01:05:00,490
WS with the 181.

418
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:05,380
Yeah. So all those parts do not have the haplotype that I'm looking for.

419
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,100
This, this pool of people have the haplotype.

420
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:19,339
That one copy of it's not doubles 181. It's this one we've given the face.

421
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,400
So we know the haplotypes are these.

422
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,840
So they do not contribute. Or do they?

423
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:52,840
When you teach. And then we have 54 here.

424
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:06,290
The 128 year. This one, the 54 would be double.

425
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:14,790
So 54 plus 54. So this one here.

426
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:29,680
gh2 54. Me the age of TV.

427
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:20,280
This one, I think we kind of messed up on some. So we would need to add the 119.

428
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,250
So. So it's actually since these are people.

429
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:31,350
So what you were saying was actually incorrect so to 70 our big G.

430
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:39,860
Paige. I feel like once we beat the age would be 119.

431
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,550
So what are the different options? So big. Big age.

432
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:50,270
Energy. She?

433
01:07:53,660 --> 01:08:08,470
You need to. You for.

434
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:43,570
Thanks. So we would do the health and types for each of these the numbers for each of those different haplotypes.

435
01:08:45,400 --> 01:09:04,480
And then the big G little page eight plus the one that would be six this 16378.

436
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,330
So what are the haplotype sequences?

437
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:09,310
So we're going to take the total of the haplotypes and then the denominator would be the 3000.

438
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:16,890
So for the G age, that would be 952 divided by 3000.

439
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:29,850
3.3173 and G age 5669 3000.

440
01:10:36,600 --> 01:11:21,670
I mean. The key because I'm also going to be able to over that we can young people are going to explain why 119 like recombinant one spore.

441
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah. So these are kind of easy for this one.

442
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:37,300
So you had. So we have 380 people and then.

443
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:47,950
So total package types would be double that, which is what, 189 times two?

444
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,420
7:17 p.m.

445
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:05,820
Now, we do not know the face of it, so they could be big g h they could be moto g little boots.

446
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,540
I think this one needs to be a little.

447
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:32,300
So these are the possible haplotypes for those people.

448
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:46,440
And we're told that this genotype class has to 70 g to age.

449
01:12:49,170 --> 01:13:00,129
And then if you do, I guess if you do, the seven is one way to think.

450
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:11,380
Let's just divide the remaining over. Those three have some types of the ones to use.

451
01:13:46,230 --> 01:14:17,220
Yeah. You shoot into this small age also will be 200% small.

452
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:29,770
Which one? Small. Very small age. And it's not used because you know, you have the expected haplotype for one.

453
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:39,780
So it's like the person has two strings, so the other one has to be small, smaller, so it has to be a the same number as the number.

454
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,510
That is. Yeah. This one should be nice.

455
01:14:46,520 --> 01:15:00,970
This one should be to a 70. He's.

456
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,890
With the second one being the 119.

457
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:22,210
Wouldn't it be like. Get a big H for 119 inches on this side.

458
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:36,610
Which side. Right where you've got the half. Which I see. Huh. So going to be big, big H for 119 g h, it's a big G and it should be 217.

459
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:50,590
So we're just assuming that like the matching good big and this small.

460
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,879
Ah, yeah. Ah ah. Let me think about it.

461
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:05,470
See if I can explain it better next time I hear the big G little show at the one you see here.

462
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:19,020
And then this one, it would be it will include the 192 was 70 from the unfazed genotype.

463
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:40,270
So you want to combine like 50, 70 plus one, 1989, and then this one kind of goes with that.

464
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:49,540
We'll talk over it next time. Okay. This is the solution here.

465
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:56,010
Helpful. Hopefully we'll start. Well, we'll talk over. Okay.
