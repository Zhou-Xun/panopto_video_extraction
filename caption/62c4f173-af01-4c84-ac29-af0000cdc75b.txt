1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,680
It's so big, it doesn't even have to be on the way out like a basket like that is.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,890
It's something that's really not what happens. It's a ten foot wide shoe.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm sorry. Know I know that you want it to be right.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:34,810
I don't know how long it's been since I've spoken to be mad.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:47,760
What? I know this is all around me. Don't suppose I was like, oh, so.

6
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:58,180
So I just, you know, I, you know, sometimes.

7
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,230
Oh, yeah. I mean, I got everything. I wasn't cute teams.

8
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:11,370
Well, after I got everything in the case counter, I just got a call if you have to speak for this.

9
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,080
Oh, I don't care if you email Anthony.

10
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:48,500
And anyway, after I got Jay Z to get over it and I was like I said, you know, I haven't seen the first lady.

11
00:01:50,190 --> 00:02:07,210
It's like, it's like, oh man, you have a MRI machine and need to sell it and then it's worth 30 $600.

12
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:21,380
The only going to have a for my I literally like but it's almost like yeah it's like, oh, that's always going to be good years.

13
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:39,300
And then it turns out trying to sell valuable people that are in the same house yesterday that I should take,

14
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,030
take our case for a couple minutes talking about that,

15
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,890
and then I'll do a few slides on demand for health care and then we'll have on this little generation, you know,

16
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,720
so the premise of this paper was the drug companies frequently claim that high prices are needed to recoup spending on research and development.

17
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,580
If my research and development costs are justified by drug prices that are association between these two measures and be extracted.

18
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,670
So that's the exclusive promise of the paper directly quoted and what they did then as they develop a

19
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:23,430
statistical model and try to relate to develop the R&D costs for the particular drugs in African-Americans.

20
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,480
PRICE So they argued that, well, companies are right, that they set prices to recoup our legal costs,

21
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,430
then drugs that were more expensive to develop should inherently have a higher price.

22
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,070
And drugs that are relatively cheap to develop should inherently have a lower price.

23
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,079
And lo and behold, they found no relationship between the R&D costs to drive the price of that.

24
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,250
Right. So this is about kind of how they concluded it was.

25
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,350
Also the study indicated that research and development investments did not explain the variation in list.

26
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:02,610
Prices for the 60 probability sample from a company should make further data available to support their claims that drug prices

27
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,090
are needed to recover research and development investments if they are continue to use this argument to justify higher prices.

28
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,070
And so that's kind of what the study did and what they concluded.

29
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,110
So think back to the drug price setting case that we did last week.

30
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,930
What role was there for your R&D costs?

31
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:35,070
You know, arguments about what the profit maximizing price would be, not only factor in the R&D costs,

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:45,390
that will also be considered somewhat because regarding the notion is so you price for marginal revenue you know so in other words

33
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:53,459
we actually didn't taking those into account we mean all our arguments about what price the company would set based on data,

34
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,870
on what there are two things that did matter to the data in that the savings from.

35
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,070
The drug, which then determines hospitals willingness to pay for it.

36
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,500
So the drug company tries to say, how valuable is this product to the people who are going to be paying for it,

37
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,630
in this case, the hospitals or the consumers?

38
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:19,460
So they tried to estimate, well, can we go into the hospital and say, if you buy our drugs, this will happen?

39
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,460
So the value, the demand.

40
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,310
So essentially tried to figure out what would be the demand for our product at different prices that determines the revenues.

41
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,180
And then what costs do they take into account in our discussion?

42
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,190
The cost to produce doses of the drug, the actual cost to produce the doses of the drugs.

43
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,100
So it's really good marginal revenue.

44
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,650
How much does our revenue go up if we sell another unit, marginal cost, how much is our cost of a consultant or unit?

45
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,940
So production costs, how much it costs to actually make another dose,

46
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:02,460
not the fact that 20 years ago we spent $150 million to develop that drug is going to be the cost that factors into today's price.

47
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,250
So the phrase sunk cost was used.

48
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,160
And that's exactly what the R&D is at the time you're making the pricing decision now, the drug has been FDA approved.

49
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,390
Now you're allowed to sell it. That's the point at which you have to decide how to price it.

50
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,720
If you spend $1 on R&D and you somehow locked in, what, into a really, really,

51
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,920
really, really valuable drug, do you think the drug companies are going to say?

52
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,450
Well, it was really so cheap to develop that drug, we ought to just set a really low price.

53
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,900
We'll make enough money at a low price. No.

54
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,600
If it's a really valuable drug, they're going to try to extract as much of that value as profit as they possibly can.

55
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,390
On the other hand, what if they spent billions of dollars developing this drug and it gets approved and it's actually not a particularly great drug?

56
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,860
Maybe it only applies to a small number of patients and has a small clinical benefit.

57
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,050
So it's good enough to get approved and works.

58
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:05,100
FDA gives thumbs up, but there's not much of a market for it because it only applies to a few patients and it only helps them a little bit.

59
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,050
What does that drug company said? But we spent billions of dollars developing this drug, so we're going to charge $100,000 a dose.

60
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:23,010
How much are they going to sell? Zero. So in other words, regardless of their historic cost was $1 or $1,000,000,000.

61
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,840
That money is gone. That's a sunk cost to an economic perspective.

62
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,260
We've already spent that money historically, and it's not coming back.

63
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,400
So when we're figuring out what our price should be, if our goal is to maximize our profits, we need to look at,

64
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,480
well, once the demand for our product at different prices and what's our cost of actually producing the product?

65
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,940
So those are the only factors that we took into account. We had in the background data on the drug,

66
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:59,159
there was $150 million was spent by the first company alone in R&D and then some additional amount by the second company.

67
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,510
The information didn't give us that because the second company was still doing research to get it approved.

68
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,500
So it was at least $250 million. But when we actually price that drug, we didn't take that into account.

69
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,480
So what I would argue is sort of the premise of the study is flawed.

70
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,760
The premise is that it's a drug buy drug thing.

71
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,889
So this drug costs a lot to develop.

72
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,700
Drug companies are going to price that high because this drug didn't cost a lot to develop drug companies that are going to price of low.

73
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:36,919
And I don't think that's really what the pharmaceutical industry is saying when saying, you know, we need to recoup our R&D costs.

74
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,080
They certainly make that PR point a lot.

75
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,650
But they probably were saying it more or should be saying and more of a perspective over the portfolio of drugs.

76
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,860
Yes, it's true. Among all the drugs we create, the vast majority of them fail in phase one trials.

77
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,460
Another big amount failed in phase two trials. Another amount failed phase three trials.

78
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,290
Finally, we've got the small subset that's approved, that's small set, that's approved.

79
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,370
If we're going to keep investing in R&D and the future has got to be lucrative enough to justify that investment.

80
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:17,420
So as a prospective things, I'm deciding not on a sunk cost basis based on what I spent 20 years ago,

81
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,530
but deciding should I invest in an R&D program today and how big should that program be then?

82
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,960
Yes, it's true. If I if I don't expect to make a lot of money on these drugs, I'm not going to invest nearly as much in R&D.

83
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,630
So at that point, it becomes a prospective decision. How much am I going to invest in future drugs?

84
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,680
And if, for example, we said we're going to radically cut the price of all drugs in this country.

85
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, R&D investment will go down somewhat. It's empirical question how much?

86
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,870
It may not be as much as the drug companies are claiming. It all surely is not going to go down as much as the drug companies would claim.

87
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,660
But at that point it's a prospective decision. I haven't sunk that R&D cost yet.

88
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,350
I just say, well, it's going to take ten years to get something on the market.

89
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:11,220
How lucrative do I think this portfolio of products that I'm investing in now might be ten years from now?

90
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,960
And that's going to determine how much I invest today, because at that point, it's not yet a sunk cost.

91
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,000
But the idea that I'm going to once once I have a drug that's approved,

92
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:29,790
I'm going to look backwards to how much I spent to develop it in order to determine what the price of that today now implies.

93
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,040
Well, the drug's really cheap. I'm going to leave profit on the table because I'm just going to pass on a low price.

94
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,719
If the drug is really expensive, I'm going to shoot myself in the foot by pricing it at a level.

95
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,680
Nobody's going to buy it at three. And I don't think drug companies are in the business of doing either making

96
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,400
of either of those types of decisions and only leaving profit on the table.

97
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,459
I think that's a pretty solid statement there.

98
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,870
I don't think there's too much doubt that drug companies are not going to leave tons of profit on the table,

99
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,820
which means they're not going to sell a low price just because the R&D cost for this particular drive is low.

100
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,540
And they're also not going to shoot themselves in the foot by saying, well, we have to recoup this high R&D cost,

101
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,590
so we're going to set the price so astronomically high that nobody's going to buy the drug.

102
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:26,840
So let's follow up to our case, which just kind of came out this week, and we haven't really talked about sort of sunk costs yet.

103
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,110
We haven't gotten to some of the cost part of producer cost part of it for us yet, but it's sort of a nice premium.

104
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,960
So sunk cost for of year, all of the different things is that that money is gone.

105
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,230
It's not coming back. No matter what decision you make currently, you should make the best current decision prospectively, not retrospectively.

106
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,010
Any comments about that, for one?

107
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,089
And so they were to apply our demand concepts to medical care and were going to see a

108
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:13,370
few areas where we need to at least modify a little bit how we can centralize things.

109
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,800
It's a big question. Health is health just something that happens to us?

110
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:33,940
Or is it something we choose? We choose how healthy we're going to be and sometimes which ones do we need or what they need.

111
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,640
So it's kind of both. There's certainly a random things that are well beyond our control.

112
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,680
You know, there are diagnoses that happened that there's nothing that I did that caused me to have this condition happen to me.

113
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:54,520
It might be a genetic thing. It might just be bad luck. But there's some there's something beyond my control.

114
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,050
But there are clearly choices I make that influence my health status or influence my likelihood of getting certain things.

115
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,370
The healthiest person in the world might have a big heart attack that they're

116
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,660
less likely to than somebody who doesn't maybe have the same health behaviors.

117
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,990
So the demand for medical care itself is kind of a weird concept.

118
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,270
Who likes getting medical care and who may enjoy it? Winkenwerder Awesome.

119
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,620
I get to go to the doctor today and I'm going have a surgical procedure.

120
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,580
It's going to be so fun. That's how I choose to spend my day.

121
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,010
So why would we demand something that we actively dislike?

122
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:51,470
Need it. In what sense? They see us to be healthy again or right in order to go back to our usual schedule.

123
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,890
So that's great because I don't like medical care, but I like being healthy.

124
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,960
And if I believe there are some scenarios where that unpleasant medical care can contribute to the production of my good health,

125
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,980
I will say, you know, I will purchase that as an input to help me produce the thing I do care about that does give me utility.

126
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:21,290
I get utility from better health and sometimes I think medical care, even if unpleasant, is going to be a sufficiently valuable contributor to that.

127
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,520
And I'm going to go get that surgery even though it sure as heck is unpleasant.

128
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,339
So we're going to talk about later in the course.

129
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,620
We talk about production or more specifically about the production of health and all the different we call

130
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,520
inputs that can go into producing health both at the individual level and health at a population metric level.

131
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,230
Demand for health care is based on what's called the human capital model and something that Michael Grossman,

132
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:02,750
a 50 years ago adapted to from it, was originally sort of in the education setting program investment in education or training.

133
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:11,000
He adapted that model to talk about the demand for health care in the economy and viewed it as well.

134
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,350
It's really an investment good. So health is kind of a durable good.

135
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,589
If I invested in a lot of healthy behaviors over the last five years, I exercise or eat healthy foods.

136
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,580
I wore my seatbelt. I didn't drink and drive.

137
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,340
All those things that I might have done over the last five years have a lasting effect on my health today.

138
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,900
So it's kind of an investment. Good. You know, I don't eat carrots round than potato chips with lunch because it's going to make me healthier today.

139
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,549
Think of that decision with your lunch today,

140
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,660
are you going to be healthier tonight at dinnertime if you eat carrots rather than potato chips in any discernible way?

141
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:06,650
No. But if you eat carrots, potato chips instead of carrots every day for lunch for five years, you might be less healthy 20 years from now.

142
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,160
You know, you're still young enough that probably you've got a long time before the heart disease would kick in from that decision.

143
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,100
But if you do that every every day for the next five years, you know, you're going to be maybe more healthy 20 years from now.

144
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,710
So it's really an investment. Good health is a durable good. It initiates over time.

145
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,680
It can depreciate the number of ways it can depreciate sort of predictable ways with aging.

146
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,720
You know, we all know that our health is going to at some point decline and depreciate very rapidly.

147
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,630
If I'm not if I'm looking at my phone when I'm walking across the observatory and I get hit by a bus.

148
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:53,450
My health status depreciates very, very rapidly. So it can be a gradual and predictable thing as we age.

149
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,040
It can be a rapid thing where I get some diagnosis or some accident occurs to me.

150
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,090
And so health inputs have some consumption value.

151
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:11,580
Potentially, they might make you feel better and make you more productive. And they also have some investment value in terms of the future.

152
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,400
So eating those carrots every day this week is going to maybe make you healthier down the road.

153
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,080
So in some sense, people are optimally choosing their health status.

154
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,280
They're choosing these inputs. You know, am I going to exercise? Am I going to eat well or not?

155
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,350
And part of that decisions, based on the rate of time preference, some people discount the future more heavily than others.

156
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:40,760
And you tell me have the benefit of the of the chips is today the cost of the chips is 20 years in the future.

157
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm having the chips and other people might weigh the future a little bit more heavily and say, you know what, maybe I'll have some carrots.

158
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,540
And so if we can just rewrite the utility function as a function of two things X is just your goods, goods and services that you buy.

159
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,940
Things are, you know, maybe a vector of all the goods and services that you potentially are buying

160
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,050
or you're just considered one consumption good for a two dimensional graph.

161
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,240
And H is health. Now I like to be able to go buy health.

162
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,060
Did you buy health? No, not directly.

163
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:30,010
You can't just say, well, you know what it costs to improve my quality adjusted life rating by point one.

164
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,590
Okay. I go to the store and for $10,000, I can buy a point one increase in my quality adjusted life.

165
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,220
I can't do that. But what I can do is I can buy inputs that help me improve my health.

166
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,260
So medical care is one of them and that's the one we'll kind of focus on.

167
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,169
So they will sort of hold all the other things, constant things, gym memberships,

168
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,640
lifestyle choices, sort of variety of things that I can buy through which I can influence health.

169
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,860
Let's just substitute that. And since today, all this talk about medical care or similar sort of one input for health,

170
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,120
medical care, or you think of it as well, we're holding all the others constant.

171
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:19,059
So whatever I've done in terms of lifestyle choices, gym memberships and the like will hold all that constant.

172
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,770
And we're just going to say sort of what happens as we vary the amount of medical care we decide to buy.

173
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,850
So health is a function of medical care, so we can just plug that function into the utility curve.

174
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:37,450
I can't buy health directly, but I can buy medical care which transforms into health.

175
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,500
Medical care doesn't yield utility directly. It probably yields just utility directly.

176
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,660
Royal's utility indirectly because it can contribute in some cases to improvements in health.

177
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,040
So economists call the demand for medical care a derived demand.

178
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,380
We don't demanded in and of itself we took the demand, for it is derived from our demand for good health.

179
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,670
So how many of you have bought raw chicken in the last month?

180
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,280
Like raw chicken. That was disgusting and dangerous.

181
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,020
Why would you buy something disgusting and dangerous and make it right?

182
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:30,900
Because you're using it in a production process when you can then think that gives you utility as a code chicken dinner and your purchasing inputs,

183
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,059
including raw chicken,

184
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:43,680
which is disgusting and dangerous, and then you're transforming it using your labor, your time, your capital stock, your pots, your pans, your stove.

185
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,549
Other purchased ingredients, vegetables,

186
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:52,470
whatever are the ingredients are your recipe that you're making and you're transforming it as a thing you do like.

187
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,210
So it's just like the demand for medical care. Medical care is like raw chicken.

188
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,220
We heard that before. You know, I never forget a very one thing to remember from this course,

189
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,070
like in 1998 years old, in the nursing home that was over, there was like raw chicken.

190
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:18,660
And the only thing you remember that said all semester, it's economically, it's like raw chicken.

191
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:26,070
It's something I actually dislike, but I can use it to help produce something else that I do like.

192
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,110
So I don't demand it directly. I just like it. I demand it indirectly because it helps them produce something else which does generate utility.

193
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,250
Yes, medical care is like Washington. Okay, so let's go back to our usual graph only maximizing trade off between medical care and other goods.

194
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,280
So if we got our mission, rational consumer is going to say, well,

195
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:59,400
at what point does the mix of medical care and other goods maximize like tillery of things sitting there for now, let's see maybe how things change.

196
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,810
Something occurs to me. I get sick. I get a new diagnosis, a new symptom, new injury.

197
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:18,750
That's going to change my preferences. So without illness, I buy relatively little medical care and one with illness.

198
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,010
I'm going to change my trade off. And I say, You know what?

199
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,780
Now that I'm sick, I think medical care is more valuable than I thought it was yesterday to me.

200
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:34,990
So I'm going to change my trade off. You know, it's fine that these indifference curves cross because I my whole preferences have shifted.

201
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,990
If I tell you today that the Michigan medicine is giving away free cardiac bypass surgeries, come on down.

202
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,230
How many of you are going over there? Obviously, zero.

203
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:59,610
Even it's free, you know? But if I suddenly were diagnosed with three coronary arteries or 90% blocked, they wouldn't run.

204
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,300
There was a very dangerous horizon point for certainly walk over there.

205
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:17,400
So I reallocate my consumption. Okay.

206
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:25,410
So in the last graph, I assume the budget constraint didn't change. Unfortunately, getting sick might also impact my earning power.

207
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,680
I have to take time off work. Or maybe I can't do the type of work I used to be able to do.

208
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,200
So it's kind of a second. Thanks to my consumption.

209
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,890
So originally unhealthy, I've got this sort of the darker shaded utility or indifference curve tangent here.

210
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:53,500
That's one more just like the last graph. Now, if my income didn't change, just like the last breath, I'd want them to index to.

211
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:00,430
But unfortunately, my budget constraint shifts and I bought Aflac and they have the same budget constraints.

212
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,770
I didn't buy half last. So that's what medical care is a normal good.

213
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,320
That also means I'm going to buy a little less of it than I would have. And three is less than two.

214
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,000
At the lower income level.

215
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:21,590
So we're kind of building up sort of a story about sort of the complexity of the relationship between income and medical care.

216
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,319
What your preference for medical care not shift back down to somewhere,

217
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,870
maybe just like easily below you one after your income also shifts down because you've got the medical care.

218
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,780
Now, despite you haven't gotten the medical care yet, we're seeing different scenarios.

219
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,220
In the original scenario is I stay healthy and I keep my whole income.

220
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,330
The second scenario is I get sick, but I still have the same income.

221
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,830
The third scenario is I get sick and it actually impairs my earning power.

222
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,020
Okay, so it's three different scenarios,

223
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:04,150
but it's those last two come from the same set of preferences because there are those sort of with illness preferences, not the healthy preferences.

224
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,159
So it kind of helps us understand how income affects us then.

225
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,490
It's kind of a sort of multifactorial relationship.

226
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,149
There's a direct effect. If income as a normal good, my income goes up, I'm going to buy more medical care.

227
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:30,220
If it goes down, I'm going to buy less. There's an indirect effect as well because higher income people are more likely to have good health insurance,

228
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,320
which does what, to the price of the medical care they buy. Increases their out-of-pocket price.

229
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,260
So there's an indirect effect of income on health that operates through how insurance affects the price of care.

230
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:50,310
If higher income people are more likely to have health insurance at all and the insurance they have maybe is more likely to have,

231
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,469
if they're very generous,

232
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:59,520
a good policy rather than one with a $5,000 deductible, that higher income people actually face a lower out-of-pocket price of care.

233
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,740
And that would also cause them to buy more medical care.

234
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:10,660
So through a correlation between income and price that's induced by insurance, we might have another effect of income.

235
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,730
And we also saw the budget constraint shifting in poor health can reduce my income.

236
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,910
And then we've got various things that are correlated with incomes, environmental factors.

237
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:30,490
Who's more likely to live near a toxic brownfield, higher income person or a lower income person?

238
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:41,070
Now, persons with households with lower income are more likely to live in undesirable settings where there are risk exposures for public health,

239
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,620
poor sanitation and poor public safety.

240
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,550
So households of lower income are more likely to be exposed to these things and behaviors.

241
00:26:51,820 --> 00:27:01,140
Many of them are correlated with income. So we think about income and health behaviors.

242
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,670
There are a number of kind of complex relationships. Higher income tends to improve mental and physical health, but it increases alcohol consumption.

243
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:20,130
So it's not even sort of universal that higher income is necessarily going to be healthier in every dimension because of the choices people make.

244
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:30,200
Higher income people tend to use more alcohol. Wealthier individuals consume more healthy and moderately unhealthy goods, gym memberships,

245
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,180
healthy, moderately unhealthy alcohol, but less severely unhealthy goods.

246
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:49,390
Things like tobacco. You also use this model of health medical care as an investment to think about prevention.

247
00:27:52,810 --> 00:28:00,340
If you're a hundred years old. Are you is it really important for you to keep up with all your cancer screenings?

248
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,210
You can't do anything about it. You know, I kind of have it exact.

249
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,560
So basically you say, well, first of all, the payoff period, the number of even if something is discovered early,

250
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,030
even if you can do something about it, how much life are you going to get?

251
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,230
Relatively small. And like you said, maybe you can you know, we've discovered.

252
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,200
But you're too unhealthy to even go through the treatment. The treatment would actually kill you.

253
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,900
You actually be worse off getting treated and not getting treated.

254
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:33,430
So we see that beyond age 16, the U.S. preventive services kind of continuously declines with age.

255
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,300
And that's what we would predict with this model, because it's models that, you know, medical care card partially as an investment.

256
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:47,260
And if you think what's the return on that investment? Well, if I'm 50 and I'm getting screened for colon cancer,

257
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,030
the return on that investment is a lot better than if I'm 100 and I'm getting screened for colon cancers.

258
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,810
This is what I 100 years old. Hope I get there. You are not wheeling me down for a colonoscopy is not happening.

259
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,929
Sure. Sometimes they're what's called shock information.

260
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,580
Something new happens. You learn, you have a diagnosis. How does that change your behavior?

261
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,600
One study of people with the new diabetes diagnosis said that it did lead to a bunch of changes.

262
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:27,600
Some of them actually persisted longer term, others didn't. So within sort of the first year or so afterwards, there was more exercise.

263
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,220
There was some weight loss, there was less drinking and smoking.

264
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:40,210
Those the drinking and smoking tend to be maintained, but the changes in exercise and the weight loss tended to kind of wane over time.

265
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,140
So some of the changes were maintained, some weren't.

266
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:52,870
Which is that new information, that new diagnosis caused people to change these various inputs they add into their health.

267
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:04,510
The United States Preventive Services Task Force has recommendations against certain routine tests beyond certain ages.

268
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,710
So saying we recommend this task, there is supposed to be evidence based.

269
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,550
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has to grade the evidence before it makes a recommendation at all.

270
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:23,470
It offers recommendations with great evidence. Great evidence, great to see evidence based on how strongly the panel believes it is.

271
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,209
And a lot of the recommendations for tests have caps that say, well,

272
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:36,460
we recommend routine colonoscopy for people between and I don't know the exact numbers as 50 to 75 every five years.

273
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:46,480
I'm not sure what the exact standard is, but will often have an upward count of physicians reported that they would actually

274
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:53,200
recommend tests even for people with advanced age or with other major conditions.

275
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,809
So one study surveyed family practitioners and general practitioners about whether

276
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,530
they recommend routine mammography for patients with terminal lung cancer.

277
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,909
And surprisingly, almost half of those checked.

278
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,710
Yes. Now, whether they actually do that in their practice, I don't know, because it's just a survey.

279
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:19,360
So I wouldn't take this too seriously. I'd rather see what they actually do in their practice than just what they check on a box.

280
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,090
But at least a lot of people checked on the box.

281
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:32,110
I'd recommend that in about a third of an obstetrician gynecologist recommended routine mammography for women or for women aged 80,

282
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,980
which is well beyond the U.S. for random chance forces.

283
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,729
Now. All right.

284
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,770
Kind of blow through this one pretty quickly. It's just our standard, how you draw the demand curve.

285
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:54,350
You vary the price of the range and look at what the utility maximizing amount is and translate utility maximizing bundles into a demand curve.

286
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,330
So that's going to give us our demand curve for medical care. So what could shift that demand curve?

287
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:07,819
We're going to talk later about movements along that demand curve because we're going to hold off mostly on that when we to talk about insurance,

288
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:15,649
because insurance is what's often used as the factor that changes the price of care that people are responding to when we're trying to measure

289
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:23,930
demand responses from the trade off on movements along the demand curve until we talk about how insurance affects the demand for care,

290
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:32,390
because insurance is sort of the determinant of our out-of-pocket price, but shifters of demand income.

291
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,780
So if we look at a country at a point in time, medical care tends to be a normal good.

292
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,000
It has a positive income elasticity of demand.

293
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:48,200
What's generally in the necessity region is if your income goes up 10%, you're not buying 20% more medical care.

294
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,290
So within the United States at a point in time.

295
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:58,880
So if we look at our income varies across the population in a particular year, we expect the income elasticity of demand to be about 0.2.

296
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:05,030
So 10% higher income, 2% more use of care, holding everything else about the person constant.

297
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,570
But if we look at a different way.

298
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:16,730
If we say, well, let's look at different countries and look at average income in the country and average use of medical care,

299
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,940
we see that, yes, medical care is a normal good in that context, but it's actually in the luxury category.

300
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:31,160
In other words, as as a society as a whole gets richer, the society as a whole gets 10% richer.

301
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,700
They find 12 to 16% more medical care.

302
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,750
They invest more in their medical system. So all the people so everybody in that society gets more care.

303
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:51,980
So you this a distinction between thinking about different people in a given society at a point in time versus comparing richer and.

304
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,760
Poor countries are in the war and home countries. You can also think about it over time.

305
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,600
So as a country gets richer over time, if we look at the U.S. today versus the U.S. 100 years ago.

306
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,330
We're much richer today than we were 100 years ago.

307
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,090
And our medical care consumption has gone up more than proportionately with that change in average national income.

308
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:22,740
So again, we got to think of it as as we've gotten richer, we've decided as a society to invest more in our medical care system.

309
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:32,459
And if our average income goes up by 10% in the next ten years, we probably will spend more by five more than 10% more medical care.

310
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,930
And we use a. So it's kind of a necessity at the personal level.

311
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,770
If you're comparing different people in a particular place and time, it tends to be more a luxury.

312
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:48,940
If you're comparing people in one country to another, very different income levels or in one country.

313
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,180
Today was a very different income level than that country had in the past.

314
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,520
So as a society, as we get richer, we want a lot more medical care.

315
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,630
As an individual, at a point in time, we get richer. We want a little bit more medical care.

316
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:10,470
And obviously, health status is going to shift the demand for care beliefs.

317
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,750
We can change people's preferences. You studies come out they get reported on the on the news.

318
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:30,530
Advertising. So a study of antidepressant ads found a 6 to 10% increase in antidepressant use following

319
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:37,640
exposure to TV ads and about 3.43 to 4% increase following exposure to magazine ads.

320
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:50,550
So our preferences change as we're getting new information. It's just kind of the society getting richer and using more medical care.

321
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,760
Other demand shift as the relative prices of different kinds of care so fast.

322
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Price elasticities of demand. So inpatient and outpatient care may be substitutes.

323
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,090
If you make outpatient care cheaper, then maybe will move more procedures to the outpatient setting.

324
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:22,470
Prostate screenings. It's a PSA screening for prostate cancer and biopsies are complements.

325
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:33,870
If we set up the little medical stand at the mall and we give people free PSA screening as we reduce the price of PSA screening to zero,

326
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
they're already there in the mall. They don't have to pay anything out of pocket for it.

327
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,190
They don't have to make a special trip to the doctor or the lab to get it.

328
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,920
So reducing the out-of-pocket price, reducing the time price or making it cheaper, people can get more PSA screenings and then what's going to happen?

329
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,840
They're going to get their biopsies and biopsies.

330
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,499
Exactly. Some of those and come back positive. When your test comes back positive, you say congratulations, you've a positive PSA.

331
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,750
Go on with your life. We say, now let's figure out what to do next.

332
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,050
Now, for some people, maybe I might not do a biopsy right away.

333
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:18,000
We might say let's do what's called watchful waiting. Come back in a year and let's see if your PSA remains high.

334
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,310
Or maybe more importantly, it gets even higher.

335
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,760
Turns out the stronger marker, you can never have a high PSA for benign reasons or for cancerous reasons.

336
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,280
Strong marker of a malignancy is not just that your PSA is high, but it's rising rapidly over time.

337
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,500
So we might be conservative with you and say, you know, why don't you get tested again in six months or a year?

338
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,730
Or we might be more aggressive and say, let's do a biopsy.

339
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,890
So by lowering the price of PSA screenings, we get more positive tests and therefore we get more biopsies.

340
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:59,620
So those would be compliments. Yes. A screening in the supply of these peanut butter and jelly apples, primary care coverage.

341
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,540
So Oregon's Medicaid program increased primary care coverage.

342
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,110
It actually increased preventable hospitalizations.

343
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:16,770
And that was sort of a head scratcher because the program, the rationale was partly that people should get better primary care coverage.

344
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,749
We're going to be able to avoid preventable hospitalizations, it turns out,

345
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:28,890
is very context dependent in a population that had very, very poor access to the medical system as a whole.

346
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,810
Giving them better access to primary care brings them into the system.

347
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,060
It brings them into the system for all kinds of things.

348
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:45,440
If we started with a population that already had very good access to the medical system, maybe we wouldn't have seen this.

349
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:54,860
Essentially improving primary care access becomes a marker for improving their access to medical care overall, for getting them into the system.

350
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,910
If you get them into the system, you're going to get them into the system for all kinds of things.

351
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:14,300
There was some mention the last one, Medicare Part D. Not surprisingly, when prescription drug coverage was added to Medicare,

352
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,790
it increased the use and spending on drugs among the people who gained prescription drug coverage.

353
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:26,930
But in that case, it was all that those extra costs were also offset by reductions in medical spending.

354
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:34,340
So by getting people their drugs. It kept them away from the doctor.

355
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:46,300
There's monetary costs of care. How much do I need to pay out of pocket when I go to the doctor when I have a procedure?

356
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,580
There's also non-monetary costs. We talk the PSA screening example about one of those costs being time.

357
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,930
And when they set up in the wall that you're taking or taking now the time cost as well as the financial costs.

358
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:03,040
I don't have to make a special trip. I was already here. We're also non-monetary costs of side effects.

359
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,490
So surgeries used to be done in what was called open techniques.

360
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,700
You make a big incision and you do the procedure.

361
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,940
A lot of surgeries over the last several decades have been converted to what's called minimally invasive techniques,

362
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,639
where you use a couple of very small incisions and use a lap or a stone to go in and

363
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,310
use cameras and robotics and all types of other things to make the procedure less.

364
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,460
Orbit rotations. So used to be if I had my gallbladder removed, I would have a big scar.

365
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:48,490
I would be in the hospital for 7 to 10 days. I would have to be off of work and regular activities, maybe another six weeks.

366
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,030
And there was a 1 to 2% chance that I would die in the operation.

367
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,360
Minimally invasive. I seen the hospital one night.

368
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,040
Maybe I can even go in. In the morning, in a day and day procedure.

369
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:09,290
You might go home the same night. I'm off my regular activities for, you know, maybe a week.

370
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,120
And mortality, operative mortality is essentially zero.

371
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,159
You can never say anything of the zero when anesthetic is involved or is scarred with an infection risk.

372
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,620
But it's as close to zero as we can get.

373
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,410
Okay. So think back to pre laparoscopic surgery.

374
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:33,770
So I've got some pain for my gallstones. It's kind of intermittent.

375
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,570
It's kind of moderate at the worst. You explain that procedure to me.

376
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,150
It says a 1 to 2% chance you're going to die. You'll be in the hospital 7 to 10 days.

377
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:50,630
You have a scar this big for the rest of your life, and you have to take six more weeks off your regular activities.

378
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,090
I think I'm going to live with my pain.

379
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:03,370
Now same patient goes to the doctor and says, okay, we have a procedure here that's essentially as safe as we can.

380
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:11,560
You know, we can never promise anything, but operative mortality is essentially zero, you know, is epsilon in mathematical terms.

381
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,700
You can go home the same day, maybe the next day and go hang out for about a week.

382
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,310
You'll be good to go. I think I'm having that procedure done.

383
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,110
I moderate intermittent pain. Looks like a pretty good deal to get rid of it.

384
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:39,190
And so we saw a 30 to 60% rise in gallbladder removals after the conversion from open to laparoscopic.

385
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:51,360
A perceived quality. So there are a lot of efforts, particularly by the federal government, to try to inform consumers about quality.

386
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:01,380
So we've got star ratings for nursing homes, homes, agencies, dialysis facilities, hospitals, Medicare Advantage, insurance plans.

387
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,830
They're also ratings for transplant centers for fertility clinics.

388
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,640
And we see that a lot of times there will be some response to that.

389
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,510
Other words to those facilities that get higher ratings, get more patients, those that get low ratings get less patients.

390
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,030
But it tends to be a pretty small response.

391
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:33,220
So if you look at that literature broadly to say, yeah, there's pretty good evidence of this type of information, reporting matters.

392
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:40,150
There's also pretty clear evidence that it doesn't matter a lot. It does matter to the income that they get.

393
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,520
So yeah, I mean the quality procedures,

394
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,959
they'll really focus on the five procedures because they can get more money and reimbursement rates are tied to the quality.

395
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:01,060
That's why. And so reimbursement can be tied to the quality and also the your demand can be tied to the quality and what type of insurance it is.

396
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:09,420
So. If we look at nursing homes, when CMS implemented the five star nursing home rating system,

397
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,450
five star facilities market shares increased, one star facility's market share has decreased.

398
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,250
And then, hey, Friday with Sean, one of my former doctoral students.

399
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:27,150
So five star facilities were able to raise their prices about 5 to 6% relative to one star facilities.

400
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,850
So in nursing homes, it's less an issue of the reimbursement is set by a third party payer because most private,

401
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:41,070
most nursing home stays are paid by Medicaid, which doesn't make those ties, but a lot of others are paid out of pocket by the patient.

402
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:49,290
And the out-of-pocket prices to the patients were able to be raised five or 6% by the five star facilities relative to the one stars.

403
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,830
And there's also evidence that there are impacts on disparities.

404
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,000
So if we think of the nursing home sector, if the nursing home has both private patients that are paying.

405
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:07,800
You know, $75,000 a year or Medicaid patients that are paying $30,000 a year or $40,000 a year.

406
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,140
And I only have a certain number of beds and I'm relatively full.

407
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,710
And now it is a great five star rating. And I've got these private patients coming in.

408
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,660
It's going to shift my market away towards, you know,

409
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,530
who are the patients who are responding and who are going to get one of those fixed number of beds.

410
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,140
It's going to be more likely to be the privatization.

411
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:40,530
So this increased likelihood of getting a high quality facility after this information became public was concentrated among privatizations.

412
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,810
So essentially pushing the Medicaid patients out of high quality facilities

413
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,359
because they're better able to attract private patients to handle the facility.

414
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,400
Or would you rather have 75,000 or a patient paying 30,000?

415
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:03,580
That's pretty easy question. So there's an unintended consequence in terms of increasing the disparities of access to the best facilities.

416
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:14,990
So we often use the demand curve as a measure of value. So we motivated that when we were talking about basic consumer theory,

417
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:20,000
saying the demand curve says or how much are you willing to pay for another unit?

418
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,460
That's the most to pay for the first year and the second year at the third unit.

419
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,390
And since that demand curve came from utility maximizing decisions, it says something about how you value those units.

420
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:39,580
So it's a strong kind of assumption that the height of the demand curve measures some of the marginal benefits economists call it,

421
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:45,549
or the maximum willingness to pay for each year of the go ahead of the ice cream cone effect was the most you pay for the first school,

422
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,110
the second school, the third school.

423
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:55,360
You can read that off your demand curve for ice cream, the very convenient property, and allows us to make strong statements about optimality.

424
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:03,790
So if we want to say, maximize consumer surplus and we're defining consumer surplus as the value in

425
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:09,190
this case of medical care minus the cost of care land curve tells us that.

426
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,070
So let's get a couple simple examples.

427
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:19,120
Kind of I think it's easier to illustrate what this means with an example and try to sort of explain it conceptually.

428
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,160
And suppose I say how many dental visits to consume,

429
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:32,590
how many times I go to the dentist this year and suppose I have to pick them and hold number units just to kind of keep this really, really easy.

430
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,510
One, two or three visits or four or even more.

431
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,510
And suppose it costs us $30. That's what I have to pay each time I go to the dentist.

432
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:48,070
Am I going to go with for the first visit this year? If I haven't gone to the dentist all year and I got to go once?

433
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,400
I would have paid up to $100 to have one visit rather than none.

434
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:00,750
So I'm definitely willing to pay $30. So we call the consumer surplus of that first visit $70.

435
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,740
I would have paid anywhere up to 100. I only had to pay 30.

436
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,760
So it's sort of like $70 of excess value that I get to keep.

437
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,990
I would have given you $100 for something. I only had to give 30.

438
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,020
So there. There's a movie you want to see this weekend. Suppose you have no idea what the ticket prices are.

439
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,740
So you go to the movie theater and they tell you the price.

440
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:35,150
They say they were up to $25 to see this movie as I'm really excited about this movie and they tell you the ticket price is 15 bucks,

441
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,370
you're going to buy that ticket and you're going to generate $10 of consumer surplus for you.

442
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,610
You would have been willing to pay anywhere up to 25 for that ticket, but miraculously, you only had to pay 15.

443
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:55,370
Am I going to go to the dentist a second time? So I'm not I don't value that second visit as much as the first.

444
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,309
I'd only give up to 75 for it, but since the price is 30, I'm still adding to my consumer surplus.

445
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,760
In other words, I still rather use my $30 on this than on something else.

446
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:12,170
That's what the height of the demand curve is telling you. I'm going to go for a third visit too, but barely third visit.

447
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,490
I only would have paid up to $35. So it's generally a little bit of consumer surplus.

448
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:23,360
I'm definitely not going for the fourth visit. I would value a fourth visit valued up to $20.

449
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,589
The problem is, if I got it, I would generate -$10 of consumer surplus.

450
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:32,780
I'd be giving up $30 of other stuff to get something I only value at $20.

451
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:38,960
Sounds like a bad decision. So to maximize my consumer surplus, I go three times and I'd stop.

452
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:49,800
You're a fly on the tire. At 925, we're going to stop for our speaker house with our usual smooth demand curve.

453
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,710
I suppose the price of gold is p star. And there's my demand curve.

454
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,290
How much for that good should I buy?

455
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:07,690
One argue that I ought to buy you star units because all the units object you star are worth more than the price of a star to me.

456
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:13,320
In other words, they generate positive consumer surplus. I'd rather use my money that way.

457
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:20,070
That's what the demand curve is telling me. Then use it on something else. I would never want to buy more than you, Star.

458
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,930
Even though I value additional units, I value them at less than the price.

459
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,100
Therefore, the opportunity cost of spending my money on more than few star units is too high.

460
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:38,460
I'm giving out stuff that I value more than those additional units beyond Q Star green areas or my area of consumer surplus.

461
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,560
I can assume that you started someone by all of you. And so I value more than the price that I want to stop right there.

462
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,230
So you can figure out that area pretty easily with the linear demand curve because it's a triangle.

463
00:50:51,770 --> 00:51:03,560
So the area is just 0.5 times P called MWP maximum willingness to pay for the first unit, labor's p star and then Q star -0 or just Q star.

464
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,360
So the length of that as Q star, the length. This is the difference in prices.

465
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,030
And multiply by point five, we get the area of consumer surplus.

466
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,180
So that's kind of just this graph clicked on with our usual kind of continuous quantities.

467
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,760
And so is this valid? Bunch of assumptions under it.

468
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:35,390
Yeah, my demand curve accurately reflects the value of that product and the success of the product to me.

469
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,840
If I'm a rational utility, my maximizing consumer, I've got sort of well-defined, reasonable preferences.

470
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:49,340
I have sufficient information to make good choices. It's not a well-informed demand curve, not an ill informed demand curve.

471
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,530
I'm not saying systematically over underestimating the value of care, and I understand the consequences of my choices.

472
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:05,780
And so for buying most things we buy, it's probably not too unreasonable.

473
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,590
A set of assumptions for buying medical care.

474
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:18,620
So little sketchy or set of assumptions can easily be critiques.

475
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,410
Preferences for medical care might be very malleable.

476
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:31,190
I see something on TV or my doctor tells me something and might radically change my preferences even if it shouldn't.

477
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:37,610
Oftentimes I just simply don't have much information and my demand curve is my guess curve.

478
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,860
I'm guessing medical care might be worth this much to me. I really don't know.

479
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,960
It's hard for me to learn even after the fact.

480
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,040
Okay, so you go to the doctor, you have some symptom.

481
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:56,810
The doctor gives you a prescription to take for a week and a week later, you feel better.

482
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:09,330
That drug make you feel better? Maybe it's because you didn't run you didn't run the counterfactual experiment

483
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,450
of what would have happened had I not taken this drug and just waited a week.

484
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,900
Maybe I would have felt just as good. So even after the fact, it's hard to evaluate.

485
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,230
Was it a good decision to get that prescription or not? Well, I think so, because I felt better.

486
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,480
But maybe I would have felt better without it. And I don't know that counterfactual.

487
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,110
Now we have a real problem of externalities. My failure to get care puts you at risk.

488
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:42,330
My personal assessment of the value of that care may be biased because it might ignore the value to others.

489
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,960
So oftentimes we kind of interpret the demand curve in a little bit more limited way.

490
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,610
It's an empirical relationship that can be useful.

491
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:02,160
It has predictive power. It has descriptive power, even if we're not going to push the value interpretation to harsh.

492
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:09,010
So if we change health insurance parameters, if we know something about the demand curve care, we can predict.

493
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:17,300
So how much more or less care people are going to consume? Maybe they're consuming the right amount the summer if they were well informed.

494
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,670
But we can still sort of predict what they would do.

495
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:27,000
If I'm provider, I can predict maybe what would happen to how many office visits I'm going to have if I change my prices.

496
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,649
Though often we are going to sort of at least loosely use as value interpretation,

497
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,460
especially when we're talking about things like designing health insurance plans.

498
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:42,320
So just be aware that we're, you know, when we're using this sort of an approximation of best.

499
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,160
I will stop now. This is one more slide anyhow.

500
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,499
During the effectiveness research,

501
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:58,670
studies are sort of intended to better inform the demand for care in actual practice, such as in clinical lab setting.

502
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,979
So it's one kind of attempt to sort of take some shore out of the management and

503
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,790
choosing wisely initiative is another to kind of take a look at this in the

504
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:13,340
in the notes throughout all the all the details on this don't want to think

505
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:20,390
people's lives that were they didn't love this money we just sent it to you.

506
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:35,940
Well, I will. Absolutely.

507
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,800
Yeah. Yeah. You know.

508
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,760
Okay. Sorry. Hi, everyone. My name is Tim. My name is Faten.

509
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:47,390
I'm Sarah. And I'm Mike. And today we will be presenting about universal basic income.

510
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:58,480
And discussing one article titled Economic Impact of Universal Basic Income by Cogan and Heil of the Hoover Institute.

511
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:07,750
And another experiment that we'll be talking about is the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, known as seed.

512
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:21,310
So within the universal basic income, we'll be looking at two plans, an idealized prototype plan and discussing what UBI is.

513
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:27,110
So just right off the bat, these are some government programs.

514
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,780
Can anyone share what you thought of when you when you see these words?

515
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,030
Medicaid, Welfare, Section eight, snap. Yes.

516
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,130
Right. Low income. Okay. Yeah.

517
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,670
Testing. Interesting. Yeah.

518
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:49,100
Great. And then these are also some government programs.

519
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,640
Can anyone share what your first thoughts were when you see home ownership subsidies,

520
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,890
subsidized loans for your student loans, transportation subsidies?

521
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:06,370
Any thoughts there? Thank God. Thanks, Andrew.

522
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:12,879
Okay. That we. So all of those or both of those slides.

523
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,950
Right. There are government programs that are subsidized through taxes.

524
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,590
But for some reason, one is stigmatized versus the other one is not.

525
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:32,140
Depending on who is utilizing them, if there are family or individual lower income versus someone of higher means,

526
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,560
we have different connotations with them.

527
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:51,220
And as we'll learn, UBI is hopefully impact of UBI will de-stigmatize programs because we will no longer need them or less.

528
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,220
And then just to share.

529
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:03,940
Universal basic income is income you receive from the federal government regardless of your income.

530
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,630
So it's a cash grant, no strings attached.

531
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:20,250
And then does anyone remember a Democratic hopeful in the 2020 election that ran on the promise of UBI?

532
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:32,220
And when I shout it out, Ferdinand, since he was so small, I think it was $1,000 a month that he promised.

533
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:45,030
And I mean, obviously, just some more background in the UBI history in the United States in the seventies, actually,

534
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:54,300
President Jimmy Carter and President Nixon, a Democrat and a Republican, both tried to enact UBI in the United States in the seventies.

535
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,509
Obviously, we're not getting any monthly stipend now.

536
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:09,750
So it did not work because mainly they just tried to add on a stipend without taking any of the benefits the government subsidized so that families.

537
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:17,020
Okay. So just we're going to be talking about both plans, the first UBI plan.

538
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,860
So this is coming from the Hoover Institute. So this is a conservative perspective.

539
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,729
So just to let you guys know, objective of UBI is basically its ambitious goal of eliminating poverty completely in the

540
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:32,980
U.S. And the way that it's done is you get like an annual basic income for everyone,

541
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:41,500
regardless of income, income level. So if you look at the table, if you're 100% at the poverty level, you mean you get maximum benefit.

542
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:48,649
And this kind of like varies based on household size, age and the number of children under 18.

543
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:56,060
But you have and a notable thing, just like Medicare and other social insurance programs, there is no phaseout rate at all.

544
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:05,860
So how is this done basically? You what they what you have to do is that you're eliminating all the social insurance programs

545
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:10,899
which have no phaseout rate and you're means tested programs which are which do have to phase out.

546
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:20,230
Right. Things like Medicaid, snap, social snap, things like that are given basis regardless of income.

547
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:27,279
So you can kind of see the problem with Nixon and Carter's plan because initially they wanted to eliminate it,

548
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:34,750
but they cut it because the public they would essentially you couldn't like proposed eliminating Medicare or Social Security or anything like that.

549
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,220
And by doing this, you would be saving the US government about $2.8 trillion.

550
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,740
So what happens if if you eliminate it and implement a UBI plan?

551
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,670
So it's kind of the first thing you can kind of look at is the current system.

552
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,560
It's 3.3% the poverty rate, and it would virtually eliminate it to 0.1%.

553
01:01:54,740 --> 01:02:00,440
So it's successful in that aspect and it's self-financing because once you eliminate all the the current system,

554
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,290
all the programs that we have and implement the UBI system, it basically it's self-financing.

555
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,979
You're not really costing the US government anything. But there are some negative.

556
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:18,740
So if you look at the bottom quintile and the top, you can kind of see there's a shift from the current system, 35% to 16.2% of government assistance.

557
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:23,120
So there is kind of a shift from the bottom to the top income earners,

558
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:32,300
and that's kind of because your majority of the government assistance now is based on incomes with lower income.

559
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,350
Get more. But if you go into a UBI system, you're kind of leveling it out of it.

560
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,780
So there's like 530 billion reduction in government assistance to the bottom and 400 billion in increase.

561
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,970
And the people that are kind of most affected is senior citizens, because if you're a couple,

562
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:53,030
say, 66 years old, you'd be getting Medicare and you'd be getting Social Security.

563
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:57,980
So that's around 55,000 a year. In this proposal, you'd be getting around 30,000.

564
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,490
So you can kind of see there's a shift of $40,000 that you'd be losing on.

565
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,760
So people that are elderly that kind of have passive income from the US government would be most affected.

566
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:17,230
How does this affect labor supply and marginal tax rates? So first of all, if you look at the labor supply, all workers, it's 1.8%.

567
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,040
And what they said, the the reason behind this is budget neutrality,

568
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,800
meaning that the reduction from one group is being offset by the increase to another group.

569
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,900
So that's from the top to the bottom quintile.

570
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:35,020
And another primary driver, they said, was the reduction of marginal tax rates from the elimination of all those transfers,

571
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,220
programs like Medicare, Social Security, that kind of thing that we talked about in the previous slides.

572
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:45,630
And then just another thing, if you look at all workers and the workers ages 21 to 64, you see a difference.

573
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:54,320
And what they said was, was you assume that last thing to be the same for both people over the age of 65 and people between 21 to 64.

574
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,020
And the reason behind that is because you're losing you know, if you're a senior citizen,

575
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,700
you're going to be losing out on the passive income like Medicare and Social Security and things like that.

576
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,920
Hi, guys. Be talking a little bit about the prototypes of the UBI plan.

577
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:16,550
So obviously there are some issues with the idealized plan, but the goal is pretty much the same.

578
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,810
It's to eliminate poverty. The main difference is that the prototype plan phases out assistance at 50% as earnings rise,

579
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:26,930
and it phases out at about 200% of the federal poverty line.

580
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,879
And this just button targets government assistance to poor people and just like redistributes a little

581
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:39,170
better because you saw in the previous slides that it shifts a lot of the money to the top quintiles of.

582
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,509
So this is just the way to combat that.

583
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:47,720
And this also offers assistance to a larger group of people who currently don't qualify for existing welfare programs.

584
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:53,630
So at the end, it'll be around 39% of U.S. households that would be receiving this payment.

585
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,370
And so the good news is that this effectively does eliminate poverty.

586
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:07,440
The bad news is that it'll cost us $648 billion, which is a little bit a 200 billion more than the programs it's intended to replace.

587
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:16,379
So this would necessitate either a permanent increase in taxes or a government borrowing, which will have an impact on labor supply and GDP.

588
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,550
But they don't include that in the calculations for this paper. So just keep that in mind.

589
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,600
And so I'm going to be talking a little bit about the effects of the programs that would be replaced.

590
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:31,620
So the means tested programs and all that typically have high marginal tax rates, all this recipients.

591
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:39,180
So that's about like 50 to 100%. And so the UBI phase out rate of 50% with lower marginal tax rates for that group of people.

592
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:44,340
But that's only a small fraction of recipients that only about 9%.

593
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,230
But for the rest of the 31% of people who don't qualify for existing welfare programs,

594
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,600
this actually adds 50% to their marginal tax rates, which disincentivizes work.

595
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:01,860
And so you can see that the labor supply effects and decreases most heavily in UBI recipients.

596
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:11,850
But overall, there's impact across the board. And so this would result in a reduction of about $270 billion in lost output in 20 $15.

597
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:19,770
So it's pretty significant. So in order to combat these concerns, they had a few variants of this prototype plan.

598
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,030
So they had a plan with lower phase out rates at 25% instead of 50.

599
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:30,030
And that improves the work incentives by lowering each recipient's marginal tax rate.

600
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:34,560
But it would extend UBI payments to an additional 46 million people who would also be

601
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:40,380
subject to that 25% on top of the income and payroll taxes that they're already paying.

602
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,879
So the net impact is that this actually ends up reducing the U.S. labor supply relative to the original 50% phaseout rate.

603
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,340
As you can see, there's comparisons of the three plans pretty much that I'm going to be talking about.

604
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:57,719
And so the cost of the program would rise to a little bit over $1,000,000,000,000

605
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,990
compared to the for 50 billion on the programs that are supposed to replace.

606
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:07,500
So probably not ideal. And in order to combat this, they came up with a federal budget neutrality plan,

607
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:13,560
which would kind of match the expenditure of this proposed UBI plan to the current expenditures of the programs right now.

608
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:19,140
And it's achieved by reducing the prototype plant income guaranteed to 80% of the poverty line.

609
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:24,480
However, this doesn't totally eliminate poverty, so that's kind of the tradeoff here.

610
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:30,480
It would leave 1.6% of the population in poverty still, which is about 5 million people.

611
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:38,429
It's a considerable amount of people. And this reduces UBI participation and so it reduces the labor supply effects and

612
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:43,680
it would only fall by point 7% and the GDP would decline only by 8.4% a year.

613
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:49,459
So obviously there are the trade offs that we have to consider when we're thinking

614
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:54,080
about making UBI plans that might be effective for us to adopt in the future.

615
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:10,230
Okay. As we know, that literacy program consists of Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP benefits.

616
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:19,050
On this one, in order to qualify as one has to meet a narrow criteria and not everybody is eligible to get those benefits.

617
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:28,830
So federal government economists implement this entire program for those people who are needy for are like dependents.

618
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:35,460
So other people are expected to live on their living by independently.

619
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,080
A federal government has to implement that UBI program.

620
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:48,030
What happens is that they have to keep aside a fixed amount of budget without any restriction condition.

621
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:54,900
So what are going to happen after they keep a certain amount is they people going to get the money and the people will get money.

622
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,730
They will be depending on those money and they will not go for the work.

623
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:02,940
So it will decrease the labor market.

624
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:16,530
But however, the people who support or advocate for UBI says that if we give a consistent amount of money to these people,

625
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,850
then they will have made up their living.

626
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:31,320
And once their basic needs are met, what happens is that they will start thinking for further down for their work or education.

627
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:42,690
And by implementing the reality of what we are going to get to is that the federal government will benefit, reduce the inequality in the system.

628
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:54,180
If we implement for some reason, if we implement both UBI and and then welfare program together, the government has to tax heavily on the people.

629
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,930
Either they have to borrow the money from the future and which will cost upwards in deficit and increase the inflation.

630
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:18,230
And even if [INAUDIBLE] be, it has to be implemented or the lobbying power from a welfare program.

631
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:25,550
What is the service provided like a Fijian group? Farmer Housing companies.

632
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:33,080
They will use their power and lobbying power and make sure that UBI is not implemented in the system.

633
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:42,320
If a UVA is not repelled and then pressure will emerge from the other benefit program in treatment so that,

634
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:51,290
you know, if they keep implementing or adding more and more in the system, like from the extraordinary group.

635
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:55,900
What happened is that the program you'll be a program will be blotted out.

636
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,480
It will become really heavy and the government cannot sustain.

637
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:09,270
So in conclusion, if we give you money for the no cost, then you know, and then a system will collapse.

638
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:19,610
It's not going to benefit. So a benefit of disadvantage of having you be over over the welfare program is.

639
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:29,380
I was. Liz. That is why we conclude that it is not great to implement.

640
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:42,390
Right. So now we will be discussing a real life example of UBI with a few residents in Stockton, California.

641
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:47,490
This was the Stockton economic empowerment demonstration, as I mentioned earlier.

642
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:59,010
So this started in February 2019 where 125 randomly selected residents in Stockton were given $500 a month for 24 months.

643
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:07,560
And the median household income in Stockton is about 46,000, versus the rest of California, which is about 62,000.

644
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:14,730
So definitely a city with a lot of lower income residents.

645
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:28,710
They can compare the recipients with a control group who did not receive a UBI, and these were the key findings for the recipients of UBI.

646
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,690
There was increased full time employment, increased health and well-being.

647
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,009
Self-determination was achieved and they had reduced income.

648
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:45,030
And so with increased full time employment at the start of the program.

649
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:54,150
30 or 28% of the recipients were full time employee versus in the control group.

650
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:04,920
It was about 33% a year into the program that 28% of fully employed recipients jumped 12% to 40%,

651
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:12,330
while the control group only jumped 5% from 33 to 38%.

652
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:18,840
And that's quite a jump in the from recipients.

653
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:24,570
And they leveraged their $500 a month to find full time positions.

654
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:31,250
There was also an increase in health and well-being for the recipients.

655
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:38,280
They found that they were less anxious and or less depressed within a year of receiving.

656
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,070
So some examples of how they use this money. Micah.

657
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:47,660
Also Micah.

658
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:58,820
But not that Micah was able to use the $500 a month and put it towards her son's football camp, including new shoes and food for when he was away.

659
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:01,370
This is obviously not a necessity,

660
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:11,990
but this is something that enriched her family's life and she would probably want to have been able to do so otherwise without a monthly stipend.

661
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:19,040
Another example was a couple who shared one car here.

662
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:24,230
Jovan is a social worker or construction worker, and his wife is a social worker.

663
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,490
So they shared a car and when their car needed another gasket,

664
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:35,390
they were able to already pay for the expenses that needed to fix their car versus if they did not have the stipend.

665
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:42,230
You mentioned that the car would have just been sitting at the house as they tried to save up to fix it.

666
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,990
And then he would have gone to work, which negatively affects their.

667
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:51,409
All right.

668
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:59,330
So basically the conclusions for the Stockton demonstration were that, Tamara, you touched on it a little bit, but we have less income volatility.

669
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,690
So people were running short on cash one month and had more the other month.

670
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:08,510
They were able to find more full employment on their health care increase.

671
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:15,680
And one discussion question I have is, what does this tell us about how individuals spend no strings attached money?

672
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:26,010
Since. Yeah. People will spend it in ways that improve their own personal lives.

673
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:31,800
I think we have like this idea that when you donate money, people should use it how we want them to.

674
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:37,110
Backgrounds, preferences obviously are different and the things that increase their well-being are.

675
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,350
Yeah, exactly. So one thing that, you know,

676
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:46,880
legislators are worried about is that people are going to spend things are going to spend the money on things that we don't consider valuable.

677
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:53,690
But clearly, in this demonstration, they showed that people are spending it on things that we as a society wouldn't consider valuable.

678
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:00,570
All right. So this relates a little bit to the Kenya experiment we read about a few weeks ago.

679
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:06,989
So it's very similar to the Stockholm demonstration. Individuals in Kenya were given this no strings attached cash,

680
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:13,049
and they used it in very similar ways to sort of help them pay for their kids schooling,

681
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:18,660
increase, you know, hire more people for their business or expand their business, things like that.

682
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:25,350
And then one way, we wanted to sort of tie this concept of UBI to a difference curves.

683
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:30,149
And you guys may have seen this a little bit, but this is one of our indifference curves.

684
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:36,960
We have good acts which will use food as an example on the x axis and all other goods on the y axis.

685
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:44,910
And the little dashed line is how much the government wants you to spend on good acts, which will say it's food for this example.

686
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:52,380
And in reality, a lot of people might spend less on food, which is the free spending curve up there.

687
01:16:53,310 --> 01:17:00,720
So they want to spend less on food than the government is actually wanting them to spend and spend more money on other things that are useful to them.

688
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:06,360
But if the government is requiring them to spend a certain amount of money on food via in-kind benefits,

689
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:15,900
then we have the restricted spending curve and that that forces us to lose utility, which the waste utility is the little shaded area in green.

690
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:23,370
So based on the income that we have, that just shows that when we have restricted spending versus free spending,

691
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:30,030
we are giving up a lot of utility that otherwise we would able to be able to spend on things that are useful to us.

692
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:39,410
All right. And that leads us to just two more discussion questions so you guys can think about this a little bit and just give us your thoughts.

693
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:45,290
So the first one is, given the pros and cons of UBI, do you think we should try to implement a program like this in the US?

694
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:53,840
Yeah. I think there's an equity issue in it. There's an equity issue in it.

695
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:57,559
Do you want to expand on that a little bit? If you're giving everybody the same amount of money,

696
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,120
you guys already talked about how it's the the amount that low income people are

697
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:06,480
getting in terms of benefits from the government is much lower after you buy them.

698
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:14,210
It's much harder for people who don't necessarily need it as much as much as people are.

699
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:18,520
Yeah. So more specifically that it's it's more so in the idealized plan.

700
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:23,420
But yeah, what you're saying is exactly correct. And then any other thoughts on this question?

701
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:32,320
All right, then our second question is, what would be the long term impact of the on American culture, politics, society, economy and government?

702
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:40,200
You guys can pick one. Yeah.

703
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:43,190
I think if we do implemented in an ideal world,

704
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:52,329
it's great that we go back to this scarcity and we just talk about where it's allocated in different areas.

705
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:57,420
So I don't think it would have a great impact if we apply the way things are right now.

706
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,560
But ideally it would be a good option.

707
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:07,240
Yeah, but you know, kind of based on our presentation, there are definitely some drawbacks and you know,

708
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:17,040
it's a lot of choosing whether the prevents you replacing or you know, applying this VI is actually going to solve the problem that we have.

709
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:23,220
I mean, we're going to eliminate poverty, but we're also going to redistribute a lot of our resources to maybe people who don't need those resources.

710
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,030
But the UBI experience seem to show very positive effects.

711
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:34,830
Right. But yeah, so, so the, the, like the stock demonstration in the Kenya demonstration definitely showed that people were spending them.

712
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:38,670
We're spending the money on things that were useful to them.

713
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,340
And at the same time, when we kind of look at who if we implement this on a broader scale, who's getting the money,

714
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:51,750
you know, we we are we are decreasing the money that, for example, senior citizens are getting about like $20,000 a year.

715
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:56,580
So what you're saying is right on a small scale, that's maybe what it looks like.

716
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,602
But on a larger scale, that scale was only for people.
