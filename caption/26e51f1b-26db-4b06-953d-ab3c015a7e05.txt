1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,820
Okay so why don't we get started. welcome to public health 200

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,820
health and society. So this is a survey course that will introduce you to the major

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,820
issues in public health. I'm Sheela Kennedy. I'm delighted to see you all here.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I know I'm a bit quiet, so I've got the mike on but if you have trouble hearing me please raise your hand and let me know.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,820
I wanna make sure everyone can hear. Thanks for coming out today. I know

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,820
we had like really warm weather during break and now you're back and its winter so

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,820
buckle up. Let's service introductions. I have a PhD 's in University

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Pennsylvania. and I was originally from East Coast but spent last fifteen years in the Midwest

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
first Wisconsin, then Minneapolis and now here. and we

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,820
we lack a nice little cartoon rodent and. So

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
someone should do that that would be nice for my pictures here. Um I have

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,820
a degree in sociology and demography , in in demography and if you probably know what sociology is.

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,820
How many of you know what demographers are? Oh we've got a couple people

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,820
that's good. Um so demographers count people and we count events.

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,820
so deaths, births, migration. Um, so as a demographer

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm really really excited about the 2020 census and extremely nervous.

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,820
So here is my plug for the semester. It is really important that this April that you are counted

18
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,820
that your family is count and that and everyone in your community is counted. It affects the funding

19
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,820
available to every community, affects voting for reapportioning. It's really critical.

20
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,820
So please do your part. And if you've questions about the census, I'd love to hear

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,820
them. um so yeah and I am terrified.

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I don't actually count people but I count divorces. I study marriage,

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,820
living arrangements and the impact of family structure on the

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,820
the well-being of children and the elderly. I have a five year old dog

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,820
his name is Java and he loves toys and will not sit still. So I can't

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
bring him in, but he's really cute. So next I wanted to

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,820
ask a graduate student instructors to introduce themselves. um.

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:36,820
so we'll go in order listed here. These cubes are microphones

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Hi I'm Samantha Lapehn, I'm a PHD student in the Environmental Health Sciences department.

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:49,820
I'm part of their toxicology program. I'll be teaching sections 2, 3 and 4 so if you are in any of the Thursday morning sessions, I'll be the GSI this semester.

31
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,820
And my research focuses on birth defects and trying to understand molecular mechanisms of gestational

32
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,820
exposures to environmental agents that lead to birth defects.

33
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:09,820
Any of the Mollies.

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Hi I'm Molly 1, Molly Paschall and I'm in the Nutritional Science department in Molecular and Biochemical Nutrition.

35
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,820
and I'm studying Inflammatory Bowel Disease and how genetics and diet may affect it.

36
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,820
I'm from California and Texas, so [inaudible]

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,820
I teach sections 5, 9, and 10 so Thursday afternoon and Friday mid-day.

38
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:49,820
I'm the other Molly [Carter]. Hi. I'm a 2nd-year PhD student also in Bio-Molecular Nutrition. And I'm studying maternal diet during pregnancy and how that impacts whether or not an offspring will have obesity and metabolic disease.

39
00:03:49,820 --> 00:04:03,820
You will notice that I am very rarely alone. I have a service dog. I ask that you ignore him and he will do his best to ignore you as well. If you see us walking outside you can say hi. But, in general, talk to me, not the dog.

40
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:19,820
[MC] I teach the Thursday at 3 and 4:30 and Friday at 10 am sessions. If you have any questions about dietetics, nutrition, anything like that. [SK] and I'm going to add Molly generously offered--she has experiences with SSD on campus

41
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
so if you've questions about the process, um she's generously offered to speak with you about that.

42
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,820
[MC} .... you can find my contact info on the Canvas site.

43
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,820
[SK] Thank you. I'm going to start throwing these [cube mics]

44
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,820
about. okay. I also wanted to mention the course was developed it

45
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,820
was produced by a large team at SPH that includes a number of faculty expert who

46
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,820
recorded lectures for you. The Instructional design team, nd also we have professional designers

47
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,820
and editors who helped prepare the content. so

48
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I think you'll see the amount of effort that went into this as you go through the lessons. so I'm going to start

49
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,820
with a poll. so I'm gonna ask you to bring your ...  let's see.

50
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,820
sorry

51
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,820
to get out your laptop or your device and either go to the website

52
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,820
or text. basically my name (minus the Y) 949

53
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Now you will all spell my name correctly.

54
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Alright and I want you to answer. once you can get connected. just type in a couple words

55
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,820
What do you hope to learn from this class. you know maybe you wanna do a career in public health. Maybe you're trying to fulfill distribution

56
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,820
requirements. It's anonymous.

57
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:58,820
is it working okay?

58
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,820
this is not working.

59
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:14,820
alright here we go. broader

60
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,820
policy. yep that's a big part. biostatistics and

61
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,820
medicine. Maybe many of you are premed. I see disparities.

62
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:33,820
We're gonna talk a lot about health disparities. It's a real key focus of public else

63
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,820
and you learn a lot about the challenges we face. I see some specific fields

64
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,820
epidemiology - community -

65
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,820
infrastructure. Yeah absolutely. So we're gonna talk about all of these semesters.

66
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,820
As I said it is a broad survey. thank you for doing the wait list. I'll talk about that at the end.

67
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,820
I'm sorry. Determinants of health yeah. so

68
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Thankfully last year someone got nothing and then wouldn't identify themselves. It is anonymous.

69
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,820
so this is a big step up. Poverty. Yeah. so the next.

70
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,820
the next ... let see how I go to the next one

71
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,820
next. Okay. The next one is a slightly more serious question. During during last fall the

72
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:53,820
fall semester how many times did you have five or more drinks at a setting

73
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:01,820
and again your answers are anonymous. Let's see

74
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Have most people answered? We're probably pretty steady here it's a little less than last year.

75
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,820
so 52%, more than half of you had had 5 or more drinks at a single sitting, 2 or

76
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,820
more time during last semester. Does this surprise you or

77
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,820
what were you expecting. Oh and we have these [cubes] to pass around.

78
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:32,820
yeah. Raise your hands.

79
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,820
well we

80
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:50,820
[SK] were. anyway. What number were you expecting? More or less? [student] Two or more seems likely.

81
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,820
[SK] sorry [student inaudible].

82
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,820
[SK] there's a lot of variability. Um this is actually.. actually probably lower than

83
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,820
the university University of Michigan as a whole. So a recent survey found that in a two

84
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,820
week period so not whole semester but in the two week period about half of undergraduate students here engaged

85
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,820
in binge drinking and that's 50% here compared about 40% nationally. so it's a it's it's

86
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,820
more common here than in most colleges. so what are some of the problems you've seen

87
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,820
or heard about with binge drinking on campus. And someone raise their hand we'll and toss a

88
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:36,820
microphone to you. alright oh there we go.

89
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:49,820
[student] so I don't get out much, but my friends walk around a lot and join the ... on game nights. I've heard some horrible stories about people not being able to walk.

90
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:58,820
because they are so wasted. So I don't know ... they don't seem like they would remember that

91
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:08,820
[SK] Right so you could you could get injured. [Student] yeah, it's really dangerous, because if they don't have someone to take care of them like and they pass out ,who knows what could happen to them.

92
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,820
[SK] Yeah, and when it's cold ... yeah. so what else

93
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:26,820
[SK] Way in the back.

94
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:35,820
[Student] I know 2 people who have gone to the hospital because of alcohol poisoning, so you have to be careful.

95
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,820
[SK] Anyone else want to add something. Alright, over on the left. Just toss is ...

96
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
[SK] Go ahead. It can't hurt her.

97
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,820
[Student] I mean, there are obviously lots of very serious problems with binge drinking, but I think

98
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,820
the most common one is just being hung-over in the morning. That's the most common reason somebody might go out

99
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,820
and drink more than 5 drinks will choose not to in any particular day. Oh I have to study for this test this morning.

100
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,820
[SK}. So, yes there are academic consequences. Sorry I'm doubly miked. Cool.

101
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,820
You've been talking about the impact on individuals. What about sort of the the larger communitY

102
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:23,820
can binge drinking affect other people in the community. not just self-harm.

103
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,820
[Student] Yes, in the community the larger effects are like fiscal

104
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,820
or behavioral, if you have a like family or a child. Those are the

105
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,820
harsher lasting effects. People will often like deplete the bank accounts

106
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,820
because of alcohol, can become a very significant percentage of the weekly income

107
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,820
[SK] So yeah, it has huge consequences for family members.

108
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:59,820
[Student] Just the complications that can arise like sexual assault and violence when a person is drinking.

109
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:10,820
[SK] Yeah absolutely. [Student] Some people will develop an addiction, a dependency, which then goes into health care costs

110
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,820
[SK]. Absolutely. So when we think about the cost of a public health issue, we want to think about

111
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,820
not just the individual, but families, other people in the community, and the costs to society.

112
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,820
And, so, um, when we're talking about public health we're really focused on that broader issue rather than individual

113
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Community [inaudible]

114
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,820
[Student] I think also the culture of having normalized it can also make it

115
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,820
be that like small cruise.

116
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,820
yeah. talk about losing about um educational

117
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,820
channels. so

118
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,820
what kind of thing okay. so we'll go back to

119
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,820
three okay. so don't answer

120
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,820
this yet but I want you to think about whether finished binge drinking on college campuses is a public health issue

121
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and there's no sort of one easy answer to this is actually really difficult question. so some

122
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,820
sir but the definition of public health which is the public health is the set of activities the society

123
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,820
undertakes to monitor and improve the health of its collective membership. so in other

124
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,820
words how much else seeks to protect and improve the health of the entire population

125
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,820
not just individuals. so the three factors that distinguish public health from other sciences like medicine.

126
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,820
our first at the bold public health is prevention rather than treatment. the second

127
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,820
is that the patient is the entire community and not just individuals and the service is the provider to society

128
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,820
rather than individual health care providers. I'm gonna go over this and I'm gonna just let you know

129
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,820
the very first paper will ask you what part of it will be discussing whether something is or is not

130
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,820
a health public health issues. so you're looking these let issues when you write your papers so

131
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,820
if I ask you it's been drinking a public health problem. I'm really asking you is binge drinking

132
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,820
health problem that is significant enough that the community needs to step in to address

133
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,820
does society need to act on the population and

134
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,820
some of the factors we think about our first is it an important population health issues. how

135
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,820
many people are infected or affected was affected and what that is the financial

136
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
cost. another question is is it preventable if we can't

137
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,820
prevent something. there's a role for public health. so public health cannot prevent hurt

138
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,820
public health can prevent severe consequences. hurricanes

139
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,820
of through emergency preparedness part is helping people evacuate provide

140
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,820
alternative housing. so it's gotta be preventable

141
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,820
for the consequences have to be minimized. the next question is do the

142
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,820
benefits of intervention outweigh the cost

143
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,820
and here I'm not just talking financial costs. you also have to weigh

144
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,820
the cost of intervening on individual liberty. so if we say no one under each

145
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,820
twenty one contract that is an infringement on the rights of everyone under twenty one

146
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,820
and is that is a benefit with that and then finally the sort of came up the and is there an underlying

147
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,820
societal problems. and we wanna make sure we're addressing the root causes

148
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,820
of public health issues rather than treating the symptoms. so the issue is fraternity culture

149
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,820
rather than drinking maybe we need to look at fraternity culture. if the issue is discrimination

150
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,820
which has huge impact for mental health on and take the physical toll on the body. so

151
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,820
that's really treating the symptoms we've gotta go back to the roots and look

152
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,820
at this commission. I'm trying to address things before that. so there's reports of questions

153
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,820
you wanna think about when you want to intervene. okay. so

154
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,820
now they can spot about it a little bit do you think college

155
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,820
campus in trip and college campuses is a public health problems. so raise your hand if you think

156
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,820
you know the University Michigan should step in to prevent binge drinking on campus.

157
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,820
if you end up shot. okay. maybe about

158
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,820
a third. raise your hand if you think that this is not a public health issue

159
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,820
on campus. you had a couple Hans

160
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,820
lot of you have waiting in. so someone to send in the public helps problem

161
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,820
explain what we um the new loan I..

162
00:16:48,820 --> 00:17:00,820
bye bye.. or

163
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,820
major issues lot of university. so

164
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:14,820
probably collect all of and I think that uh a lifetime.

165
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:23,820
your today's trading moved to

166
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:30,820
a area that he used

167
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:42,820
possible

168
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:55,820
IRAs and

169
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,820
yeah he was in same line whether

170
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:08,820
yeah there are any um pretty involved you know we know

171
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,820
there are prepared to make the right decision and with drinking one of the problems is your ability

172
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,820
to make decisions changes and she drink so um that's

173
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,820
that there are arguments for why it's not necessarily a problem

174
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:32,820
but anybody like this besides the fact I have

175
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:45,820
a

176
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,820
you know ways are um

177
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,820
um let's permit holders are um pieces

178
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,820
are a preferred vehicle. a which might you know

179
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,820
I was crazy him all

180
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:19,820
her cover story and characters if you go to

181
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,820
university you get a small school. yeah

182
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,820
yeah well. okay.

183
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:43,820
I I don't

184
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:56,820
oh wow I

185
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,820
you know so then they come back

186
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,820
and fine so I believe they show

187
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,820
it visually because there others

188
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,820
are more we should

189
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:26,820
be chosen. so I don't know TV

190
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,820
more education. you'll

191
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,820
see I need to think carefully about the finding list the problem and it probably

192
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,820
wasn't to him and then you not friends you maybe need to have a different interventions for different

193
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,820
they just went ahead of us. I don't I don't know how yeah really hard

194
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,820
question um choosing another question for you. how

195
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,820
many have you reach your hand how many of you think the drinking age should be lowered to eighteen. okay

196
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,820
a lot of of you who wants to address I can talk to.

197
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:14,820
alright I think you wanna talk that back there.

198
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:30,820
I think that colorful

199
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,820
for yourself. you know maybe a university

200
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,820
information about Paul with true car

201
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,820
decision once should be.

202
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:53,820
so you're a libertarian which is really important point of view I mean not something we have to

203
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,820
think about a public option. well. if I had talk about here.

204
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,820
you know make a couple oh uh-huh I

205
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,820
agree with a lot of ways that just because you think

206
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,820
that age should be lower. you say easier you know which is

207
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,820
easier like like

208
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,820
usually have like she's like her to this future.

209
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,820
what I'd like to be on the a lot of rulers and people are.

210
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:43,820
yeah yeah simply press I think

211
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,820
it is kinda seen in College Station being a legal problem

212
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,820
you know I mean here's a little street

213
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:02,820
you have a smaller amount of kids should get great

214
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,820
kind of thing it's kind of a great situation you guys who are only

215
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,820
partially twenty days velocity. I

216
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,820
don't you meetings and. yeah.

217
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,820
um and this is the reason he's the legal drinking age. the

218
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,820
you a strange because when I fall. age to

219
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,820
home or you know or make work. um

220
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,820
I did a really nice Kurdish people do.

221
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,820
extremely nervous like a regular size I heard the whole utterances

222
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,820
team people and you know it was ministry

223
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:03,820
two oh not that hard. yeah

224
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,820
yeah yeah it's not drinking it's for context in our relationship with alcohol

225
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,820
which in the US is more problematic I think then right.

226
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,820
you hired a huge culture yes. um

227
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:29,820
yeah we we yeah. call

228
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,820
him I feel was raised.

229
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,820
yes. so when you start thinking about not just the impact on yourself but on the other

230
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,820
and with the driving culture. it really makes a difference and there's some evidence up sort of listing to perhaps

231
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,820
reduce dust from driving impaired. if you're driving

232
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,820
um because people have an option other than walking. so we're gonna get moving

233
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,820
so public health that sort of can pay an important role in understanding and preventing substance

234
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,820
use so and talk about the five main areas really briefly. I'm the first is epidemiology

235
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,820
also in epidemiology kind of studies disease pattern so they might look at um how

236
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,820
often students binge drinking and which students are at most risk of alcohol related injuries so

237
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,820
they might wanna figure out where is the real problem on campus so you figure out how to

238
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,820
solve it. if you need to solve it. the second is health policy. so I don't know if I

239
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,820
can help policy and management. I got forgot to say that. so I don't have policy management. um

240
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,820
and that would be you know thinking about you know what policies could we do to enforce

241
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,820
drinking age during hearings on campus it might making be tremendous services

242
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,820
are available to students need need them to survivor statistician. you

243
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,820
know they count numbers. so one of their important roles would be to think about you know does

244
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,820
his policy it's his policy effects. so if we're going to intervene on people those individual

245
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,820
liberties we gotta make sure we're actually doing something effective. so that's an important role for bio

246
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,820
statistics. heater of house. I'm helping her health education.

247
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,820
you know making sure that you knew they might because all programs reduce to

248
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,820
brings spending in my education faculty on warning signs to look for and then the final

249
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,820
field which is environmental health. I apologize. apologize or nutritionist but you're not counted

250
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,820
among top five areas the public house. it's more like this is a lot of overlap.

251
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,820
so with the nutrition you have the epidemiologists and help policy on the biochemist and

252
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,820
so environmental services are really important expense you know and the attitudes. so

253
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,820
that's the impact to the environment on health and includes things like the built environment. so can you walk him

254
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,820
safely. if you need to drive everywhere. so um syringe talk about all these areas

255
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,820
as well. nutrition during the semester. um very briefly I just

256
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,820
wanted to mention the public major public health values. um.

257
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,820
we're gonna ask you to sort of except this is part of this class um juggle a

258
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,820
public health decisions for people can achieve their highest attainable level of health regardless

259
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,820
of their social economic or environmental background and so public health is motivated by social

260
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,820
justice and we strive for health equity. we believe the

261
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,820
community should lead solutions that intervention should be based on science and

262
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,820
evidence and we focus on prevention and we think about what

263
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,820
well this is what helps did sort of a multidimensional concepts. it's not just your physical health.

264
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,820
it's your mental health. it's sort of social health you know are you able to fully participate in

265
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,820
society and so we wanna try and develop interventions that address all of those factors

266
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,820
then I don't know what's in the nuts and bolts of course the boring part

267
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,820
because I'm for that first part was so much fun. um the main point of

268
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,820
the course if you're not gonna have to listen to me. lecture to you anymore. this is that um

269
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,820
there's it's remain objective I mean of the course you should be able to explain what public health is

270
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,820
and what you need contributions. public help makes to population health. you'll understand

271
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,820
the major population issues and their determinants and you'll gain an understanding and empathy for

272
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,820
inequities and health outcomes and experiences so they're sort of three components of

273
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,820
the class online lessons discussion sections and forth. so the course combines

274
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,820
online lessons with face-to-face learning and we do this for a couple reasons will be main reason

275
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,820
is there's evidence research suggest that the seventh course I improves learning.

276
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,820
when so you to listen to lectures each of us I don't observe very much

277
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,820
active learning you getting engaged you have to work to actually learn a bit more. so in this class you'll

278
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,820
listen to watch the lectures online sort of as part of these online lessons and include knowledge

279
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,820
checks. your noodle lectures and readings on your own time where you want to. lectures

280
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,820
are trying to do short segments so if you know Doctor Kurt

281
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Diaz talk to you at epidemiology. you know you don't fully understand what you said you can watch it again

282
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,820
you can read the transcript you have a lot of possibility to kinda go through the course at your own pace

283
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,820
so for a lot of people it's stability like is helpful the and other benefit it's competing leading

284
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,820
lessons online freeze up class time for active learning activities

285
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,820
and so I'll go into that more in a minute. so the the first

286
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,820
section or the online lesson and they're gonna include recorded lessons reading and knowledge checks

287
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,820
if you look up here when you go to the online lessons in hand. you'll be asked to watch the video

288
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,820
reading here you read chapter one and then you're gonna be asked a series of questions.

289
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,820
so it's very first question of the course is public health focuses on populations where the medicine

290
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,820
focuses on individuals that trip trip. you know it

291
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,820
will be on the exam. um one point everyone. so um

292
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,820
the goal of the lessons it's not just that you can get them on your own time. they designed to reinforce learning with the low

293
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,820
seats assessments so each week to be one to two lessons you'll be able

294
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,820
to teach take each quiz twice and we'll take the highest scores they're typically do Wednesdays eleven

295
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,820
p.m. and so this is a chance you to really kind of you have the study throughout the semester

296
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,820
gonna have to work harder. you're gonna actually learn the material. as you read as you watch lectures

297
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,820
and it also helps us to see where you have if you're having trouble with some of the questions it's really helpful

298
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,820
for us to be able to see that and they'll be in place are gonna encourage you to use Java said

299
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,820
to go through these quizzes and you have questions about it we want you to each other kinda talk to each other and we'll

300
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,820
be involved there as well. on is there also a comic form we and will he can use if you want us

301
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,820
to explain things more. but um see if this this is sort of fifty percent of your grade

302
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,820
hardly online quizzes to them. it really hurts or if you don't hear them

303
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,820
really helps great you. if you did stuff and you learn more sexy questions.

304
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,820
okay. um discussion sections. these

305
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,820
are most of your probably had discussion sections we didn't do this and I was in college so

306
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,820
things have changed at the old so these are gonna be you're gonna discuss topics they're gonna be debates are gonna

307
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,820
be two studies applications and it's really again a chance

308
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,820
to actively apply the material that you're learning you soon meet meet weekly

309
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,820
attendance is required and the final part of the form. it's just thing from

310
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,820
four to five. we're normally gonna meet and ask each one because I'm guessing maybe half

311
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,820
of you will decide not to show up because they're optional. I will record them so you can watch them

312
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,820
later. um. so why would you want to come to what

313
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,820
I wanna do during the time most weeks. I'm gonna go over some of the issues that come up in the weekly lessons

314
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,820
and so because it's a discussion sections have real sort of applied activities

315
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,820
more to did you hear at the time if you've questions about what's upstream intervention like that will go over

316
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,820
that in more detail. so I will use your question as the basis of how we spend

317
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,820
this time. and I really want us to be informal discussion for you to

318
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,820
be involved and then we'll have a few times during the semester will have for asked

319
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,820
chocolate to come in. I may ask Archie assigned to do a career advice

320
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,820
for graduate school. by form. so these are optional but

321
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,820
I do hope you'll come or watch them online afterwards. I think certainly helpful there some

322
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,820
weeks on the affordable care act. we don't have a recorded lecture for not because

323
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,820
I know this we don't know month to month what's going to be there so that

324
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,820
once that week I really do you know we'll see when we really want you to watch to let you know. bye optional but I

325
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,820
I do think it's I hope these are helpful. so why is active

326
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,820
learning important. this course is designed to promote it. so what's

327
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,820
your experience with us. if you like it. he didn't we didn't have it when I was in college.

328
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,820
anyone wanna raise a hand topic you. whose if you

329
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,820
toss it to someone tell me do you hate or love after money.

330
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,820
just hate your love. what do you think.

331
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:50,820
okay. anyone. - again

332
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,820
house it's a toss it.

333
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:04,820
alright see you hate it healthwise okay..

334
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,820
I was really shy when I was a student I never talked in class. um. so you

335
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,820
know oh wait what else here and talk. just don't

336
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:25,820
get there.

337
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:39,820
are you.

338
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,820
that's fair. I'm we're gonna try make the group work not missiles and

339
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,820
I know for some students someone like me who would hate talking in class. you know smaller groups are kinda nice because

340
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,820
you maybe more comfortable sharing then and the bakers so so the research

341
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,820
says active learning doesn't help and it's because your community more engaged

342
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,820
a learning more less likely to fail the evidence

343
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,820
that you might learn when you games are sort of almost doubling classes that use active learning with research is found.

344
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,820
I also think about something you do well maybe or swim or maybe your game or

345
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,820
maybe you it need. how did you learn how did you get

346
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,820
chatter that cracked up yes. you practice he didn't listen to someone

347
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:36,820
explain how to swim and so that's what we're gonna ask you to do. um

348
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,820
so when you're really sick of answering tennis quizzes. you learning. you will

349
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,820
appreciate it wanna participate in the exam. I'm I don't think grades are hired and

350
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,820
classes with active learning students are more engaged to one study found that

351
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,820
active learning you know that exam scores are about six percent higher or the absolute point three

352
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,820
points. so they if you were on the cusp of the a A- my supposed you. I don't really

353
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,820
listen last you're gonna be learning the material all along and I think that really helps.

354
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,820
we're gonna go to the course requirements. the weekly on my monthly is

355
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,820
fifteen percent of your grade. midterm and final twenty five percent each.

356
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,820
they're online. okay book and canvas. I believe they will be two hours long

357
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,820
and what that means is you have to study maybe open book but you're not can be able to go

358
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,820
back and read your material what you wanna do is study as if they were close books

359
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,820
and then use your note as the backups you don't have to memorize. I don't know when

360
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,820
John Snow discovered colors. so

361
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,820
which we will not ask your. so those are the exams

362
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,820
some people really do not like to take the exams in can this sort of online if you prefer

363
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:01,820
to write. please let me know these are high stress. so in terms of accommodations.

364
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:07,820
I consider these to be in class. so time and a half bye.

365
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,820
we're gonna see you really have to study these are gonna be really exam.

366
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,820
they're gonna be two essays the first one we'll be talking about Park what is a public health issue.

367
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,820
um and each of those is worth twenty percent and finally class participation is worth fifteen

368
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,820
percent and not on the attendance and discussion section and active participation and you

369
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,820
can boost your class participation through um your work in all

370
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,820
cats. I just the assignment due dates the very first paper is due in.

371
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,820
so you wanna get started on that. you know we'll talk about it next week

372
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,820
and then the edges are gonna be two exams and again these take home two hours. you have a two day period

373
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,820
over which can take them so some people like to take some of them are people like taking

374
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,820
them and then if you take it right

375
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,820
before the exam and your guaranteed computer so don't do that.

376
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,820
but see the canvas I am I'll tell you a little bit more about some synopsis of

377
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:18,820
next week. so basically this is the homepage to get kind of up the

378
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,820
you wanna start here at the unit page down here at the bottom since is on the homepage

379
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:32,820
and so you can see here that there's a link shirt and very first lesson quiz. there readings.

380
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,820
there's information about what we'll do in for that week and then sometimes and discuss the section they'll

381
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,820
be sort of additional meetings or activities wants you to do and will be posted

382
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,820
on the unit pages um the textbook is

383
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Schneider introduction to public health. the cheese out of sixteen is available through

384
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Michigan Barnes & Noble site. - them because it's just it's a discount. you

385
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:03,820
can also use the twenty thirteen edition. the page numbers are different that the contents really similar.

386
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,820
that could be maybe ten dollars. thank you if you're looking on the library has three e-books

387
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,820
licenses. so this is free but there's only three people can sneezing simultaneously

388
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,820
so if you want free option. talk to me about it and you can download chapters on such a great option

389
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,820
if you kinda like PDF. studies so the first reading is the first three weeks

390
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,820
are on campus so feel the time to sort out the textbook situation.

391
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,820
you can also go over the reading will be on the unit pages

392
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,820
that you access the recordings and knowledge checks through the

393
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,820
on my life you saw this before but we'll have the readings listed here and makes all that

394
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,820
done on textbook reading. I'm wondering that's kinda important to know.

395
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,820
so when you're looking at the lectures. there will be a close cut it can turn on close captioning.

396
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,820
you can also download the video transcripts which is great when you're studying to be kind of like

397
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,820
you or watch you watch the first there's and question on that. you don't know how to answer. my coach

398
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,820
is the transcript and figure out the answer faster so they're really helpful. you can also change the speed

399
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,820
you might wanna listen that one point two five or one point five.

400
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,820
we're not have to use the discretion boards for all non- personal questions we can talk about that more next week.

401
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,820
um I just wanna stop and say that you know mental health issues are a huge problem

402
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:34,820
on campuses. so our food security financial problems. even homelessness.

403
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,820
um life happens you know if you like Anita excluding poop

404
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,820
energy but should happens and we understand. so if something happens

405
