1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,720
A high-profile report
noted that the costs of

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,120
health care relating to
personal bankruptcies,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,310
loss of homes, and people
going without needed care.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,610
That report also concluded that

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,205
the key problem was
not the system,

6
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:24,080
but the lack of a system
to organize care.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,840
That report could easily

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,070
have appeared in today's issue of

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,450
The New York Times but it was
actually written in 1932.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,610
At that time, health
care accounted for

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,840
no more than 4% of

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,735
the gross domestic product
of the United States.

13
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:40,000
Since then, the share of

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,840
national income devoted to
healthcare is quintupled.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
To this day, cost, quality,

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,340
and access remain

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,175
the fundamental trilemma
facing health policymakers,

18
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,975
providers, and the public.

19
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,610
Trade-offs between these three

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,604
important objectives
are inevitable,

21
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,510
and economics is
the discipline that

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,370
studies the trade-offs that occur

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,780
when desired objectives

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,765
inevitably exceed
available resources.

25
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,460
In this course, you'll get

26
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,540
an intuitive grounding in

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,565
the Principles of Microeconomics.

28
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,080
That grounding will allow you to

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,630
understand why health
care markets sometimes,

30
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,095
okay, often fail to
yield optimal results.

31
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,720
With this knowledge,
you'll be able to analyze

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,220
various policy approaches to

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,720
improving the health care system.
