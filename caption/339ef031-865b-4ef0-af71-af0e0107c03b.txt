1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,569
It was so cool. All right.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,820
Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back. Looks like the same number we had last lecture, so I haven't lost anyone yet.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,870
That's always somehow validating. I'll also say I usually try to bring extreme enthusiasm into the classroom,

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,149
but I got both the COVID 19 booster and my flu shot yesterday and you're like, Oh, you won't notice it.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,559
And I was like, I guess I won't notice if I get run over by a truck in the road either, because that's exactly what it feels like.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,590
So I may be a little low key today, but I'm here doing what I can.

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,260
As always, any questions at all that you have? Please do just raise your hand or shout out.

8
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,570
We're going to have a few sessions of sort of breaking up into small groups of two or three people,

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,700
and we're going to run through some calculations together.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,600
I find it seems to go better if people do those as a group for the first couple of times, rather than just sort of striking out on your own.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,219
I did send out a super late announcement. Apologies about calculators. Can I just get a show of hands?

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,640
How many of you actually have a calculator with you? Okay, a few.

13
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,520
Does anybody not have a calculator or some kind of smartphone with a calculator app on them?

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,860
Okay. So I think we're going to be fine. If you end up in a group where nobody has a calculator,

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm going to encourage you to just swap and find somebody who does because it'll just make your lives that much easier.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,590
All right. So last lecture we talked about sort of an introduction to the course and also an introduction to ionizing radiation.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
Today, we're going to continue our leisurely stroll through the world of ionizing radiation.

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,480
We're going to talk about how radiation is created.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,980
We'll talk about what I mean by the word radio isotopes, and we'll talk about some considerations around radioactivity in the environment.

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,549
So after the next couple hours, and I will give you a five minute break again in the middle,

21
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,550
and let me just say, if I get off into my own little world and blow through the break,

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,500
which I'm planning on taking around the top of the hour, please just raise your hand and be like, remember when you promised us a break?

23
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,670
Don't just sit there passively because I really do want you to get up and stretch.

24
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,959
So today we're going to talk a bit about the atomic structure.

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,830
So this will be harking back back maybe to some high school physics.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,440
We're going to talk about the three kinds of ionizing radiation that will really focus on in this course.

27
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:27,790
We'll actually talk about a couple of additional types, but the ones we're really going to focus on are alpha beta and gamma x ray radiation.

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,950
We're going to spend some time playing around with an online chart of radionuclide,

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,930
and that's a really convenient tool that I wish had been available when I was

30
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,920
sitting in your seat some hundred years ago taking my own master's degree courses.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,950
So that's going to help you sort of understand concepts around radioactive decay and what certain atom or element is likely to decay into.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,540
We're going to talk about half life values. And so we touched on this, I think, in our first lecture, but the concept of sort of, you know,

33
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,730
how long is this stuff going to be around maybe at levels that are potentially harmful to health?

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,830
We'll talk about the distinction between radioactive activity, radioactive energy and radiation, radioactive dose.

35
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,389
And then finally,

36
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,230
we're going to talk sort of at a very high level about how photons of energy from radiation can interact with different kinds of matter.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,719
All right. So in the last lecture, I talked to you a little bit about the difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,790
And I think I told you sort of generically that we define ionizing radiation

39
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,769
as radiation that's got sufficient energy basically to where it hits an atom,

40
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,250
some matter, and it's able to create charged particles, in other words, energized electrons.

41
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:51,730
We call that process and a station. So some types of radiation, again, have the ability to ionize.

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,170
And it kind of depends on the particular material that we're looking at.

43
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:04,479
But the sort of distinction here, the dividing line between ionizing and icing is actually a bit more gray than you might expect.

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,770
So ionization occurs somewhere between, say, ten and 33 electron volts.

45
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,200
So again, it's a measure of how much energy this radiation is able to impart onto an atom that it hits.

46
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,160
And if it doesn't have at least that much energy, it's going to be considered.

47
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:25,240
Non-ionizing can still be bad for us, but it's not going to cause ionization or create these energized electrons.

48
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:35,290
And we talked last time, and I'll just reiterate again that conventionally, when you see a graph of the electromagnetic spectrum like you see here,

49
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,919
conventionally ionizing is to the right end of the graph, but not always, and non-ionizing would be on the left.

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,130
And so I'll just reiterate what I said last time.

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,909
We can see that in the non-ionizing spectrum we've got very long wavelengths.

52
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,550
In other words, the waves are very stretched out.

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,880
And then as we get up into ionizing radiation, you can see the wavelengths grow much, much more compressed.

54
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,370
So the way. Things are shorter. And we've already talked last time about how different frequencies within the ionizing

55
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,379
radiation spectrum are very useful for us in terms of things like medical imaging.

56
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:23,320
So we can do X-rays, we can create things like a gamma knife where you can do very detailed surgery on the brain, for instance.

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:32,590
We can also take advantage of ultraviolet light, and we'll talk about all of these other non-ionizing portions of the spectrum later in the class.

58
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:43,499
So hopefully this doesn't bring back kind of PTSD from your earlier years when you first learned about atoms and atomic structure.

59
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,450
But it does sort of bear revisiting. So hopefully everyone remembers that when we consider a single atom of a particular element.

60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:58,890
We've got a couple of components within that atom. So at the heart of the atom, at the center of that atom is the nucleus.

61
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:07,860
And you may recall that the nucleus consists of a mix of protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no charge that they're neutral.

62
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:17,940
And then around that nucleus, we have a whole shell of electrons that are constantly orbiting around there and the electrons are negatively charged.

63
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,960
So a couple of things to think about when we describe an atom of a particular element.

64
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:34,980
So one is we can describe any element by its atomic number, and we define that as just the number of protons that are present in the nucleus.

65
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,910
We can also describe atoms by their atomic weight or mass,

66
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:49,709
and we use that number to represent the number of protons present in the nucleus, plus the number of neutrons present in the nucleus.

67
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:58,020
So the atomic number is just protons. Atomic mass or atomic weight is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

68
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,470
Now you might say, Well, what about the electrons there? And there too? They are.

69
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,820
But it turns out electrons are almost 1/12 of the weight or mass of a proton.

70
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,880
So from a weight perspective, they contribute essentially nothing, though they do have a charge and that's very important.

71
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,959
Okay, so we've got electrons again in this shell around the nucleus and they are negatively charged.

72
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,070
We've got our protons in the nucleus and they are positively charged.

73
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,300
And then the neutrons that accompany the protons in the nucleus have no charge at all.

74
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,110
The other thing to think about, and you may have heard this on a podcast or read it in an A website or something,

75
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:44,610
but we should recognize that while we represent atoms in this fashion, the truth is atoms are about 99% empty space.

76
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:53,009
So when we think about radiation interacting with an atom, there is not very much there for the radiation to hit.

77
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,300
And we're going to talk later about what can happen when it does occur that a release,

78
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,280
a radioactive particle or a radioactive energy wave actually hits matter.

79
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,610
But again, keep in mind that atoms are a lot of empty space.

80
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:17,670
So again, just kind of introducing you gradually to the nomenclature here so we can represent any atom with this simple nomenclature.

81
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:25,140
So we're going to have some atomic symbol. And to that symbol on the left side, on the lower left, we're going to write the atomic number.

82
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,940
So again, that's the number of protons that are present in the nucleus.

83
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,080
And then on the upper left of the atomic symbol, we're going to put the mass number.

84
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,260
And that's the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons we're going to get in and do some hands on work.

85
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,280
So hopefully this will all become quite clear as we move on.

86
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:55,710
So something else that we need to consider is that atoms can have isotopes, and so an isotope is another atom that has the same atomic number.

87
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,380
In other words, it has the same number of protons, but it has a different mass number,

88
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,480
meaning it has a different number of neutrons than other atoms of that particular element.

89
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:15,930
And so just to give you some examples here that might be relatively familiar, I talked about uranium a little bit in our last lecture,

90
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:23,370
and you may know that there are different isotopes or if they are radioactive isotopes, we call them radio isotopes.

91
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,080
Very clever. So you may know that there are different forms or different isotopes of uranium.

92
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,069
There's uranium to 38 to 35 and to 34.

93
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,299
And while they're all uranium, they have different properties that we might take advantage of,

94
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,230
for example, for power generation or the creation of weapons.

95
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,770
So while these have different mass numbers to 38 to 35 and to 34,

96
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,600
the atomic number is going to be 92 for each one of these isotopes because every one of them is going to have 92 protons.

97
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,330
Again, they differ only in the number of neutrons that they have.

98
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:06,270
So when we talk about these radio isotopes or radionuclide, all these terms are totally interchangeable.

99
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:14,940
It turns out there are about 350 known radio isotopes, which only about 50 occur naturally.

100
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:23,009
So if you hearken back to the 1940s when we first figured out how to conduct nuclear fission as part

101
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,379
of our World War Two efforts and really started to play around with uranium and other elements,

102
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:35,160
we rapidly figured out actually we can create a bunch of other radio isotopes that don't exist in nature.

103
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:44,650
Without some sort of human help. Basically, one unifying factor for all these radioisotopes is they're all unstable.

104
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:51,530
So we talked about this in the last lecture. All of them are going to undergo radioactive decay over time.

105
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,100
In the process, they're going to emit radiation. And that's all part of their efforts basically to get to stability.

106
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,190
So atoms do not like to be unstable and they will do what they need to to reach ultimately a stable form.

107
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,460
Now, there are different types of radioactive decay that we're going to talk about.

108
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:16,310
And depending on the type of decay or I should say, depending on the element we're talking about,

109
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,030
and it's number of protons and neutrons and kind of the balance between those.

110
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,090
We're going to get some or perhaps another type specific type of radioactive decay.

111
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,550
I talked to you about half life.

112
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:36,200
And so, again, that's going to be if I've got a set number of radioisotopes or a certain number of atoms and I'm a clump of radioactive contamination,

113
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,850
you know, how long is it going to take for half of those atoms to become stable?

114
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,380
And amid all the radiation, they're going to admit something else.

115
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,909
Just a term that often gets thrown around is so-called transatlantic new clods.

116
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:56,090
And so these are all the radio isotopes that have an atomic number greater than 92.

117
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,840
So basically, uranium is the the element with the highest atomic number that exists naturally.

118
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,540
And so any element that we find that has an atomic number greater than 92 is going to be synthetic.

119
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,740
It's something that humans have created through experimentation or mistakes or both.

120
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,859
So we're going to look at this chart and interact with this in a little bit.

121
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,960
But I just want to introduce you to this super handy chart of radionuclide.

122
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:35,270
And so what we've got here is I should, I should mention every row of this beautiful multi hue cluster that we have here.

123
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:43,669
So if you look closely, you can see every row is made up of pixels in every one of those rows is a different element on the

124
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,430
Y axis here we're looking at the number of neutrons that are present in each of these elements.

125
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,680
Excuse me, on the x axis and on the y axis, we're looking at the number of protons.

126
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,079
And so you'll see this black line that runs approximately up the middle of the graph here.

127
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,760
So those are stable forms of these atoms.

128
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,549
In other words, along the black line, the number of protons is going to equal the number of neutrons.

129
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:19,010
So that's really where our our atoms want to be. And the further and further you get away from that black line, these different isotopes are,

130
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,340
you know, farther and farther from stable is one way to think of that.

131
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,360
So we'll, as I said, explore this in a little more detail, but this cloud will be very handy.

132
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,849
We're going to use this tool pretty extensively over the next few weeks.

133
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:39,770
We'll get a chance to play with that in a few minutes here. But again, that black line is really where these isotopes are trying to get to.

134
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,589
That's the line of stability. And you'll see there's all of these elements up here.

135
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,809
So those are the transatlantic elements. They don't have a lot of stability because they don't exist naturally.

136
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,680
So they're going to end up coming down further into the cloud here to find the line of stability at that point.

137
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,900
And so, again, each one of these little pixels, the little squares is going to be a radionuclide or a radio isotope.

138
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,150
The color coding here turns out to be pretty useful.

139
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,770
We're not going to use this too extensively in this class, but it's important to know.

140
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,610
So each of these different colors on here and I'll describe them more in a minute,

141
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,580
are going to tell us what's going to happen to that radioisotope when it undergoes radioactive decay.

142
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,110
And as we learn which type of decay it undergoes,

143
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:37,460
has really important ramifications for what it might do to us or how concerned we have to be about it if it's in the environment.

144
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,810
So again, everything on here wants to get to that line of stability.

145
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,590
So before we dove into the chart and start interacting with it a little more, as I said,

146
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:56,240
we really need to know what type of radioactive decay is going to occur because that's going to dictate

147
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,350
how and when I choose to seek protection for myself or workers or the community who might be exposed.

148
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,760
And so, as I've mentioned, there's different types of decay here.

149
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,470
The ones we're going to focus on in this class are alpha and beta and gamma and x ray, which will tend to group together those last two.

150
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
So let's talk about what these are and then we'll we'll sort of run through this in a little more detail.

151
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,500
So alpha radiation is actually a big particle.

152
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,340
It's essentially the nucleus of a helium atom that gets kicked out of another atom as a way to release energy.

153
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,120
And so a helium nucleus consists of two protons and.

154
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,630
Two neutrons, and I'll show you that more in a moment.

155
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:45,760
So because it's a helium nucleus, we can represent an alpha particle as though it's a helium atom, essentially.

156
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,590
So we can represent it is an H.

157
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,920
And again, the kind of an element and the particular radio isotope we're dealing with is going to dictate when alpha occurs.

158
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:05,139
So alpha radioactive decay tends to occur when we have radioactive decay and very high mass isotopes.

159
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:11,110
So isotopes that have a very high atomic mass or very high atomic weight.

160
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,440
Again, the number of protons plus the number of neutrons,

161
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:25,780
beta particles are emitted from isotopes that essentially don't have enough proteins, and proteins are protons and different class.

162
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,100
So you might imagine an atom that has a negative charge on it,

163
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,930
meaning that it's got too many electrons considering the number of protons it's going to have.

164
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,280
That atom is going to want to get rid of electrons and shed that negative charge.

165
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:45,790
And a beta particle is basically just a single electron that's been kicked out of an atom as a way to seek stability.

166
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,669
There are neutrons we're not really going to touch on and perhaps even beyond this slide.

167
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:59,080
But neutrons are another type of radioactive particle. These are really things that we only encounter doing nuclear fission,

168
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,069
which happens during nuclear power generation and when a nuclear weapon is exploded

169
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,280
and we're not really going into either of those circumstances in this class,

170
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
gamma radiation is no longer a particle.

171
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,840
This is a wave or a photon. So it's pure energy here, and this can occur in a couple of different ways.

172
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:26,110
So it's possible that as an isotope emits an alpha or a beta particle, it might also emit gamma energy.

173
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,969
And we'll also talk about electron capture a little bit later in the lecture today.

174
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,330
That's another way that gamma radiation can be produced.

175
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,400
And then X-rays, which probably all of us are familiar with, more or less just from past medical procedures, maybe at the dentist.

176
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,379
X-rays can occur when we've got an electron in an atom.

177
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,340
And that electron, through interactions with other photons, for instance, goes to a from a high energy orbit.

178
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,320
So an an electron that has a lot of up to it, to a lower energy orbit.

179
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,620
And so that difference in that energy ends up getting released as an X-ray.

180
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,040
And we'll go through all of this again in more detail. This is just intended to be a short intro here.

181
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,530
Okay. So like I said, we're not really going to focus on Neutron at all.

182
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,370
So you can effectively forget that word just as soon as you've learned it here.

183
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,089
And the ones that we're going to focus on are the three you see here.

184
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,490
And on the bottom here, all I'll mention it will just kind of clump X-rays into gamma radiation.

185
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:38,650
So going into this with a little more detail here, so alpha decay, again, we're going to have a parent that's the original radio isotope.

186
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,870
And then as that radio isotope, that particular atom undergoes radioactive decay,

187
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:51,340
it's going to kick off or spit out an alpha particle again, which is exactly two protons and two neutrons.

188
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,669
And so the way we describe this, we can start with our initial atomic symbol here.

189
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:05,320
So X is whatever element this is. A is our atomic mass and Z here is our atomic number.

190
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:12,070
So number of protons and A here the atomic mass is number of protons plus number of neutrons.

191
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:22,690
And so I told you that an alpha particle consists of four total charge particles here again, two neutrons and two protons.

192
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,540
And so the way we write out this radioactive decay, we have our starting atom here.

193
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,239
And then what we're going to do is we're going to represent that the starting atom is change.

194
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,080
So we put this x prime here to indicate there's been a change in that atom.

195
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,979
We indicate that we have emitted an alpha particle here.

196
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:51,520
So we write the Greek letter for alpha, and that alpha particle consists of two protons and two protons plus two neutrons.

197
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,560
So this sort of in its entirety represents that alpha particle.

198
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:05,440
And then for the parent atom, here we are going to reduce the atomic mass by four to represent what we lost in the alpha.

199
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,460
And we're going to reduce the atomic number Z here by two to reflect the loss of two protons.

200
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,550
So with that equation, we've now said my initial atom has undergone an alpha decay,

201
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,940
the parent has lost four from its atomic mass and two from its atomic number.

202
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
And now we have this new alpha particle that's been created.

203
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,040
And everybody with me so far. All right, great.

204
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,280
So beta decay, we can write. In a similar type of fashion.

205
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,440
So recall that I said a beta particle is just a loose electron that's been kicked out of an atom.

206
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:50,330
So as part of Made in Decay, we have our parent atom and that's going to decay into a daughter atom, plus this loose beta particle.

207
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,070
So how would we actually write that kind of objectively? Very similar here.

208
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,059
So we start with our initial atomic symbol here.

209
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:07,610
Whatever our parent atom is, then we're actually going to indicate here for our daughter, which will indicate is ex prime.

210
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:19,549
So the atomic symbol prime here, we're going to indicate that the atomic number Z actually goes up by one and we're kicking out this loose electron,

211
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:30,440
which we can write essentially as beta. So a beta particle here is associated with an electron that made a particle, as I said, has zero atomic mass.

212
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,210
Electrons are extremely lightweight, but it does have a charge of negative one.

213
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,959
So again, we've got our parent, we have our daughter,

214
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,760
and we have this loose electron that is now radiation zipping out through the environment and gamma and X-ray.

215
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,540
We write in a again, a fairly similar fashion.

216
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,319
So we're still going to start with our atomic symbol here. However, you'll notice that the symbol is got this little asterisk on it.

217
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:08,330
That means essentially that this particular atom is excited and it really wants to release some radiation here, different nomenclature.

218
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,319
Sometimes they'll write relaxation, sometimes they'll write gamma or x ray.

219
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm pretty loose on this in the class, frankly.

220
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:22,250
And we're going to end up with a daughter atom, and we're going to end up in this case with a gamma emission.

221
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:29,840
So this is the Greek letter Gamma. And as I said, gamma and X-ray have no mass.

222
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,110
They're photons, they're packets of energy. So we've got zero atomic mass here and zero atomic number.

223
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,320
This is truly just a wave of energy that's been released.

224
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,480
So we're going to run through some exercises just to kind of familiarize you with

225
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,010
these equations and get you to actually run through them with your classmates here.

226
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:55,580
But just about everything we're going to talk about over the next three weeks comes down to these three decays that occur.

227
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:05,420
Also say and I don't I don't remember if I said this on our first lecture, the exams in here are all open note.

228
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,979
So my goal for you is not for you to memorize all this stuff and be able to barf it back out on the test.

229
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,930
That doesn't help you, and it's not especially interesting for me, so I'm not expecting any memorization.

230
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,259
But I do want you to be able to run through these equations and actually do them.

231
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,340
That's much more important for me than, you know, memorizing particular details.

232
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,600
Okay. So coming back to our annotated chart here and then we'll pop it over to our our Web browser and take a look.

233
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,000
So as I said, the colors here indicate the type of decay that's actually going to have occurred.

234
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,020
And so green, you'll see, is relatively rare.

235
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:46,639
And it only occurs in these extremely massive radio isotopes with very high atomic numbers here, spontaneous vision,

236
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:57,260
meaning that for these select radio isotopes here, they will essentially on their own split or conduct fusion and turn into different radioisotopes.

237
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,030
Yellow, which you can see is much more common, indicates alpha radiation.

238
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:08,299
So again, the release of an alpha particle, the blue, which is very extensive, as you can see,

239
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,470
particularly on the kind of negative side of the line of stability in the lower side.

240
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,590
So blue is beta or beta minus emission.

241
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,920
So that's again the emission of a single electron.

242
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,389
And there are some other things on here that we're really not going to touch on.

243
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,100
So proton emission here in orange, very rare. We're not going to spend much time on that at all.

244
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,080
Dark pink here is neutron emissions. We're not going to spend any time on that at all.

245
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,270
And then light pink. So we've got so-called positron emission or electron capture.

246
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:46,370
And you can see that one is also fairly common here. And once again, just to emphasize, this black line, right up the middle is the line of stability.

247
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:53,389
So all of these radio isotopes are trying to get towards that line of stability, meaning they are no longer unstable.

248
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,410
They've achieved a state where they don't have excess energy or energy.

249
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,829
Okay. So I'm going to encourage it looks like just about everyone's got a device with them.

250
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:12,170
So let's go ahead and click on this chart and this will become your friend over the next few weeks of class.

251
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,879
Again, extremely useful to have this online tool available.

252
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,250
So I'll just kind of scan and again, you guys can do this on your own computer or just follow along with me.

253
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:29,840
So you'll see as I'm just running my mouse across this cloud, I get it constantly updating.

254
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,410
It's just pick something interesting here that's pronounceable.

255
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,770
So and I don't know if folks can see this,

256
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:43,729
but I'm getting a readout here that this particular graph that I'm looking at or a particular pixel is tungsten.

257
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,390
Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger and more legible.

258
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,440
Yeah, not so much with our our projector capability here.

259
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,000
So this particular radioisotope that I've highlighted here is tungsten.

260
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,930
It's got I don't know if you can even read this here.

261
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:08,600
Let's see if you can find this or you can actually search for the letter W up here in the search bar.

262
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,080
And that's going to take you to the tungsten arrow. So that's a pretty handy search.

263
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,310
So this is showing me that Tungsten has a Z of 74.

264
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:23,180
So that's the number of protons present in a tungsten atom and it's got an end of 114.

265
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,719
So that's its atomic mass. So that's pretty handy.

266
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,700
It's also got other information on here, which again is is virtually unreadable on this screen.

267
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:41,149
But one of the things that we're really interested in here is at the bottom here, it says major radiations and I'll just read it to you.

268
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,680
So it says, we've got different types of decay.

269
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,370
So this is beta minus and this is gamma. If you can't read it, this is killer electron volts.

270
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,969
So that's again how much energy is being emitted during radioactive decay.

271
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,280
And then this last column is super important.

272
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:11,599
So this suggests that for a for tungsten, this particular radio isotope, we've got 99.73 kilo electron volts of beta minus radiation.

273
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,860
So that's way more than ten or so electron volts it takes to be ionizing.

274
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:25,910
No concerns there. And this percent column says that about 99% of all the decays that occur for this type of tungsten are going to be beta minus.

275
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,280
They're going to be kicking out electrons.

276
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:35,240
And that makes sense because we're in the blue part of the cloud, which I already told you represents beta minus.

277
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,660
So we can just confirm what I said earlier and find another color in the clouds.

278
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,800
And I have gone to radium. So radium has an atomic number of 88 and atomic mass of 130.

279
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:57,799
And you can see the symbol here is art of the other way I could do this would be, oh, my gosh, I need to find radium in the chart here.

280
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:09,230
So if I search for radium naturally on this computer, it is not not working for me, but it works on my my laptop up in my office.

281
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,580
So that's truly strange. Maybe we'll just reset this and see if that works.

282
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,740
All right. Trying again, if I punch in radium. No, it doesn't work.

283
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,220
Are you guys. It might not work in either mine work at all.

284
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,959
You just did. All right, so let's just try that. Okay, so I lied to you.

285
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,320
You can't type in the whole name. You needed to know this symbol, so that's useful.

286
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,850
So if you're looking for something extremely exotic and thank you for reminding me of that, you might need to Google it first.

287
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,809
So if you're looking for americium or something, you're like, I have no idea what the symbol for that is.

288
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,550
Google will know that for sure.

289
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:54,650
And then if you type in radium here, so you'll see all of these different pixels along the cloud here are it's a little, little smaller.

290
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,459
So each of these are radioisotopes of radium.

291
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,430
They all have the same number of protons along here. So each of these has a Z of 88.

292
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,780
So exactly 88 protons and an atomic mass of 131.

293
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:15,770
But then the yellow versions here again are unstable.

294
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,920
They wanted to K so this is radium 221 all the way up to radium 226 here.

295
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,989
This is one that we'll talk about later in class because this can lead to radon in our homes,

296
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,650
which we already talked about is not a trivial deal in our country.

297
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,380
So here we've got radium.

298
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:44,270
226 And so the symbol up here in red is R.A. with the 226 So that's the total atomic mass here or the radio isotope, excuse me, of radium.

299
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:52,610
And this one, as you can maybe read, says who gives off alpha radiation with an extremely high energy of 47,

300
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,350
84 and about 93% of the decay is going to be alpha radiation.

301
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,229
So the reason that. Focusing on this percentage column is in class.

302
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,750
Actually, in just a couple of minutes, I'm going to start asking you,

303
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:11,260
like look up a particular atom or element and tell me what the atomic number is and tell me how it's going to decay.

304
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,479
And for the purposes of this class, I'm just interested in what is the major form of decay.

305
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,520
So if you guys were going on to be help physicists, it wouldn't be okay to just say, well,

306
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,089
like most of it is Alpha, you're going to want to know down to the exact distribution.

307
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,610
But for my for my purposes in this class, just knowing that it's mostly alpha is plenty.

308
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:38,410
And most of the elements that we're going to look at are virtually all, you know, alpha or beta or something else or not a lot of mixtures there.

309
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,830
So again, this is a super handy map. We can scroll back out here.

310
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,109
If I tell it, I'm not interested in radium anymore. Let's see if it shows me everything else.

311
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,979
It does not. But you can see, you know, for any element you want to look for, there's Einstein.

312
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,150
M So you can just sort of scan across here if you want.

313
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,749
If in a question that you're given, you know, the atomic number, you should be able to find that on the graph.

314
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:15,730
So for instance, if I take a look here, this is to William, which has an atomic number of 69.

315
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,330
And I'm looking for an element that has an atomic number of 80.

316
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,130
I just need to keep going upwards on the the chart here and I can finally get to health.

317
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,870
It's mercury that has an atomic number of eight. So again, a pretty handy tool.

318
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:38,860
And as I said, just looking at the colors on the chart here and reset this again, just looking on the chart, you should be able to know, oh, gosh.

319
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,979
So we're looking at rhenium here. This is in blue.

320
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,430
So that must be B2 minus or electron emission.

321
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:53,260
Again, yellow is alpha and we've got the other other colors on here that are relevant to us as well.

322
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,280
So any questions about this annotated chart here?

323
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,559
Something else you'd like me to run over? Not so much.

324
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,240
Okay, so let's jump back into our slide.

325
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,420
So right on to 22, as I mentioned, last time is for most of you,

326
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,660
probably far and away your major source of ionizing radiation exposure in any given year.

327
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:30,879
And so, you know, it's reasonable to start asking questions like, well, radon 222 what is the atomic mass of 2 to 22?

328
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,790
And it occurs to me, I think I think I misspoke on that last slide.

329
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,370
Let me be clear here on the annotated chart, because this is so important to get right.

330
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:50,379
And I apologize. So what I was describing to you here, Z, is always the number of protons, the atomic mass on this chart.

331
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,000
And I apologize for the confusion here.

332
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,370
That's going to be the number in red so that the atomic mass for mercury here, which I can't even read on the computer screen, is 199.

333
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,070
The number of protons is 80 and the number of neutrons is the N here.

334
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,479
So that's 115. So apologies, I think I may have misstated that.

335
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,830
But just just for the record, there we've got protons, neutrons, and then the number in the red square there is the total atomic mass.

336
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:31,870
All right. So. So if we come back in to raid on here and wait for power point to reload.

337
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,640
So if I had a question like rate on 222, what is its atomic mass?

338
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,600
Well, the answer is 222. It's in the name of the element there.

339
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:49,930
If I ask you, what is its atomic number? That's something you need to go to the annotated chart for and you'll be able to search for R in 222.

340
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,220
And it's going to tell you that the Z there is 86, so 86 protons.

341
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:03,040
What type of decay is it most likely to undergo? Well, if we look up radon 222 on the chart, it's going to be in the yellow zone of the chart.

342
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,260
So that tells me it's alpha decay that this particular radioisotope undergoes.

343
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:16,419
And if I ask you to describe, well, how would you rate out that radioactive decay for radon?

344
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:23,350
222. So again, this is the same well, a slightly different version of the formula I showed you earlier.

345
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:28,470
Both are totally acceptable. So we've got our our parent atom here.

346
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,320
So it's radon again. The atomic mass is 222 and the number of protons the Z is 86.

347
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:43,600
In this case, I'm indicating over the arrow that shows the reaction here that it's going to be alpha emission.

348
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,660
And I know that again, just from the color of the pixel for this particular radio isotope on the chart.

349
00:34:50,590 --> 00:35:01,720
And so what's going to happen here is, again, as I undergo alpha decay, I'm going to lose four of my atomic mass and two off my atomic number.

350
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,720
So my atomic mass goes from 220 to -4.

351
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:12,250
That leaves me at 218, and my atomic number goes from 86 down to 284.

352
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:20,890
So now I've got a new element that has a total atomic mass of 218 and an atomic number of 84.

353
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,820
And we could ask ourselves, well, gosh, where is that going to be on the chart here?

354
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,570
And I can just scan quickly through find 84.

355
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,379
So I've just found the road here that has an atomic number of 84 just by scrolling along.

356
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:45,550
And I figure out, okay, this is polonium is the atom, the or the element that has exactly 84 protons and then again coming back to the slides.

357
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:59,170
So now I know this, this parent, Radon 222 is going to create a daughter that is polonium 282 atomic mass to 18 atomic number 84.

358
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:05,350
And then I've got this spear radioactive alpha particle now introduced into the environment.

359
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:12,549
And as I said earlier, we can denote this as four, four over two as an alpha symbol.

360
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:21,300
We can do for over two as a helium here. If you want to use this nomenclature again, either is fine if you put four over two.

361
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:27,070
So again, just the nucleus of a helium here, the correct nomenclature is with the helium.

362
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:33,250
We have a plus two charge here because it's two neutrons and two protons, but no electrons.

363
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:39,430
So we don't have that balancing negative charge. Again, either of those is totally fine for this class.

364
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,360
Another example here, so carbon 14, you may have heard from radiometric dating.

365
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,879
So when a piece of a shipwreck is found or a fossil is found, how are we going to figure out how old this stuff is?

366
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,120
What carbon 14 decays at a very certain rate.

367
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:02,830
And so if we look at the ratio of carbon 14 to other types of carbon in that fossil, we can see how old approximately this fossil is.

368
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,270
So another basic question. So carbon 14 what's its atomic mass?

369
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,780
14 Just like I said, the atomic numbers.

370
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:17,890
So if you search for see in the annotated chart of radionuclide, you'll figure out the atomic number is six.

371
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:27,310
And again, if we just go here and take a look at carbon 14, so we're way down in the low end of the scale here.

372
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,830
So here is carbon. 17 is about as close as I can get with the mouse here.

373
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:43,910
So I have a number of protons. Here is six and I can see that for carbon 14, which is seven.

374
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,900
You ought to take my word for it here, because I can't seem to hold the mouse over. There we go.

375
00:37:50,440 --> 00:38:00,100
So for carbon 14, you can see we've got six protons, we've got eight neutrons and a total of carbon 14, the mass of 14.

376
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:07,570
And then I don't know if you can read this on here, but at the very bottom of that pop chart, it says beta minus is 100%.

377
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:15,549
So for this particular radio isotope, it's going to be essentially all emissions of electrons.

378
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,510
That's how it goes through radioactive decay.

379
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,919
And so if I write that out again, I dropped my power point.

380
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,630
It's just an out crash. Great. All right, let's try that again.

381
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,000
She? Okay.

382
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:56,330
So sorry about that. So we get our parent Adam here carbon 14.

383
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:03,200
So again, with atomic number six, atomic mass 14. I know this is going to undergo beta minus decay here.

384
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:13,339
And again, as I said on the previous slide, when I undergo beta minus, I'm actually going to end up with an additional proton in my nucleus.

385
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:20,270
So that C six here is going to become a seven and we're transforming into a different element when that occurs.

386
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:26,030
And so if I go back to the chart of Radionuclide, which I'm going to do because it seems to want to crash every time I can figure out,

387
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,620
oh, the atom that has an atomic number of seven is actually nitrogen.

388
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:41,390
And I've got this now spare a electron. So I've gone from carbon 14 to nitrogen 14 with one additional proton to my atomic number.

389
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,170
And then I've kicked out this negatively charged electron,

390
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:52,700
which again has a negative charge of minus one and a mass of zero, because electrons are so very sort of insubstantial.

391
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,380
And then just one more example here now for gamma radiation, we can talk about cesium.

392
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:11,540
So cesium 137 has a half life of about 30 years, but it will undergo beta minus decay into this so-called metal stable element.

393
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:18,350
Barium 137 M And that particular radio isotope has a very short half life, a couple of minutes.

394
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:26,989
So it turns out you can make devices that use barium 137 M or metastable for treatment of cancer

395
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:32,780
to put a radiation dose in the food to kill any bugs in the food or for industrial purposes.

396
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,659
And so, again, same sequence of questions here. What's the atomic mass of cesium 137?

397
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:47,059
Well, it's 137. Like we said, if I look this up in the radioactive nuclei chart, I figure out the atomic number here is 56.

398
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,290
So it's got 56 protons. And if you look it up in the chart, you'll see that it's actually primarily a key emitter.

399
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,560
So that's the dominant way that it undergoes radioactive decay.

400
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:06,470
And if I asked you to actually write out, well, how does cesium 137 decay through the release of gamma radiation in this case?

401
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Well, we're talking about cesium 137. I'm going to focus in on this.

402
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:18,379
MIT is stable version. So we've got barium 137 M again indicating that this is really not a stable element at all.

403
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,880
We've got that little asterisk here that also kind of reinforces that note.

404
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,720
So atomic mass 137, atomic number 56.

405
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,549
I've got the line indicating that I'm undergoing radioactive decay in this case.

406
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,700
I know it's gamma. So I put the Greek letter Gamma there and I end up now with still barium.

407
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:48,950
137 So the I've removed the metastable notation because this is actually a bit more stable here and admitted this Gamow wave.

408
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,770
So again, I've got Gamma and I have zero mass and zero charge on that wave of energy.

409
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:04,610
So that's about as hard as our sort of descriptions of radioactive decay are going to occur.

410
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:11,120
What I like to do right now, let's take ten or so minutes. Have you guys break into groups again of two or three?

411
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,409
And I just want you to run through these same style questions here.

412
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,120
So, again, figure out what's the atomic mass of cobalt 60, what's its atomic number,

413
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,830
how is it going to decay and actually write out that decay formula.

414
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,590
So spend a few minutes again. Let's just clump into whatever convenient groups of two or three are.

415
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,860
I've got a question for Cobalt 60 and one for Americium 241 So,

416
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,180
so run through both of those with your groups and then we'll come back together and see what you guys found.

417
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,510
Again, just an exercise to get you thinking about how to write these things down.

418
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,570
So go ahead and chat for a few minutes and I'll let you know when you have maybe one minute.

419
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,200
So what's your name again?

420
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:11,360
This image that you just saw.

421
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,540
I see you guys didn't say anything.

422
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,350
You didn't want to do that. I see.

423
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,340
That's no good. Oh, yeah.

424
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,090
Okay, we'll just.

425
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't have to.

426
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:43,894
yeah, yeah. Exactly. I mean, I think. All right, 5 minutes goes pretty fast, unfortunately.

427
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:56,674
So what I would like to do now is pivot as a way from how we sort of denote a radioactive decay process to talking more about radioactivity.

428
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:01,264
And so I've already said this in various ways. Here's just a slightly different phrasing.

429
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:08,794
So radioactivity is basically just this process by which a nucleus that's unstable is trying to become more stable by get ridding,

430
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:13,384
getting rid of this excess energy. That's kind of a generic concept.

431
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:21,484
We can also talk about radioactivity as an actual measure of sort of how much radiation is getting emitted from an isotope as a decays.

432
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:28,144
And again, we're talking in this decay process some kind of internal disintegration that's either resulting in

433
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:35,164
particles of radiation like alpha and beta neutron particles or waves of radiation like gamma and x ray.

434
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:38,674
A little bit of history because why not?

435
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:46,444
You may know that back in 1903 there were three individuals who received the Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery of radioactivity.

436
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:52,414
So Marie Curie, her husband, Pierre Curie, and then Henry Becquerel.

437
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:57,184
Quick question. Anybody know how these people died?

438
00:44:57,274 --> 00:45:00,694
So if I were to ask you, how did Marie or what did Marie Curie die?

439
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:08,553
So we'll just be right. Didn't she lecture on uranium so that that's very close.

440
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:11,613
So Marie died from chronic radiation exposure.

441
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:19,204
She was dealing with radium constantly. It was her husband who carried a source around in his pocket and ended up dying of acute radiation sickness.

442
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:24,504
And what about Henry here? Any guesses on him? Somebody else.

443
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:30,084
Radiation? No. So, you know, you can't predict these things 100%.

444
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:39,413
So because the Curies and Becquerel were working with radium,

445
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:42,924
they ended up defining a bunch of our terms that we still use and our units

446
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:48,774
that we still use in radio and in radiation science here in regards to radium.

447
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:57,324
And so they defined one curie of radioactivity as radioactivity, essentially, that occurs.

448
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:03,254
Well, let me rephrase this slightly differently. This is DPS is disintegration per second.

449
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:08,724
So radium, if it sits around, undergoes 3.7 times ten to the 10th.

450
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:12,234
Radioactive decays or disintegration per second.

451
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:15,264
And so that became the definition of the curie.

452
00:46:15,594 --> 00:46:22,544
And there's also a unit called the Becquerel named after Henry, which is 3.7 times ten to the 10th BECQUEREL.

453
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:30,014
So one Curie is equivalent to 3.7 times ten to the 10th Becquerel And we're going to use both of these units in this class.

454
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:34,134
So we'll get kind of familiar with converting between those.

455
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:42,174
I'll also say if you want to learn more about Marie Curie, this show, Radioactive on Amazon is a great movie, so I'll just put a plug in for that.

456
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:51,623
For those of you who have Amazon Prime, I talked already a little bit about the half life of a radio isotope.

457
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:59,214
And so, as you might imagine, how much or how many of these disintegration per second are occurring at any

458
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:03,414
given time are going to be related to the half life of particular elements.

459
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:10,283
And so again, when I talk about a half life, so this is the amount of time it takes for the number of radionuclide to radio

460
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:15,804
isotopes in some contamination to decay to one half of their original value.

461
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:21,444
And so I suspect all of you have probably been exposed to this concept of the half life before.

462
00:47:21,444 --> 00:47:27,983
You may have seen a graph like this where you have kind of a a starting concentration and then we have different amounts of half lives.

463
00:47:27,984 --> 00:47:32,934
And you can see indeed, every time we go one half life forward in time,

464
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:38,604
we drop the amount of material or radioactive radioactivity in this case down by half.

465
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:41,784
So we can present this with a graph. We could do it by table.

466
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:46,944
The bottom line is you can see that with a half life. As we look at this thing across multiple lives,

467
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:54,864
we get this very steep decay initially and then a more gradual decline as we get out to eight or nine or ten half lives.

468
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:58,494
You can also see that after ten half lives,

469
00:47:58,494 --> 00:48:08,903
we've essentially eliminated nearly all of the original material and all highlight here that not every element is created equal.

470
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:16,404
So if we take a look, for example, at uranium now, I talked to you about two isotopes already, uranium 235 and 238,

471
00:48:16,404 --> 00:48:19,974
you might think, well, they're both uranium, so they must have pretty similar half lives, right?

472
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,084
In fact, no.

473
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:33,383
So Uranium 238 has a half life of 4.5 Giga Years, basically, or four and a half billion years, whereas uranium 235 is only 0.7 billion years.

474
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:39,114
So they're both really long, but they differ by an order of magnitude, basically in their their half life.

475
00:48:39,774 --> 00:48:44,664
You can also see here there's things like carbon 15, which has a half life of on the order of seconds.

476
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:50,544
There are things like that cesium, which we talked about in a previous example that have a half life of about a month,

477
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:55,344
a certain radioactive isotope of iodine that has a half life of about a week,

478
00:48:56,394 --> 00:49:00,264
and then some that have even half lives on the order of milliseconds or less.

479
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:04,224
So quite broad range in terms of half lives here.

480
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:11,784
And so, you know, from a practical perspective, what this means for me is if I've got Uranium 238 lying around,

481
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:16,554
that stuff's not going anywhere for a while, right? It's been around for most of the life of the planet.

482
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:23,694
Whereas if I have tritium, this is something that may hang around for a relatively short amount of time.

483
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:29,454
And if I have fermium here, well, it's going to be gone by the time I measure it because it's half life is on the order of milliseconds.

484
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:34,644
So, you know, if we're creating waste, radioactive material, that's waste.

485
00:49:34,914 --> 00:49:40,404
Again, if it's uranium, this is something we're going to deal with for the rest of the life of the planet,

486
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:45,804
whereas for some of these other things, they're going to be hazardous, maybe for a relatively shorter period of time.

487
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:54,264
So we've got an equation here that lets us apply the half life, basically.

488
00:49:54,264 --> 00:49:56,213
And so I'll run through some examples of this.

489
00:49:56,214 --> 00:50:05,033
But essentially what I'm saying is the activity at some time t in the future is equal to the activity at the zero

490
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:13,884
time or essentially right now times e to the negative lambda here and lambda here is equivalent to the log,

491
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:19,374
the natural log of two divided by the half life of the particular element here.

492
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:29,604
And so we've got a number of. The things we can think about so we can apply this equation to the number of integrations,

493
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:34,793
the activity level, the fraction of a particular radioisotope that's left.

494
00:50:34,794 --> 00:50:40,104
So how long does it take to go from, you know, the original concentration to 50% of what we started at?

495
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:42,984
We can plug all those numbers into this same equation.

496
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:49,223
So I essentially just defined all of these things for you, but just to make sure you've got them there in writing again,

497
00:50:49,224 --> 00:50:53,574
we've got our activity in a given time or initial activity.

498
00:50:54,084 --> 00:51:00,323
This lambda is the decay constant, so that's going to depend upon the particular radioisotope.

499
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:05,034
So uranium's going to have a much different decay constant than tritium or cesium.

500
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:11,244
TI here is just our elapsed time. So how long have we let this stuff go?

501
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:16,104
And then again, the half life is in innate, neat property of the particular element.

502
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:19,104
So we'll run through a few more equations here.

503
00:51:19,674 --> 00:51:25,734
But before we do that, I just wanted to mention, you know, fortunately when we're dealing with radioactivity,

504
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:30,084
typically we're talking about very, very small amounts of radioactivity.

505
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:35,633
So a Curie is actually a pretty substantial amount of radioactivity.

506
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,904
Oftentimes in this class we're going to be talking about Pico Curies.

507
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:46,224
So one times ten to the -12 curies or nano or micro or miller curies.

508
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:52,254
You know, the only time when we get up to these is bigger values of Kilo and Vega and Geiger when

509
00:51:52,254 --> 00:51:56,544
we're talking about like the total amount of radioactivity you present on the planet.

510
00:51:57,204 --> 00:52:02,783
So it would behoove you to just kind of memorize these or you don't have to memorize them because it's an open note exam.

511
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:07,614
But sort of get familiar with well Pico. Yeah, that's ten to the -12 then or that's ten to the minus nine.

512
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:11,304
It'll make your calculations a little, a little bit simpler here.

513
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:22,884
So another example we've got iodine 131 and some of you may have heard of this before 18 131 is absorbed by the human thyroid,

514
00:52:23,034 --> 00:52:33,144
but it's also a product of nuclear fission. And so a nuclear power plant emergency or a meltdown can result in the release of 18 131.

515
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:37,253
So it could be harmful to us, but it's also used to treat thyroid disease.

516
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:43,764
So if you've got something going on in your thyroid and we've got a radioactive element that naturally wants to go to your thyroid,

517
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:46,703
and if you can kill that cancer by giving you iodine.

518
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:56,334
131 So if you were to go back to the Annotated Chart of Radionuclide, you could look this up and you'll see that in there.

519
00:52:56,334 --> 00:53:00,053
It will tell you that the half life of iodine 131 is eight days.

520
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:05,784
So once again, that chart is your best friend. It's got virtually all the information you're going to need for this class.

521
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:14,244
So let's run through an example again. 18 131 is going to be present to some degree after a nuclear emergency at a power plant.

522
00:53:14,964 --> 00:53:21,203
So there's an estimate that something like 130 Pico Becquerels of Iodine 131

523
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:26,964
specifically was released when the Fukushima Daiichi reactors melted down in 2011.

524
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:36,053
So we could start to ask pretty practical questions like, well, gosh, if that's what was released, how much was still left 30 days after?

525
00:53:36,054 --> 00:53:43,164
And if we just account for the fact that once this stuff is out, it's always undergoing its half life and it's degrading or decay.

526
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:49,224
So we can use that same equation. I just walking through here again, we're looking for the activity at time.

527
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:52,284
T This would be 30 days after the event.

528
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:57,863
We want to know what the original activity was and we've got e to the negative decay constant times.

529
00:53:57,864 --> 00:54:03,354
T and again the decay constant here is the natural log of two divided by the half life.

530
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:10,854
So just plug and chug here. And again, I'll encourage you to do this on your calculators just to make sure you're getting the correct numbers.

531
00:54:11,934 --> 00:54:18,774
So I know that my initial activity, my zero here, was 130 Pico Becquerels.

532
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:27,173
My decay constant is the natural log of two divided by the half life, and I can look up Iodine 131 and figure out the half.

533
00:54:27,174 --> 00:54:31,464
Life is eight days here, just like we talked about on the last slide.

534
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:38,964
And the amount of time that I've actually allowed this stuff to decay is 30 days, just like I mentioned to you in the prompt.

535
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:43,344
So if I collapse or run through that part of the equation,

536
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:51,174
I end up with the activity present after 30 days is 130 people becquerels times e to the -2.6.

537
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:59,963
And if you do that on your calculator, the answer you should get is after 30 days we're down from 130 to 9.6 Becquerels.

538
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:06,354
So that's a pretty tremendous reduction over just a 30 day period just from natural decay.

539
00:55:06,354 --> 00:55:11,394
And that would consider if we're actually cleaning this stuff up and removing it from the environment.

540
00:55:12,024 --> 00:55:15,444
So with this equation, we can ask some pretty practical questions.

541
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:22,494
Now, I've given you the answer here in terms of Pico Becquerels, but I might also be cruel and say, well, how many?

542
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:33,174
Curious is that. And so we've already talked about how 3.7 times ten to the 10th Becquerels is equal to one Curie.

543
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:41,664
So we can run through a simple sort of canceling out equation here where I've got a 9.6 Pico Becquerels,

544
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:52,793
and I know that one Curie is equivalent to 3.7 times ten to the 10th Becquerels, and that one Becquerel is ten to the 12th Pico Becquerel.

545
00:55:52,794 --> 00:56:00,894
So I'm just keeping my units constant here, and if I run through this, I can figure out that's actually 2.6 times ten to the -22 curies.

546
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:05,934
So an even smaller sounding amount, even though of course it's the same amount of radioactivity.

547
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:11,964
And I will say, for the purposes of this class, when you get questions, you know,

548
00:56:12,204 --> 00:56:16,464
some of the questions on the exams will be quantitative, but by no means will it be all of them.

549
00:56:17,094 --> 00:56:21,174
But you're more than welcome to just report that 2.6 times ten to the -22.

550
00:56:21,684 --> 00:56:29,873
Or you could do a little conversion here and say, okay, that's, you know, the same thing as saying 2.6 times ten to the minus ten pico curie.

551
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:33,144
So either way you want to report it is totally fine.

552
00:56:35,664 --> 00:56:44,484
We already talked about americium. 241 As it happens, the half life of an emery scheme is 433 years, so much longer than iodine.

553
00:56:45,264 --> 00:56:48,494
So if I gave you a similar question here, let's say, well, you know,

554
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:53,634
you're not supposed to leave a smoke detector in place for 20 years because they typically don't last that long.

555
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:55,224
But let's talk about this.

556
00:56:55,224 --> 00:57:07,674
So after 20 years, let's say there was one micro curie of americium, 241 in the smoke detector when you bought it, how much is left after 20 years?

557
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:12,834
And so, again, we can do the same equation here. So I'm trying to figure out what's my activity at time.

558
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:16,104
T I'm starting out with one micro curie.

559
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:25,644
My key constant is the natural log of two times 20 years, the amount of time elapsed divided by the half life of 433 years.

560
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:33,894
And I actually figure out, in fact, after 20 years, there's still virtually all of that radioactivity left in this smoke detector.

561
00:57:33,894 --> 00:57:39,863
So it turns out it's not the decay of the product in the smoke detector that's going to cause you to need to change it out,

562
00:57:39,864 --> 00:57:44,214
but rather just the fact that the chamber can get clogged basically from cooking and all

563
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:49,524
sorts of other things that we want to make sure we we replace those regularly and again.

564
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:55,074
So these questions in curies but I might ask you well you can convert this to to becquerel while you're at it.

565
00:57:55,194 --> 00:58:02,274
And so we know that one Curie is equivalent to one times ten to the sixth micro curies.

566
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:07,553
We know that 3.7 times ten to the 10th Becquerels is equivalent to one Curie.

567
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:12,984
So if I do my unit cancelation here and again run this through on your calculator just to make sure you get it,

568
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:16,944
that should be about 35,520 becquerels.

569
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:21,923
Or again, if you want to simplify this a little bit, 35.5 kilo becquerels.

570
00:58:21,924 --> 00:58:28,043
And both of those answers are totally fine with me. Just one more example here.

571
00:58:28,044 --> 00:58:31,944
So carbon 14, again, we use that for radiometric dating.

572
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:36,744
It's got a nice solid half life of 5700 years.

573
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:48,084
So if I had a 20 military source of carbon 14, how long would it take that source to get down to one molecule, for instance?

574
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:53,754
And so we can do a little bit of rearranging here. I've got my same equation that we've run through a couple of times.

575
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:59,214
I can figure out my decay constant here, and I could have done this for any of those problems.

576
00:58:59,214 --> 00:59:07,674
I just kind of embedded them in line. But my decay constants, the natural log of two divided by the half life for 5700 years.

577
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:13,974
So that means I'm losing about 0.0012 milli curies per year.

578
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:25,913
Again, I'm trying to figure out well actually I have the the starting activity of course 20 million curies I've got my decay constant here.

579
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:34,434
I can do a little bit of rearranging and so if I move my initial activity over here to the left side of the equation

580
00:59:34,434 --> 00:59:42,024
and divide my ending activity by my initial activity and left with e to the negative lambda t on the right side,

581
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:50,604
I can take the log of both sides of the equation here and I end up with this equation, which is much more sort of user friendly.

582
00:59:51,054 --> 01:00:02,484
So the half life time times, the natural log of the final activity over the starting activity equals the natural log of two times.

583
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:10,794
T and if I actually do the plug and chug and run through this equation, so now it's just substitution basically.

584
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:19,314
And I can figure out it's going to take me about 25,000 years to go from 20 million Curie to one milli curie.

585
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:23,234
So this is just another formulation of that. Same equation.

586
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:28,304
You know, sometimes we want to know how long is it going to take me to get to a safe level through natural decay?

587
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:30,234
Sometimes I want to know, well,

588
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:37,494
how long can I use this thing before it hits some low level threshold where I say there's not enough radioactivity for this to be useful anymore?

589
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:43,264
I'll just different variations on a theme. Another one here, radon 222.

590
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:49,104
So the largest source of radiation for most of us and present in most of our homes, unfortunately.

591
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:54,494
Pretty short half life of 3.8 days. So here's a question.

592
01:00:54,504 --> 01:01:05,033
If you had a perfectly enclosed space, let's say your basement is radon contaminated and you were able to seal up your basement and wanted to know,

593
01:01:05,034 --> 01:01:09,974
well, how long is it going to take for most of the radon to decay and not be a problem anymore?

594
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:17,304
So I can go back in my basement. So how long is it going to take for 95% of that radon 222 to naturally decay?

595
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:23,234
I've done well. Let me just mention. So here my initial value is 100%.

596
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:27,383
That's what I'm starting with. And my ending value, I want to be 5%.

597
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:30,384
So I'm basically getting a 95% reduction.

598
01:01:31,194 --> 01:01:35,574
And this is the same equation we looked at for the last example.

599
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:40,434
So again, I'm just trying to figure out what what is the answer here?

600
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:47,904
And so following through my various expressions here, we can figure out again,

601
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:55,764
I've got my 3.8 the half life, I've got my 5% that I want to get to my 100% that I'm starting at.

602
01:01:56,274 --> 01:02:01,244
And if I do that math, I can figure out that if I could just shut my basement up for 16 days,

603
01:02:01,254 --> 01:02:06,084
most of the radon, more decay by then, and I don't have an inhalation problem anymore.

604
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:10,823
So sometimes we don't have the ability or the resources to remediate.

605
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:15,174
But if we can just seal something off, it will take care of itself for some of these shorter lived half lives.

606
01:02:16,884 --> 01:02:25,584
All right. So practically speaking here and I will say, I'm going to try to come back always in this class to, you know, those are the equations.

607
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:31,014
How might we actually use those to benefit the public and communities and workers?

608
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:37,914
So hopefully by now you're getting a sense, well, I really need to know the sources of radiation in my environment,

609
01:02:37,914 --> 01:02:45,624
because that's where the problem is being generated. I need to know sort of the activity level, how much radioactivity is present.

610
01:02:46,164 --> 01:02:55,134
I need to understand the decay of those radioactive isotopes because how they decay is going to dictate whether it's alpha,

611
01:02:55,614 --> 01:03:01,224
beta minus or other types of radiation. Something else that we'll talk about a little later.

612
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:06,654
But any time I'm dealing with radiation in a workplace or a community, you know,

613
01:03:06,654 --> 01:03:11,894
there are very strict licensing and storage requirements for most types of radiation.

614
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:17,783
I want to make sure I'm following those. And then any time we've got people, yourselves included,

615
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:26,124
who might be involved in activities that have the potential for radioactive exposure, you know, I want people to be trained.

616
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:30,953
I want the workplace to be designed to protect those people or the community to be

617
01:03:30,954 --> 01:03:34,984
designed such that the radiation is contained and not emitted into the community.

618
01:03:35,574 --> 01:03:41,264
And very critically, I want to monitor to make sure that what I think is happening is actually what's happening.

619
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:45,083
And we'll touch on all of these things in some of our next lectures.

620
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:49,223
Just kind of bring it back to reality there. All right.

621
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:56,244
So now we're going to switch gears and talk a bit about sort of quantities that we can describe radiation as,

622
01:03:56,664 --> 01:04:00,324
and we can talk about activity, which is mostly what we've been focused on so far.

623
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:07,674
We can talk about energy and we can also talk about dose, dose being sort of how much actually gets into a person in environmental health.

624
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:10,704
That's typically the endpoint that we're most interested in.

625
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:15,324
So of course, we don't want radiation going into Flora or Flanner either.

626
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:22,974
Sorry. So when we talk about activity, this is basically proportional to how much radiation is there.

627
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:29,783
The more contamination that we have, typically the more activity there is going to be because there's more radionuclide,

628
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:39,074
which means more disintegration per second. So Curies, I already described to you since the Curies actually did their research using radium.

629
01:04:39,504 --> 01:04:47,604
The standard unit to divide or to describe radioactive activity was decided on as one gram of radium.

630
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:52,763
So how much activity occurs if you have one gram of radium?

631
01:04:52,764 --> 01:05:02,213
And it turns out again that that's 3.7 times ten to the 10th, the celebrations per second or one curie and then the Becquerel,

632
01:05:02,214 --> 01:05:12,504
as I said, is equal to 3.7 times ten to the 10th series or I'm sorry, one Curie is 3.7 times ten to the 10th Becquerels.

633
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:22,344
So when we're talking about activity again, if I imagine just some generic exposure scenario where I might have a lab worker here who.

634
01:05:22,664 --> 01:05:27,184
Is working with radioactive materials. Well, I've got some kind of source in there.

635
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:29,234
That's where the radiation is being emitted from.

636
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:35,984
And I can describe that in terms of curies or becquerel or disintegration per second, any of those are totally fine.

637
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:41,814
I can also talk about the energy that's emitted through that radioactive decay.

638
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:47,924
And typically we describe that energy either with joules or with electron volts.

639
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:51,794
And so again, I've got my source. That's where the activity occurs.

640
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:55,994
The energy is basically what's being emitted from that source.

641
01:05:56,084 --> 01:06:03,014
And then last but not least, I have the dose. So that's how much is potentially getting into my lab worker here.

642
01:06:03,854 --> 01:06:11,204
And so dose we got, as is often the case, a sort of hodgepodge of units to deal with here.

643
01:06:12,044 --> 01:06:16,754
So in the US we typically use rads when we're talking about dose.

644
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:26,054
So that stands for radiation absorbed dose. But the international system or the metric system uses grades which are abbreviated to G UI.

645
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:29,473
So one grade is equal to 100 rads.

646
01:06:29,474 --> 01:06:33,684
At least they meet the exchange rate. They're relatively easy to remember.

647
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:39,374
And so a rad is basically how much energy is getting deposited per mass.

648
01:06:39,384 --> 01:06:43,514
So how much radiation got into me per kilogram of body weight, for instance.

649
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:48,973
Now, the issue with Rads, they're useful, but they really don't account for the type of radiation.

650
01:06:48,974 --> 01:06:55,934
So one round of alpha radiation would be considered equivalent to one rad of beta radiation.

651
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:59,864
But from a tissue perspective, that's not an accurate way to describe things.

652
01:07:00,464 --> 01:07:09,283
So really what we want to get to in terms of my human tissues getting exposed to radiation are these units here we've got RAM and we've got sieverts.

653
01:07:09,284 --> 01:07:13,634
So RAM is the US unit and it stands for Redken equivalent man.

654
01:07:13,754 --> 01:07:21,914
This is the name of a Scotsman, I think, who initially discovered this one sievert is equivalent to 100 REM here.

655
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:26,504
And so rather than just calling this dose, we think of it, this is a dose equivalent.

656
01:07:26,514 --> 01:07:31,904
It accounts for how much radiation got into you, but it also accounts for the type of radiation that you're exposed to.

657
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:39,364
And so if we want to talk about a dose equivalent here, we would talk about dose in terms of RAM.

658
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:44,563
And they're going to multiply by some quality factor. And I'll show you what that is in just a moment.

659
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:49,094
So Ram, this measure of dose equivalent is equivalent to RADS.

660
01:07:49,094 --> 01:07:54,034
So that's how much radiation is absorbed multiplied by this quality factor.

661
01:07:54,044 --> 01:07:57,224
And so quality factor turns out to be pretty important.

662
01:07:58,034 --> 01:08:04,844
So when we talk about X-rays and gamma rays and for the most part beta particles as well,

663
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,534
you'll see here if we go, well, let me even take a step back.

664
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:14,264
So we've got different kinds of radioactive decays on the left column here, right from X-ray down to Alpha.

665
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:21,284
Let's say we have one rad of dose that occurs from each of these types of radiation.

666
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:27,074
Well, we have to account for the fact that an X-ray and a gamma ray and a beta particle, for the most part,

667
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:32,774
are in a zip right through you and not deposited a lot of energy, whereas alpha particles are quite massive.

668
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:32,953
You know,

669
01:08:32,954 --> 01:08:42,284
this is a most of a helion nucleus and they're going to tend to impart their energy in a different way and be much more energetic to begin with.

670
01:08:42,974 --> 01:08:51,264
So if we think about quality factor here, we might think of that sort of as the oomph that comes along with this particular radioactive decay.

671
01:08:51,284 --> 01:08:55,034
So alpha particles have this quality factor of 20.

672
01:08:55,694 --> 01:09:00,674
And so if we put these in a football analogy and it's imperfect, but bear with me, you know,

673
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:05,224
an alpha particle might be the guy on the field who's like four times the size of anybody else.

674
01:09:05,234 --> 01:09:12,044
Incredibly massive, not very fast, probably not going to travel very far, but pretty much unstoppable over that distance.

675
01:09:13,004 --> 01:09:17,893
So our alpha particles here, again, are kind of those linebackers that are massive.

676
01:09:17,894 --> 01:09:26,504
They have this huge quality factor. And so we end up with one rad of exposure to alpha particles is equivalent to 20 REM,

677
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:31,754
just accounting for the fact that they do deposit so much energy and they are so energetic to begin with.

678
01:09:32,564 --> 01:09:37,754
On the other hand, X-rays, gamma rays and beta particles are more like maybe a wide receiver or something.

679
01:09:37,754 --> 01:09:46,184
So they go very far, but they're not very massive and they might be easily stopped if they hit something or sorry, not very massive.

680
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:53,654
And so they they end up just sort of squirting right through whatever they're encountering, including human including human tissue.

681
01:09:54,464 --> 01:09:57,254
So so this quality factor turns out to be very important.

682
01:09:57,254 --> 01:10:05,774
And again, the key here is for x rays and gamma rays and beta particles, we assign them a quality factor of one.

683
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:10,214
So RAM is the unit we're really trying to get into. That's our dose equivalent.

684
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:16,483
And four x rays and gamma rays and beta particles REM is just equal to rats.

685
01:10:16,484 --> 01:10:21,643
Those are essentially interchangeable. Whereas for alpha particles.

686
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:28,754
And again, we're. Pretty much ignoring neutrons here. For alpha particles, we have this extremely high quality factor of 20,

687
01:10:28,764 --> 01:10:36,054
and so rads for alpha particles are not equivalent to when one round of alpha is equivalent to 20 RAD.

688
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:42,684
And so this is just kind of a fundamental aspect of these units that we use to describe those.

689
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:48,964
And so if you're given a question that's asking about Ram and you're given Rads,

690
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:52,373
you'll need to remember or at least be able to navigate to the slide and figure out,

691
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:58,104
gosh, you know, I feel like the lighter, non dense or even, you know, no mass at all.

692
01:10:58,104 --> 01:11:02,183
Like the x rays and gamma rays feel like they didn't have much of a quality factories.

693
01:11:02,184 --> 01:11:07,014
Those alpha particles have this huge quality factor because they're enormous and very energetic.

694
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:14,783
So from our source, we get activity. That activity creates energy that travels through the environment.

695
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:19,974
And then when we hit our worker or our community member here, we're talking in terms of dose.

696
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:25,854
And so, again, we have rads and grays which are unadjusted for equality factor,

697
01:11:25,854 --> 01:11:29,483
and we have REM and sieverts which are adjusted for that quality factor.

698
01:11:29,484 --> 01:11:33,624
And so REM and sieverts are kind of our gold standard units that we're striving for here.

699
01:11:36,274 --> 01:11:39,843
There's another unit that gets thrown out. So this is Renton's.

700
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:44,374
Again, it's not really specific to human tissue.

701
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:49,654
So REMS, we consider to be, you know, the dose received in human tissue.

702
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:55,444
Red organs are sort of like how much might get in contact with your body without getting into it.

703
01:11:55,454 --> 01:12:00,724
It's kind of a funky unit. It doesn't have an international system equivalent.

704
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:07,954
People don't really use this, but you will find it labeled on instruments as we'll see when we play with instruments in a couple of lectures.

705
01:12:09,004 --> 01:12:12,254
So regions are abbreviated as a capital R here.

706
01:12:12,274 --> 01:12:17,104
And again, the reason I bring these up is because although it's sort of a historical holdover,

707
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:23,314
I would say many, if not most radiation measuring instruments still are capable of measuring rankings.

708
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:31,893
And, you know, you talk about kind of an obscure value here. So one ranking is the amount of radiation that produces one electrostatic unit of

709
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:35,644
charge in one cubic centimeter of dry air and standard temperature and pressure.

710
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,963
Like, I fell asleep just reading that. So it's not not super relevant,

711
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:45,634
but it is something that instruments are capable of measuring and will actually take advantage of that in some of our exercises.

712
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:53,284
So Renton's kind of floating off here on its own maybe is a step sort of between energy and dose.

713
01:12:55,514 --> 01:12:59,974
All right. Let's do a quick poll everywhere here, and it looks like this is actually working.

714
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:07,784
So, again, just to bring us back to reality and punctuate these dry technical comments with something a little more applied.

715
01:13:08,354 --> 01:13:17,053
So my question for you here is, if we think about who might be out there looking after us in terms of our radiation exposure,

716
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:20,383
either in the workplace or in the community,

717
01:13:20,384 --> 01:13:29,564
I'm curious which of these agencies you think has a required or a recommended exposure limit specific to ionizing radiation?

718
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:39,284
Excellent. So for those of you, I think we've talked about most of these agencies already.

719
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:45,734
Again, this is a voluntary group that comes up with recommendations for lots of occupational exposures.

720
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:51,343
Nash is the agency that's funding many of you to come to graduate school and

721
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:55,604
is kind of the research arm for health and safety for the federal government.

722
01:13:56,444 --> 01:14:00,433
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for that.

723
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:06,194
Essentially all applications of radiation in the US, OSHA, of course,

724
01:14:06,194 --> 01:14:15,524
is our mandated kind of legally required standard setting body that that sets the bare minimum limits that people have to follow in the workplace.

725
01:14:16,214 --> 01:14:24,224
And then MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, is sort of like OSHA, but specific only to mines which historically were so dangerous.

726
01:14:24,224 --> 01:14:28,123
They needed their own sort of watchdog there. Okay.

727
01:14:28,124 --> 01:14:30,944
So looks like folks are still answering here.

728
01:14:31,184 --> 01:14:43,544
There's a clear thought that HGH has a limit for ionizing radiation, maybe not so much for Nash and sort of somewhere in between for the NRC and OSHA.

729
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:51,464
And we've got moisture coming up. I will say for the most part, if OSHA has a limit, MSHA will also have a limit.

730
01:14:52,514 --> 01:14:59,384
The rules are basically that the administrations have to be consistent with each other and be at least as protective as each other.

731
01:15:00,224 --> 01:15:06,524
Okay. And so I can tell you, you're absolutely right. HGH definitely recommends a limit for ionizing radiation.

732
01:15:07,394 --> 01:15:12,104
The NRC also absolutely sets a limit for ionizing radiation.

733
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:17,744
OSHA and MSHA have kind of a mixed bag.

734
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:23,534
MSHA, for instance, has a regulation specific to radon or radon equivalents.

735
01:15:23,864 --> 01:15:29,174
And I ash, I actually think doesn't have an emerging radiation limit.

736
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:32,354
But I'm going to have to double check that. I mean, to look at this right before class started.

737
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:39,043
So I will circle back around on that. But again, the vast majority of your right, HGH, definitely has limits.

738
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:42,494
And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission definitely has limits to in fact,

739
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:49,783
if we take a look at the NRC specifically, so the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, again,

740
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:54,504
is kind of responsible for all aspects of potential radiation use and exposure in the

741
01:15:54,504 --> 01:15:59,624
U.S. And so you'll see they have actually a whole bunch of different limits here.

742
01:15:59,654 --> 01:16:06,554
So 5000 mg per year is the same as five REM per year.

743
01:16:07,004 --> 01:16:08,444
And so that's actually the limit.

744
01:16:08,454 --> 01:16:17,704
If you're a worker working in a nuclear power generation generating station, you are allowed to get five gram of radiation into your body every year.

745
01:16:18,134 --> 01:16:19,724
If you're below that number, you're fine.

746
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:25,244
If you go above that number, you're going to have to be removed from that radiation exposure for the rest of the year.

747
01:16:25,844 --> 01:16:35,174
And then your exposure basically resets on January 1st so your whole body can get five REM or 5000 milligrams per year.

748
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:41,474
Any particular organ within your body can actually get 50 REM per year.

749
01:16:41,474 --> 01:16:45,944
So we're treating your whole body is different than one particular organ system.

750
01:16:46,484 --> 01:16:52,244
Your skin, for instance, can also get 50 REM per year, your extremities.

751
01:16:52,244 --> 01:16:57,164
So your fingers and feet or your hands and your feet can also get 50 REM per year.

752
01:16:57,704 --> 01:17:04,754
But the lens of the eye turns out to be a little more sensitive and you can get up to 15 REM per year.

753
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:11,954
Also, if you are pregnant. So of course workers in every workplace can be pregnant.

754
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:21,014
And if you're a pregnant woman or a person with a child in a nuclear power plant, then you're allowed only a half a room per year.

755
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:25,274
The concern there being, well, we've got the parent being exposed.

756
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:29,683
We also have exposure happening to the embryo. And many of you, if not all of you,

757
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:35,173
probably know that a developing embryo is much more susceptible to things like radiation

758
01:17:35,174 --> 01:17:39,254
and chemical exposures than an adult would be because its systems are developing.

759
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:43,664
And lastly, we can come down to a member of the public.

760
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:48,944
So if you're a worker in that nuclear power plant, you are allowed five REM per year.

761
01:17:49,454 --> 01:17:54,254
If you're a community member who lives a half a mile from where that worker is working, you're only allowed.

762
01:17:54,614 --> 01:18:03,784
One REM per year, 100 milligrams. The idea here being we can give workers a higher limit because we're monitoring these people every single day.

763
01:18:03,794 --> 01:18:08,494
We know exactly how much radiation they got. Members of the public, we're not measuring every day.

764
01:18:08,504 --> 01:18:11,233
We might make some measurements around the facility,

765
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:15,644
but we want to make sure that they're getting just a fraction of what's happening inside the facility

766
01:18:16,184 --> 01:18:20,024
because unlike the workers who at least nominally have a choice of where they want to work,

767
01:18:20,024 --> 01:18:23,084
the public has no control over this exposure.

768
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:29,864
All right. So let's go ahead and wrap up now on the homestretch here.

769
01:18:30,554 --> 01:18:39,043
And so basically what we're going to talk about now is when some form of radioactivity encounters matter, what's going to happen?

770
01:18:39,044 --> 01:18:42,734
So be that an alpha particle or a beta or an x ray right here.

771
01:18:43,994 --> 01:18:49,814
And essentially we've got two different sort of broad types of ionizing radiation we can consider.

772
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:54,134
So we have alpha and beta, which we can call directly ionizing.

773
01:18:54,134 --> 01:19:01,424
In other words, these can sort of interact with an atom and they might actually knock off a charged electron.

774
01:19:01,424 --> 01:19:07,753
They're actually doing ionization here or directly ionizing, and then we can have indirectly ionizing.

775
01:19:07,754 --> 01:19:17,444
So photons of energy like X-rays and Gammas can interact with the electron shell around the nucleus of an atom.

776
01:19:17,444 --> 01:19:21,434
And through that interaction, they might actually cause an electron to be ejected.

777
01:19:22,064 --> 01:19:27,314
So those are kind of the two broad categories, but we'll delve into these a little bit more deeply.

778
01:19:28,124 --> 01:19:33,104
So again, alpha particles, these are those supermassive helium nuclei floating around.

779
01:19:33,614 --> 01:19:38,294
Most of what they do in terms of interacting with other matter is direct ionization.

780
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:46,934
So they're going to cause, as you saw here, they're going to hit this electron shell and cause, for instance, a charged electron to be ejected.

781
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:52,483
They can also collide with things. So it's statistically very low probability.

782
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:58,904
But an alpha could hit the nucleus of another atom and as an alpha particle slows.

783
01:19:58,904 --> 01:20:06,973
So it's it's very massive, very energetic. But it doesn't travel so far because it's so big and it tends to slow down pretty fast as it's

784
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:12,374
slowing the chances of it actually encountering another atom long enough to interact increase.

785
01:20:12,644 --> 01:20:19,094
So the higher the speed, the more likely it is to just zip through something and the lower the speed, the more likely there is for ionization.

786
01:20:20,444 --> 01:20:24,013
Now, beta particles, again, these are much smaller than an alpha particle.

787
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:30,493
This is just a single little electron. They can have two possibilities when they interact with matter.

788
01:20:30,494 --> 01:20:34,064
We've got inelastic scattering and we've got elastic scattering.

789
01:20:34,994 --> 01:20:44,684
And so inelastic scattering, we've got an electron that essentially zips out of nowhere and hits the electron shell of another atom,

790
01:20:45,284 --> 01:20:49,064
and it ends up transferring its energy into that atom and the atom.

791
01:20:49,064 --> 01:20:52,844
Then to get rid of that extra energy kicks out a separate electron.

792
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:59,474
So we've got essentially a little bit of energy lost as this first electron hits the atom.

793
01:21:00,044 --> 01:21:04,873
And then most of that energy is transferred to kicking out a separate new electron.

794
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:08,774
But largely the amount of energy overall is is quite similar.

795
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:18,854
Or we have this elastic scattering here. And so this would be we've got an electron that ends up coming in to another atom and

796
01:21:18,854 --> 01:21:24,973
essentially slingshot around its nucleus and then leaving in a different direction.

797
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:29,744
So the electrons direction has been changed by interacting with this nucleus here.

798
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:35,534
In this case, we have essentially new energy that's been transferred from the beta particle to the atom.

799
01:21:38,484 --> 01:21:43,434
Some of you may have heard of this word here, but I'm strong. So this is a great old German word.

800
01:21:43,944 --> 01:21:46,973
It applies specifically to beta particles.

801
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:55,224
So if we've got electrons that are hitting high Z material, as you see here, so a material that has lots of protons in it.

802
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:59,514
So this is going to be one of our heavier radioisotopes.

803
01:22:00,024 --> 01:22:05,124
So if we get an electron that comes into a high Z material with lots of protons in there,

804
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:10,044
it's going to end up slowing down or maybe even stopping completely.

805
01:22:10,404 --> 01:22:14,904
If it's just slows down, it may exit the the atom.

806
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:16,494
So that's elastic scattering.

807
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:26,354
But if it stops completely, all that energy that results from it essentially breaking into this atom is going to be released as strongly.

808
01:22:26,364 --> 01:22:29,574
And we're essentially what's called breaking radiation here.

809
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:36,234
So you can see in the animation, we've got an electron that comes into this electron shell of an atom,

810
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:43,704
and as it slows down and gets captured, it releases this wave of what can be gamma or X-ray radiation.

811
01:22:44,424 --> 01:22:53,094
And so for this reason, if we've got a radioactive source that's creating a lot of beta particles and we're thinking about,

812
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:57,744
for instance, well, how would I shield people from getting exposed to those beta particles?

813
01:22:58,284 --> 01:23:05,274
I don't want to use a shielding material that has lots of protons in it, because when those beta particles hit that shielding material,

814
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:10,463
now instead of reducing radiation, I'm going to create a secondary burst of photon radiation.

815
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:19,134
So that's bad. So from a practical application here, this means if I've got a medical procedure that involves a lot of beta radiation,

816
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:27,984
I want to put somebody in a material that's not going to cause additional radiation exposure, something with low Z number, not a high Z number.

817
01:23:30,144 --> 01:23:34,914
When we have beta particles, we can also have something called positron annihilation here.

818
01:23:34,914 --> 01:23:40,884
So if we have essentially a positively charged electron and we're not going to get into this any more than what you see on the slide,

819
01:23:41,274 --> 01:23:46,973
but if I have a regular electron in a positron and they collide, they essentially annihilate each other.

820
01:23:46,974 --> 01:23:52,463
The positive and the negative charges cancel out and they will emit two gamma rays, pretty energetic.

821
01:23:52,464 --> 01:23:55,914
So about 511 kilo electron volts.

822
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:01,884
And then those gamma rays can go on and interact with other types of materials through either

823
01:24:01,884 --> 01:24:05,874
the full electric effect or Compton scattering that we're going to talk about in just a moment.

824
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:13,283
So for beta particles, again, this is just a single electron. We're talking about very little mass, you might ask.

825
01:24:13,284 --> 01:24:16,644
Well, like how far is a beta particle actually going to travel?

826
01:24:17,034 --> 01:24:21,113
What are we talking about here? And the range is essentially determined by, well,

827
01:24:21,114 --> 01:24:28,134
how much room for how much energy was behind that electron when it got kicked out and what's the density of whatever it's traveling through?

828
01:24:28,884 --> 01:24:35,033
So the graph here on the right is essentially presented as though this beta

829
01:24:35,034 --> 01:24:39,174
particle is traveling through like a cubic centimeter of soft tissue humans,

830
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:45,473
in other words. So you can see we have increasing electron energy on the x axis and range on the y axis.

831
01:24:45,474 --> 01:24:51,564
And so the more room for the more energy there was behind that electron to begin with, the farther it's going to travel.

832
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:54,623
And I think that kind of makes sense. But it also applies here.

833
01:24:54,624 --> 01:25:03,684
It's sort of subatomic scales. And the other thing we can think about on the flip side is, well, what is sort of the stopping power of material?

834
01:25:03,684 --> 01:25:07,343
So if I've got radiation exposure, I think you'll all agree with me.

835
01:25:07,344 --> 01:25:11,753
I don't want human bodies to be the stopping material. I want to stop it before it gets to the people.

836
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:21,354
Right. And so I need to think about, well, what kinds of materials would be appropriate here and for different types of sort of energy bands,

837
01:25:21,654 --> 01:25:27,834
you know, a different element might be a more appropriate blocking material, basically.

838
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:36,024
Okay. Okay. So what we've been talking to so far is the particle radiation, the alpha and the beta particles.

839
01:25:36,024 --> 01:25:40,974
But what happens with these photons, these waves of energy like x rays and gammas?

840
01:25:41,664 --> 01:25:46,464
Well, these are no longer directly ionizing. So this isn't going to hit an atom and knock off an electron.

841
01:25:46,824 --> 01:25:50,004
Here we have essentially indirect interactions.

842
01:25:50,664 --> 01:25:57,233
And so if I imagine, you know, a conceptual human body here, I've got really just a limited range of options here.

843
01:25:57,234 --> 01:26:03,054
So if I'm hit by a wave of radioactive energy, it could penetrate me, it could zip right through me.

844
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:11,844
It could be completely absorbed within my body or it might be scattered where it ends up hitting part of me.

845
01:26:12,204 --> 01:26:16,374
And some of the energy is deposited and some of it scatters and passes through my body.

846
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,453
And so for these photon interactions,

847
01:26:20,454 --> 01:26:28,074
we've really got three primary effects here that we refer to is the photoelectric effect Compton scattering and pair production.

848
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:35,004
So let's look into these. The first example here is that photoelectric effect, and this would apply to kind of low energy.

849
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:39,074
So relatively little room for. These x rays and gamma rays.

850
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:45,614
And so what can happen is we end up with this incident x ray or gamma ray that hits an electron shell,

851
01:26:46,184 --> 01:26:54,133
that that photon of energy essentially collides with one of the electrons in the shell and kicks out an electron

852
01:26:54,134 --> 01:27:00,314
that gets emitted and is basically containing the same amount of energy that that incident photon did.

853
01:27:01,184 --> 01:27:05,803
A little bit of energy is lost because this electron has to break free from the electron cloud.

854
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,694
It's held there with some force.

855
01:27:08,594 --> 01:27:15,794
But basically, we've got, you know, a little bit of energy coming in and an electron emitted basically the same amount of total energy.

856
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:22,514
Compton Scattering happens with more medium oomph or medium energy, gamma rays and X-rays.

857
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:30,944
And so here we're going to have our photon coming into the electron shell here, and it's essentially going to cause an electron to be kicked out.

858
01:27:31,394 --> 01:27:36,104
And some of that energy remains, and it's going to continue on as a wave.

859
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:42,884
So unlike this first one, where all of the energy, the photon essentially gets admitted as an electron, in this case,

860
01:27:42,884 --> 01:27:49,454
we've got enough energy that an electron is emitted and the wave still continues on at some slightly decreased energy level.

861
01:27:51,134 --> 01:27:56,594
And then we can get power production here. And this really only happens with super high energy gamma as in X-rays.

862
01:27:57,074 --> 01:28:02,863
And so what happens here is that photons of that wave of gamma or X-ray energy is so

863
01:28:02,864 --> 01:28:07,814
powerful that it cuts all the way through the electron cloud and makes it to the nucleus.

864
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:10,424
And you've got to have an extreme amount of power to do that.

865
01:28:11,144 --> 01:28:21,494
And so here, if that photon hits the nucleus and this is, you know, a relatively rare reaction because keep in mind, 99% of atoms are empty space.

866
01:28:22,454 --> 01:28:23,954
But if that photon hits the nucleus,

867
01:28:23,954 --> 01:28:34,214
we end up with this beta minus or electron that gets ejected and we end up with a positron or a positively charged electron that also gets ejected.

868
01:28:34,694 --> 01:28:41,743
And so, again, the energy here is too much for the release of one electron to kind of relieve that energy.

869
01:28:41,744 --> 01:28:47,264
And so we get two particles that are oppositely charged that get emitted here.

870
01:28:47,954 --> 01:28:52,514
So now we've got this negative electron floating around and a positron floating around, too.

871
01:28:53,024 --> 01:29:01,334
Eventually those two may run into each other by chance, and then we get that annihilation reaction where two gamma rays get created there.

872
01:29:01,814 --> 01:29:08,474
And what's more, those gamma rays can go on in and interfere, so we can end up with kind of a chain reaction that occurs.

873
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:17,533
All right. So just in conclusion here, we're talking about subatomic scale interactions here.

874
01:29:17,534 --> 01:29:24,734
None of this can be sort of reliably predicted beyond sort of what is the statistic probability of an interaction to occur.

875
01:29:25,544 --> 01:29:30,764
And so we know a few times a punch through you and never interact with your tissues at all.

876
01:29:30,854 --> 01:29:37,633
You go through all that empty space in the atoms that leave you unchanged, or it might actually impinge on an atom.

877
01:29:37,634 --> 01:29:46,514
And we get an effect here. And so the whole goal of this graph here is we've got sort of energy on the x axis from low energy to high energy,

878
01:29:47,084 --> 01:29:49,334
and then we've got the different effects.

879
01:29:49,424 --> 01:29:56,774
So we've got photoelectric kind of low energy, Compton scattering kind of the mid energy and then pair production at the high energy.

880
01:29:57,314 --> 01:30:03,464
And then we can also consider that in terms of what is the material that's absorbing this radiation,

881
01:30:03,794 --> 01:30:07,364
does it not have many protons in it or does it have a lot of protons in it?

882
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:15,314
And so statistically, we can kind of predict what kind of reaction do we think should happen given this material and given the kind of radiation?

883
01:30:16,814 --> 01:30:21,254
And so just in conclusion here, I'll say from a practical perspective,

884
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:31,424
what we want to figure out is what kind of decay do we have and what sorts of materials can we use to block that radiation from getting into us,

885
01:30:31,424 --> 01:30:39,253
into people. And so just, you know, closing comment, I'll say alphas are very massive and very energetic,

886
01:30:39,254 --> 01:30:43,723
but they are stopped by the first surface that they interact with.

887
01:30:43,724 --> 01:30:48,794
So an alpha particle can actually be stopped by a single sheet of paper or layered that skin on your body.

888
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:56,444
For instance, a beta particle will make it through that paper, but can be stopped by just a thin piece of wood, for example, or aluminum.

889
01:30:56,984 --> 01:31:02,204
An x ray is going to zip through all of that, but will be stopped by something dense like land or iron.

890
01:31:03,014 --> 01:31:07,904
A gamma ray is sort of the same, and neutron particles, which we're not really talking about here,

891
01:31:08,234 --> 01:31:14,504
we'll go through all of that and can really only be stopped by things with a very low end like water,

892
01:31:14,504 --> 01:31:19,633
for instance, or a very low Z number, I should say. So again,

893
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:24,974
the type of radiation we have is going to dictate how concerned we are about that and what protective

894
01:31:24,974 --> 01:31:29,714
steps we might need to take to make sure that people don't get too much of a dose into that.

895
01:31:30,704 --> 01:31:34,364
All right. With that, I will wrap up the lecture here.

896
01:31:34,844 --> 01:31:40,214
We're going to talk about some of the biological effects of. Of radiation. Next time we'll talk about instrumentation as well.

897
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:42,554
And apologies for going over 2 minutes here.

898
01:31:43,544 --> 01:31:50,084
So just as a reminder, as I'm shutting this down, I will not be in class next week or the following week because I'm out of the country.

899
01:31:50,474 --> 01:31:56,104
But you've got all the prerecorded videos to watch. And certainly if you have questions, I will be accessible by email.

900
01:31:56,114 --> 01:31:59,504
Just let me know otherwise. Thanks, everybody, and have a great afternoon.

901
01:31:59,964 --> 01:32:00,554
Thank you to.
