1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,020
All right. Sorry. And so, you know, we name cancers after the cells that they arise from.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,479
And so in this case, squamous epithelium, same squamous epithelium, it's on your skin, but they act differently.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,350
And that's something you just have to think about. They have different same names. They act very differently.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,069
We treat them very differently. And so, like I said, we then characterize which parts of the body they come from.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,860
Is it from the nose is from the oral cavity, the mouth,

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,760
is it from the throat or is it from what we call your pharynx, which is your base of your tongue or your tonsils?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,190
Because they actually act differently. They arise from different sort of risk factors, but in their cancer in general is really relatively rare.

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:52,840
3% of all cancers in the US, you know, overall nationally we see about 60, 60,000 a year, predominantly in men, about a 2 to 1, 3 to 1 ratio.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,450
You know, we lose about 13, 14,000 patients a year from head and neck cancer.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:04,599
Again, predominantly, you know, men. But like we talked about, this is basic anatomy of the head neck.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,309
So this is your nose right here, and that's the nasal cavity and then this is your mouth.

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,780
And so we talk about mouth as oral cavity. That's your tongue that you can see the inside of your cheeks, the lining of your teeth,

13
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,549
the alveolar ridge, and then the oral pharynx is your base of tongues, just part of the tongue.

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:27,490
You can't necessarily see your tonsils out. Maybe you're targeting and you're younger, but those are your tonsils.

15
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,740
That's part of your appearance. And then the larynx or the throat is your voice box.

16
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,320
So your Adam's apple and then you have the vocal cords that help you generate sound for speech.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:46,720
And those are the main kind of regions of the head and neck that we deal with in terms of squamous cell carcinoma and traditional risk factors.

18
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,770
So carcinoma really cigaret smoking, you know, we know it causes lung cancer,

19
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,870
a number of other cancers, but this one definitely is implicated in 75% of all head and neck cancers.

20
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,200
It causes a 2 to 6 fold increased risk of developing a second head neck cancer.

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,490
So it's why I'm always telling my patients, yes, we cured you, this one cancer.

22
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,240
But if you keep smoking, you have a high risk of developing a second cancer,

23
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,190
let alone lung cancer, let alone, you know, COPD, emphysema, other things like that.

24
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:27,220
Smokeless tobacco. My patients who chew tobacco, you know, they keep in their front, lower lip baffled about lip cancer or gum cancer.

25
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,170
And that's also fairly high within the US and then alcohol use.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,160
So alcohol by itself predominantly we talk of like darker liquors, like scotch, whiskey, bourbon.

27
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,080
Those have a higher risk. I'm not advocating you drink clear vodka, but you know, we do know that darker alcohol has a higher risk.

28
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:54,910
You combine that with cigaret smoking and then you get up to a 10 to 15 fold increased risk of developing head neck cancer.

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,110
And that, unfortunately, is what I see. A lot of my patients are big time smokers, big time alcohol use and have them say, how much do you drink?

30
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,430
Oh, I drink one or two drinks at night. And I tell the residents, you need to quantify that.

31
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,190
Right. How much is one drink to you?

32
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,819
And I had this one woman who was drinking, whatever, like five tallboys, which I had to look up how big those are.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,120
Those are like giant beers. And she was doing like five or six at night, you know.

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,329
So that gives you some perspective, you know.

35
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,100
And then in Southeast Asian India,

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,810
betel quit is something that patients chew is much like smokeless tobacco and often developed like gum and cheek cancer.

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,770
And then the other main risk factor, and this is becoming more and more prevalent within our patient population, is human papillomavirus.

38
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:45,640
So we know fairly well that it causes cervical cancer, but actually head neck, particularly pharynx cancer,

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,560
this is now the most common cancer caused by HPV and we're starting to see it more and more.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,509
We see this in our non smokers and we see it in our nonalcoholic in younger patients, still more men than than women.

41
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:07,480
But it's unfortunately equalizing, you know. And so that's one of the newer kind of portions of head neck cancer that we're starting to see.

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,180
When we think about the different types of cancers, each of them act differently.

43
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:21,730
Like we talked about your oral cavity cancer, we typically will treat with surgery, you know, throat cancer or ovarian cancer.

44
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,980
We need to choose surgery or radiation and chemotherapy or some combination of them.

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,100
But those are kind of the three main kind of treatment modalities.

46
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,489
Immunotherapy is one of the newer drugs which I'm sure you guys have heard about.

47
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,270
If you watch any TV, you see advertisements for immunotherapy,

48
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,210
it's still in it's kind of like juvenile state within head neck cancer and how can we actually use it?

49
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,030
And mostly phase two trials or early kind of stage trials, what we're looking at.

50
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,850
But when we look at changes over time in terms of in terms of treatment,

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,900
we see a decrease in surgery over the last several decades, an increase of radiation, chemotherapy and the reason why.

52
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,570
Is surgery will remove whatever organ is affected, whereas radiation,

53
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,530
chemotherapy in theory lead to what we call organ preservation in the vast majority of people,

54
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,800
given the option, who wants to lose their voice box or who wants to keep it?

55
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,270
Most people want to keep it right. And so we've started to see kind of changes in trends.

56
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,150
That being said, though, as cancer doesn't always abide by what we think is best for patients.

57
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,820
And like I said, you have to think about the sub site. Where is this and what is the best type of treatment?

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,940
Oral cavity cancer. We know that if you try treating that with chemo and radiation, they predominantly fail.

59
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,749
Actually, when I was a resident, I reran a trial looking at that.

60
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,379
And people people did really poorly. So we don't recommend chemo radiation for oral cavity cancers.

61
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,510
The surgery is really their their main treatment.

62
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,050
We do give radiation and chemotherapy on the back end to improve their chances of survival and beating the cancer.

63
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,649
Like I said, pharynx and larynx, those those are kind of nice.

64
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,770
You have different choices. Sometimes you have a small surgery and avoid radiation, chemotherapy.

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,700
Sometimes you need radiation and chemotherapy or in rare cases, you need all three.

66
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,400
But that's kind of one of the places where we've been able to evolve a little bit in terms of what our treatment.

67
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,510
But again, your treatment goals when I talk to my patients is we want to optimize, you know, your cure rate.

68
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,220
That's what most people want to know. Doc, am I going to beat this cancer and what are my odds?

69
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,090
Right. But you also want to try and minimize the functional impact.

70
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,650
And this is where in head neck you don't really realize how important your tongue is, how important your voice box is.

71
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,330
But once you lose one of those things, it's really hard to talk.

72
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,670
And as you guys all know, talking is a critical component of who we are as human beings.

73
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,799
Tongue in the mouth is also really important for swallowing. I want you guys to do something.

74
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,030
I want you to take your tongue out. You push it down into front, bombard your mouth.

75
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,310
I want you to try and talk like you notice that you do the articulation.

76
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,360
Your tongue is really important for forming words.

77
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,220
I also want you to do the same thing, not try to swallow your saliva or coffee or whatever you have in front of you.

78
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,200
You'll realize how hard it is to swallow when your tongue doesn't move normally.

79
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,130
And these are things you don't think about. You've been born with your tongue working normal.

80
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,240
And so we have to think about what is the functional impact that's going to have.

81
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,570
I can hear a lot of people like cut off their head. Right.

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,510
That's not going to help them long term. You know, what is their quality of life?

83
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,980
So these are different components of oncology that we have to kind of think about.

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,480
And obviously, the head, neck, you know, cosmetics, right?

85
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,980
You remove the nose, you remove their entire cheek, their entire jaw.

86
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,940
Right. Those are deforming surgeries. People don't want to go out in public anymore.

87
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,480
You know, so you may cure them, but what have you done to their quality of life?

88
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,580
And so these are different things you have to kind of think about. So now we're going to get into some of the graphic kind of pictures.

89
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,320
So if anybody wants, like I said, put your head down. Take a step outside.

90
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,800
I won't be offended. You're not going to get graded poorly.

91
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:14,590
Okay. But I kind of want to show you the impact that cancer can have and the treatments and the limitations of treatment that we have right now.

92
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,890
Okay. Anyway, and then midway through, if you need to run out, it's totally fine.

93
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,972
I've had many medical students pass out on me, so. Okay, so this is the case.

94
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:35,578
Right, in cancer related deaths have declined from 2013 to 2017.

95
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:41,758
I was talking predominant adult had neck cancer but other cancers breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer.

96
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:46,708
You know, a lot of these cancers actually are seeing improvement. And it is a direct result, you know, of research.

97
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:53,098
You know, that benefit has really been in women, you know, younger men, you know, children and things like that.

98
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:57,718
But we're still seeing in 2020. You know, 600,000 cancer deaths.

99
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,778
You know, that's a big number.

100
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:06,208
So, yes, we are seeing improvement, but that's still a lot of, you know, patients who are dying, you know, of their cancer.

101
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:10,918
And it's not from a lack of effort. I mean, this is NCI funding for cancer research.

102
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:18,058
You know, and you see that over the last 20 years, you know, that that money is continue to flow into the research labs,

103
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:23,458
but we're not seeing as much of the benefit or it's just very slow in terms of what we're seeing.

104
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:30,478
So why is research important? Translational research, you know, is knowledge flow from theory.

105
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:33,838
You know, what you come up with in the lab, what hypothesis you come up with,

106
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:38,638
you know, to actual practice, how do I apply this, you know, to patient care?

107
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:47,038
And that's the ultimate goal of translational research, basic science, discovery, early translation, late translation dissemination.

108
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:50,848
Just because you find if you don't tell people about it, then it's just can be stuck at your institution.

109
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:57,868
You know, and then adoption by the community at large. But you'll realize there are politics and medicine there.

110
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:01,408
Politics, oncology, we're all arrogant type people.

111
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:07,578
Right. So just because Ohio State says it's good to Michigan, be like, no, we're going to do it better, right?

112
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:13,438
Doesn't mean that's true. Just sometimes we have our we're stuck in stuck in our own preconceived notions.

113
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:19,318
But really, ultimately, we do all of this to improve the condition, human condition.

114
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:23,158
To those pictures I showed you, I have to be able to do something better.

115
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:30,658
I, I like surge. I actually love surgery, but I would prefer if I got to sit at home and give people a drug and not have to cut off half their head.

116
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,948
Right. That would actually be ideal for me because I think it would be better for people as a whole.

117
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:45,897
You know, translational research theory to practice bed to bedside or bench to bedside is kind of what what the ultimate goal is.

118
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:52,138
But it's complex. You know, I think you guys have talked about different types of studies.

119
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:56,758
Right. Like phase two clinical trials. Phase one, clinical trials. Have they talked about that a little bit?

120
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:05,428
Yeah. So basically, you know, preclinical work is I come up with idea they test in the lab, maybe it's in some animals.

121
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:10,138
They say, oh, look, this is this looks promising. The next thing we do is a phase one trial.

122
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:14,728
We say is this drug, is this procedure safe or not?

123
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:20,428
Is it better? Is it safe in people? That's a phase one trial and it's like ten, 20 patients.

124
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:25,048
Typically for these, if you start to see some efficacy and some safety and you say, okay,

125
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:31,608
now we're going to expand it out to extended safety and really start looking at like, is this having some sort of benefit?

126
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:37,588
Usually you compare it to historical control and you know, these are phase two trials where you have hundreds of patients.

127
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:43,197
We often will run phase two trials here at Michigan by ourselves, not, you know, multi-institutional.

128
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:47,038
We also run phase one trials. And then if that looks promising,

129
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:50,968
you then usually say we need to do a randomized controlled trial where you are going

130
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:56,188
to randomize people to whatever is the standard to your new experimental arm.

131
00:11:57,298 --> 00:12:00,298
And those typically are in the hundreds, if not thousands.

132
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:03,448
We are one of the busiest head and neck ecology programs in the country.

133
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:07,738
Yeah, we can't run a phase three trial by ourselves, so we have to be multi-institutional.

134
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:14,658
So then you have to work with others. Tuitions around the country to come up with the trial has to get funded.

135
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,568
You have to then recruit patients. And this takes years.

136
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:24,318
Usually from trial inception, when we come up with an idea to getting it started, is about 5 to 6 years.

137
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:28,518
When I was a fellow, I came up with an idea with one of my mentors.

138
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:33,078
We started the process going, This was 2014.

139
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,158
Just got started last year at the national level, right?

140
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:40,278
That took that long for us to get a trial up and running.

141
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:45,438
And that just goes to show just why things move kind of slowly.

142
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:51,317
The other challenge is the likelihood of approval, you know, is is actually not very good.

143
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,397
And this is what this chart is. These are different types of kind of studies.

144
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,038
This is, you know, hematology, infectious disease, ophthalmology.

145
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:02,988
They do really good, you know, really good, 20%, you know, but oncology,

146
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:13,398
only 5% of trials that start out as a phase one ever make it on to the drug approval or approval for patients by the FDA.

147
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:18,648
So it takes time, you know, and it's slow and there's any sort of problems.

148
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:22,878
And oftentimes we develop a trial and then technology changes.

149
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:30,828
But the trial's already been vetted. So we lose some of the the benefit of innovation just because of how the system is set up.

150
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:40,958
So that's some of the rationale why we struggle, you know, but cancer discovery is something that's been studied for thousands of years.

151
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:45,198
The Egyptians, you know, were the first to kind of describe cancer in 3000 B.C.,

152
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,788
you know, the properties, 400 B.C., you know, he actually termed carcinoma.

153
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:58,638
You know, it wasn't a very good way to find it. But yeah, we started to try to find it really wasn't until the 19th century with the light microscope,

154
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,998
we started to look at the cells and realized, that's a funny looking cell.

155
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:07,998
That cell looks more normal and start to talk about what is the actual cellular makeup of cancer,

156
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:11,058
not just cancer, but, you know, across human biology as a whole.

157
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:15,888
You know, I think one of the next biggest, you know, contributions was in 1953.

158
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:25,067
And Watson and Crick identified DNA. Right. Because that then kind of opened up the molecular era, you know, of of genomics and whatnot.

159
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:32,528
And then fast forward to the 21st century, you know, molecular oncology, we can now sequence a cancer, you know, fairly quickly.

160
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,708
Actually, we're running a trial.

161
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:40,428
We're trying to do rapid sequencing of like ten genes in 30 minutes so I can make a decision in the are based on some sort of molecular signature,

162
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:47,178
which is kind of cool. When I was a graduate student, it took us months to get any sort of sequencing data we were still doing.

163
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:52,298
Sanger Sequencing. That's probably the most you you've heard of. It just took a long time to do.

164
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,898
And so we were able to do things faster and better. The question is, how do we translate that?

165
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,207
This is one of my favorite quotes we'll talk about a little bit later.

166
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,528
But cancers are considered incurable when everybody is ignorant of their microscopic nature.

167
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:08,778
That was John Bennett. He was actually one of the early kind of like societal pathologists.

168
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:15,428
But understanding the small nature of cancer, you know, in his case, he's talking about the cells.

169
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,518
And we're going to talk a little bit about the genetics and the molecular components.

170
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:27,408
You know why you need to understand that to make any headway in in cancer treatment like we talk about,

171
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:33,108
you know, the Human Genome Project, you know, that was a big deal, $2.7 billion.

172
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,618
It took him 13 years to do it.

173
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:43,997
You know, 1990 was you guys, you've been born yet probably not getting there, you know, but 2003 is when it was ultimately published.

174
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:48,588
You know, that was a big deal. And I remember when this came out, I was a graduate student.

175
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:52,458
Right? Holy cow. This is gonna change the world. We're going to be able to sequence everybody.

176
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:58,348
We're going to know everything about everybody. Like all, all diseases are going to go away.

177
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:03,678
Obviously, we were wrong, you know, but it has helped us to a certain degree.

178
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:09,948
The other thing is we're I told you it took him 13 years to do that. I can now do a human genome in an hour.

179
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:15,288
Right. So, again, we have gotten better at what we're doing in terms of head and neck sequencing.

180
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:19,757
It took us another, you know, eight, nine years to then sequence head,

181
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:25,818
neck cancer genome to start to generally understand what is happening at that microscopic level.

182
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:33,108
Right. Like John Bennett said, you have to understand the kind of the small aspects of cancer and basically what we found.

183
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:41,748
These are two studies. This is out of M.D. Anderson, Johns Hopkins, where they basically looked at the different kind of genetics of cancer.

184
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:47,538
Again, this is just tells you what genes are mutated, how they're mutated and whatnot,

185
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:53,148
what percentage of them are p53 is one of the most common cancer genes that are altered.

186
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:58,008
So it didn't we knew that. We knew that before this was starting to just help kind of confirm it.

187
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,588
So it was helpful.

188
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:10,458
The next kind of major, kind of like learning iteration was probably the the tumor or the cancer genome atlas, which came out in 2013.

189
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:16,398
Where they actually were able to sequence several different types of cancers, breast, prostate,

190
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:23,687
whereby stem in the brain had neck cancer and we were able to start to look at cancers as a whole and say,

191
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:28,908
what are the common things between breast cancer and that cancer or what are the different combinations?

192
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:32,568
But they were able to use what we call a multi omega approach.

193
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,748
They looked at DNA and RNA. They looked at protein.

194
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:41,688
They digitized every one of the slides. They had to look at all the different types of alterations,

195
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:47,058
and then they put it into a public database that a lot of anyone you guys could actually pull up,

196
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:52,097
tag and look up whatever gene you want to look at and figure out what cancers that

197
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:56,028
gene is is overexpressed in and look at different kind of clinical features.

198
00:17:56,328 --> 00:18:04,788
So this was a big deal because it allowed us to start being able to do rapid hypothesis generation without having to do all of the heavy lifting.

199
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:09,198
Right. And it was done across multiple different types of cancers.

200
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:17,868
And so, you know, but these are kind of like this is just talks about the different pathways that are involved of the different specific genes.

201
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:24,768
But you can see that there's not a lot of overlap and there's not a lot of like obvious alterations.

202
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:28,338
And when we talk alterations, alterations that we can actually try and target.

203
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:33,288
This is the this is also looking at we call it tumor mutational burden.

204
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:37,158
We see that different tumors have more mutations than others.

205
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,788
And what does that actually mean? That leads to more heterogeneity.

206
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:47,088
And we do know that with more mutations you have, the more complex the tumors are, the harder it is for them to treat.

207
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:53,448
That being said, as we've also realized recently of yet more mutations. Immunotherapy typically works better for you.

208
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:56,208
So we've been able to flip it a little bit like with immunotherapy.

209
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:03,258
But when we talk about traditional therapy, higher mutational load usually meant you didn't do nearly as well.

210
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:07,968
And we think that's because you have a more complex, heterogeneous type of tumor.

211
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:14,778
And Head Neck is one of the more heterogeneous and mutational active tumors around.

212
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,818
This was in when was this come out? This is when they did have neck cancer.

213
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:25,548
Again, this is we expanded out to 279, had neck cancers and we were a part of this study.

214
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:29,178
And basically we found mutations everywhere.

215
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:38,718
This is this is a heatmap showing the different types of mutations, whether there they're missense mutations or not, that it doesn't really matter.

216
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,667
But when you kind of like I tell the graduate students,

217
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:47,928
kind of like defocus your eyes and you see any growth patterns and really maybe you see some clustering in this general area,

218
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:54,737
you know, but really there was a lot of variability across multiple different types of like clinical phenotypes.

219
00:19:54,738 --> 00:20:00,018
Was this in the mouth? Was this caused by a virus? When we talked about earlier, the virus ones actually respond better.

220
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:05,418
But when we look at the genetic level, they actually look a lot like the ones caused by smoking and drinking.

221
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,328
So there's something else going on. We just don't know what. Right.

222
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:13,208
And again, it's the complexity of the cancers that makes it very daunting and hard to take care of.

223
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:19,368
Same sort of thing as we looked at different mutations, you know, what are they?

224
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:27,528
How many are they? And what we found is that there's a lot they're all over the place and not along what we call driver mutations.

225
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:33,948
The driver mutations are genes that are overexpressed that cause cancer because they're overexpressed and cause cancer.

226
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:41,028
Then you can just knock it out, right, and target it. But most of them are their loss of activity.

227
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,048
And it's hard for us to give a drug to reactivate something. Right.

228
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:46,668
So we don't have a lot of targets.

229
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:52,968
We can't say, here's the drugs that block this gene or this gene expression, and we're going to be able to treat cancer.

230
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:57,258
And that's been one of the challenges that we're dealing with, is there's no obvious targets.

231
00:20:57,258 --> 00:21:01,848
There's been some really good successes in the former where they have found one gene alteration.

232
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:08,178
They found a drug that worked for it. So 90% of patients are here when they were down at 10%.

233
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:10,128
We don't see that in head neck.

234
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:17,298
We don't see that a lot of the breast cancer, lung cancers and things like that because we just don't have any targets to try and hit.

235
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:22,308
And that goes back to tumor heterogeneity because they're so varied.

236
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:27,828
It's hard to know exactly what each cancer cell is doing, what each cancer is doing.

237
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:35,837
You know, different tumor cells can show distinct variable morphology, their general appearance, you know, and also their phenotypic profiles.

238
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:45,168
What are they doing at the genetic level? And it's cause what we call intrinsic and extrinsic heterogeneity, intrinsic is the actual life cell.

239
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:49,358
Right. Does the cell a funny shape? Does it have kind of two nuclear?

240
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:53,327
They're separating, right. What are the chromosomes looking like?

241
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:57,828
What is the protein? Was the RNA? What's the DNA? Those are we call the intrinsic.

242
00:21:57,828 --> 00:22:02,088
What's happening inside the cell. Extrinsic is the difference between cancers.

243
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:10,368
So the tumor microenvironment. So it's not just the cancer cells, but the other cells around it, like fibroblast endothelial cells, immune cells.

244
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:18,668
Those have different kind of components. And those lead to some of this, what we call heterogeneity, you know, and obviously environmental exposures.

245
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:24,738
Some people smoke. Some people drink. Some people don't. But we don't know what's causing this kind of variance.

246
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:31,178
So you have to try and control for all of this and simplify it so we can identify different ways to target it.

247
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:35,497
But again, heterogeneity is something that we see throughout all cancers.

248
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:42,038
So we know it's a big problem. You know, again, thinking about some of the basics of genetics,

249
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:47,048
just to understand the genetic tumor heterogeneity is, you know, tumors have what we call somatic events.

250
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:51,608
So you're born with we've got germline, you know, whatever you're born with.

251
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:55,688
So you have it over time. You get mutations. We all get mutations.

252
00:22:55,688 --> 00:23:01,898
We know that as people get older, they get more cancers. And it's likely related to just developing mutations over time.

253
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:07,808
You know, and some people get lucky whether mutations are in, other people get unlucky and it's just one of those kind of random things.

254
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:13,658
So you have mutations, whether it makes the gene, you know, overactive or underactive, right.

255
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:17,408
Copy number alterations means that gene, that whole gene gets copied.

256
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,918
And so you have multiple versions of it or that whole gene gets deleted.

257
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:24,728
So then it's not working anymore. And so there's different ways to kind of think about it.

258
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:30,428
And like we talk about different types intrinsic extrinsic in the tumor or versus between

259
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:35,048
different patients are kind of different ways we think about tumor heterogeneity.

260
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:41,108
But like I said, Intratumoral heterogeneity is heterogeneity amongst different patients, right?

261
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:46,778
So in this pretend patient they have, but we've call well differentiated, which is a usually a good type of cancer,

262
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:51,548
you know, versus a poorly differentiated cancer or this one's caused by the virus.

263
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,728
You know, this one is moderately, but it's invading nerves. Right.

264
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,248
So they have different kind of components that we see between them.

265
00:23:57,548 --> 00:24:04,178
And again, like we talked about the the molecular analysis that were done previously, you can't differentiate them.

266
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:06,788
Right. And you look at them genetically, they all kind of look the same,

267
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:12,488
even though you know that they more or less look different and they're acting different and they're in different types of people.

268
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:17,738
Right. And so it's hard to know, you know, how to analyze that kind of variance.

269
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:24,488
And then looking at the tumor microenvironment, the tme, the germline, the immune status,

270
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,608
and that's something we're realizing how important your immune system is,

271
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:33,278
because if you have, we're all probably developing cancers right now and it's our immune system that's probably knocking them out.

272
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:38,107
And it's when people have altered immune status that suddenly they start developing more for cancers.

273
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:44,828
And we know that because people like kidney transplant or liver transplants or heart transplants, they get cancers, you know, nonstop.

274
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:49,747
And we're constantly having to figure out ways to treat them because they're they're the

275
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:54,308
drugs that are used to treat their transplant are knocking down their immune system.

276
00:24:54,548 --> 00:25:00,968
So that immune system is critical for basically surveillance in your body to knock out cancers that are made in a daily basis.

277
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:05,048
Who knows? Coca-Cola may cause cancer. And I'm just lucky because I have a good immune system.

278
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:08,678
I have no idea that it's like it's so much I'm going to take that risk, right?

279
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:13,357
Inter Intratumoral heterogeneity is within the tumor.

280
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:19,058
So we talked about the differences between patients and their individual tumors within the tumor.

281
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:25,088
They actually are a distinct cellular population specific genetic epigenetic phenotypic features within the tumors.

282
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:29,348
When a histology is there, pathologist looked at a slide, this is squamous cell carcinoma.

283
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,888
I don't expect you guys to know that, but that's a screening.

284
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:36,338
So section, when you go look at more or less looks the same, right?

285
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:41,498
They all kind of look the same. You know, a pathologist can say, Oh, yeah, I see some fibroblast right there.

286
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:47,508
That's an immune cell. You know, I'm not a pathologist. I'm going to try right there.

287
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:53,618
You're like, okay, that all looks the same. When we start looking at the tumors at the molecular microscopic level,

288
00:25:53,618 --> 00:26:01,718
you actually realize that even though you look at it and make sure they look the same at the genetic at the molecular level,

289
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,647
they actually are different. And so maybe the cells we thought all look the same.

290
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:11,348
Nope, they have a different expression pattern. Maybe they have different number of chromosomes, maybe they have a different RNA expression pattern.

291
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:18,638
Right. And even this is not even accounting for heterogeneity amongst the supporting cells like the fireflies immune cells.

292
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:25,208
Right. That's a whole nother you know, this is just within the cancer cells that they have variance between that.

293
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:30,188
And so when we talk about the Intratumoral heterogeneity,

294
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,838
that's one of the things we think is critical to why we're failing to improve survival

295
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:40,598
and a potential area to target to try and improve different treatment options.

296
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:46,388
And so we're going to talk about the tumor microenvironment a little bit more because that's where my research really focuses on.

297
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:51,398
And so the tumor microenvironment is really what's made up of the gist of the cancer.

298
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,007
Just like this is the classroom microenvironment.

299
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:59,618
There's a computer, there's students, there's desks, there's a professor, there's some joker from the med school.

300
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,788
Right? Those are that's the environment. And so we look at the cellular level.

301
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:09,938
There's cancer cells, right? The epithelial cells, you have the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the immune cells.

302
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,458
You have cancer associated fibroblast, they create kind of the structure.

303
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:18,478
They're kind of like the death. Not to be offensive to you call you guys the cancer cells of the room, right.

304
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:22,487
The firebombs are kind of like the death. They're the structure, you know, of everything.

305
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:26,718
I mean, you guys immune cells because you get I like. Yes, right. You guys are trying to help things out.

306
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:31,367
Of the if anything, those cells that bring blood vessels. Right.

307
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:35,987
And bring blood to the tumor because tumors need blood. And then the extracellular matrix,

308
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:44,238
just the proteins that make up the cells within within this kind of microenvironment is also something called cancer stem cells.

309
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:50,078
And we're going to talk a little about that because that's actually the main area of my research in.

310
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:56,118
And so but to take a quick step back, though, is how do we get this diverse environment?

311
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:05,388
And there's something called clonal evolution, just like evolution of us as people and animals and whatnot is,

312
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:10,338
you know, there was a founder clone by some original mutational event that happened really, really early.

313
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:18,088
Those cells started to expand. Then some of those cells got changes and then they became unique and diverse and start to

314
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:23,928
expand and and likewise and so we'll see this kind of expansion of different cell types.

315
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,438
And that's, you know, the blue cells was kind of the original found are clones,

316
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:32,658
but they're kind of were overtaken by some of the green ones or some of the yellow ones just over time.

317
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:36,198
Because, again, by the time cancer starts to when we ultimately can see it,

318
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:40,558
we're talking from one cell to several million cells before they become clinically.

319
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,918
You have it. And so it's had time to rapidly grow, divide and change.

320
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:51,828
Heterogeneity, though, just heterogeneity alone, predicts survival.

321
00:28:52,518 --> 00:29:02,358
Right. How well you do with your cancer, you know, is based on how kind of heterogeneous or lack of heterogeneity there is within your cancer.

322
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:09,858
And this is actually work in head neck cancer where they actually came up with an algorithm where they will look at what is your heterogeneity score?

323
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:16,238
We're not going to get to it. But like basically if you have a lot of heterogeneity you really bad and these are kaplan-meier survival curves.

324
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:22,518
You guys see these? Yeah. So survival is here and then time is here in the x axis.

325
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:27,948
And so if you have a low they call math score, a low heterogeneity score, you actually do fairly well.

326
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:34,938
It's relative, right? We're still looking at 70%, you know, but you do better than the patients who have a high heterogeneity.

327
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:42,948
And that was significant. When they looked at it, they then expanded it out, you know, to different types of cancers, types of mutations.

328
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:49,518
And again, you know, they see that it holds for larynx cancer, throat cancer, for cavity cancer,

329
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:57,468
even across different stages that even if you controlled for stage, you low stage tumor be at high mask or you actually did worse.

330
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:03,048
Or if you had a high stage but a a low heterogeneity, you actually did that better.

331
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:08,268
So again, it showed that staging is great because it helps predict for us how people are going to do.

332
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:12,588
But there are other components that drive how people do and how they survive.

333
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:17,898
And so heterogeneity alone is an independent predictor of survival.

334
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:21,737
And again, they were able to show this across numerous types of cancer.

335
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:28,458
So it's not just head neck cancer, but across different types of cancer types, colorectal, ovarian, breast sarcoma and whatnot.

336
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:33,978
And so that again, helps us say heterogeneity is a problem.

337
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:35,988
How can we target that?

338
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:47,447
And the reason we think this happens is certain cells over time have developed an ability to evade treatment or evade the immune system or or whatnot.

339
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:53,448
And so, you know, here is your cancer. We treat it with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and whatnot.

340
00:30:53,778 --> 00:31:00,978
You know, we may not get all the cells or not. All the cells are respond like responsive to the therapy, and then you ultimately get a recurrence.

341
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:04,097
And they actually were able to show this in a really nice study in breast

342
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:09,497
cancer where they looked at cancers that were treated or the original cancers.

343
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,118
And these are the different kind of cells.

344
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:16,728
You know, think about the different colors that I drew in my cartoon and the different cells and see how diverse they are.

345
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:20,838
But when they recurred and they came back, they actually were more homogenous,

346
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:29,688
meaning that whatever the cells that recurred were able to resist the treatment were the ones who then created the newer recurrent cancer.

347
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:32,928
And so they are predominately made up of those more resistant cells.

348
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:38,477
And we know that once your cancer come back, it's almost impossible for us to cure you.

349
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:46,608
It's very, very, very difficult. And so this was nice because it was actually a proof of principle what we thought was actually happening.

350
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:50,208
And so how do we unravel heterogeneity? Right.

351
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:56,238
Tumor heterogeneity is a major factor in treatment failure and those static outcomes that we were talking about kind of earlier.

352
00:31:56,628 --> 00:32:00,288
And so how do you assess, you know, what are these subclass?

353
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,527
How do I identify this green cell from the ground cell?

354
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:09,588
From the red cell. Right. And then which ones are causing the.

355
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:15,368
Resistance. And which ones are causing the metastases spreading to the lymph nodes, spreading to the lungs?

356
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:19,907
Right. Because those are reasons that kill patients. And so we need to understand that better.

357
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:22,987
And I go back to that John Bennett quote, You know, cancers are considering a cure,

358
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:31,208
but when everybody's ignorant of their microscopic nature in this case, you know, their molecular, you know, single cell level nature.

359
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:36,248
Right. If you don't understand what's happening at each individual cell, you're not going to be able to decipher anything.

360
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:41,468
John Bennett was too many years too early. He didn't know that we can actually look at each individual cell.

361
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:46,178
But, you know, give credit. He understood that you had to look at this at a very microscopic level.

362
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,338
We just have to look deeper. And so I'm going to briefly talk about something called single cell analysis of cancer.

363
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:57,758
And this is basically cell biology mixed with novel technology, mixed with computational biology,

364
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:03,668
where we can take a single cell separated and then actually do sequencing on it.

365
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:08,918
You can do RNA. You can do DNA. The DNA is rather expensive, but you can do it.

366
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:14,318
And the reason why single cell is advantageous over during regular sequencing, right?

367
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:18,878
All those studies I showed you before with all those colorful plots, those were all regular.

368
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:24,368
You know what? We got bulk sequencing, just taking the whole tumor, mashing it up, putting it in the sequencing and getting results.

369
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:31,088
The reason why Bork is not as helpful when you're trying to look at the heterogeneity is it's an average.

370
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,118
We're looking at that gene, right.

371
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:42,007
So Gene acts across the entire cancer, but all those cells got mashed together, got digested, and then we averaged out with their expression.

372
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:48,428
Pattern is where single cell analysis looks at that individual cell and in that individual cell,

373
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,988
that RNA or that DNA maybe different from the neighboring cell.

374
00:33:53,558 --> 00:34:00,217
Right. And that's what we're able to see with RNA single cell RNA analysis is that in this gene, with these two genes,

375
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:05,108
Gene X, you know, in this cell, they're quite low, whereas in the other cell they're quite high.

376
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,118
But when you average them, it's kind of somewhere in the middle.

377
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:15,158
So it helps to tell you what individual cells are doing and the variance across them at kind of the more molecular single cell level.

378
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:21,338
And the way we're able to do this from a technology standpoint is we basically isolate cancers

379
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:28,597
down into single cell solution and we put them through these kind of droplet kind of machines,

380
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:32,497
which is really kind of cool because the the machine will capture a single cell

381
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:35,858
right there and hold it in place and then it shoots the rest of the cells through.

382
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:42,337
And it's basically we basically will do this with thousands of cells and then we're able to then tag them and say that is

383
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:50,648
cell one through 1000 or whatever side that we're doing for that experiment and then sequence each of those individual cells.

384
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:58,028
And so this was done over one of my friends who's at Harvard, where they're the first ones to do single cell analysis in cancer.

385
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,508
And he thankfully, he was one of my friends. So he happened to be a head neck surgeon as well.

386
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:07,747
And he was able to do this in in oral cavity cancer. And what they were able to show is that different types of cells.

387
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:14,928
So these are nonmalignant cells. So those supporting cells, the fibroblasts, the immune cells, you know, they have their own unique signatures.

388
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:20,878
And we were able to say, oh, well, if you have signature X, Y and Z, you're a macrophage or you have a different signature,

389
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:26,467
your fibroblasts and whatnot, and they're able to like separate that and then they're able to look at them.

390
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:32,768
They're different types of immune cells or look at the different types of fibroblasts and whatnot within the malignant cells.

391
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:38,767
Interestingly, they were able to separate them out. But what was kind of concerning that concerning.

392
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:43,028
But one of the things we noticed was they separated out by each individual patient.

393
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:47,048
So this is one patient up here and these are the different patient mass.

394
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:50,798
And here is the institution, the number of them. But this is one patient.

395
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:54,818
So you see that one patient is different from the other patients.

396
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:59,378
The reason that's challenging is that goes back to that entire tumor heterogeneity.

397
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:03,488
Each individual person has a different cancer, so they may not get treated the same way.

398
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:09,998
They may not respond the same way. So we kind of were like, Well, this isn't very helpful because now we realize we're right back where we started.

399
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:14,527
Right. Because everyone's different and everyone's tumor is going to be a little bit different.

400
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:18,848
So how do we come up with a common, you know, generalizable treatment?

401
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:26,738
But they were able this was actually really interesting that I was able to start thinking about how could we use this within our own lab?

402
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:34,908
And they also were able to show there was more heterogeneity in the primary tumor where the tumor arose versus metastasis and whatnot.

403
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:38,608
So again, it went back to that corner evolution that we were kind of talking about.

404
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:46,928
So it all kind of solidified what we already knew. So again, how do you study, let alone treat, you know, a complex tumor?

405
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:50,018
You know, I always think about cancer is this chaotic kind of environment.

406
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:53,228
You don't know what's happening. Things are changing rapidly.

407
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:57,848
Cells are dividing, some tables are mutating, some are dying because we got chaos theory.

408
00:36:58,268 --> 00:37:05,558
Right. However, in theory, there's going to be a pattern built into it if you look at it the correct way.

409
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:09,968
And that's what we started to try to look at. Is there a better way to.

410
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:17,708
To look at cancer. And, you know, if you look at this long enough, you know, you'll start to see some sort of pattern.

411
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:23,708
And the area we wanted to focus on are those cancer stem cells that I've really touched on before.

412
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:30,068
They are component of the tumor microenvironment, a component of of cancer.

413
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:37,688
And so cancer stem cells are basically tumor initiating cells or cells that we think form all cancers.

414
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:47,078
And then they go on to form these the more diverse portions of the cancer, the more heterogeneous components of the cancer,

415
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:51,398
they're able to, you know, self-replicate so they can make themselves again.

416
00:37:51,548 --> 00:38:00,037
They can form, you know, progeny cells. And we really think that the driver of that control heterogeneity remember I showed you the other picture,

417
00:38:00,038 --> 00:38:07,928
I think in general celebrates are we think that those are individual cancer stem cells that mutated and then created their own subclass.

418
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:14,168
And what our theory is, is that they're responsible for we know that the responses were growth, maintenance and tumor spread.

419
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:17,378
And so could we try and target those?

420
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:23,527
And we've been able to identify different enzymatic markers to say that is a cancer stem cell, that is not a cancer stem cell.

421
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:30,458
So we figured that all out. This was work I did when I was a postdoc, basically were able to show in mice.

422
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:37,607
When we injected them with cancer stem cells, they grew more cancers than ones that didn't and they grew metastasis into their lymph nodes.

423
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:41,738
So we were able to show that the cancer stem cells are critical for tumor growth.

424
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:44,678
We also showed that they created these very heterogeneous tumors.

425
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:49,357
They actually these are pictures of the primary patients, tumor versus the mouse tumor.

426
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,748
And you actually have trouble differentiating them at the cellular level.

427
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:58,418
So, again, it confirms that these cells are likely responsible for some of that heterogeneity that we're seeing.

428
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:06,368
And so early on, we said, well, it's just most because was cheap and I didn't have a lot of money when I was first starting it.

429
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:10,418
So all we just sequence them like everyone else is sequencing things at bulk analysis.

430
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:13,898
And so we did that. We basically took a bunch of primary tumors, we took some cell lines,

431
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:20,668
we identified the cancer stem cells and we sequenced them, you know, and unfortunately,

432
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:30,848
oops, we didn't see any difference because we were averaging all of them and there's probably some sort of variance or heterogeneity between them.

433
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:36,188
And so we weren't able to try and find these targets that are specific to cancer stem cells.

434
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,738
This was prior to my friend's work happening with a single cell.

435
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:43,688
This is the data where we basically said they kind of looked the same. We can't see a difference.

436
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:47,828
But once my friend published the data, I said, Oh, well,

437
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:53,917
what if we do that same sort of thing with our cancer stem cells and see if we can say, okay, we know where the cancer stem cells are.

438
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:59,468
We know that they are the kind of originator cells that lead to all these different subclasses.

439
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:03,898
Right, right here. And so can we target them a little bit more?

440
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:08,288
Try and knock out the sub clones and what's driving the tumor heterogeneity?

441
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:10,498
And that was our our hypothesis.

442
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:17,048
And so we ended up doing that where we took primary tumors, we had cell lines, we have in vitro where we saw them for these specific markers.

443
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,558
We do single cell analysis and we had these really pretty graphs.

444
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:24,188
Right? Or it looks like my five year old got a whole set of markers, one of the two.

445
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:32,437
But it really what it was able to show is in cell lines, we could separate out the cancer stem cells that they looked distinct from the non cancer

446
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:36,308
stem cells and that there was a gradient and there's variance amongst the cancer stem cells.

447
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:42,128
Again, that red cell, you know, the green cells, they arise from different origin cells.

448
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:47,528
But we think that they're arising in these cancer stem cells and we're able to identify that that was really important.

449
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:54,518
So then we wanted to do that. We do that in cell lines, but cell lines are cells that have been growing in culture for a decade.

450
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:58,298
How real is that? Right. How much is that really?

451
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:04,118
Tell us about what's happening in humans. And so what we wanted to do is can we do that in primary tumors?

452
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:10,868
We have the same sort of thing identified as cancer stem cells and identify critical signatures

453
00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:16,808
that tell us there is a difference and we know which genes are driving their behavior.

454
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:22,558
And so that's what we were able to do. Again, we don't need to talk about it, but you can see that there is a difference in the cancer stem cells.

455
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:27,008
The other thing we found is that cancer stem cells are actually more kind of like there's

456
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:31,298
a greater spectrum which allowed us to figure out different ways to target things.

457
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:35,828
And so this is actually work done by one of my undergrads in the lab, and she's a European student.

458
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:39,158
What we started doing is some of the gene signatures that we identified.

459
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:42,488
We said based on that exploratory hypothesis,

460
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:49,628
what potential pathways are there that are driving this heterogeneity and how can we start to think about applying that clinically?

461
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:53,048
You can't just say, Oh, here's my single cell data, here's some genes.

462
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,888
Let's just start throwing it at patients, right? You have to then go.

463
00:41:56,888 --> 00:42:05,858
The next step is validating some of your results and identifying better targets that actually have some sort of efficacy that will actually work.

464
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:09,878
And she was able to show us that by giving different factors. And in this case, we're looking at.

465
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:14,558
FGF, which is a part of the fibroblast pathway.

466
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:20,408
We won't get into specifics of it, but usually we will show that those genes are critical for making more.

467
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:24,878
We call spheroids either a in vitro way for us to look at cancer stem cells.

468
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:33,008
They're basically these like nice little circles here, whereas when they don't have any factors, you kind of see like a wide spread of cells.

469
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,218
And this is the in vitro way we look at what is a cancer stem cell.

470
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:42,878
It's usually able to show that they're significantly enriched when we either culture them with this factor or with fibroblast,

471
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:48,128
which we know is part of the tumor microenvironment which make things. And so we came up with the pathways.

472
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:54,428
We validated all of this work. And the next step is saying, can we target these cells?

473
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:58,988
And that's what we're starting to do now. We went from the bench to now to the bedside.

474
00:42:58,988 --> 00:43:02,228
And this is a proposed phase two schema that we're looking at.

475
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:06,578
So we talked about that. We're taking a drug that's already been FDA approved.

476
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:10,588
I'm kind of lazy. I don't want to come up with a new drug. Right?

477
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:16,178
So I'm taking a drug that's already been approved. So I'm skipping the phase one because we know that it already has been approved and safe in humans,

478
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:20,768
but we don't know is it going to work and head neck cancer, you know, in this specific target.

479
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:30,938
So that's where we are. That's been done since 2018 because when I started this work and we're now only now starting to get into a phase two trial.

480
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:35,078
But again, we're not even to phase three and there's a high likelihood this will fail.

481
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:40,718
I've accepted my fate in academics. Right, that, you know, the chances work.

482
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:44,227
If it does, fantastic. But if it doesn't, then I'll go back to the drawing board.

483
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:50,558
Will come with something, something new and something different. But that is the basic principles of translational research.

484
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:57,608
I want to use in the context that what I'm doing right is we came up with a hypothesis based on the literature, based on what other people are doing.

485
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,458
We said, Does this work in the cancer we're interested in?

486
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:05,498
We came up with new ways to look at things and we identified some really important kind of factors.

487
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:10,028
And then what I did was said, Great, I don't really care about the intricacies of it.

488
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:14,437
How can I apply this to patients? And then we pivoted and said, Does this work?

489
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:18,128
And are there drugs that are already done that we can try investigating?

490
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:25,768
And that's kind of the basics of translational research and how I kind of apply it to to what I do, you know.

491
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:32,428
And we'll see. You know, this is we're still in development phase right now, but, you know, we're trying to get approval and whatnot.

492
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:35,918
And that alone is a lot of paperwork. So I feel like I do a lot of paperwork.

493
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:39,398
But why is translational research important in my career?

494
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:43,358
You know, I probably see about 50 to 100 new cancer patients per year.

495
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:48,728
We talk about 50% survival overall. Right. If I go for 30 years, hopefully.

496
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:51,998
Right. I will cure, you know, 1100 patients.

497
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:58,928
That's pretty good, right? But remember, we talked about earlier, 600,000 patients are dying of cancers a year.

498
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:03,008
And there's, you know, thousands of oncologists throughout the country doing the same sort of thing.

499
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:07,418
We're still far behind. So research, if we can improve survival by 10%.

500
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:10,898
Right. I go from 1100 patients to curing 1300 patients.

501
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:14,738
Just me alone. 70%. 1500 patients.

502
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:23,408
80%, 1800 patients. And then ideally, we'd like to cure patients, you know, but incremental advances is really what we're shooting for,

503
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:28,418
because very rarely and I've learned this is we're not going to find the magic bullet.

504
00:45:28,808 --> 00:45:34,657
Cancer is smarter than we are. And we have to think about different ways, different approaches to to target it.

505
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:38,288
But if I can get a 10% improvement, I think that's good.

506
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:43,148
I will be saving someone's grandma, someone's grandpa, someone's brother, someone's sister, you know.

507
00:45:43,328 --> 00:45:51,488
And again, you want to then disperse your information so that others can do it and then it magnifies, you know, those results.

508
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,518
But this is why translational research is important, because we're stuck.

509
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:58,508
We need better ways to do it. You guys are very fortunate.

510
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:03,188
Michigan is a phenomenal institution. I trained at USC.

511
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:08,708
I trained at M.D. Anderson. I've trained here. And I think Michigan has some of the best resources across the board.

512
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:11,588
You know, we're from a discovery standpoint, right?

513
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:18,428
Cancer biology, cancer omics, epidemiology detection, diagnosis, health disparity, cancer prevention, cancer treatment, education.

514
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:25,298
Right. And then early translation, early translation, late translation, dissemination of adoption.

515
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:31,327
Those are all the critical things. And Michigan dumps a ton of money into research and trying to help people.

516
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:35,768
And it's one of the reasons I'm still here. I'm from Southern California originally, and this is what I do.

517
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:39,368
I do cancer. Biology to cancer all makes up NRG Cancer Treatment.

518
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:43,478
So this is kind of what my lab does when I do the cancer stem cells.

519
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:48,248
Additionally, we do different types of comics. We're also doing something called immune modulation,

520
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:55,028
trying to get cancers that don't respond to immunotherapy and alter them enough so they can become more sensitive to immunotherapy drugs.

521
00:46:55,028 --> 00:47:01,357
And then we do you basic population database analysis, but as a surgeon scientist, I still do cancer surgery.

522
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:02,998
I still see patients in clinic.

523
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:09,718
I do the reconstruction, but I also do research and it's having the foot in both kind of environments that allows me to have some.

524
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:14,808
Idea of why we're doing what we're doing better with, where we need to be better at doing it.

525
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:18,618
So, you know, obviously I would not be able to do this by myself.

526
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:23,808
We have a huge team and a college program in my lab, my collaborators and whatnot.

527
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:27,678
And obviously, you have to get money. And that's the unfortunate name of the game.

528
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:32,188
So. That is about it. So a little faster.

529
00:47:32,238 --> 00:47:40,218
But. Questions.

530
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:49,378
Concerns. And I was just wondering about one of the lessons.

531
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:54,018
What your lab does. How do you.

532
00:47:56,688 --> 00:48:02,988
So yeah. So what we're doing first is you have to figure out what is the what is the environment you're looking at.

533
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:09,558
You have to even understand how do you even measure that? And so we're looking at what is an immune hot, what is an immune cold tumor?

534
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:13,998
How do you define it? What are the cells that make them hot? What is it that makes them cold?

535
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:18,317
And then we're starting to use different types of drugs. There's something called a sting agonist.

536
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,538
There's one that's an interferon kind of agonist. There's ways that we can augment it to try and bring in cells.

537
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:25,398
But then you have to say, did I actually do it?

538
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:30,798
So that's where being able to identify what the tumor microenvironment looks like, that's where we're at right now.

539
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:38,417
And then once we can confirm that there are multiple trials going on where we give immunotherapy and I have access to the specimen.

540
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:42,048
So I would say, what does the tumor look like before they got me a therapy? Who responded?

541
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:48,108
So what does that tumor look like? Who didn't respond? And then can we alter that tumor to make it more responsive?

542
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:53,118
Right. So that's where we are right now. So we have a couple of drugs and we have a couple of ongoing clinical trials.

543
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:56,058
So we're using those kind of avenues to try and do it.

544
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:03,347
And then we have a couple of potential drugs that we may try and use, but that's the holy grail of immunotherapy is immune modulation, right?

545
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:06,648
If you can figure that out, you'll win a Nobel Prize, right?

546
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:11,778
Because we're just not there yet. We don't know why. They're just very complex.

547
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:15,107
And so, again, if we can alter a couple of patients, that's good.

548
00:49:15,108 --> 00:49:19,937
I'm not trying to convert everybody to be immune sensitive, but we're trying to figure out why.

549
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:25,728
And like I said, there's a recent trial that came out with skin cancer. So remember that guy with that big vasectomy I did?

550
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:30,918
Had he been seen now, we probably would given him immunotherapy.

551
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:37,728
And 66% of people have a complete response where the cancer completely goes away with immunotherapy.

552
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:42,587
We just didn't know. You know, we didn't know that when we we did his surgery.

553
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:48,317
So he him I would have offered that to now again, if he's in that unlucky one third, then he ends up with the same thing.

554
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:54,618
But at least we gave him, you know, two third chance of keeping his eye from those because I was going to work anyway.

555
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:59,718
Right. And that's why I try and tell patients just because the cancer shrinks away and it's already destroyed the organ,

556
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,657
the organ is not going to suddenly work again if your eye stops working because the cancer is taking it out is not going to like work.

557
00:50:05,658 --> 00:50:12,438
But from a cosmetic standpoint, he probably could have kept his brow, you know, and it's an easier thing to put a fake glow back.

558
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:17,718
Right. So from a cosmetic standpoint that he would have been better off and not take off half his head.

559
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:22,878
So, yeah, excellent question. And I said we're trying to figure that out.

560
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:29,428
So. That's the way.

561
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:36,858
Coming up to space right now. So when you're like in such a.

562
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:42,118
Research project. What if something comes up like something?

563
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:51,058
To try to revive the project before. Yeah.

564
00:50:53,008 --> 00:51:01,227
Design. Yeah. No, it's actually it's great and bad because you come up with a great idea, you get everything up and running and then you start going.

565
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:04,798
But yeah, invariably someone comes up with a better idea like, Hey, have you tried this?

566
00:51:05,248 --> 00:51:09,657
And so I, I, I do think maybe my grad students will think otherwise,

567
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:17,067
but I think I'm fairly nimble in that I'm like willing to pivot when presented with the appropriate evidence.

568
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:21,748
But I do, you know, people calling me all the time say, Hey, we should try this, we should try that, we should try this.

569
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:24,868
If I listen to everybody, I would go nowhere. Right.

570
00:51:24,988 --> 00:51:29,578
So I do say I mean, this is I don't work in my lab because if you come up with a question,

571
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:34,168
I will send you home with 30 more things to look up and then come back and talk to me.

572
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:39,268
Right. Because like, if I'm going to pivot, I need to make sure that that's a good decision.

573
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:44,427
But I am very open to innovation. And we we've definitely have pivoted, you know, throughout all we've done it.

574
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:49,018
But you have to be thoughtful about it, you know, or a side project and say, you know, that's a good idea.

575
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:53,128
We're not going to change the main project, but let's let's do some side experiments.

576
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:58,168
Let's see how that works. And then if that you see good results, then you say, let's integrate it in.

577
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:02,398
You know, I'm a true believer in evidence based. Right. Come up with an idea.

578
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:06,048
We just don't do it because it sounds like a good idea. Right?

579
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:09,987
You really have to show me that there's good evidence. Why do I do things clinically?

580
00:52:09,988 --> 00:52:15,898
I don't just make things up for my patients. I have to have good evidence behind my decisions and I use the same approach in the lab.

581
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:20,538
I say, Where has it been done? Whether labs have done it, why do you think it's going to work here?

582
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:23,908
Here are the pitfalls I see. I'm like the master at shooting things down.

583
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:30,808
Right. And that's your goal is to try and get past my my skill of knocking everything down.

584
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:34,948
Right. Um, but I do keep things in the back of my mind and I do think about things.

585
00:52:34,948 --> 00:52:39,388
And sometimes I say, I very rarely say you were right. And I say, you know what, we should reconsider that.

586
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:44,228
Right. So but that's yeah, I mean, that's, that's one of the challenge but that's one of the fun things, right?

587
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:47,278
That's what I like about things I like when I meet new scientists,

588
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:51,358
like last night when I was walking with my kids for Halloween, well, the dad's is a chemist.

589
00:52:51,688 --> 00:52:54,048
He said, How come you guys don't work the cameras? We start talking about things.

590
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:58,558
So we actually came up with like a potential collaboration walking at Halloween night, right?

591
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,888
It was kind of cool. That's what I like about Michigan, you know? It's a really cool place.

592
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:06,888
Oh, sorry about your. With all the heterogeneity you see, like.

593
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:18,858
There's still so much money going into the gene editing and stuff, but I think if we can ever get gene it, yeah, I think I mean,

594
00:53:19,098 --> 00:53:23,808
one of the reasons, you know, I came to Michigan way back when for graduate school is Francis Collins was here.

595
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:29,198
Francis Collins was like the former head of the NIH or whatnot. And he was really big into gene editing and knocking genes.

596
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:33,678
Remember I told you one of the challenge with cancer is we tend to try and knock things down.

597
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:37,007
Those are drugs. We have to block it and knock it down.

598
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:44,718
Whereas gene editing enables us to put things, yeah, at the clinical level, or at least in cancer, we're not there yet.

599
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:52,067
We can do without CRISPR analysis. CRISPR is a way for us to knock things in and out really easily and that we can do very easily.

600
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,788
We do it a ton in vitro, a lot of the work we've done, we do that in vitro.

601
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:01,698
How do we then apply that to like patients and in vivo use?

602
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,558
That's where we still kind of struggle because how do you control it?

603
00:54:06,558 --> 00:54:12,318
And I think that makes people nervous about knocking genes in, you know, to you, where does that go?

604
00:54:12,978 --> 00:54:22,788
So I think it has potential we have just yet to solve it, but that is another approach to addressing that are genetic, right.

605
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:29,838
Because right now all we can do is knock it out. But if you start knocking, then, you know, that is, you know, would be unbelievably helpful.

606
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:35,388
Um, but, you know, and people are still doing it but not like they were early on.

607
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:41,058
And I think, I think just because there were a lot of failures and we just haven't found a good way to do it.

608
00:54:41,298 --> 00:54:44,747
And I remember when CRISPR first came out, that's the technology, really,

609
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,438
not because it turned easily, but we were thinking, Oh, this would be great, we can do that.

610
00:54:48,438 --> 00:54:53,448
And we just haven't seen that translate yet. So but yeah, that's a great question.

611
00:54:57,498 --> 00:55:00,678
How do your conversations with your patients go?

612
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:04,458
When you talk about prognosis and treatment options.

613
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:09,928
How much do you talk about? Evidence based medicine.

614
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:17,658
What the research shows. And versus how much of their face they're willing to.

615
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:22,068
Yeah. And I'm very you have to be open and honest.

616
00:55:22,248 --> 00:55:29,268
I mean, that's step one is you have to tell people, you know, and and you should try to break down, you know, you have a bad right.

617
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:37,698
This is a bad crash. This a stage for cancer. It's not curable, but it's going to require us to do X, Y and Z.

618
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:43,248
This is what I recommend based on the evidence, you know, the alternatives are nothing,

619
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:49,698
you know, going off and trying for serum, you know, that you pay $30,000 for that.

620
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:50,958
There's no evidence behind it.

621
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:58,038
You know, you also have to realize that everyone comes to me from a different background and a different educational level.

622
00:55:58,308 --> 00:56:04,488
So if I have like a Ford CEO, I'm having a far different conversation than, you know,

623
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:09,258
someone who's living up in the Upper Peninsula, uh, you know, didn't finish junior high.

624
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:13,397
Right. And so you have to be able to relate things to people.

625
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:16,458
And, you know, analogies are one of my favorite ones.

626
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,878
One of my mentors is gonna steal this one, but he's, you know, he's like, you know,

627
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:25,038
the Redwings This is back when the Red Wings were winning against the Red Wings win most of the time,

628
00:56:25,038 --> 00:56:31,788
but not every time, you know, and you try and make it something for patients, understand, because you have a 30% five year survival rate.

629
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:37,998
Most people don't understand what that means. And so you have to try and make it something that is understandable for them.

630
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:44,538
And I translate daily and when I talk to my patients, I talk to my nurses, I talk to my medical students.

631
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:50,268
You have to be able to explain complex, you know, topics and the things that people don't understand.

632
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:59,238
Um, I will say is I think if people truly knew what they would do to people in the operating room, they wouldn't sign the consent.

633
00:56:59,778 --> 00:57:06,128
Um, but having said it, if you ask them a year later, they always said, yes, I'm doing great, I'm happy, I'm glad we did this.

634
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:09,348
So there is a balance of, you know, being open and honest.

635
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:13,538
But, you know, I'm not going to say and then I'm going to slice your jaw, you know,

636
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:18,737
with a sore and I'm going to crack it and then I'm gonna then pull your tongue

637
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:23,208
out of your throat and cut it right at the base and clip all the blood vessels.

638
00:57:23,628 --> 00:57:27,198
Right. I don't tell that to me. No one wanted to hear that, right?

639
00:57:27,348 --> 00:57:32,988
No one's eating lunch today. I apologize. Right. But what I tell them is, say, we're going to remove your cancer.

640
00:57:33,828 --> 00:57:39,528
I'm going to then use your leg, your thigh or whatever I'm using to rebuild your tongue, rebuild your jaw.

641
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:46,068
It's not going to be perfect. We can't rebuild your tongue like the way you were born with, like, the way it was two years ago.

642
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:53,688
But the reason we're going to do this and this is so that we can give you the best possible chance that you the best possible chance to talk,

643
00:57:54,048 --> 00:58:01,578
the best possible chance to beat this cancer. You know, so you try to explain to people, you know, what the reality is, where they're at right now,

644
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:07,628
but the potential where they could possibly be, you know, the likelihood to try to share that.

645
00:58:07,638 --> 00:58:13,878
People have said, you know, that that one lady I talked about, I told her, you have less than 2% chance of beating this cancer.

646
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:17,898
You know, I said, I can do this surgery.

647
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:22,898
I don't necessarily recommend it. You know, she said, I these are my reason.

648
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:30,858
He's she's like, can you give me six months to a year? I said, Maybe, but I didn't I I've never, never say never, never say always.

649
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:37,728
Right. And so I was very like, you know, I can that is more doable than me saying you're cured of your cancer.

650
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:42,738
So she understood and she said, you know what? These are what my goals are. This is what I want.

651
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:47,898
I have another guy who's a Notre Dame fan and all his goal is to make it to the U.S. Notre Dame game this year.

652
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:52,308
Right. That's all he wants. Right. And so I said, yes, we can help you get you there.

653
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:55,818
You know, it's not going to be easy, but we can help you.

654
00:58:56,298 --> 00:59:02,438
So I think just being open and honest and explaining evidence that they can understand, you know,

655
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:06,558
I can go into multivariable analysis of why this study is garbage and that was

656
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,278
better than now or why this immunotherapy drug mixed with this chemotherapy drug.

657
00:59:10,558 --> 00:59:17,838
Anybody got it? Got it. You know, I'd bore most of you guys and you guys are highly intelligent to sleep if I started going to those conversations.

658
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:23,358
So you have to be able to, like, adapt it to what patients can digest.

659
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,867
I even tell them you're not going to hear half of what I'm saying right now.

660
00:59:26,868 --> 00:59:31,338
Anyways, they hear cancer, they hear stage four, and that's about all they hear.

661
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:36,708
I do try to remind them I said cure a couple of times to say you are curable.

662
00:59:37,368 --> 00:59:39,168
You know, we have a chance for care.

663
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:43,877
Those are the other like if they're gonna remember anything, that's what I want them to remember is, you know, they have cancer.

664
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:46,548
But we we're going to take a swing at we're going to try and help them.

665
00:59:47,478 --> 00:59:53,038
And then their second meeting with me is when they coped with the fact that they have cancer and now we have to go through.

666
00:59:53,118 --> 00:59:59,327
But then I go back through the details again. So, you know, and then we get more of the new ask questions like a pair.

667
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:03,738
And I tell them, you know, things like that, all my tattoo words that kind of go.

668
01:00:04,538 --> 01:00:12,808
So. That's that's the that's the fun part about being a physician, you know, is talking to patients, seeing patients.

669
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:17,948
You're seeing them long term from when I first meet them.

670
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:25,018
You know, most of my as many of them as I can, I trained, you know, five years, you know, but I lose 20% of my patients.

671
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:29,788
It's not I don't think it's good. I'm a bad surgeon. I think it's just cancer is really, really tough.

672
01:00:30,688 --> 01:00:36,178
And so that's that's why I'm in the lab, because every one of my patients that dies, I have a picture of them.

673
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:42,958
I get my lab office. And it's a reminder to me about why I do what I do, why I spend extra time during research,

674
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:48,508
because to try and help them or help people or to avoid having people pass.

675
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:58,538
That's my philosophical component. And now.

676
01:01:02,438 --> 01:01:10,308
They dissuade anyone going to medical school? Okay.

677
01:01:10,728 --> 01:01:11,058
Thank you.
