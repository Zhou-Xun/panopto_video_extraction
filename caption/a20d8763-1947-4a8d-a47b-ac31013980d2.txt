1
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:11,851
which focuses on standardization and age period cohort effects otherwise known as APEC effects.

2
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:15,851
This is the final part of the six part session on measures of disease.

3
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:26,851
We made it and I'm providing this lecture content asynchronously in a prerecorded format to support the learning of those students in epidemic.

4
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:35,851
So one who are taking part in the geo strike today such that the material can be accessed at any time.

5
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:44,851
So let's do a recap. This is everything that we've covered in this six part session, which has spanned across two lecture sessions.

6
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:50,851
We learned about basic measures of disease, specifically proportions, rates and ratios.

7
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:57,851
We learned about the concept and method to assess prevalence point, both point prevalence and period prevalence.

8
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:05,851
We learned about cumulative incidence, otherwise known as risk, otherwise known as the incidence proportion.

9
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:13,851
We learned about the relationship between prevalence and incidents and how they are linked through the duration of disease.

10
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:16,851
And then we learned in-depth methods to calculate risk.

11
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:24,851
Specifically, these were the cumulative method, the actuarial or life tables method, the incidence density method,

12
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:31,851
both the overall and time stratified method and the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.

13
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:35,851
And then we learned about key measures of mortality in populations.

14
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:44,851
Today, we're putting the final pieces together and learning about standardization and age period and cohort effects.

15
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,851
So why might we do standardization? Well, let's think about it.

16
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:56,851
With respect to comparing mortality across populations. And that's the example that we're going to focus on in this session.

17
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:06,851
So we know that age is the strongest predictor of mortality. And so often it's quite tempting to compare rates of mortality across populations

18
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:11,851
in order to get a better idea of overall health and well-being of populations.

19
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:17,851
But this is complicated because population age structures differ both within

20
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:23,851
populations at different points in time and between geographically defined populations.

21
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:34,851
So comparing overall crude mortality rates, which means unadjusted between populations or within a given population but at different points in time,

22
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:39,851
is often problematic and can't really be interpreted in any meaningful way.

23
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:49,851
So we standardize in order to make populations comparable with respect to comparing rates of outcomes such as mortality.

24
00:02:49,851 --> 00:03:02,851
Let's think about an example. This table shows the crude or unadjusted racial inequity in mortality in Baltimore City in nineteen sixty five.

25
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:06,851
So for whites who lived in Baltimore at that time,

26
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:15,851
the mortality was fourteen point three people per 1000 population members for Blacks or African-Americans.

27
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:22,851
The mortality rate was ten point two people per 1000 population members.

28
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:26,851
Is this a valid comparison? What can we conclude from this?

29
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:32,851
Well, the first thing that we might think about and knowing that age is really the strongest predictor of mortality.

30
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:40,851
We should consider whether the age structure of populations differ according to race.

31
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:48,851
So maybe we should look at the age specific racial inequities in mortality in Baltimore City in 1965.

32
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:54,851
So here I'm showing the same data, but this is separated out into age groups.

33
00:03:54,851 --> 00:04:00,851
And what we see and this is masked when we look at the overall crude mortality rates,

34
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:08,851
is that the racial inequity in mortality actually varies a lot, depending on what age band we're looking at.

35
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:15,851
So under one year, it is twenty three point nine for whites and thirty one point three for Blacks or African-Americans.

36
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:21,851
That's huge. That's way bigger than the overall crude mortality rate and indicates that there's a huge mortality.

37
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:30,851
But there's a huge inequity in infant mortality and it's actually in the opposite direction to the crude mortality rate.

38
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,851
We then see the racial inequity and mortality rates narrows at older age groups.

39
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:42,851
So kind of during childhood and then gets wider again, that adulthood and wider at older ages.

40
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:50,851
So that's really interesting and kind of shows why we might need to consider age stratification when we want

41
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:58,851
to compare mortality rates between groups or populations of people that have different age structures.

42
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:05,851
So one way that we do this is called direct age adjustment or direct age standardization.

43
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:11,851
Essentially, what we do here is we use a standard population structure to account for differences

44
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:17,851
in the age structure between populations or groups that we want to compare.

45
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:24,851
We can use a hypothetical standard population or we can use a real standard population.

46
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,851
It doesn't really matter. And I'll get into this in the coming slides.

47
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:35,851
We then apply age specific mortality rates to this standard population structure.

48
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:43,851
Specifically, the steps that we follow to perform direct age adjustment are step one.

49
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:51,851
We calculate the overall crude, an age specific mortality rates for each community, group or population that we want to compare.

50
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:59,851
I am using the phrase community here, you could equally think of it as being a population or a group of people. In step two,

51
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:04,851
we either create or choose a standard population. In step three,

52
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:12,851
we apply the community age specific death rates to the standard population.

53
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:16,851
And then in step four, we calculate the age adjusted death rates.

54
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:23,851
Let's work through an example in order to make this make a little bit more sense.

55
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:33,851
So step one. Calculate the crude and age specific mortality rates, the table on this slide shows the crude death rates in two communities.

56
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:43,851
Let's call them community A and community B. We have age groups in the far left column going from under one up to over 64.

57
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:54,851
We have the total number of people within each community that fall into each of these age groups in the columns headed population.

58
00:06:54,851 --> 00:07:03,851
And then we have the number of deaths of people in each community, within each age group, under the columns headed deaths.

59
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:09,851
And then we have the death rate per 1000 population members, which we have yet to fill out.

60
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:16,851
So let's fill that out. It is simply the number of deaths divided by the population size.

61
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:23,851
And we can readily calculate that for each age strata as well as overall for each community.

62
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:28,851
So in community A, there are fifty thousand people total in the population.

63
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,851
There were one thousand seven hundred and eighty one deaths.

64
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:40,851
And this translated to an overall crude death rate of thirty five point six deaths per 1000 population members.

65
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:47,851
And Community B. There were a total of one hundred thousand people in the population and one thousand seven hundred and forty deaths,

66
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:55,851
which translated to a death rate of seventeen point four deaths per 1000 population members.

67
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,851
And if you have a keen eye here, you may note that I'm using the terminology rate.

68
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:07,851
But actually, this is not a rate. This is a proportion which you've probably noticed.

69
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:17,851
One important thing to note here is that we can calc we can perform standardization using proportions or by using rates.

70
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:23,851
It actually doesn't matter. So we actually could be doing this whole thing with person time and estimate a true rate.

71
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,851
But I'm showing proportions to you here.

72
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:33,851
To be honest, it's often mortality rates are quite often referred to as rates, even though they are proportions.

73
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:37,851
And this was a question in the take home exercise from last class.

74
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,851
So you may have already encountered this and you may have already noticed that I'm

75
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:46,851
using the phrase rate when I am actually referring to a proportion or a risk of death.

76
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:52,851
So just keep that in mind. OK.

77
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,851
Step two, this is create or choose a standard population.

78
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:01,851
And there are many choices here. The choice of standard population is somewhat arbitrary.

79
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:09,851
What matters is that you use a standard population. It doesn't really matter what it is and you express what your standard population is.

80
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:15,851
So in this example that we're working through, we could use Community A as our standard population.

81
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:24,851
We could use Community B as our standard population. We could sum together community A and B to create our own standard population.

82
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:33,851
And note that this would be a pseudo population or a hypothetical population because it's not a real population that exists.

83
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:40,851
Or we could use some kind of external community or population such as the U.S. population in a given year or another country.

84
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,851
And this is often what's done. For example,

85
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:51,851
we may be comparing mortality rates in two populations and we may standardize them both to something like the U.S. population in the year 2020.

86
00:09:51,851 --> 00:10:03,851
You'll often see this in the literature. So let's add the populations of Community A and B in order to create our standard population.

87
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:09,851
So here I've got the total population sizes for community and community B.

88
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:15,851
Both the totals in the bottom row and then in the age specific strata throughout the rest of the table.

89
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:20,851
There are fifty thousand people in community A. And one hundred thousand people in Community B.

90
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:25,851
So we end up with a total of one hundred and fifty thousand people in our standard population.

91
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,851
And you can see that in the final column.

92
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:38,851
The total number of people within each age strata is the sum total of people in that age strata for community A plus the number of people in that age.

93
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:49,851
Strata for community B. So let's move on to step three, apply the age specific death rates to the standard population.

94
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:57,851
So I've got my standard population here in this first column that's just copied and pasted from the previous slide.

95
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:04,851
And now I've got the death rate per 1000 population members in Community A.

96
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:09,851
And I've got the death rate per 1000 community members in population B.

97
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:17,851
Now, we're going to use the information in these three columns to calculate the expected number of deaths

98
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:25,851
at the death rate for Community A and the expected number of deaths at the death rate for Community B.

99
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:35,851
Let's calculate this out and we get a total of three thousand two hundred and ninety nine expected deaths in community.

100
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:44,851
And three thousand seven hundred and seventy two point five deaths in Community B.

101
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,851
Step four, calculate the age adjusted death rates.

102
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:53,851
Now we divide the sum of the expected deaths by the total population.

103
00:11:53,851 --> 00:12:01,851
To calculate the age adjusted death rates. So here is the total number of expected deaths in population.

104
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:06,851
A, the expected number of deaths in population be our total standard.

105
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:17,851
Population size is one hundred and fifty thousand people. And this gives us age adjusted death rates of 22 deaths per 1000 popular population members

106
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:25,851
and community A and twenty five deaths per 1000 population members and community B.

107
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:30,851
And please note that this rate here can be expressed in person time.

108
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:35,851
So this will be the true mortality or incidence rate or in terms of population size as a proportion.

109
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:41,851
So this would be the mortality or incidence proportion. And that's it.

110
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:50,851
So in summary, to perform direct age adjustments, we first calculate the crude and age specific mortality rates for each community.

111
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:55,851
We then create or choose our standard population.

112
00:12:55,851 --> 00:13:03,851
We then apply the community specific sorry, the community age specific death rates to the standard population,

113
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:10,851
and we do this by multiplying the community age, specific death rates to the standard population.

114
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:17,851
And then finally, we calculate the age adjusted death rates by something, the expected number of deaths.

115
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:22,851
But in each community and dividing by the total population size.

116
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:29,851
This is actually really straightforward. When you when we get down to it.

117
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:41,851
And there is an example of there is an example that you can work through on your own in the take home exercise for today's session.

118
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:53,851
It's question number twelve. The other way that we can standardize is by doing indirect age adjustment so we can do both direct age adjustment,

119
00:13:53,851 --> 00:14:02,851
where we standardize the population, or we can do indirect age adjustment where we standardize the rate and then apply it to the population.

120
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:11,851
So here, rather than choosing a standard population, we choose a standard mortality rate and then apply it to the population under study.

121
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:20,851
We can then come up with the expected and observed mortality rates and we use this to calculate the standardized mortality ratio or s.m are,

122
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:26,851
which is the observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.

123
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:32,851
You may have seen standardized mortality ratios before in the literature.

124
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:39,851
Here are the steps, indirect age adjustment. And it's actually a little bit more simple than direct age adjustment.

125
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:47,851
So in step one, we apply the standard mortality rates to the population age structure in our population

126
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:53,851
under study. In step two, we sum the expected number of deaths over each age strata.

127
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,851
And then in step three,

128
00:14:54,851 --> 00:15:02,851
we calculate the standardized mortality ratio or SMR as the number of observed deaths divided by the number of expected deaths.

129
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:07,851
Let's work through an example. So here we're going to work with population.

130
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:12,851
The population of community A that I showed you in the previous example.

131
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:16,851
So first, we will apply the standard rates to the population structure.

132
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:24,851
So here are the standard death rates that we're going to use. And we will come up with the expected number of deaths within each age strata.

133
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:30,851
If these standard death rates were applied to the population of community.

134
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:34,851
And so that's here pretty straightforward.

135
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:43,851
Next, we sum the expected deaths over each strata to get the total number of expected deaths, which is two thousand thirty two point five.

136
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:52,851
Then we simply calculate the s.m are we know what the observed number of deaths were, because that is what we directly observed in Population A.

137
00:15:52,851 --> 00:16:01,851
And in the previous slide where I first introduced Population A to you, the total number of deaths was one thousand seven hundred eighty one.

138
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:09,851
You can go back and check if you like. And then we divide that by the expected number of deaths based on the standard mortality rates.

139
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:13,851
This gives us zero point eight seven six as the SMR.

140
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:23,851
A few notes here on the SMR. The SMR will vary depending on the choice of population that is used for the standard rates.

141
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:26,851
So you will end up getting very different SMRs,

142
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:35,851
depending on which standard mortality rates you decide to use when you are calculating this measure.

143
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:44,851
And here's a quick comparison of the direct and indirect aid adjustment methods just to sort of help you distinguish between the two of them.

144
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,851
So indirect standardization.

145
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:57,851
We use a standard population and we apply observed age specific death rates to a standard population structure in indirect adjustment.

146
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,851
We use an observed population, but a standard age, specific death rates.

147
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:11,851
So we apply a standard age, specific death rate to an observed population structure.

148
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:15,851
We can also think about standardization from the counterfactual perspective.

149
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:22,851
So recall, in the first week of class, we learned about cantered counterfactuals under direct standardization.

150
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:28,851
We think about what the overall mortality would be under acounter under an age structure

151
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:34,851
that is counterfactual to what was observed in the real population under study.

152
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:45,851
In indirect standardization, we think about the total number of deaths that would have been if we had a counterfactual age specific mortality rate.

153
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:54,851
Sorry if the specific mortality rate was counterfactual to what was observed in our population understudy.

154
00:17:54,851 --> 00:18:02,851
And what do SMRs actually mean? So an SMR equaling to one means there is no difference in mortality after you've

155
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:07,851
adjusted for age or any other factors that you want to standardize between populations.

156
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:15,851
And some are greater than one means that mortality is higher in the population under study.

157
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:21,851
And an s.m are less than one means that mortality is lower in the population under study.

158
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:31,851
Sometimes the SMR is multiplied by 100. In that case, 100 would be the null value rather than one.

159
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:38,851
Another measure that we use to assess health and well-being of populations is the years of potential

160
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:46,851
life lost and the years of potential life lost is a measure of premature mortality or early death.

161
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:54,851
And essentially what we do here is we take a mortality index age, and this can vary by populations.

162
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:58,851
We then subtract the age at death of each fatal case,

163
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:06,851
of whatever disease outcome we're looking at from the standard mortality index age in the United States.

164
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:13,851
We often use age 75 as the standard mortality index age for simple analysis,

165
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:26,851
and then we just simply add them together to come up with the total number of years of potential life lost that are due to a given disease outcome.

166
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:32,851
We can also do this using life expectancy instead of a standard age, which is a bit more complicated.

167
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:38,851
Here we're going to do an example using standard age. So here's an example.

168
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:47,851
Let's calculate the years of potential life lost for each of the following outcomes using the US standard age of seventy five.

169
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:59,851
Let's say in community aid, there are four cases of RSV and the ages at death of those four cases are zero years, zero years, one and one years.

170
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:09,851
In community, there are 12 cases of influenza and the age at death are zero for 74, 70, 73 and so on.

171
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:19,851
If we're using a standard age of 75, we simply take the difference between 75 and the ages at death in each of these communities and we add them up.

172
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,851
So in community A, it's seventy five plus seventy five plus seventy four plus seventy four,

173
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:33,851
which is equal to two hundred and ninety eight years of potential life lost due to these four cases of RSV in Community B,

174
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:38,851
it is simply seventy five plus seventy one plus one plus five and so on,

175
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:47,851
which is also equal to two hundred and ninety eight years of potential life lost due to these twelve cases of influenza.

176
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:52,851
And here's an example of what this measure looks like in a published paper.

177
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:59,851
And so what they've done here is they've looked at the years of potential life lost in the 2009 flu pandemic,

178
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:06,851
the 1968 flu pandemic, and the nineteen fifty seven and 1918 flu pandemics.

179
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:14,851
And then they've compared that to the average age three and two season from the years 1979 through to 2001.

180
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:22,851
And you can see they show the number of deaths. And this is adjusted or standardized to the to to the population in the year 2000.

181
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:28,851
And so we know that the age structure of the population across all of these years from 1983.

182
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:33,851
Right. 1918 through to 2009 is really different.

183
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:35,851
You know, the population has aged over time.

184
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:42,851
And so they standardized using the population in the year 2000 to make these numbers of deaths comparable.

185
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:47,851
They just they then show the mean age of deaths. And they calculate the years of life lost.

186
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:55,851
Again, adjusted or standardized to the population in the year 2000.

187
00:21:55,851 --> 00:22:03,851
Another indicator that is used to assess health and well-being of populations is disability adjusted life years or DALYs.

188
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:12,851
DALYs are the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability.

189
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:22,851
DALYs use social weighting where the value of each year varies and typically reflecting high social value of young adult years.

190
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:29,851
This is really a value based judgment, something that there's a lot of debate over and you may or may not agree with.

191
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:35,851
But essentially, DALYs weight earlier deaths more highly than later deaths in the life course,

192
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:43,851
recognizing that deaths at a young age lead to a greater amount of potential life lost.

193
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:53,851
And here's an example of what DALYs look like. This figure shows the percentage of DALYs attributed to 19 leading risk factors for mortality.

194
00:22:53,851 --> 00:23:01,851
According to country income level in 2004. So in the orange color, we have low income countries.

195
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:06,851
In the purple, we have middle income countries and the dark blue. We have high income countries.

196
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:14,851
So we can see here that in 2004, globally, the top three causes are of the top.

197
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:22,851
Yeah, the top three causes of DALYs. So loss of disability adjusted life years were childhood underweight,

198
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:29,851
unsafe sex and alcohol use, closely followed by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.

199
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:37,851
And we can also see that the number of DALYs attributable to these risk factors is much higher in low income countries

200
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:46,851
and then middle income countries with very few DALYs attributable to these factors in high income countries.

201
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,851
That's it for standardization. Let's move on to age period cohort effects.

202
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:57,851
I'm going to start referring to these as APC effects from now on.

203
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:09,851
ABC effects are three or age, period and cohort are three distinct time related variables that can influence the risk or rate of health outcomes.

204
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:15,851
Age refers to biological age of the individual period refers to calendar time.

205
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:21,851
So it could be the year 2000. It could be the period between 2000 and 2010.

206
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:31,851
It could be the period between 2000 and 2020. That could be any range of time in calendar time and cohort refers to year of birth.

207
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:40,851
And similarly, this could be one single year of birth. It could be generational cohort such as baby boomers, generation X, millennials, generation Z.

208
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:47,851
Or it could be year of birth. Categorized in decades, for example.

209
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:56,851
In an age effect, this is simply what happens where disease frequency or incidence or prevalence varies by age.

210
00:24:56,851 --> 00:25:02,851
And this is typically regardless of the period or birth cohort.

211
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:06,851
So a good example here is that we know the incidence of cancer.

212
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:11,851
For most cancer types tends to increase with increasing age.

213
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:20,851
And this has been true for a very long time. It doesn't matter if you're born in the year 1950 or 1960 or nineteen hundred.

214
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:29,851
The risk of cancer tends to increase with age. And this table here shows a really nice example.

215
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:35,851
It shows age affects over a different time periods and specifically age specific death rates per

216
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:45,851
100000 people from tuberculosis and men in Massachusetts from the years 1880 through to 1930.

217
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:57,851
So if we go down each of these columns and here time is broken up into six, 10 year periods within each of these 10 year periods,

218
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:07,851
if we go down the columns, we see that the death rates due to tuberculosis tend to increase with age for some of these periods.

219
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:13,851
They're a little bit higher in the zero to four years range, but they do tend to increase with age.

220
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:20,851
And so within each one of these periods, when we look at differences in the death rates from tuberculosis,

221
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:30,851
according to age group, that would be an age effect. So any age specific difference is often referred to as an age effect.

222
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:36,851
Whether or not we think age is a cause is another question.

223
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:42,851
In a period effect, the prevalence or incidence of the disease outcome varies by period.

224
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:48,851
And again, this is calendar time, regardless of age or birth cohort.

225
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:59,851
A great example of a period effect are things like pandemics. So right now, everyone is experiencing a higher risk of infection due to COVID-19.

226
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:04,851
That is a function of a period effect with this pandemic happening in the year 2020.

227
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:10,851
It doesn't matter how old you are or when you're born. Everyone is experiencing it.

228
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:19,851
Of course, the risk of mortality due to COVID-19, there is an age effect because we know that older adults are at higher risk of mortality.

229
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:26,851
But someone who was alive before 2020 but not alive in 2020 would not experience any risk due to COVID-19.

230
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:38,851
This is a specific period effect and that would be similar for other pandemics that happened in other years, such as in 1918.

231
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:42,851
And here's what a period effect would look like in this table that I showed you before.

232
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:49,851
So if we just consider the data for any one of these given 10 year periods, that would be the period effect.

233
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:55,851
So if we compared the age specific death rates from tuberculosis between 1880 and 1930,

234
00:27:55,851 --> 00:28:03,851
we can see that the age specific death rates are much higher in the 1880 period as compared to the 1930 period.

235
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:10,851
And this makes sense. And I think this is actually a great example of a period effect whereby life expectancy has continually

236
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:17,851
increased over time and mortality due to a lot of different causes has also decreased over time.

237
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:25,851
So there are strong period effects in or in mortality rates as time has gone on.

238
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:35,851
Finally, a cohort effect is where the prevalence or incidence of a disease varies by year of birth, regardless of age.

239
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:46,851
And here's what this looks like in the table. So if we could so we can go across all of these columns and rows in order to isolate a cohort effect.

240
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:57,851
So the individuals who were aged five to nine years in 1880 would be aged 10 to 19 years and 18, 19 and 20 to 29 years and nineteen hundred and so on.

241
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:04,851
And so we can look at the trend in the age, specific death rates across this one specific cohort.

242
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:09,851
Similarly, we could map the next the age specific death rates in the next cohort.

243
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:19,851
So, for example, those individuals who are aged 10 to 19 in 1880 would be aged 20 to 29 in 1890 and so on.

244
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:23,851
And one thing that I'd like to note here is that.

245
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:32,851
It is rare that disease outcomes or causes of mortality purely have an age effect or purely a period effect or purely a cohort effect.

246
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:37,851
We often see a blending of these different effects mixed together.

247
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:40,851
So, again, a great example is covered 19.

248
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:49,851
So this is a specific period event because it is a specific disease outcome that is occurring in the period of the year 2020.

249
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:54,851
And everyone who is alive in 2020 is exposed to this risk in that year.

250
00:29:54,851 --> 00:30:01,851
But there is also an age effect whereby we do see very different age, specific death rates due to COVID-19.

251
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:08,851
So it is a blending of an age and a period effect. Here's a couple more examples.

252
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:18,851
This figure shows the prevalence of obesity among men in the top panel and women in the bottom panel according to age, within 10 year birth cohorts.

253
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:24,851
So we're actually looking at age effects as well as cohort effects here.

254
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:28,851
And so, for example, we can think about this.

255
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:36,851
Well, we can think about this in a few ways. So in the legend, we see the young boomer generation.

256
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:42,851
And honestly, I don't even know what years those are shown with the diamond shaped indicator.

257
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:54,851
The older boomer cohort indicated in the squares the young silent generation and the triangles and the older silent generation with the stars.

258
00:30:54,851 --> 00:31:00,851
And so we can see how the prevalence differs across cohorts.

259
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:07,851
I don't even know that it's hugely different. The prevalence of obesity is going up in the younger cohorts.

260
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:10,851
But we can also look at the age effects by cohort.

261
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:17,851
If we kind of think about this graph in a slightly different way so we can compare the prevalence at age 30 between cohorts,

262
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:21,851
if we think about kind of drawing a vertical line up at given age intervals.

263
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,851
And so I've done this by a decade of age.

264
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:34,851
And so, yes, we can see that the prevalence of obesity is going up for a given age across these cohorts, which is really interesting.

265
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:44,851
And if you really have a keen eye here, you'll notice that the cohort effect is actually not separable from the period effect in this graph.

266
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:51,851
And the reason for that is that age plus cohort equals period.

267
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,851
And so no matter how you try to get around it,

268
00:31:53,851 --> 00:32:07,851
we can actually never identify all three of an age period and cohort effect simultaneously because the three of them perfectly identify one another.

269
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:13,851
That is a problem that we are not going to get into in this class. It is well beyond the scope of this class.

270
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:21,851
But basically, the purpose of introducing age, period and cohort effect here is to make you aware of these three different time

271
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:26,851
related variables that we often think about and talk about in epidemiology.

272
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:35,851
There are specific advanced methods that can be used to identify APC effects, but they're outside the scope of this class.

273
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:44,851
And actually, I've got one more APC example for you here. So this figure shows lung cancer mortality rates for U.S. white males by birth cohort,

274
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:51,851
which are shown in the solid line and current age in the dotted line.

275
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:55,851
Actually, I think it's the other way around. I think age is the solid line.

276
00:32:55,851 --> 00:33:04,851
And birth cohort is the dotted line. Sorry, but we can actually see that the solid lines show that the mortality due to lung

277
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,851
cancer just steadily increases with age across all of these birth cohorts.

278
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:16,851
But then we and we also see higher rates of lung cancer mortality with subsequent birth cohort.

279
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:24,851
And so you can see it goes up from 1914 all the way up to nineteen forty nine to 1950, probably because changes in the prevalence of cigaret smoking.

280
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:32,851
This is a really complicated figure. If you don't understand it or if it looks weird, don't worry about it too much.

281
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:37,851
Age period, cohort effects are really kind of mind bending to think about.

282
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:42,851
But again, I reiterate, I just want you all to be aware of the difference between age affects,

283
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:48,851
cohort effects and period effects and be able to think them through conceptually.

284
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:53,851
And that's it. We made it through the measures of disease sections. Let's recap one more time.

285
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:57,851
So we learned about basic measures of disease. Again, these were proportions.

286
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:03,851
Rates and ratios. We learned about the concept of prevalence and how to calculate prevalence.

287
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:07,851
This was point prevalence as well as period prevalence.

288
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:13,851
We learned about cumulative incidence, which is also known as risk or the incidence proportion.

289
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:20,851
We learned about the relationship between prevalence and incidence and how they are linked through duration of disease.

290
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:26,851
And then we learned about in-depth methods to calculate risk. This is probably the most important thing in this session.

291
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:33,851
Aside from these sort of conceptual foundations around the basic measures of disease and prevalence and incidents.

292
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:43,851
These methods are the cumulative risk method. The actuarial or life tables method, the incidence density method, both overall and time stratified.

293
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:48,851
And the Kaplan Meier product limit method. We learned about basic measures of mortality.

294
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:54,851
And just now we learned about standardization, both direct and indirect standardization.

295
00:34:54,851 --> 00:35:07,050
In addition to years of potential life lost in dailies. And then we had an introduction to age, period and cohort effects.
