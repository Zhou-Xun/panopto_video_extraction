1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,800
Right. And hopefully this won't run into trouble when we invite our speaker.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,120
So today, I'm very excited that Dr. Boehner is going to join us.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:25,290
She's in psychiatry and is like an absolute force in terms of our and related interventions when it comes to substance use.

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:32,770
So she focuses across, as you run the gamut as alcohol related interventions, as opioid related interventions, as cannabis use interventions.

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,410
Then she's going to talk about two years for one State of the City.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,770
Articles that I shared brings a really interesting perspective, because not only is she a researcher, but she's also a clinician.

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,299
So she's meeting with folks on the ground. And I was reading a proposal one time.

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,040
I was really focusing on mental health and the my kind of mentor advisor for that proposal.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,250
Jim said also over in psychiatry, he was he was asking me what I was focusing on.

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,010
I was interested in it was in this case, it was kind of anxiety.

11
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,610
And he said, if you really want to write this proposal, if you really want to understand,

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,960
you need to come to me or come with me to an anxiety clinic and see what it means to have,

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,450
you know, a debilitating case of anxiousness around different facets of people's lives so that

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,450
you can start to understand when we started to put this into research practice.

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,550
Who are the folks that are operating on the ground?

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:26,110
And I think in the case of Dr. Barnard, having that clinical experience, along with a really robust research program,

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,040
makes her research all that more effective and makes it all that much more applicable.

18
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,440
So she was not able to join us in person today.

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:40,000
We're going to try to zoom her in. Fingers crossed that it's going to be feasible enough.

20
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,930
I had it up and working now. We're going to be relying a lot on this little thing, hopefully for both sound audio and all that type of thing.

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,330
But I'm hoping folks can ask her questions because again, when it comes to designing and developing interventions,

22
00:01:52,690 --> 00:02:00,370
she is literally at the forefront kind of across the country. So I'm very excited to bring her in to talk a little bit about their work.

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:11,049
We'll also look a little bit at the data. I think having data driven decision making, allowing us to identify spaces for intervention,

24
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,580
allowing us to justify what we're approaching or who might be missing some of the gaps that could be out there.

25
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,260
That's been a theme throughout the course of this semester, so we'll do a little bit of that with substance use.

26
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,360
One of the questions that I posed this week in the as kind of a discussion question is, is this really injury?

27
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,370
And I don't know if anybody thought much about that. QUESTION, But does substance use belong in an injury prevention course?

28
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,910
Maybe I'll just throw it out now. What do you think this does?

29
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,420
A substance as a week focused on substance use belong in the course, ostensibly focused on injury prevention and intervention.

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,290
What does it. Yeah, I would think, yes.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Because substance use like to me substance use itself may not be the thing,

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,760
but substance abuse is what makes it like going injury because people could be hurting themselves.

33
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,930
They could be encouraging other people to do similar things and it could be hurting other people, like with driving.

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,320
Okay. So I think that's how it is. That's okay.

35
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:23,900
All right. I think if we to look back, but to be honest, when you're talking about like the prevalence of falling,

36
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,669
the big ones for like the age of 21 to like 15,

37
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,700
you said it's like throwing something that's like altering the way they think, like they can fall to hurt themselves.

38
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:45,479
The country might fall into that category. Okay. So and so older adults falls are actually a big issue for people like kind of over like 60,

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,080
but then they do happen to be really middle age groups, younger age groups, and it often is when there's some certain emotional substances.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,820
Yeah. What else was. Testing is under attack, of course, on substance abuse.

41
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:08,640
And I just think that. Don't go quietly after six weeks.

42
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,350
Right. I know you have more to say. I know you're more safe. Does it belong in this class way?

43
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:23,790
Why not? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's injury to oneself alongside, like, things that could happen.

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:33,770
If you do have a substance use addiction like you can have in class, family impacts, your life, etc.

45
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,180
You know, neoplasms like cancer. They affect family. They affect your life.

46
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:59,310
But they're not we're not going to cover those in this class. And I think that because it's a conscious decision to change in the behavior.

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:08,670
It's like enjoying yourself, whereas cancer is not and arguably a substance use because of how the kitchen works.

48
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:17,250
I think there's not always like a fully adjusted decision, but I do think it is technically a.

49
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:26,820
Actually, I got actionable. I never got an agent that is enforcing some sort of injury on another agent,

50
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:37,680
whether that's like a cell or somehow relating to how substance abuse can cause other types of injury to other people, that makes it fall into injury.

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,810
And then also I just I mean, I agree with Mohammed's point, and I think it can be expanded into a lot of other areas of injury with suicide.

52
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:55,320
There's a higher risk involved. There's also just like a lot of correlation between substance use and sexual violence, both before and after.

53
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:03,600
And so I think it's so intertwined with other areas of injury prevention, besides being its own area, that it would be hard to not talk about it in.

54
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,689
Right. You're not reaching out because you reached last week and even the week before.

55
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,760
So give me a second. Give me a second. That's a second.

56
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,810
Sorry. That's okay. Caroline. Caroline? Yeah. It's like it rhymes with Rachel.

57
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:36,690
So I'm trying to actually go home with the official definition of injury prevention and, like, what is included in the field.

58
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,880
Yeah, but it kind of seems like it's things that are available on the market that might be causing injury to society,

59
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,290
whether that's the black market or not.

60
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,129
So I don't know if it includes what's available in the market, but I mean,

61
00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:01,680
there's there certainly does acknowledge whether it's products or whether it's chemicals, manmade or otherwise, that can affect people.

62
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,710
So when we get into environmental toxicants in a couple of weeks,

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,840
we do have a speaker that's going to come and speak about kind of occupational hazards. Um, the, the definition.

64
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,550
And that's part of why I think this is an interesting question. Often occurrence has often included something in the area of like transfer of force.

65
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:29,580
Right. So there is an almost that kind of speaks to mind an impact, whereas you won't necessarily see a transfer of force with substances.

66
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,150
But at the same time, I think the point that folks are making forces us to think really more critically about what that definition means,

67
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,120
whether it's a direct effect on your body. You know,

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:47,429
if you're harming your your your your physical or your physical body or the way that substance use can co-occur with so many other forms of injury,

69
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,860
whether that's suicide, whether that's motor vehicles, whether that's any other aggression,

70
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,030
that violence that can increase when alcohol or drugs are present.

71
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:06,090
And so all of these areas, I think that these are great points and that helps to validate our decision to spend some time thinking about

72
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:14,700
how substance use can play a role in injury and why we need to at least consider how these other areas overlap.

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,370
And just because substance use is one of those that can touch on so many areas of of injury.

74
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:29,160
I still like substance use as a paradigm for us to think about how we can apply what we learn from this space to others.

75
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,310
For example, thinking through other areas of injury and how they might intersect with different forms of injury.

76
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:43,469
So again, using substance use as that example, I think helps us to think more holistically about our field in general.

77
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:49,110
So I'm glad folks can only see why substance use belongs in this class.

78
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,540
We're going to talk about some of those co-occurring factors and what happens when we mix areas of injury today.

79
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,259
We'll also think about some of the interventions that are happening.

80
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,630
And this is another fabulous thing about and I don't mean I'm just trying to put positive language around substance use,

81
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,700
but because there is so much attention, you see interventions at the individual level,

82
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,150
at the relationship level, at the community level, at the policy level.

83
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,770
Think about that whole multilevel model of that whole you go sociological logical framework.

84
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,900
Chances are substance use as people have approach substance use from those different

85
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,950
lenses and we can potentially learn from when that was successful or not.

86
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,150
So we'll see here in in about 20 minutes or so. And that's a great idea.

87
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,849
I'm going to go ahead and start in about 10 minutes.

88
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm going to turn on our Zoom call so that she can join. We'll see how that works out.

89
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,550
But why do I feel like it belongs here? So first of all, CDC will throw it up there.

90
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,030
They'll start talking about injury or substance use as a form of injury they called part of an unintentional injury.

91
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,719
So we're talking about whether they're often listed as poisoning.

92
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:04,830
I'm sorry, you can't read that. But so this is all the different leading causes of fatalities in the United States.

93
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,070
These boxes are unintentional injury.

94
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,780
We showed you in week one that if you break down these things a little bit, who are we really talking about here?

95
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,800
These are motor vehicle crashes. These are poisonings. So if you have overdose, they're in almost all forms of substance use.

96
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,410
They're resulting in about half,

97
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:32,400
but 45% of the unintentional injury fatalities that happen in this country across what is this from one all the way up to about 45?

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,430
Right. So this is a major issue. It does also speak and even though you can't really read this either, sorry about that.

99
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,719
It does speak about how we present this data because saying that, yes,

100
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:51,720
unintentional injury is the key here from ages 1 to 45 doesn't tell us much as much as when we think about,

101
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,970
okay, what if we tease out that unintentional injury and we see that these are motor vehicle traffic?

102
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,330
And I know it's about five years old now, but it's not all that different. Maybe these things kind of vacillate back and forth.

103
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,070
But unintentional motor vehicle traffic, unintended poisonings.

104
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:14,220
So the vast majority of which are substance use related opioid overdose, alcohol overdose, that type of thing.

105
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,959
And it's such a motor vehicle crash that you start to see how across again, the life span, some of these challenges are more or less prevalent.

106
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:31,710
But the fact that we are seeing such high rates of overdose at older ages tells us a little bit of something about where,

107
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:45,550
again, we're focusing our efforts, how we might be choosing to intervene. So I decided.

108
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,570
What we started straightaway, we started speaking to and I think what folks pulled out on their own website.

109
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,010
That's great it. You just.

110
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,990
Hello. Hey, Matt.

111
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm well, thank you. Actually, I think somebody opened the container remotely.

112
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:17,110
Is that true? Six.

113
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:28,960
Originally. It was a tough one. Yes, I was.

114
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,420
So I think we are good here.

115
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,420
So I was able to start the meeting.

116
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah, I can promise you the audio of this because we haven't had somebody log on to the call yet, but I will call you if that's all right.

117
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,670
The speakers are at about 12, if I can call them, though, because, um.

118
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,730
Okay, sir, just 1/2 here.

119
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:22,680
The old model of what has happened was in 1974.

120
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,270
No, that's not true. Mm hmm. Fortunately, they are able to break.

121
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,799
All right. Thanks so much, Matt.

122
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:45,090
Appreciate it. I started bringing in calls for that.

123
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,250
Now that a staggering number, even when I first are sending it through some of this data.

124
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:57,030
It was to your point about the overlapping substance use and other forms of injury.

125
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,560
So when we think about unintentional injury, when we think about suicide, when we think about homicide,

126
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,150
the leading causes of death for children, at least in this case, 14 to 24 year olds, which is where we do see this starting.

127
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,610
These increasing spikes in substance use tend to have overlap with substance use.

128
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,780
So when we think about suicide, when we think about homicides,

129
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,290
you cannot just you cannot fully disentangle substances like many of the other things that you cannot disentangle.

130
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:30,270
But it's important just to be aware of it. And we can apply some of the same tools that we've used previously.

131
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:39,480
So in this case, this was looking at motor vehicle crashes and how we can think what's happening prior to the event,

132
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:45,810
at the time of the event, following event and across these different facets of our environment and experience.

133
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,890
And so that that maybe for the next 10 minutes while we wait for Aaron to jump on, you could do the same thing with substance use.

134
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,270
So if we wanted to think through kind of impaired driving.

135
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,260
So because there is and this is one of those ways where substance use is overlapping with another form of injury,

136
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,560
if you could start thinking through what are some of the things that we could populate within our hands matrix, right.

137
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,950
What are some of the precursors? What are some of the things at the time of the event that some of these might already overlap?

138
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,740
But what is what is substance use at the time of and this is just a graphic origin, which I thought was kind of interesting when you see,

139
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,900
you know, alcohol is present in some of these crashes, cannabis is present, other substances.

140
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,220
How might those interact again with our matrix here,

141
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:43,860
which in turn could inform how we approach interventions with in particular from that it's going to be a process changes

142
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,870
rethinking what's been a few minutes just thinking through it see if you can start to fill in some of these cells.

143
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:59,350
Again, nice examples here, but I think we're now trying to think maybe a little more intricately about do

144
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,450
some of these boxes change when we when we introduce substances into a situation?

145
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,120
And that could be things like the facility, if they're coming from a bar of their own on their own,

146
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:15,370
where they're serving alcohol, it could be the availability of, I don't know, services like words.

147
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:22,770
So it could be other factors. So grab a partner or two and see if you can start to fill in some of these.

148
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:28,390
I think on your slides, there's this graphic not here, but they cover.

149
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:46,320
Too, because it gives you a sense of how this happened.

150
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,290
I guess we were roommates.

151
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:05,010
So I'm sorry. I'll tell you, we're going therapy for this.

152
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,770
Like, I mean, I never knew of each other until. Since I have this.

153
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,240
I mean, even maybe. I don't know.

154
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,840
I think so. Because, like, you folks remember all these.

155
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:26,490
Just real quick. Sorry, folks. Remember what the host who knows this kind of person or at the right age in this case is

156
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:33,490
going to be the person that the substance or the car or combination to right environment.

157
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,890
Right. What's going on around social media?

158
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:52,240
So I'm setting out to prevent something like, yeah, and there's nothing.

159
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:01,500
And what would you say without a host like a person involved in it to view them or the material?

160
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,940
The most common problem is the president of Syria.

161
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:16,140
Yeah, either something very serious, 141st during this or whatever.

162
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,520
1000 or so. Yeah.

163
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,490
Yes. Yes. Just turned 21. Yeah.

164
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:26,890
Right.

165
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:53,920
So yeah, I'm going to be and I need some kind of retirement because I think like you are, I think that's going to be just another piece of paper.

166
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah. And they have this great concern about sending a filmmaker or an astronaut right now and others around.

167
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:23,130
Like, I think like and this is still something that you have probably what's happening at.

168
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,800
Are you ready?

169
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:39,910
Yeah. My heart is going to be ready for the thrill of that.

170
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:50,090
She is my heart and soul searching.

171
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:09,370
Maybe this was just about, you know, just, like, whatever on the outside looking like that.

173
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:20,830
That could easily be resigned from not having to call as this can't change, I.
