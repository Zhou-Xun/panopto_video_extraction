1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,190
Oh, really? Yeah. Mike Kane for us. Big deal.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,570
Yeah, it's always been there. Never missing commencements or Fridays.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,260
It's always Tuesday. Just them a week later.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:24,370
Because it makes sense. Because that's really. You see?

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:34,850
Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,710
You just heard say.

7
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:58,080
And. Recording in progress.

8
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:10,980
Yeah, it's the last day.

9
00:03:00,490 --> 00:04:37,219
That's. Okay.

10
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:44,540
Good morning, everybody. Morning. Morning. So let's continue our simulation.

11
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,060
I want to tell you that I really appreciate those who have come forward and talked to me.

12
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,010
I, you know, I feel much better, I thing because of your actions.

13
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,320
So that shows a lot of strength.

14
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:29,150
Thank you. Okay. So last time we are talking about making a simulation out of the insurance auto insurance problem.

15
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:38,120
And we had a deductible of 8000 and the probability of an accident of 2.5% per year.

16
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,990
And if we have an accident with 2%, 2.5% probability,

17
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:56,100
then the damage of the accident is going to be distributed within me normally with a mean 3000 and a standard deviation of 750.

18
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:08,000
So we created this simulation here and that or the logic of the simulation, and we use the phone show that ran,

19
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,310
which generates a number between zero and one A with a uniform distribution.

20
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,420
That's the only party which function.

21
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,930
I will function in Excel.

22
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:41,990
So this is the only skin native random number generator of Excel and we can based on based on that function, we can build any other distributions.

23
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:50,800
So he says if this number between zero and one is B is less than one 0 to 5, guess you have an accident.

24
00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:03,680
Otherwise, no. So that the chances of that number being less than or equal to point 0 to 5 because we have a uniform distribution is actually 2.025.

25
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:12,530
Right. So those are the probability at .975 is the probability of being greater than point 0 to 5.

26
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,920
So that's the probability of no. Right?

27
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:33,290
So then the next the next cell says, well, if there's no accident, then the cause of the damage of the car is zero.

28
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:42,379
But if there is an accident in other ways, then we generate a normal distribution, and that's the way to generate the normal distribution.

29
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:53,750
Using functions in Excel, just plain Excel is the inverse of a normal evaluated on a number between zero and one here,

30
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:04,690
which is the cumulative probability distribution. And then the mean and the standard deviation of that normal variable.

31
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:15,730
And the inverse of a cumulative distribution is simply the number is normally distributed know number.

32
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:25,250
So it tells you, oh, what is the the number which is at the point nine, seven, five percentile,

33
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,090
and then it give you what, what, what is the number that is at the point five percentile.

34
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:40,910
And in that number and that number will eventually be, you know, when you just repeat samples is going to be and normally distribute.

35
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:50,490
Okay, so so we did that. And then.

36
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,940
So when we finally we computed the amount you pay.

37
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:22,480
So if the damage is greater than or equal to the deductible, then you pay the deductible.

38
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:34,899
Otherwise you pay it damage. So if you know the deductible, it's $1,000 from your accident cause you don't pay it that much amount to $800,

39
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,470
then you pay $200 because you haven't reached your deductible.

40
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:46,570
But if the damage is $2,000, that's more than $10,000 of your deductible,

41
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:53,590
then you just pay the only rate you pay without some dollars and the insurance will pay the rest of the amount you pay.

42
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,590
It is just up to the doctor.

43
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:08,110
Right. So can you think about a way, you know, to do this?

44
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,720
We saw the statement. For example.

45
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:31,480
So y y if I say, okay, this is going to be the maximum in between or the meaning between the deductible and the cost, right?

46
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,790
So that will do the same thing.

47
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:44,950
So if the cause is less than the double, then you pay the cost is the cost is greater than the deductible, the meaning would be the deductible.

48
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:58,400
And then you just begin. So without the statement I can to say give me the minimum between the deductible and the and the damage, you get the same.

49
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:13,400
I'll change that later. But for now, what we wanted to do as a team, we generated numbers, a list of number from 1 to 5000.

50
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:33,200
So you to keep down that road control that narrowed and so you see that I got up to 5000 or I wrote and then we could do it.

51
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:44,900
And then what I'm going to do is create a one way table, one way, because I am just going to change one parameter of time table.

52
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,950
And that parameter space would be the duration.

53
00:11:47,960 --> 00:12:05,480
Everything is going to be the same. So if you don't know about tables, you can still, you know, just think if have half an hour or so and practice.

54
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,360
But I'm going to tell you what it said, how to generate it to a one way table and then two,

55
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:21,440
waiting, for example, the one way table is, you know, I changed something in Excel.

56
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:29,210
So number parameter at every time I change the parameters,

57
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:38,900
then I evaluate these these line and then I pull the line in starting in an independent role.

58
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,420
In this case, actually, what I am going to change is the iteration eight.

59
00:12:46,520 --> 00:13:00,230
So iteration one, two, three, four that is not going to affect anything of the simulation, except that is going to make Excel recalculate.

60
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:09,170
And when things have recalculate, you get a new random number, you random number here and you run the numbers here.

61
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Those two runs are going to be recalculated and then they're going to whatever the result is going to be is going to be place in the.

62
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,170
In the property of the property in the proper role.

63
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:35,530
So what we need to do for the one way table is on this first row, you are going to put the formulas that you need to replicate.

64
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:46,460
We have those formulas here. Right. So I just simply say, okay, this is equal to it.

65
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:59,850
So you here, you 16 and then all I need to do is copy is is going to be equal to see 16 and it is going to be equal to this 60.

66
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:08,079
Okay. So I don't need to look then because the table I'm not going to be that formula.

67
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:21,910
I'm going to use a table that automatically we're going to refer to the first row so you can either block the sales here or not.

68
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,330
It doesn't know. This second thing I'm going to do is.

69
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm going to select the whole table.

70
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,130
I'm going to go to roll his down arrow to the right.

71
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,640
So we have the whole table selected, right?

72
00:14:51,270 --> 00:15:06,720
Then Excel knows that if they apply the table, Excel knows that the first column is going is going to be the cell that is driving the change.

73
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:17,130
So he's going to take each one of these numbers and he's going to put them somewhere in the spreadsheet, is going to trigger a recalculation.

74
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:26,520
And then that resolves of these three cells are going to be placed in their respective positions in that group.

75
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,310
So they need to I'm going to put that two in the spreadsheet.

76
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:40,019
The spreadsheet will recalculate and then whatever and whatever output is here

77
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,910
is going to be copy in the in the row of the two and then three and so on.

78
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:56,910
To do that, I'm going to go I'm going to go to data and then if analysis.

79
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:09,860
And then I'm going to go into the data table and this is asking me for the drivers.

80
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:18,920
The parameters are going to drive it two way data table, but we just have one, right?

81
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,220
So this is a one way data table.

82
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:31,410
So one of those sales are going to one of these parameters are going to be left blank because we are looking at just one line.

83
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:45,990
We need a table. So one is that row input cell and means that if I if I if we're doing a two way data table,

84
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,830
then I would have the top parameters that would change, right?

85
00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:04,950
Like there one, two, three. Maybe I would have in this case different different deductibles.

86
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,370
Right. Right. But in this case, I don't.

87
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:17,160
So I don't have any row to, you know, any row parameters to to place on the spreadsheet.

88
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,750
But I have a column of parameters.

89
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,750
Those are going to those are the durations.

90
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:37,800
And what is asking me is these numbers are going to be taken and I'm going to have an output be put somewhere in this in the Excel spreadsheet.

91
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,920
And then the result is going to be taken and placed over here.

92
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,480
Okay. So question to you is, where do I put this iteration?

93
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,990
So where do we put this number? One, two, three, four.

94
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,850
What cell here? So what is going to be this cell where I put this column of inputs?

95
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,100
What do I want to do with that input?

96
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:22,670
What? What is that? What is the purpose of taking this number here in duration and put it somewhere in the spreadsheet?

97
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:33,290
They only purpose is not is not making excel do something with this number like computation

98
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,390
with the number at the only purpose is make excel rate calculate this spreadsheet.

99
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,490
So in this case, I can put it anywhere I want,

100
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:54,659
any blank cell where it doesn't interfere with the calculations in Excel so I can put it over here, here or here.

101
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,130
It doesn't matter. So in this case, I'm going to have the random number in kept in place,

102
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:14,160
let's say D5 and then if I click, okay, I get my simulation, right, I get 5000 iterations.

103
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,640
Then we make the format consistent.

104
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:38,470
The. Just it works.

105
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,770
The series. Thank you for this, Kate.

106
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,380
Sick. So what?

107
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,750
What's going to happen? Most of the time, 2.5% of the time.

108
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,390
Right. You are going to see a third.

109
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:27,060
Most of the time, 97%, 97.5% of the time, you are going to see the ends, right?

110
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:36,750
Not to the extent of 2.5% of the time you are going to see the yes or there is an action.

111
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:48,660
So for example, here, the iteration 79, there was an accident in this scenario,

112
00:20:49,230 --> 00:21:01,800
the accident that caused the damages where 1840 8.35 1840 $0.08 of 3540 $8.35.

113
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,410
And then when you paid a thousand and get another one.

114
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:22,710
So yeah, you have to treat it in in those three cases, the accidents where Morden is south and in damage, they use pay $1,000.

115
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:32,129
So with a mean of $3,000 is quite difficult to understand.

116
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,850
Litigation 750 is going to be rare.

117
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,860
The having an accident in less than 2000 loses.

118
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,580
So what? What now? What I want to do. Well, thank you.

119
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:55,450
This. So what I want to do.

120
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:12,060
Is get the the mean or the amount I pay, the standard deviation of them, I pay for that deductible.

121
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:24,510
So for the mean, all I need to do is compute the average of the damages and the standard deviation is compute the standard deviation of the I'm sorry,

122
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:30,150
the damage, the amount you pay for the mean and the amount you pay, the standard deviation rate.

123
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:38,550
So for that mean out, four of the amount you pay is going to be average.

124
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,200
Right. And that's going to be these columns and columns of them, I think.

125
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,460
So control his close parenthesis.

126
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,320
And then we got $22.80.

127
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:17,410
That's the average. I mean, the average amount. I think all of you are going to have different numbers because simulation is very you know,

128
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,630
your brands are going to be different from mine but is going to be around these number.

129
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:33,290
Right. So some of you might have 27 to or some of you may have 25 or something.

130
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,850
You might have 88, I think 27 these high that you can happen.

131
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,740
So let's take a look at this.

132
00:23:45,750 --> 00:24:02,930
And their deviation and the standard deviation is going to be equal to their deviation is to be done.

133
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:09,710
Is this is a population or a sample? But we generated it.

134
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,710
So is all the accidents that can happen over this sample.

135
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:20,740
This is right. So their population will be infinite.

136
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,400
So keep it. Keep getting more good. Getting more.

137
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,390
So I am not exposing the.

138
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,530
I'm just taking a sample of the possible scenarios and simulations.

139
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:46,240
So this is a sample. The standard deviation is going to be 44, 5000 is going to be pretty much the same for a population or sample.

140
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:55,510
The idea is divide by and when you get a square root of of x,

141
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:03,399
each one of the each one of those about I pay my bills they mean and then

142
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:12,729
divide it by in that number of sample you got the number of you know elements

143
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:26,160
in the sample you can if you are dealing with a population divide in if you are dealing with the sample you divide by in minus one to get by is is me.

144
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:32,650
So with 5000 divided by 5000 or 4999, pretty much the same.

145
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:45,240
You don't worry about that. So what will do is they want to give you something.

146
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:55,540
So finally, we have some deviation of $148.

147
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:04,190
Okay. So the mean is 20 to 40 is standard deviation is 148, right?

148
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:13,270
So it's a huge standard. And you see that is huge because we have zero here, but then we have 1000.

149
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,509
So we have pretty much two numbers, zero and 1000.

150
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:28,990
So that's a huge dispersion. And but the mean is $22.40 when we compute the the average.

151
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:39,430
Now, what I want to do now is to compute, according to the instructions,

152
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:50,730
either a 95% confidence interval for the average amount to pay for each deductible.

153
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:58,630
So the the average amount you pay. Now let's do that to the complete.

154
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:07,150
And then so I want to create a 95% confidence interval for this number.

155
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,100
What do you mean? 20 right now is 2240.

156
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,260
And the question is, if I where do do to have an older sample, right?

157
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,460
I am not going to get 20 to 40. I'm going to get something similar like you did.

158
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,879
Right. That is not 20 to 40.

159
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:41,300
So the question is 80. So what I'm trying to compute is, is I get the numbers from each one of you who have different samples.

160
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:50,700
What how much do you get here? And then I compute the standard deviation of those numbers.

161
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,630
What would be the standard deviation? So can I put the 95% confidence interval?

162
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,510
So 95% of your numbers will be between which you know what?

163
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,370
What, two numbers. Right? So if I get the distribution.

164
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:23,320
So do you remember how to get the standard deviation of the mean that from the deviation of a sample mean if you don't remember when I tell you that.

165
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,610
Right. So. Those numbers.

166
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:38,210
If I get your number, your number, your number for that mean if I love them, they are going to be distributed normally.

167
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,730
And why are you going to be distributed, number one?

168
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,830
You think? Because these numbers are your zero.

169
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,150
Right. So this is the perfectly normal distribution here.

170
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:08,599
Those these these amount you pay, the normal distribution like come from the, you know, these values when when I compute the damage.

171
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,960
But then I don't pay that 1000.

172
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:21,590
I cannot pay more than 1000. And so. So these numbers per say are not going to if you plug them, they're not going to be distributed normally.

173
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,420
So why do I think that these numbers they mean is distributed?

174
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:46,830
So suppose that you get a sample of a bunch of numbers and then you add them and then divide by a constant,

175
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,210
which is saying this is what the averages are, right?

176
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:00,240
So then you get a number, then you get another sample with the same 5000 with 5000 numbers,

177
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,720
both different random numbers, then get another average and then another average.

178
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:19,740
Right. So those averages are going to be distributed normally, right, because of the central limit theorem.

179
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,040
So the central theme theorem just tells you that.

180
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,170
And that's why the normal distribution is so important.

181
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,310
If you don't remember anything about the normal distribution,

182
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:42,720
it's everywhere in nature because when you have a lot of different sources of variation or when you use the average,

183
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:53,060
or if you sum a lot of random numbers, no matter where distribution they're coming from, that some are the limit is going to be distributed.

184
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:04,140
The more samples you have is going to be distributed. So that's what a central midfield says.

185
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,690
I'm making that too.

186
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,770
I lose of the expression of, of, of the theorem, but that's okay.

187
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,979
So that's why when you have a regression, you know, the assumption is, oh,

188
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,380
this is normal and they give you the percentile for the normal distribution, right?

189
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:37,499
Because you are taking a sample or they're dealing with a lot of large amount of numbers that are going to be processed in a linear way.

190
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,740
So that's what you write. So it's a linear combination of your numbers,

191
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:51,419
of your the numbers in the sample to get the parameters right and the parameters are going to be distributed.

192
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,840
The estimate of the parameter needs to be normal.

193
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:04,590
So central in in this case, when we talk about the central limits here,

194
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:11,680
what do you mean you think central means in this case, whether we call central or.

195
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,970
At the limit. Things are going to be normal. But since there are limits here, what what the central banks here.

196
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,820
Things are centered around. Is you know,

197
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:37,570
that is a logic interpretation I and most people have that interpretation is

198
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:43,030
centered around the ME right but is not central in this case means important.

199
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:58,620
So it was name. It was so fantastic that any from any place you get the normal distribution in nature from any kind of distribution.

200
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,600
When you ask them what you get,

201
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:11,520
the same normal distribution that was that was so fundamental in the statistic that they called that normal for fundamentally important,

202
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:20,340
awesome, if you like, so that, you know, it's it was you know,

203
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,430
they they want to signify this that this station wanted to see to to signal the importance of things of these.

204
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,280
See this discovery, right? So I can say no.

205
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,780
No. 35%.

206
00:33:49,550 --> 00:34:19,850
See, I. Or do the things you say this sample mean because it means doesn't have the means.

207
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,400
You'll say no, obviously it doesn't it doesn't have anybody ability.

208
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:31,850
Right. That will have a standard deviation. But what we are looking at that is sample the average.

209
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:42,020
We are trying to estimate the mean 95% confidence interval, for example, within the no limit.

210
00:34:49,210 --> 00:35:04,330
And the highly. In the opening minutes.

211
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:23,090
No limit the. This opening here limit.

212
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,390
Okay. And then for Dad, we just know word from our statistics.

213
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:58,960
Right. So, you know, if if we have a sample that they mean is, in this case, 2536 and the standard deviation of this sample is one 57.11,

214
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:10,340
then we know that they that the standard deviation of the mean is going to be the the the

215
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:17,530
standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the number of iterations.

216
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:29,080
Right. So that makes sense. Right? This number is not going to change, I think it doesn't matter how much you have what they durations, how many,

217
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:37,470
how many iterations you have, how many samples you have, these actually make sure they intrinsic variability of this.

218
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,840
Um, but what you want to know is what you want to compute is figured out the

219
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:51,819
variability of the MI or the sample mean and then more and more and more samples.

220
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:58,149
I'd like you to sample the sample size. The mean is going to be less movable, right?

221
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,870
Because you are getting a better approximation of the mean.

222
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,320
So the larger the sample, the smaller is going to be the standard deviation of the mean.

223
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:17,709
So that makes sense that we divide by this square root of it, just somebody version of the sample mean.

224
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:32,240
So to make things you know and and knowing and going about or considering the fact that we think that

225
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:42,240
that sample mean is going to be a minimal distribution that we are going to apply the lower limit,

226
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:50,950
say 2.5% and 95% and 97.5 percentile of the normal distribution the following way.

227
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:00,010
So the lower limit is going to be the mean right minus.

228
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:18,960
And the you know that the 2.5 percentile of the normal distribution is going to be the the the, the mean -1.96 is standard deviation, right?

229
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,190
So the mean -1.96 is standard deviation.

230
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,510
So for the zero one,

231
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:38,770
if we have a standard in a normal distribution center at zero and we observe a the mean center at zero and a standard deviation of one,

232
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:49,420
the 2.5 percentile is going to be at -1.96.

233
00:38:49,840 --> 00:39:01,700
Okay. And the the 97.90 7.5% is going to be at 1.36 plus sometimes.

234
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:07,960
Right. So I'm going to get the lower limit minus one.

235
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:14,860
I'm sorry, the mean -1.96 times.

236
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:31,570
And then we go the, the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sample divided by square root is Q.

237
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,490
Not, then I'm not going to say N minus one.

238
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:46,729
So I'm just simply, you know, in this case, it's going to be 5000, right?

239
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:55,430
So I'm not going to save face some minus one. So these are the same biceps, these are large number.

240
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:07,340
And then we get 1884 is going to be the lower limit, the 2.5 percentile of that distribution.

241
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:30,530
And then the upper limit is going to be the mean the 1.36 times the standard deviation divided by the square root.

242
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,689
Ice House. So steady 79.

243
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,340
So it's a large standard deviation. So I got from 21.91 to 3.79.

244
00:40:52,580 --> 00:41:01,540
You'll see that every time I do some calculation these sample changes because I recalculate the spreadsheet and you know,

245
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:10,880
I haven't in view of a loaded image of the new operating system, then I have a different mean in this release.

246
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:25,160
So for example, if I put any number here and I recalculate then, now I have 27, 20, and then I have these grand opening midterm high rate.

247
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,580
So I'm taking a different sample. Are you the one to be, you know, changing?

248
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:39,980
You know, this needs number floating around. So what what you can do is freeze your sample.

249
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,450
So now we have this is my size.

250
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,410
So some different scenarios of four actually.

251
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,750
This is the one that I want to use. You know what?

252
00:41:53,750 --> 00:42:02,610
What I can do is simply any minute all the formulas take all the formulas from these distributions.

253
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:14,480
So from this table. And what we can do in that, what I can do is select the whole table, throws it an arrow, right?

254
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:28,310
And then I'm going to copy all these numbers, right click and copy and then I'm going up, paste all these numbers, you know, on top of them.

255
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,390
So that's values, right? Not with formula.

256
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:43,610
So I'm going to right click and then copy and then right click and then paste special.

257
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,990
And I'm going to do values.

258
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:54,420
I'm not going to copy formulas or format or anything, just the values the formats are.

259
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,690
So done. So that means that.

260
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:23,770
The. So what means is that right now these numbers do not have any formulas, right?

261
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,450
There's no table here. There is no first row of formula.

262
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,840
These numbers are not going to change. That's going to be more like computation.

263
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:48,040
That's the mean of, you know, we said a couple of thousand, I'm going to think on average, 23, 60 with it, number one, 58.1.

264
00:43:48,760 --> 00:44:03,400
And these 2360 can go, you know, the average can go from 1939 to 27.81, and that's an 85% confidence interval for that number.

265
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:18,350
So. So what, what, what it means.

266
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:35,640
So thinking about there is that that's the he said he's 1919 3920 7.81 represents a the

267
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,560
eradication of that random interval that will try to meet with probability point 95.

268
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:58,630
So that that you know the interpretation is not all the probability of the mean being in within the these two limits is 95%.

269
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,160
That's not the right interpretation. So we just say that but is not correct right.

270
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,160
Unless we use Bayesian statistic that we are you.

271
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:23,450
So some of these means that I constructed an interval that goes from 9719 to 27, 98.

272
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:34,550
And if I repeat that interval with a lower sample and that interval with another sample of the small sample,

273
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:50,630
this series of intervals that I construct will trap the real mean 90 sit with probability point 95, which is that kind of interpretation.

274
00:45:50,660 --> 00:46:01,819
But the reason we cannot say that the probability of the mean being without that interval is 95% is because they mean is a number.

275
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,729
It does indicate it's not a random number. Right.

276
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:15,050
So you cannot say that the probabilities of what we understand in probability of something being in this range or this range,

277
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,650
that's something, you know, must be a random number.

278
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:26,090
Those have a distribution. The mean doesn't have a distribution, but the mean is just a constant.

279
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,120
What we're trying to do is estimate the mean with these estimates.

280
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:42,400
So this is is to the purist, it should say sample mean, but that's fine.

281
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,580
Now let's do the same thing. Yeah.

282
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,730
Mine closed down on me. Can I see the formula for the limit?

283
00:46:50,760 --> 00:47:01,590
The lower and upper limit should. And you see that?

284
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:19,580
It'd be a good idea that you just take a few minutes and review the confidence intervals and how

285
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:27,650
to construct a confidence interval with that normal distribution from your final one class.

286
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:36,870
Something that. You never thought it was going to be useful.

287
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:49,470
Here it is. Now they make what is you now?

288
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:59,380
Now we need to solve is what if we want to know how these numbers they mean in the standard deviation,

289
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,230
the opening and the lower limit, apparently more than 9090 5% confidence interval.

290
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,370
How those numbers change if we have different outcome.

291
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:24,000
So I think we we are going to start with the double of 500 and then we are going to increase that by 500.

292
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:32,340
Right. So we got to do so.

293
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:38,040
So with that, they talked about 500, 1000, 1500, 2000.

294
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:46,330
What is going to be that mean? The standard deviation for each one of those?

295
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,200
With 5000 iterations.

296
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:09,700
So. Soon.

297
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:19,910
I am. You know, to get to get out of some things in Excel.

298
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,270
I escape a lot, you know, automatically, right?

299
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:33,380
Without thinking an escape brings out the the menu, you know, interact with the menu.

300
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,270
So that's why I escape and that you get the floating bar had to either protein

301
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:48,450
bar so I need to figure out a way to disable that's key for us to happen.

302
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,930
So okay let's create my 5000 numbers like I did before.

303
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:00,160
So I place my cursor line.

304
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:18,750
Then I'm going to go home and feel this baby is series and these series are in this series in columns, right?

305
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:28,110
Is there linear growth? Is it values one is going income, environment and the stock value is 5000.

306
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,770
Okay. So I have like 3000 numbers.

307
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:50,510
Okay. Nail my hand to the teeth.

308
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,010
Okay, so now what would you see?

309
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,810
What would I want to create? Is it to weight data people and the way data table is?

310
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,160
What I want to put here is the amount you pay.

311
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,170
Exactly what I have.

312
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:20,330
In this column like this, the only thing that I'm going to love is for the 500th deductable.

313
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,090
I want to put the amount you pay for 5000 iterations for the 1000 deductible.

314
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,210
I'm going to put them on you pay and so on.

315
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:42,560
So it's not a I don't have a list of formulas for the first row because at first row right now are the parameters that I want to change.

316
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:53,479
One of these is these these are going to be my roll input cell and these are going to be the column inputs down to the column of

317
00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:04,120
input that they wrote in that I'm going to put into a cell in the spreadsheet right now at the intersection of that first row,

318
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:10,370
the first column. I'm going to see that formula that will generate the amount I base.

319
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:15,139
So that's going to be equal to the amount you pay.

320
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:22,970
That's when my simulation here. I don't have to encode that because I'm not going to copy that formula.

321
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:29,020
The table is going to evaluate that formula. No.

322
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:38,200
What's going to happen? I'm going to tell Excel to take each one of those numbers.

323
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,260
Okay. One and 502 and 501.

324
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,989
1000 to 1000. 5000.

325
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:56,710
And then start putting the resulting on IP in the proper book to do that.

326
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,500
I am going to select the whole table from.

327
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,810
He dinero. And to the right.

328
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:29,570
And then I'm going to go into data and then why do you for analysis and then I'm going to go into data people.

329
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:38,070
Now I have a two way data table. They call them input cell is the same as that first table.

330
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:45,240
So I use one to put those equations in a place that they don't bother anybody, any cell in Excel.

331
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:54,000
So I just want them I just want that number to force a calculation in Excel so that

332
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:02,760
these column they they cell that they're going to be placed on this anything.

333
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:13,530
Anywhere, right. So any blank cell now the row input cell that corresponds to the double, right.

334
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:26,670
So I need to take each one of those numbers is sitting on the south side on the place, then that number in the, in, in, in the spreadsheet.

335
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:35,100
So their calculation actually takes into account that they have a new deductible.

336
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:44,180
Where do we put the results. You can click click double is here right this.

337
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:54,310
So what is good with Excel is going to do is instead of fine so instead of a thousand you know if it is that we're evaluating the column of 500,

338
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:06,970
then it puts the 500 there and they call it because we refer these computations here, these need to be acted accordingly.

339
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:19,180
Right. So what you mean is, where do I have where do I put the deductable the row these first row is going to be on this cell.

340
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,570
So now we are ready to fill the table.

341
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:39,570
Now we have our table. Like before you have to make.

342
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:56,500
And once you know that they have informants and the police.

343
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:16,710
The informants. Okay.

344
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:32,260
So. The point is now we have all these numbers.

345
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:43,330
So sometimes the numbers are this is that these are double these numbers.

346
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,310
See, if we if we pay less than the level where.

347
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:34,980
So basically people. I think that we should be able to pay for most of it at least once.

348
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,370
But I don't see any need to.

349
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,730
Easy for me to say for rent.

350
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:08,510
Okay. You see, 16 is greater than the death toll, which is nearly double.

351
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:15,460
Otherwise he the damage which is 60 inches.

352
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,950
Then this number, the damage will be 13 dead.

353
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,940
So some change. Take a look at.

354
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:49,010
Let's see, the mean of the standard deviation. The mean and the standard deviation will mean that for the average.

355
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,220
But let's this freeze. Sorry. Let me freeze the.

356
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:08,460
Example first. Let me let me the sample.

357
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:26,180
So I am going to. Can't.

358
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:42,080
I mean, then we get the whole table.

359
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:50,150
Right. And then I'm going to right click and Kofi and then right click.

360
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,840
Okay. Special and place based on values.

361
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:06,380
Now the frozen. It grows and able.

362
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,250
I just cannot believe this number here is not doing anything anymore.

363
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,530
He said.

364
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,040
And then I can create my own variation.

365
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:38,190
So this is going to be equal to the average of this first column.

366
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,150
And means he's going to be the standard deviation of the first column.

367
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,940
He is we don't is.

368
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:27,130
And then we got the lower limit and opening it for the confidence interval for the mean it's going to be the mean -1.86 times is done.

369
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:32,130
The elevation right abi is where.

370
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:47,420
So. And this is going to be equal to the mean of.

371
01:01:48,900 --> 01:02:05,470
One in 96 is standard deviation divided by the year 2000.

372
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,860
Now I can just copy all these formulas to the right.

373
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:25,620
And these formulas to the right. Okay.

374
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:35,640
So I got for 1500, it was about $35.

375
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:42,090
Is around that number you got? Yes.

376
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:54,900
So if we had if we had got, you know, a larger sample, I think we all would have much closer and.

377
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:15,060
Sure. I wish we could see something that looks good to.

378
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:36,740
If they go. I.

379
01:03:42,090 --> 01:04:02,140
According to. Here is how he said those were his words.

380
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:07,730
Okay. All right.

381
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:22,960
So now. Okay, so this is how you do a simulation, a somewhat simple simulation in Excel if you didn't have any add ons to accept the simulation.

382
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:34,640
So. But what if we had some tools that we allowed to represent distributions and,

383
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:45,520
and do graphs better, easier and than actually just using the Excel Excel functions.

384
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:59,230
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this and I'm going to introduce you so we can play with you.

385
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:09,580
I'm going to introduce you to a program or add on Call at risk, which comes with a policy decision.

386
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:26,590
This is at 8.2. You can go into programs and the values say this is should 24, 22, but you can get these icons double click on the icon stock.

387
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,550
So you can order.

388
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,030
When you see welcome to at risk, you simply close that window.

389
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:06,810
And maybe we'll see this issue to the level of they just ignore the.

390
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:23,979
I. And so this this menu, you're going to find it at risk.

391
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:32,830
So instead of coping, is a thousand interracial or 5000 that you actually can define the number of iterations.

392
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:39,550
Get it right. And I'm going to explain what the number of simulations mean later on.

393
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,470
You have a lot of settings to see how you know, you know,

394
01:06:46,090 --> 01:07:03,310
what you can view in the screen and how to change the parameters of your simulations so you can have a lot of functions and distributions to do that.

395
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:09,470
Pretty Preprogramed is it?

396
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:15,400
This is the normal distribution is going to be a risk not.

397
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:32,150
Least normal, for example, here, Chi Square uniform, the uniform here.

398
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:36,470
And those are continuous distribution in one discrete distribution.

399
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,660
Those are the ones, some of the ones that have already preprogramed.

400
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:48,920
You can define your own distributions, but I'm going to tell you, for example, how it goes.

401
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:59,260
Suppose you all get used to the same x, but I'm going to use the the.

402
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:10,660
Icons to actually generate these attributes. I suppose that I want to generate a normal distinguish, right.

403
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:19,480
So I there is a syntax that you have to just write normal with parameters,

404
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:28,600
but if you don't remember does seem that you can always go then go to these functions and then go,

405
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,060
okay, this is normal, a continuous sort of discrete.

406
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:39,640
This is the reason would be right here.

407
01:08:49,720 --> 01:09:01,030
And I'm going to generate a normal need of this house to generate the same normal that we were dealing with.

408
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:08,520
3000. Standard deviation is 750.

409
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:20,660
Right now, what you're seeing is the mean of the distribution.

410
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:30,410
But let's say that I want to get Rob Ice House and let's say 10,000 iterations from the normal and see how it looks.

411
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:36,740
So I'm going to go into 10,000 here and I'm going to simulate.

412
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:51,170
Right now, it looks. So the blue is your sample, right?

413
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:56,360
And there is the theoretical distribution that we're sampling from.

414
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:03,920
And you see that a histogram with 10,000 iterations almost perfectly match the theoretical distribution.

415
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,610
So here I have.

416
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:20,450
Okay, my, my distribution means 3000 and this is my with a standard deviation to 1750.

417
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:27,500
Take a look at how to the right to the left goes out to the right it goes right.

418
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,350
And what else do I need?

419
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,620
Let's say instead of the 90% style, an 80% confidence interval.

420
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,559
How about if I want 95% confidence intervals?

421
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:52,430
So I would put here. Fleet.

422
01:10:53,810 --> 01:11:01,390
People are doing all kinds of.

423
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:19,290
Right. So you have a 95% confidence interval that goes from 1529 to 4470.

424
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:35,490
And you can see that the percentile is here, 97.5 and the 2.5 year percentile.

425
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:40,960
So this is just a very crude soup.

426
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:52,380
A very crude illustration of, you know, what these problems can do.

427
01:11:53,340 --> 01:12:08,100
So I gave you some videos to watch and some of the videos give you some introduction to what risk problems, you know, handle with that risk.

428
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:18,060
We are going to start handling those problems on Thursday for you to finish the homework, number one.

429
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:24,490
So let's do something else here.

430
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:30,630
Suppose I want to generate a.

431
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:39,359
Suppose I want to generate a flat distribution and a uniform distribution.

432
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:49,050
So to do that and let's say that all this distribution will be like random between zero and one.

433
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:53,370
Right. So for that, let's see what we'll do.

434
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,600
I'm going to functions and then continuous distribution.

435
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:08,250
So I'm saying this is a uniform and I'm going to be the minimum is going to be zero, the maximum.

436
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,960
So this is exactly as they ran the function in Excel.

437
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,020
I'm glad you generated that with that risk.

438
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:35,630
So if if I want to generate 10,000 iterations of this number, then we'll simply simulate that instead of seeing that in that table.

439
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:42,620
So I just save all this iteration of the things outside iterations that you can actually see them later.

440
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:47,030
So take a look at the histogram is perfectly flat right after thing.

441
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:56,389
That was 93. Now suppose that I copy this frisk uniform.

442
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:07,440
So I went to the key here and I am going to go down, right?

443
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:11,600
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

444
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:16,150
One, two, four, six, seven.

445
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:29,150
Eight, nine, ten, 70, 77 and 84.

446
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:51,770
So we have 84. When you get 84, 84 different normal uniform distribution.

447
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:59,770
So if I want to see how these looks, these one liners, click on that specific distribution.

448
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:13,910
When I simulate the height. They're all going to be.

449
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:23,570
They are all going to be flat uniform distribution.

450
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:34,370
Right. And if you want you know, I don't recommend that that you do that often, but because it doesn't affect the computations.

451
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:44,930
But you can change these settings so you can view everything that changes in this and everything that changes in the screen.

452
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,640
So everything that changes in the simulation would change in the screen.

453
01:15:49,820 --> 01:16:01,800
So it takes a lot of time, but you can actually go these a little bit more than nine days.

454
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:14,360
I am going to say A for this one first random variable because I don't want to take forever.

455
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:21,430
Let me. 5000 or thousand. And then simulate that.

456
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,589
See all these numbers? This is what the simulation does.

457
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,510
Right. So these Kenyans at the same time.

458
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:37,600
So all of them are flat distribution. Okay.

459
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:49,270
Now, suppose that then I would I'm going to take this sum of all these numbers.

460
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:58,930
So I'm going to say, do this if you want the average or the same thing.

461
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:10,840
Because it averages this sum divided by by constant.

462
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:18,530
So what are we? Right. So, of course, the average here is going to be point five.

463
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:24,900
If you want to see. So it's going to take a few on some of the waiting for it.

464
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:34,380
If you want to see the you know, this number is changing in the screen.

465
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:44,110
You can right now, they're just showing all the random numbers, their respective value.

466
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,020
So they're just showing the main bodies.

467
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:57,450
You click on this icon, then it's going to you're going to see different numbers coming from it's a random sample.

468
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,719
So if you press f nine did a calculation in Excel that you'll see all these numbers changing.

469
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:13,110
One, two, three. Right. Right now, the average is 49 because we have 84.

470
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:17,400
Right. So all of them are distributed between zero and one.

471
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,469
We have 84 of them. So he's not white point five.

472
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:32,520
But if I were to have more replication, more a sample, a larger sample, I then you'll see which growth point in time.

473
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:39,300
But the question is, how is this normal? If those are flat, how is this number distributed?

474
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,620
So I'm going to pay special attention to these numbers.

475
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:49,590
So I'm going to click here and I'm going to simulate.

476
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:59,430
Sounds a little bit like. We take.

477
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:06,210
I think we.

478
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:22,820
Yes. No one is so quick to pay special attention to Islam and he doesn't have any Iraqi formula.

479
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,910
So they should do that.

480
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:33,110
But I need to make sure that we keep track of the numbers by looking at output.

481
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:36,860
So I'm going to declare that's output.

482
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,130
And just the average input.

483
01:19:42,140 --> 01:20:07,650
The average. And they now know if you add at risk for risk output average and then obviously to see how we can see.

484
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:16,299
All these sort of flat, all these independent distribution are flat.

485
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:25,000
And you see how this is shaping up is is tending to ignore.

486
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:32,830
That's the central theory and demonstration.

487
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:37,900
You know, some people might start to make their parents work.

488
01:20:38,410 --> 01:21:11,889
All right. I'll see you Thursday. It is great to see you.

489
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:39,130
In case you want to see this, it is just steps towards, you know what you are.

490
01:21:40,050 --> 01:22:04,780
I think I know one letter to the bishops.

491
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:25,629
I just want to let you know what was going on because I was like, this is ugly.

492
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:29,800
Like, Oh, you are lives as well, okay?

493
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,670
This makes me feel better.

494
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:39,129
And we're on the same page. I like added some colors.

495
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:48,590
And if I was like, Yeah, it's not necessary, you start something.

496
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:54,910
I just started every project on one day and that's so funny.

497
01:22:54,940 --> 01:23:04,750
Yeah, right. Yeah. But this job group.

498
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:09,400
Are you going to do it? Yeah.

499
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:16,380
Yeah. Didn't ask any questions here.

500
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:32,020
And it is okay. I think I think a lot of which has to do with just like exactly the attacks on

501
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:49,810
Sunday night and reporter not so much talked about it in the first few months.

502
01:23:51,020 --> 01:24:11,700
Okay. Yes, I do the process to figure out who I know, but it's like it's so funny that, you know, this time I don't think it's like it's from there.

503
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:23,020
It's just like, oh, like when I got your house, it looks like, yeah, we like to hear from, like, you know.

504
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:32,470
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

505
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:46,980
I mean, this is about all of the people on the other side.

506
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,650
That's not going to.
