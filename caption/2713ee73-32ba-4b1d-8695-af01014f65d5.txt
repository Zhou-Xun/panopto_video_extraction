1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:15,710
For an event like this might be like working.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:34,709
It's just that it's actually I got I started to talk about this later.

3
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:45,270
We introduced this five hour run of our house, and today we're going to look at additional distribution for one variable given the other.

4
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,180
Okay. So what's unique to this five hour in case of variables for first of all,

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,670
let's define what a conditional distribution is for to run variables before we do that.

6
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,429
Recall that in the previous chapters we introduced a notion of critical probability event to events.

7
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,050
We can always calculate the conditional probability of one event given the other.

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:24,360
So the formula is as follows. P The probability of A given B policy and b are events in the sample space is defined as the

9
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,540
probability of the intersection of this two events divided by the probability of events be.

10
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:43,769
So that's how we define positional probability and recall that we have checked the common ground axioms and these conditional

11
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,910
probability is also a probability because the well probability is cited by all of these properties for probability,

12
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,120
right? It's always between zero and one and it has this kind of odd activity.

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,400
We have proof, all of it. So this is a valid probability definition.

14
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,899
Conditional probability is that special probability. Now,

15
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,270
what do we want to do is we want to extend this to the random arrows and do

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,400
not consider a discrete case first and then move on to the continuous case.

17
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,230
So the way to define conditional distribution on conditional distribution,

18
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:33,000
especially if at this point none of our balls is essentially the same as how we define conditional probability for events.

19
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,840
We call that for two variables X and Y.

20
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:46,170
We can characterize the distribution, the joint distribution using this joint PMA X for any given data point x, y, small x, y.

21
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,240
You can always evaluate the probability of that by plugging into this joint PMA.

22
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,260
So that just defines the probability of these two events, the intersection of these two events, right?

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:07,260
So y event being the right amount of a y taking value, small y, and the other event is a random variable x taking out a small people.

24
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:18,660
And once we have this two events defined, we can evaluate the conditional probability as we did before.

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,140
Essentially the probability of a given.

26
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:32,780
B, as we have said before, is defined as the probability of A and D over the probability fit.

27
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:44,340
And if you just plug in what A and B is into this calculation on the left hand side, that's exactly any additional distribution or Y give an X.

28
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:52,920
And so on the left hand side, you have this probability of this random variable Y taking out a small Y, given the amount of moral parts,

29
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,860
taking out a smaller part is equal to AB,

30
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:07,350
which is the probability of actually quite a small Y for the smaller and denominator being a probability of B which is equal to us.

31
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:17,790
And now if you look at this probability in the numerator, not exactly how we defined a joint PMA so we can replace that by to join PMT and

32
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:25,290
denominator is just the marginal PMA for X and that gave us this joint conditional PMA.

33
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,830
Okay. So the bottom line is this there is nothing new here.

34
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,340
And exactly especially for this this coronavirus drawn discrete random variable,

35
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,170
the conditional distribution is defined in the same way as we define the

36
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,390
conditional probabilities are two events at the end of the conditional PMA or Y,

37
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:59,880
given x is its price and the ratio numerator is drawn up as denominator of PMA for the market.

38
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09,540
The marginal PMI for which however the run of arable that is conditional and so that is called a conditional.

39
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:18,270
Yeah a Y given acts. Similarly, if you want to calculate the conditional pm, I ask you about why you just put x and y.

40
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,950
So. I'll ask about why.

41
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:34,490
Is. Every this too.

42
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:45,290
So the only difference is that the enemy there now, instead of using the marginal PMO or X use the marginal pimp Y, right.

43
00:05:52,450 --> 00:06:00,610
So previously for the conditional distribution, a conditional probability would have shown that it actually is a valid probability.

44
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:07,000
Similarly here, we can also show that this conditional PMA is a valid PMA function.

45
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,950
To show that, we need to verify a few things.

46
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,780
First of all, it has to be a positive function or non-active function.

47
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,490
If you look at how is defined, how this conditional PMA is defined is the ratio between two camps.

48
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:33,040
Both teams are non-active. So of course this is non-active, but that one is correct.

49
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,900
And most importantly, we need to show that this sum.

50
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,470
You're the sum of all possible values.

51
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,910
Or this conditional. Yeah.

52
00:06:50,740 --> 00:07:02,230
Should be equal to one. Right. In order for you to be a piano of the sum of all of this PMT values and this support, it should be equal to one.

53
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,910
You see that plug in what the definition is.

54
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,200
So in the numerator you have y in the denominator you don't even have a y.

55
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,280
So that's the summation only applied to the numerator.

56
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:28,270
And what do we know about the numerator? If you sum up all parts of our y values by the way out you fix x.

57
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,640
Sum of all possible. That is a Y for this joint PMA.

58
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:40,090
What you have, I just gave us the marginal here.

59
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:49,990
So that's how we go from the joint PMA to the marginal PMA essentially integrate out one of the variables in this case.

60
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:57,010
That just means sum up all the possible values on the other right amount that gave us this marginal PMT for X,

61
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,980
which is exactly the same as the nominator that I know about in one.

62
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:18,190
Right? So that is to say this is a valid PMA, but conditional PMA is also a valid PMA and we can also define conditional CDF.

63
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,160
This is not going to be a.

64
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,940
Some. Building up.

65
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,030
Why last I this small line. You have an ax.

66
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:58,350
Quite the small ax. And by definition, that is the probability of y, y and x equal to ax divided by the probability of ac contracts and the numerator.

67
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,980
You can write it in terms of the summation.

68
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:11,100
All the y i that's what it's like.

69
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:19,670
Y i ac that's. At the end of the day.

70
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,780
So just what I did is just following the definition and derive this condition on the phone.

71
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,660
And Republican National Syria Coalition, I'll say to you, at the end of the day, it's just a summation of all of this.

72
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,620
Why values last are equal to this cut off the small white office congressional piano.

73
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,460
Well, that's exactly how I define CDF or any this code of antivirals.

74
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,430
Any question? So again, there is nothing new here.

75
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,310
It's just, you know, extending what we have learned for conditional probability to the run of our.

76
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:49,359
Okay. And let's consider our example to just enhance the understanding of this definition of patients and say that we are we have five cars sold from

77
00:10:49,360 --> 00:11:01,270
a standard back end but acts one might memorable be the number of aces in this five cars and why being the number of tenths in this five cards.

78
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:14,210
The question is what is the marginal or x given Y the quadratic equation?

79
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:24,050
So first of all, if you look how this marginal distributions are acts on a Y, what is the support, for example?

80
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,500
What is a support box and why? Yes.

81
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,270
Zero. One, two, three, four. Very good for each of it.

82
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,650
Zero, one, two, three, four. All right. That's the possible values, this X and Y content.

83
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,670
But if you look at them jointly, are they independent? They're not right.

84
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,880
Because one thing, too, is that you can easily notice that I ask why has to be the last article five.

85
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,360
I only have five cars, so x plus one has to be the last article to file.

86
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:16,130
If access for you know, if a shorter than a y cannot be anything, i y can only be zero or one.

87
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,550
Alternatively, if y is equal to three, x can only be 012.

88
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:31,220
So apparently this to round about what they are not independent. One does not independent.

89
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,070
One is not independent of the other one. They are related.

90
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:46,100
So then the question is we have to derive that from this review set here to further derive this conditional distribution.

91
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,540
So that's one way to do it.

92
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:56,100
You can go from the drawing distribution and the marginals and then follow that definition to derive this conditional distribution.

93
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:06,180
Okay. So I'll give you a couple minutes and you can try to follow that and see whether

94
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,590
you can derive this conditional conditional distribution for asking about life.

95
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:40,940
She's. Three.

96
00:14:22,700 --> 00:15:58,549
Yes. Okay.

97
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:06,140
So let's look at this together and see how do we derive the conditional distribution for X given Y equal to two?

98
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:17,300
So first off, we should use the definition to express this conditional distribution in terms of the ratio.

99
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,290
So that's the first step in the numerator.

100
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,970
We have this joint PMT or this two discriminant marbles divided by this small x and two.

101
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,610
And the denominator is just the marginals or what you value out of two.

102
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,430
That's the definition. All right. That's how I define a conditional PMA in the first place.

103
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,950
Now, the problem becomes how do we evaluate the numerator and denominator separately?

104
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,240
As long as we can evaluate those two, we take the ratio, we get the final result.

105
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,370
All right. First, let's look at the numerator.

106
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:06,080
Essentially what that means is the probability of the random variable x taken by the smart and the random out of a y taking out of small taken by two.

107
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,830
That's what the numerator is. So that's the intersection of this two event actually acts like of two and a ways.

108
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,800
As we have argued before, says X and Y, they are not independent.

109
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,590
Given that a y for two to y is equal to a two as to not be anybody.

110
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,760
Right. So what is the support for X in this case?

111
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,790
Zero zero, one, two, three and a two now taken by it for.

112
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,100
Right. Because if I take one for the X plus Y is equal to six.

113
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,600
That's greater than that. Several cards. But that's impossible for actually quite a far.

114
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,110
The conditional probability is always zero. Even Y is equal to two.

115
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:08,270
So the only support is zero, one, two, three. So now if you look at this numerator, what is the probability of asking for x y positive?

116
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:17,540
That's what we are trying to calculate. Similarly, for the denominator, one of our trying to calculate the probability of this y equal to two.

117
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,890
So let's start from the numerator denominator, which is easier to calculate the probability of y positive.

118
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,760
Recall that y is a number of tens in this five cards.

119
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:38,290
So what is the probability of the you have to cancel out of five cards because this is exactly two against x.

120
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:55,530
So how many different ways to draw five cards from this deck? How many different ways to drive by cars to choose five.

121
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,950
Good. And how many out of this 50 choose five.

122
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,410
How many ways to draw five cars with two kids?

123
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,020
You have this constraint, you have to have two cans in those five cars.

124
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,810
That's the first step. You first need to draw 2/10.

125
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:25,580
And how many ways to draw two cans? How many cars are there in the.

126
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,700
All right. How many ways to draw two accounts. Right.

127
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,140
So that's how many ways they can draw two accounts. You need to satisfy that constraint first.

128
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,240
Once you have those two accounts, then you have to fill in the remaining three parts.

129
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:54,249
How many options do we have to choose? Three. Is that 52 minus two or is it 52?

130
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,879
Minus four? 52 minus four.

131
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,110
Right. Because we cannot draw any additional accounts.

132
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:12,400
So that's 48. True three. If you multiply this two, you've got the number of possibilities or number of combinations with 2/10 in this five cards.

133
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,390
So the ratio is just the probability of Y 42.

134
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:28,660
Similarly, on this side of this numerator, we are trying to calculate the probability of x aces and two counts.

135
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:37,479
Numerator is the total number of ways to draw five cards and the denominator and

136
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,650
the numerator is how many ways to draw five cards with ax aces and two cans.

137
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:52,000
So now just consider this smart x has caused some cost and mistake by zero one, two or three,

138
00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:03,520
but whichever view it takes, it's just a constant to how many ways to draw our aces and to bypass.

139
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,300
To calculate that again, we need to break it down in two steps. First, let's draw the aces.

140
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,310
Or we can start with a 10th. It doesn't matter. So let's start with the aces.

141
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:25,340
In order to draw acts. Aces. How many different ways you have to work for that?

142
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:33,280
All right. You have four different aces in the back and you need acts of them.

143
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,660
Support with X. At second step, you need to choose against or choose to.

144
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,050
Same as before. And finally, you have to choose the remaining cards.

145
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:54,520
How many are remaining cards? Five minus two by a minus X number of remaining cards that I have to choose.

146
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,500
All right. And how many remaining options you have? Two.

147
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Minus four. Minus four. All right.

148
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:12,270
So if you calculate not, that's the probability. So you in the end, what do we need to do is to take the ratio between these two together.

149
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:31,540
Find out final answer to be worked with x 4 to 3 minus x over 4 to 8 two three and and this is four x equal to zero one, two and three.

150
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:43,900
Any other x value is always equal to zero. That's a conditional PMF or x given y constitute after.

151
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,940
You can also think about other possibilities. Right. Given life, what's a one?

152
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:57,040
What is a conditional human, perhaps even y criteria for what is a conditional PENTAQUARKS?

153
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,370
So you can do those additional exercise off the books. Any questions?

154
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:17,740
So that's another example. So we can consider the conditional distribution of 2% in running variables.

155
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,990
Assume X and Y are two independent variables, both having Palsson distribution and with different parameters.

156
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,259
I'm the one I'm going to get from.

157
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:36,640
What do I have learned before Independence? Since they're an independent run of our boss that joined PM about PMF?

158
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,640
It's just a part of the individual PMF and so we can write off the joint distribution explicitly

159
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,530
as follows A joint PMF or X and Y is just the product of this two individual account.

160
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,860
Yeah, one was the one, one was 11.

161
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,130
To those are the parts parameters for X and Y separately.

162
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:07,720
And that support is just all of the possible, all of the non-active integer points and both X and y contain anybody is zero to infinity.

163
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,430
That's the set up. Then the question is first question, what is the marginal distribution for the sum of this to rent amounts?

164
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:29,880
And second question, what is a conditional distribution of acts given that's first of all, let's look at the some of this to run about.

165
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,910
If we sum up X and Y, what they know about us is as a random variable.

166
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,640
It is. All right.

167
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:47,579
Because, again, if you don't know how to decide whether to run a variable, not to go back to the definition random out, it's just a math.

168
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,860
As long as the original sample space to the real space is a random sample.

169
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,650
So the sum of this to run a variable is still a maybe, right?

170
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,559
The combination of this two mappings is still mapping, so it's still the imagine from the original sample space to this real space.

171
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,150
So as is also a random sample and it's also discrete because the support of us

172
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,640
is also from zero to infinity and can only take non-active integer values.

173
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,080
So as is also a random variable and it is also a discrete random variable.

174
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,160
And with data we can try to decide what is the marginal distribution for this new roundabout has?

175
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,850
So in the next chapter, we're going to learn about John Transformation,

176
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:47,500
where you kind of directly write out that the marginal PMA for this as run available or for now since we haven't learned that one would be our tool,

177
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,900
you got this marginal situation, how do we got the marginal distribution for us?

178
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,389
Definition. Right. That's your. So whenever you have trouble, you know, I apply.

179
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,830
I always go back to the definition. That's our last resort.

180
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:15,350
You can always rely on it. So to get on to Mars, our distribution of us we can first consider.

181
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:34,910
First we noticed that as a support the 012 all the way to infinity I and two got the margin of the distribution.

182
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,100
We can either calculate the PM up or calculate the PD, the CDF.

183
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,030
Either way we can, we can grab a distribution for us. In this case, we can directly calculate the PM.

184
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,330
To the coverage here. This is Tom Cole as this is smiles.

185
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,770
So. We want to calculate the PMI or this new random variable has.

186
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:12,370
All we need to do is to evaluate for any small house in this zero 1 to 2 infinity set.

187
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:25,330
What is the probability of this random variable as taking this small value as long as we can have a pleasant expression for this probability?

188
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,020
We got the formula for the piano runabout.

189
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,920
But so now consider this event as equal to smalls.

190
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,930
What does that mean in terms of accent a one? Because we know the distribution for accent of what we don't know.

191
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:54,910
Distribution for us, if we can somehow translate this event, this as equal to a small us into some event that is characterized by both X and a Y.

192
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,960
We can use the joint distribution for X and Y to evaluate that probability.

193
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:13,780
So that's the idea of how to like this. And so the probability of the event of as small as it is just you can break it down into different scenarios.

194
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,880
So if you consider how assets are constructed, it's just a sum of this two plus amount of our boss, x and Y.

195
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,820
Okay. So if us if I take my name zero.

196
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,620
The order for the sum to take by this small ask what has the y have to take?

197
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:42,670
Has to be small. All right. Alternatively, if I take in my one Y has to be s minus one.

198
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:50,680
If I is taking money to the Y has to be smallest minus two and so on.

199
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,820
So of course the largest value x and take is just the smallest and the math has Y has to be zero.

200
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,850
Those are all possibilities for this sum to be equal to the smallest.

201
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,240
And those are all mutually exclusive events. Right.

202
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:20,760
So what that means, you kind of express this event as the union of a bunch of mutually exclusive events,

203
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,960
and each event is defining exactly what has what.

204
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:32,430
What I just said. Or alternatively, you can express it as the summation of this individual probabilities of.

205
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:47,800
Acts from zero to small has a probability of taking very small x y taking value as minus small x.

206
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:01,680
The original probability of AC quite as small as is now translated as a sum of individual probabilities.

207
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,860
For each individual probability can be fully evaluated using just x and Y.

208
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:19,170
And alternatively, you can also use Y as your index Y from zero to assets that are going to be

209
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:27,090
starting from as minus Y and a Y going to start from this body y equivalent.

210
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:39,460
So this is just one of those important points. Now, what we need to do is to explicitly write out what the probability of this individual cases is.

211
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:51,160
If you put in the chosen PM, I've got y acts as my nonsense.

212
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,630
Okay? And then you plug in this drawing power function and simplify this calculation.

213
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:06,809
Okay? Oh, I'll give you a couple of minutes and try to plug in what this joint pump is and see whether we can simplify

214
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:16,260
this summation so that you got the final formula for this marginal clamp of this new round of our balance.

215
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:34,330
She's. Since.

216
00:31:49,430 --> 00:34:00,900
You. Okay.

217
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:08,750
I got it. So here is to our nation so we can look at this together.

218
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:18,560
Once you notice that the original camp mates past using this summation, you can just plug it in to this joint PMA for X and Y.

219
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,010
So this is what you have. Once you plug it in. Right.

220
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:31,730
And then we can clean out this summation and only leave what is necessary in this summation and take all the content outside this submission.

221
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:43,970
So once we do that, we notice that we have this X bacterial times, s minus x factorial in the numerator, so that you need to notice.

222
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:55,510
Well, that essentially is that trick. So once you notice those, the product of those two factorial, that should remind you of the end shows.

223
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,610
K. Operator. All right.

224
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:05,510
So if you have additional factorial as the numerator and it becomes obvious as choose X

225
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,090
and this as factorial can be taken outside of this summation as additional constant.

226
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:19,800
And then inside the summation it just becomes this quantity as choose X from the one to the x,

227
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,840
and I'm going to add to the as minus x and I suppose proposition to us.

228
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,350
And now we can use the equality that we have learned before.

229
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:39,979
Right. If you have this summation of interest, kx1 to the end, x one to the cake x two minus k,

230
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,800
then we know is equal to the one plus lambda two to the power of us.

231
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,900
That's just the common historical result that we have thought of when we first

232
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,479
introduced this and chose annotation and putting everything back together.

233
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,610
We have these expression that's a PMA and that is the support is from zero one to previous.

234
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:12,200
But this PMF look familiar it's a on distribution.

235
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,150
All right. So it has this power term. It's also has this exponential term.

236
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,409
The only difference with the previous course is now the new.

237
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,850
It has a new rate parameter, which is the one plus longitude,

238
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:35,570
which tells us this random variable as actually it's also right a variable with parameter lambda one plus 1 to 2.

239
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,430
Okay. So this is a very important result.

240
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,639
If you sum up to individual plus all around the variables,

241
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:52,290
you will also have a random variable and the new rate is going to be the summation of the individual rates of the program as it is.

242
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,959
Suppose random variable has to be independent. Only was independence.

243
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,450
You have this result. So now we have.

244
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:08,670
So the first question, the marginal distribution for us we know is also on distribution with new rate number one plus two.

245
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,620
And any question about the first question? All right.

246
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,040
Now let's move on to the second part, which is the conditional distribution of X events.

247
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:31,480
And so the conditional distribution has given us the other word, this.

248
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:39,890
Is what we are after. We want had arrived is conditional or has given us.

249
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:53,160
By definition, that is the joint distribution of X as divided by the margin distribution class.

250
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:04,950
Right. So that's. That's the that's the definition.

251
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,390
In order to derive this conditional distribution and conditional PMA.

252
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:15,690
We just need to see if we just need to evaluate the numerator and denominator separately.

253
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:25,110
Once we have both, we can plug it in and you can notice that the denominator actually we have we just derived it is a plus on.

254
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,900
Yeah. So you can directly plug in. The only thing that needs further derivation is a numerator.

255
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,230
Namely, we need to know what is a joint pms or ax and adds.

256
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:50,130
So let's take it here. So the Joint Plan of Action US says that this is this very roundabout.

257
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:57,700
That just means the joint probability of acts equal acts as equal to us.

258
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:10,390
That's what the joint PMF means. By definition, do we have a joint probability function for acts and as.

259
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:19,560
We do not. What do we have? We know that drawn PMF or outside of war.

260
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,220
That's what we know. Right. But now we are trying to evaluate, John,

261
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:34,820
of asking us if we can somehow convert this to a joint probability or accent of what we know how to solve that.

262
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:41,930
All right. So how do we convert this guy to the joint probability of Axion away?

263
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,050
Now you have to notice as how us as defined.

264
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,990
This House is not any have any ads, right.

265
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,420
It's specifically related to accent A why in this way is equal to X plus Y.

266
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:11,510
So that is equal to that is equivalent to say as a call to ask and ask us what do you call two acts?

267
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,630
Right. And once you write that out, you will notice that this is actually quite angst.

268
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:28,610
This event is equivalent to actually X and Y equal to one minus X,

269
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:38,450
and that is how we can convert the original drawing probability of x and has to this new drawing probability accent y.

270
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:50,990
And now I know how to evaluate this, right? So I give you a couple minutes, plug it in, and calculate what the conditional PMA is, what has given us.

271
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,120
And so let's look at this result together. So once you plug it in.

272
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,050
The rest is just simply by this formula with some derivation.

273
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:10,530
You can check it out. Fine. You will find the final expression for this additional piano of our given us in this formula.

274
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,210
Past choose x times from the one over from the one plus longitude to the power

275
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,800
x times the two over lambda one plus from the two to the power of s minus x.

276
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,250
And this x does not take any value. Right as as a support.

277
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:49,540
So what is the support of x addition of home as summation has equal to some value has taken value from zero one to all the way to as it cannot exceed

278
00:43:49,540 --> 00:44:00,010
x because the House is the summation of this x and another independent also random out of a y says Plus all of our heart has now taken active value.

279
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:15,850
So that largest amount and I can take it just ask for this piano and we should notice that it's actually a distribution that we have learned before.

280
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:31,270
Right. If you consider this lambda one over one plus lambda two as your P denoted by P two over the one plus one, the two is going to be one minus P.

281
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,360
And once you change this variable,

282
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:47,650
I hope it's obvious to you that this is a binomial random is a binomial path with end with ask trials and success rate p.

283
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,490
In other words,

284
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:12,980
acts ever as equal as follows A binomial random variable with total number of trials being as and success rate being the one over the one plus the.

285
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,920
That's the conditional P.A. of acts given as equal of Smyth's.

286
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,530
So without calculation, can you tell me what this distribution is?

287
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:49,820
What is it? Why give it as equal to a small. Think about how as is defined, it's just X plus one, right?

288
00:45:50,910 --> 00:46:00,420
If this is a binomial random variable with total number of trials as success rate is not the one over the one plus two,

289
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,500
what is the marginal distribution or the is a conditional distribution per lie given as second class?

290
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,330
Think about the symmetry between Knox and Y. Right. What would be the distribution for Y given us?

291
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:30,950
Yes. Also a binomial as with the p parameter you will remember.

292
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:41,990
Very good. So it's also a binomial with the same number of total trials and a different success rate.

293
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,800
All right. Again, as is your total number, is the sum of accent of white.

294
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:57,870
If answer is a binomial, then the complement in that total number of trials will be the number of features.

295
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,480
If axes are a number of successes. Why would be the number of failures?

296
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,140
So now directly give us a conditional distribution of y given us.

297
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:13,820
And so we do not even need to derive. Of course we can derive it.

298
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,630
You all got the same result as one, so derive one.

299
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:24,980
You don't have to divide the other. You can directly write out the other by noticing what this task is.

300
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,810
Any question? Okay.

301
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:44,000
So this is a summary of what we have just heard. It acts and why our independent calls on distribution was to rate parameters, number one.

302
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,660
And number two. We know two things. One is that the summation is also available from the alarm, that one false alarm that's here.

303
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,600
And the second, given the summation,

304
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,919
one of our will has a binomial distribution with total number of trials being asked and the success rate being under

305
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:22,270
one over number one plus number two and y given us also a binomial with as the two over I'm the one plus number two.

306
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:38,960
Let's see how that can be used in the in the real case to help us study some to help us design some hypothesis testing.

307
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:50,810
Suppose one is observing two populations with regard to the incidence of a rare disease and for one, two independent independent populations.

308
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:59,310
So a population was independent of population to have a population one the size of the population.

309
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:06,210
So one observation time t one and rare occurrence of this rare diseases mule of population two.

310
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:09,110
We have this parameter and two t to mule two.

311
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:19,720
So if I assume that the number of rare disease each population follows up fertile distribution and people

312
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:26,750
assume that the number of Americas this follows the postal distribution is similar age population,

313
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:36,349
then the person rate should be the part of the three parameters because the person rate that the number of cases should be

314
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:45,260
proportional to the size and to the observation time and the rate of occurrence in the unit time and a unit population size.

315
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:52,310
We have this percent rate of the one and one of the two in both in both populations.

316
00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:00,710
And furthermore, we can know this long enough to be the sum of this 2% rate function's rates.

317
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,070
If you want to move to an equal, then we can have this relation, right?

318
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:18,470
So the lambda, the total number of cases is going to be mu a common incidence rate times this M-1 T one plus and 22.

319
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:29,299
And again, the total number of diseases that we have observed in both populations, the proportion of diseases in population,

320
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:36,920
one should be following a binomial distribution, as we had just say in the previous example.

321
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:46,580
Okay. So in other words, if we did not X want to be a number of rare disease.

322
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,140
In this population one. And that's two to be the number of rare diseases in population two.

323
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:58,900
We know that x one is a plus on distribution with a lot of the one.

324
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:10,230
X two is of course all with the two and x one given x one plus x two is a binomial okay

325
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:18,640
with total number one plus x two and the success rate being one the one over lambda.

326
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:32,120
Similarly asked to give an x one plus x two is also a binomial with the total number of trials being x plus x two and the regime two over now.

327
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:39,120
And so later we will see how we can use that result to design.

328
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:47,190
Call this testing to test whether the two combinations really have the same rate or the same rate of.

329
00:51:49,170 --> 00:52:59,570
Let's take a break and come back at two to continue on this example, which I think makes some people think it's just nice to be able to shoot.

330
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:40,870
Who wants to get in trouble.

331
00:53:50,700 --> 00:54:33,480
I want you to know that this policy is not at your.

332
00:54:36,670 --> 00:55:29,100
Yeah, it's hard for me to see how they have something to say.

333
00:55:33,090 --> 00:56:02,940
You know, it's kind of cool to be able to help the coalition forces.

334
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:24,700
You know, I just realized, you know, it's a little old.

335
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:43,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:17,560
So that's why, you know, I'm sorry the way it was.

337
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:31,850
So it's 333.

338
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,530
As you can see, it's hospital.

339
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:41,500
You know, it's especially very dry.

340
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:49,720
I don't know, I guess super hard work this time.

341
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:58,040
I was sitting here.

342
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:05,710
Like I said, you reach your.

343
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:28,670
And speaking of the political gridlock that we just saw, each you know,

344
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:57,840
this is one where, you know, it's all thanks to this particular country so much.

345
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:30,370
The biggest challenge for the Americans has been, of course, the Yale hard times here, where I actually thought it was going to be different.

346
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:53,560
Sometimes I just want to get on that same flight or something to that person, just kind of, oh, yeah, no, that's impossible.

347
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:15,100
You think this is a chance to show that, just like I to continue and see how to apply what it was learned to solve this real problem.

348
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,430
The problem set up is as follows. We have a section of town.

349
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:30,669
I'm in the water. It's water supply up to 72 wells the first day back to work.

350
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:37,450
Compare this section to the remaining parts of the town which will not receive any contaminated water.

351
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:43,930
So the hypotheses that we want to test whether the contaminated water is related

352
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:51,130
with the first step and so that it was that is what people are interested in.

353
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:57,400
So the data that can be collected is the number of pregnancies in each region,

354
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:05,140
the contaminant region and the known contaminant region and the number of birth feedbacks out of those pregnancies.

355
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:15,730
Conceptually, if the birth defect rates is different between those two regions, then we can link the two.

356
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:19,150
We can link the water contamination with the birth defects.

357
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,490
Otherwise, probably we cannot. So that's the idea behind this hypothesis.

358
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:28,000
Testing more formally, we can use the idea.

359
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,340
We can use what we have just learned to test to formally test this hypothesis.

360
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:42,160
Notice that the two areas, contaminated region and no contamination can be considered are the two populations that we have introduced.

361
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:49,690
All right. So Region one, region eight is population one and region B is population two.

362
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:53,830
Those are independent and there are different parts of the town.

363
01:01:53,830 --> 01:02:06,010
So they are independent. And this number of pregnancies is your basis that is considered as in the previous case, it will be this end times.

364
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:10,750
T That's the basis for your random variable.

365
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:18,370
The larger that basis is, even if they have the same defect rate, the more defects you will see.

366
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,060
And so that's the custom that our need to adjust for.

367
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:32,950
So for region one, you have one over seven and Bahrain and 21079 for the region two you have 136.

368
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:41,980
So even without any association between the contamination and birth defect, if I just look at this two numbers,

369
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:47,620
you would expect more defect in Region B, even if this two are not related,

370
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,990
even if the contamination is not related to the Pacific region,

371
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:59,080
we would expect the Region B to have more defects purely because Region B has more pregnancies.

372
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,370
Okay. That's our anti the basis.

373
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,960
And we also have the number of. That's out of this pregnancy.

374
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,470
So you region there we have seven in region B, we have five.

375
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,980
To test this hypothesis of whether contamination is associated with birth defect.

376
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:34,150
We can. Set this X and Y to be the number of birth defects in Region A and original B.

377
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:42,220
So those are a rhinovirus. In this case, the realization of this two rhinovirus are seven and five respectively.

378
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:54,550
We can denote the number of difference as our rhinovirus, and I could take any value from zero to up to the total number of organisms.

379
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:05,320
And what do we know is that a 50 note new to be the rate that first.

380
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:16,580
If in no mood to be the first to evaporate for a pregnancy.

381
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,880
And so this act should follow.

382
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:31,460
A proposal roughly follows a pause on distribution with this meal times the number of pregnancy in only by and so as the follows

383
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:47,570
a course on mealtimes and they and why should follows of course all new times and be where and a is one of seven and B is 436.

384
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:56,060
And under the null hypothesis, the two populations have the same birth defect rate.

385
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:59,720
In other words, contamination is not associated with birth defect.

386
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:09,410
If that's the case, then we can set out our problem that this the two round of that this as I said,

387
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:21,770
this meal times today is a causal rate for reason one and the meal times PB and B is lambda B,

388
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:28,930
which is the puzzle rate or region B and in this case, this is how we said that.

389
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:37,760
So from what we have learned in the previous derivation, we know that it acts on a Y, both falls upon some distributions.

390
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:44,600
The sum also going to fall, of course, on distribution, with no rate being the sum of these two rates.

391
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:54,800
And furthermore, one run variable given conditional on the some kind of follows a binomial right available right.

392
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:04,040
So that's going to be the basis for all this testing. That is to say, if it denote this lambda a over a lambda a plus lambda b.

393
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,909
Which is essentially out of this null hypothesis that new women will be both able to move this lambda

394
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:20,950
rate the same that is equal to 2.2 and alumna B over lambda A-plus will be going to be equal to 2.8.

395
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,420
Okay. So that's purely based on this population size.

396
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:39,900
And what we can see is that this X given x plus Y in a follow up binomial random variable with total number of success rates being x,

397
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:48,190
y, and the success rate being a over a plus lambda.

398
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:52,300
Now yellow was the number of birth defects in reason eight.

399
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:57,310
Given the total number of birth defects in both regions, kind of follows the binomial.

400
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,389
With the first parameter being the total number of birth defects.

401
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:08,100
In this case, that's fault. And the second parameter is the rate.

402
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:14,690
A population that number,

403
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:21,900
a over number eight plus be in this case is equal to an eight over an eight plus and B which is point to say

404
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:31,980
now give us binomial distribution with total number of trials being 12 and a success rate of points two.

405
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:39,100
So that's under the null hypothesis that the two regions have the same defect rate.

406
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:44,440
Then we would have x given x plus y if all of this binomial distribution.

407
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:54,280
Any time you can particularly evaluate for this particular value as equal to seven in this case,

408
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:58,570
what is the probability of that under this distribution?

409
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,310
By plugging into this binomial. Okay.

410
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:10,660
And if for the purposes of hypothesis testing, we don't just to calculate the PMF at a single point,

411
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:18,580
but rather we calculate one side of probability of this cutoff.

412
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:27,300
But the data tells us that we have seven cases in region, 85 cases in Region B.

413
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,760
Right. And conceptually, if you have more cases in region eight,

414
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:41,160
that provides a stronger evidence that the contamination is actually associated with first defects.

415
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:51,930
So if we want to use this data to calculate the P-value, which is not going to be introducing this course,

416
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:56,970
but probably introducing some other courses, hypothesizing about a calculation,

417
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:04,110
we know that the P-value is essentially the evidence you quantified of evidence

418
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:09,020
of how likely you got to observe this result or more extreme the result.

419
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:19,020
And there's the null hypothesis. In this case, the P-value would be the probability of the number of the effects are equal to the seven.

420
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:30,420
Because for anything that's great are equal to seven, it provides an even stronger evidence for the association.

421
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:37,200
What we have is we have what have we have observed is we have seven cases in Region eight.

422
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:46,260
So that is equivalent. All possible outcomes that have greater than seven cases in Region eight would have a similar interpretation.

423
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,410
So the P-value is just that the probability of anything that's greater equal to seven.

424
01:09:52,740 --> 01:10:00,209
That is to say your want to evaluate this probability given that the total number of birth defect

425
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:08,100
is 12 plus the probability that RAISONNÉ has seven or more first defects out of those 12,

426
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:19,410
not probability. I give you the p value which provides the evidence for the alternative hypothesis.

427
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,740
A smaller the p value is the larger, the stronger the evidence is for the alternative hypothesis,

428
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:33,930
the more likely you're going to reject the null hypothesis, which is there's no association between the contamination and the first defect.

429
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:42,540
So in this case, you can evaluate this by plugging in a PMT function for a binomial distribution.

430
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:55,140
So you sum up this as equals seven all the way to 12. You can find the probability because Kimball said probability to be calling 0039.

431
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,390
So that is our p value as called the p value.

432
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,080
And this is a p value for this hypothesis testing or the null hypothesis.

433
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:15,210
And there is no association between this contamination and the first data since the p value is extremely small.

434
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,710
That just means the null hypothesis is not true. It should be rejected.

435
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:24,600
As a result, we can conclude there is association,

436
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:34,080
in fact very strong association between the contamination and the first defect based on the data that we have observed and.

437
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:50,970
So unfortunately, in this course, we won't have time and we don't have time to cover this hypothesis testing.

438
01:11:51,480 --> 01:12:00,150
But once you learn hypothesis testing, this idea would become more straightforward.

439
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:05,010
So how do you evaluate the key value? What does a key upheaval mean in the hypothesis testing framework?

440
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,720
How do we set up a null hypothesis? How do we set up the alternative, etc.?

441
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,930
Those definitely requires more knowledge about the, you know, the hypothesis testing framework.

442
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:24,659
So here, what I'm trying to say is that we can use this conditional distribution to help us evaluate

443
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:30,630
the pivot point in terms of what the P value is and how this hypothesis testing works.

444
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:39,090
Is it beyond the scope of this class? Yes. All right.

445
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:47,970
So that is an example of how we can use this conditional distribution to help us values the p value in this great place.

446
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,720
Any question about this example? Yes.

447
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:59,850
In terms of the notation, how come it's biggest equals little S instead of big s equal to 12?

448
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:08,180
I see quite a smiles. As to what. Yeah, I thought it would be equal to 12.

449
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,810
Because we know what? In this case, yes, this is true.

450
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:19,860
Okay. That's correct. Yes. Thank you.

451
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:24,090
Any other questions? All right.

452
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:31,620
Go to this example again. As I said, it's a little beyond the scope of this class.

453
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:39,360
I don't understand as much as you can. And if you have questions. Feel free to come to the office hours and then we can discuss any more details.

454
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:49,470
All right. Yeah. So it may be a little tricky upfront, but what a week.

455
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:59,130
Right. So next we move on to the companion case and we have seen how we derived the conditional distribution of this query rhinovirus.

456
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:06,630
Now let's see how to extend it to the continuous right of animals for the continuous of animals.

457
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:10,620
Instead of having conditional PMA. Now we have conditional PDA.

458
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,370
An idea is exactly the same as before. Okay.

459
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:20,820
If this exists one CDF is absolutely absolutely continuous.

460
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:27,990
We can define a conditional state of why given a using this phone than this conditional PDA.

461
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:39,999
And this is called an occasional PDA of y given us that is defined as a drawn PDA divided by the on PDA.

462
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:52,560
But that's again always how you write. And we can first verify that this is about a PDA non-active and it integrates one.

463
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,970
If you integrate y. Okay.

464
01:14:56,310 --> 01:15:12,930
See that? Notice that if you do the integration with respect to why that is, I want to integrate the right hand side, the numerator.

465
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:35,840
Anyway, this joint pdf with respect to why you got a marginal PDR of x, does the numerator and denominator cancels out?

466
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:45,260
You got integration, you caught one. And so it's a valid PDF conditional B that is about a PDA and if a conditional PDA.

467
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:52,820
We have noticed that it is a function of why, although it has ice in it, but actually it's treated as a constant.

468
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,560
But that's quite a condition. I'd say it's a constant.

469
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:03,010
Why is the argument that is changing when you do the integration?

470
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:09,030
We are doing the evaluation. You always do it with respect to what lies the variable that's checking and.

471
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:20,730
So here is an example of a conditional distribution for two containers.

472
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:31,860
Suppose X and y are independent exponential rhinovirus with the same parameter theta the conditional distribution of x.

473
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:38,340
Given the sum, we want to show that it's actually a uniform distribution on zero.

474
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:47,070
On the other show that we honor to prove that, yeah, we need to take several steps.

475
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,210
First, we need to derive what the marginal distribution is.

476
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:59,100
For this summation, recall that we actually have found that before I had four.

477
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:02,820
It acts as if acts on a y are independent.

478
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:07,020
Both have the same distribution, the same exponential distribution.

479
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,480
The summation is going to be a common distribution.

480
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:25,740
I alluded to this when we talk about comma distribution and to say that we can use the same idea as before to evaluate the distribution for Z.

481
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:31,440
Okay, so you can. I.

482
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,750
First let's derive the marginal distribution policy.

483
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:54,040
So we start from the CD in this case.

484
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:01,200
CDI or continuous random variable has a clear probability meaning.

485
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:11,880
Right. So the opposite of this small z value means the probability of this random variable z last are equal to small.

486
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,770
And that just means.

487
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:41,770
X plus or equal to X and Y plus or equal to the minus x, and you integrate that with respect to all experiments and symptoms, 0 to 3.

488
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:54,640
So doing the summation now we are doing this integration and notice that inside it is this guy that actually is a joint CTA or X and Y.

489
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:05,680
Okay, this integration of zero to Z, I have X, Y and Z minus x, the x.

490
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:18,490
And so you can plug in this joint PMA, joint CDF or X and Y and evaluate this integration as a result of work that the PDA, the CDF,

491
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:29,740
the marginal seat, Z, they can do the derivation, you can do the differentiation again, the marginal CDF, marginal PDA or Z.

492
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:36,290
So that's how you can derive explicitly derive the distribution parsing.

493
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:40,700
Alternatively, you can also leverage this knowing result.

494
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,500
That is the summation of any kind of potential run available. It's just a comma about a variable.

495
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:57,010
Anyway. As a result, we can get this a marginal PDF entry in this form in a better square z times E to the negative two z over two.

496
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:04,390
And once we have this marginal or Z, we take its place and evaluate the conditional as given Z.

497
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:11,440
By taking that I taking the ratio ratio of the joint PMA.

498
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:32,100
Joint PTA divided by the marginal PTA. By definition, this guy is equal to the Z guided by the Z of Z.

499
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:43,170
So the denominator is equal to my ex z minus x.

500
01:20:48,610 --> 01:21:01,600
Okay. So this the joint pdf of Axiom Z can be converted to the joint PD out of accent a y at these different values.

501
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:09,280
Okay. So if I take contacts axes equal to Z, that is equivalent to say XY for x, y or z minus x.

502
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:13,660
That is, there is a 1 to 1 relation between those two.

503
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:21,820
We can convert the original joint PDF, which is a known pediatric PDF of accent PDA y.

504
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:27,250
Now you can plug it in and simplify this calculation.

505
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:31,269
Eventually you can grab this additional PDA of x.

506
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:39,010
Given Z having this one over Z and AX takes the values from zero to Z.

507
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:46,660
So if it takes value from zero to Z and the PDA is a constant A one over Z, it's a uniform distribution.

508
01:21:48,430 --> 01:22:01,620
So that is how we can prove that. This is similar to that this great case study, complicated, says we have to change the summation to integration.

509
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:10,500
So we want them to be particularly counterpoints that the joint PDF or the PDFs be do not.

510
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:20,160
It's exactly me in probability. So if you want to use the definition, sometimes you have to go through this CTA function.

511
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:28,500
CTA they'll have a really good interpretation of the PDF itself does not exactly mean probability.

512
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:47,450
Right. Questions? So the next example is by very normal example, assume that X and y our five are in normal, which means zero.

513
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:58,040
That is one correlation. Then we know that a conditional distribution of one over the other is still a normal

514
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,080
distribution with maybe a row times arcs and a variance being one -0 square.

515
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:17,660
But before we approve it, let's pause for a second and think about all of this property spending we have learned about normal distribution.

516
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:21,830
Now, is that actually a very special distribution? Right.

517
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:32,590
Because we have argued that if the joint distribution is normal, the marginals we actually derive, that the marginals will also be double.

518
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:41,450
That's a very special case because it doesn't work for all of the other for all the other distributions.

519
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:47,490
All that distributions marginal does not imply the joint normal.

520
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:50,809
If you know that drawing is normal, it's, you know, the marginal is also.

521
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:59,000
No. Now we have another perspective. If join is normal, then conditional is also not a decline.

522
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:11,050
So closed loop, right. The normal is very special. Now let's look at how to prove that if X and Y are jointly now.

523
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:15,990
Well, first of all, we can write our joint opinion with this.

524
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:23,860
Parameters. Zero mere univariate and a correlation equal row.

525
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:31,160
You can write on the joint pdf in this file request.

526
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:31,630
Okay.

527
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:46,089
So the constant is one over two pi times square root of one minus row square in the exponential term has this terms of x squared minus two are all x,

528
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:51,640
y, y squared over one minus the square over to a negative sign of it.

529
01:24:52,450 --> 01:25:00,040
And if you integrate out X you get a marginal for y y, you got a marginal x, both are normal distribution.

530
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:04,720
Now we want to derive this conditional distribution.

531
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:13,300
So the computation is a little materials and not too complicated.

532
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:17,440
All we need to do is to plug in.

533
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:41,290
As to plug in this joint PDA and the marginal PDA and cancel on needed terms, repeated terms and.

534
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:53,940
So once you do that, you kind of say the final result, if it's the formula, is this.

535
01:25:54,990 --> 01:26:07,590
And you can notice that it also has this a novel PDF format with a constant and a short term inside a special term.

536
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:18,540
You have this random variable y and another constant, which is the mean of this variable divided by two times the variance of this variable.

537
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:23,700
So that means the mean is just the real time size and the variance.

538
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:34,920
Do this y minus row squared. So here is is a simplified way of doing this simplification.

539
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:40,440
You can notice Q in the original drawing pdf taking this form.

540
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:48,630
If you make the square with respect to Y, you will have a function that is a function of y plus some constant.

541
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:56,110
Of course they may involve X because as this condition of X becomes a constant,

542
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:01,960
then there's concern that they're going to cancel out with that denominator with a denominator.

543
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,360
But I just give you the final result object clause.

544
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:16,210
I want you to try it out, trying to write out these formulas, plug it in, try to simplify it, say why you check out the same result.

545
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:27,220
Also important thing here is once you got to the last line, you have to notice that this is actually a normal beginning of right.

546
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:35,020
So that is the most important part. Once you have the last line out, notice that the only terms.

547
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,530
That involved lies in business and I shall try and insight.

548
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:46,250
The exponential is the quadratic function of life. That all implies this as a PR function for.

549
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:51,600
Now what's left is to decide what is a me and what is the balance of that.

550
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:58,350
Normal distribution I find functional form should tell us it's a normal distribution and.

551
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:21,559
Questions. Okay.

552
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,300
So that's all we have. Talk about the condition of distribution.

553
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:34,560
Now we can look back and see how the condition of the distributions is related to the dependance now having to use last time.

554
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:45,910
Recall that independence means independence is defined by the joint pdf equal to the part of

555
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,890
individual PDA or the joint severe equal to the part of individual Cydia part to run a variable.

556
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:56,360
That's how we define independence in the first place.

557
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:05,540
Now recall that we have this conditional distribution and we have conditional

558
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:09,980
distribution which has also involved the strong PDA and the marginal PDA.

559
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:19,160
So with this conditional distribution, we can actually get equivalent definition or independence that is sufficient.

560
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:24,559
And that as a condition for independence is a conditional distribution of a Y,

561
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:32,209
given X is exactly the same at the bars on a distribution plot for the conditional distribution.

562
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:39,860
I'm asking about what is the same at the margin distribution for X before proving not just conceptual.

563
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:50,570
I think about what that implies. If you're a conditional, how another round about it doesn't change the distribution of the of of all the interest.

564
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:57,200
That just means whether or not a conditional additional random variable doesn't make a difference.

565
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,630
So that's why conceptually that makes perfect sense.

566
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:10,610
And the condition of how the distribution of Y is the same as the marginal distribution of Y,

567
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:14,790
that just means X does not add anything to this distribution.

568
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,610
So that's why I said a y independent. Right?

569
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:26,030
So conceptually that makes sense. And mathematically to prove that it's just a one and our proof.

570
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:43,790
We notice that the conditional CTA of the Y given x is the integration of.

571
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:53,280
This conditional PDA. Right. So that.

572
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:07,400
So you can take the derivative on both sides of this equation.

573
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:30,310
And you got. If you take the derivative with respect to one on both sides of this equation, you got this relation,

574
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:36,250
a conditional period of like if an X is equal to the marginal period of life.

575
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:38,620
And if that's the case,

576
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:55,900
then we might say that John idea of kind of y is going to be equal to a conditional period of why given X times the marginal price.

577
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:56,640
Right.

578
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:07,570
That's the definition of position distribution since this guy is equal to a marginal area applied now just follows the definition of independence.

579
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:13,000
And we have shown that the left hand side is essentially the joint of our backs

580
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,290
and why the right hand side is the product of the marginal area of our sample.

581
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:28,640
So that is the equivalent of the condition as defined by this condition distribution.

582
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:33,360
The same as the independence defined by the product of the margin of IDPs.

583
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:40,330
Similarly, if you do it the other way, you can get that by doing the integration.

584
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:49,630
And do the integration on both side. You can go from the CTA, the PDF to the CTA.

585
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:59,710
So either way it's equivalent. So the independence can be either defined using this product or using this conditional.

586
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:31,600
Any questions? All right.

587
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:39,709
So. We have to talk about the independents, the conditional distribution.

588
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:47,360
And in those definitions, in those crews, sometimes we use the CDP,

589
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:57,950
sometimes we use the PDF PMO to one than to not to get it confused is one to use which.

590
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:09,530
And so for example, we know the conditional PDA or conditional PDA acts given Y and B process criteria divided by the marginal PDA.

591
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:14,180
What about the choice of conditional Sadia Abbas?

592
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:20,810
Why is it equal to the joint CDA divided by the marginal area?

593
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:29,580
Do you think this? It's a crap equation.

594
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:42,080
Is not okay. So this is totally wrong and it's not a question.

595
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:55,850
So one way to think about the relation of all defense is to consider the joint up and gave you the joint PDA.

596
01:34:56,780 --> 01:35:06,710
And the joint PDA can be used to derive additional PDA or marginal areas.

597
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:15,260
Where the conditional pdf marginal PDA can be used to define conditional CTA.

598
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:28,430
Marginal Syria, but there is no arrow that connects this to.

599
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:43,750
So there is no direct arrow between this transitive and conditional CDI.

600
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:55,660
So you have to go through this loop. So that is one way to tease out the relation between all this different functions.

601
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:04,710
And not go directly from the drawn city up to the conditional stadium.

602
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:10,070
You have to go through this loop, go through this detour.

603
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:23,370
Any questions? Okay.

604
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:34,260
So now let's look at this example and see how these conditional notations can be derived, real set out.

605
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:43,750
So this is the example that we have seen last time is the we know that John pre-op you know,

606
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:53,580
the Chinese city are taking this formula and the support is this triangular area, but they have dried a lot.

607
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:11,030
It's. In support of this distribution and online support it has joined setting up of acts minus x times the last x over one last time.

608
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:21,770
We have already derived the the marginals of this rhinovirus are we have also derived this joint pdf.

609
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:28,340
I taken the partial derivative twice one with respect to tax the other with respect to one.

610
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:39,890
So as a result we have this joint idea which is one of our Y on this triangular area and the marginal CDF or tax is this function.

611
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:50,570
Marginal PDF is not a log at all from 0 to 1 marginal seat, a wise y and marginal pdf a y as a concept.

612
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:57,380
So why is it uniform? Now we can particularly calculate a conditional distribution.

613
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:05,780
A conditional PDA apply given us. I just taken the derivative, taken the ratio between the child PDA and the marginal.

614
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:14,630
So for Y given acts you can divide F of x and Y over acts of x.

615
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:22,790
So that gave us this formula. So this is the format or for a conditional distribution of conditional PDA of Y given x.

616
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:42,430
And the rent is this. In fact, this is only at this part because the condition upon access, access becomes a constant.

617
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:48,790
All right. And all we care about in this condition distribution is why.

618
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:58,960
So what? The range is from X to one and the formula is not then one over y minus y times the log acts.

619
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:03,760
So that's a conditional PDA y y given x.

620
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,840
Similarly, you can derive the conditional pdf or ask about y.

621
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,219
Now Y becomes a constant axis.

622
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:20,230
So what do we care about? So the support of X in this F from zero to Y and the PDA is one over one.

623
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:36,260
What is the distribution point asking about y? If you know the PDF, you should know what the distribution is.

624
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:43,750
All right, so what is the distribution for? Ask my wife and I got.

625
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:52,300
Uniform? That's correct. Right.

626
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,000
Because there's a constant, as I said, as ever. Why?

627
01:39:56,250 --> 01:40:02,400
Why do comments like that? So it becomes this PDA is a concept.

628
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:06,719
On this general 02y and the constant value is one over.

629
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,030
What? That's exactly a uniform. Right.

630
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,260
It's a uniform distribution on this interval. 0 to 1.

631
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,610
That's the conditional distribution. Or what's about line?

632
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:27,770
So that's. This any question about this example?

633
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:37,440
I just want to demonstrate how you can calculate the conditional period from this marginals or the joint and the marginal.

634
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:48,639
All right. And the last piece that I want to introduce today is that, Barbara, recall that when we talk about the conditional distribution,

635
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:54,950
conditional probability, we also introduced the Bear Theorem in terms of this probability calculation.

636
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:03,610
And back then, we introduced Bear Theorem as a way to you to to reverse the order of two events.

637
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:12,190
If you know the probability of A given B, by the way, you really care about the probability of being given eight.

638
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:18,220
Then you can think about using the spectrum to switch the order of the two, right?

639
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:24,790
So here is the same is just extending that idea to the random variables to the

640
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:29,560
bear theorem for the random variables is to switch the order of to write about,

641
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:39,999
you know, the distribution of X and Y. But if you really want to know the distribution of Y, given X, they use this bad term more commonly.

642
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:51,580
What that means is the conditional period of like a minus is equal to a conditional video of has given y times marginal y divided by the margin of x.

643
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:10,290
So if you know, I gave a lot and the marginals are usually not hard to get,

644
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:16,620
if you know X and Y, you can use the thought theorem to go to Y, give it x.

645
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:22,799
That's the idea behind this, to be a theorem. And the proof is just one line, right?

646
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:30,840
By no reason. Definition ask me why is just x, y over y?

647
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:35,880
Then you multiply. You cancel out this y term divided by acts.

648
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:40,470
By definition, you've got the marginal. You got the conditional of y given acts.

649
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:45,660
So the proof is trivial, but the idea is very important.

650
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:50,730
The idea is to switch. The order between is to write of most.

651
01:42:53,340 --> 01:43:02,430
And here is an example of how it can be used to assume the families are interviewed to identify any one of them,

652
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:08,760
if any of the members of a particular disease. In this case, the information on the family.

653
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:15,270
If any member has the particular disease, the family might be put in a database.

654
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:23,660
So and is a number of people in a family which is around a barrel.

655
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:29,050
And with this marginal payout.

656
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:36,820
So the probability of any kind of small end as this peer it's not so rent available because

657
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:41,150
for different families to kind of have different members different number of individuals.

658
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:48,500
And is rent available. And the beta is the probability of each individual having disease,

659
01:43:50,180 --> 01:44:01,129
which has a constant and this is a constant and here this small a is another round of apple apple and is a

660
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:08,540
random out of all of this small a small a is another random variable where it only takes binary values.

661
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:13,340
It takes one if the family is in the database and takes a zero,

662
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:18,110
if the family is not in the database and the sufficient necessary condition for

663
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:24,050
the family to be in the database is any member have this particular disease.

664
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:32,750
All right. So in this case, one direction is easy to calculate given.

665
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,930
A given and this distribution.

666
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:56,490
The conditional distribution of a given is easy to calculate even the number of people in the family.

667
01:44:57,510 --> 01:45:05,549
What is the probability or what is the distribution that anyone of this family has?

668
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:12,990
This particular disease? Is a relatively easy problem based on this description.

669
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:19,260
We can if we assume that the family members are independent of having this disease,

670
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:27,210
we can exclusively evaluate the conditional distribution of a given and using the probability that we have learned.

671
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:37,320
For example, given the number of people in the family is smaller than the probability of the family is not in the database?

672
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:41,700
Is the probability that no one in the family has this disease?

673
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:51,230
All right. So that is the one minus Peter to the power of one, because Peter is the probability of having the disease are usually individual.

674
01:45:51,810 --> 01:46:01,080
So, you know, I have disease in this family size and that just means you have one minus Peter and multiply that times.

675
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:05,160
So that's the probability that no one has disease in the house.

676
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:15,610
And alternatively, the probability of a or a one the family in the database, given the family size and is one minus.

677
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:20,110
And that's important and one minus this one minus Peter to the power.

678
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:25,920
So that's the probability of someone in the family has the disease.

679
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,450
With these two conditional probability, we actually fully evaluate this distribution a given.

680
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:36,960
And so that is relatively easy to derive.

681
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:47,879
But what we care about in this example is the distribution of and given given a right.

682
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:57,630
What do we want to know is that given a family is in the database, what is the distribution for the number of people in the family?

683
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:06,050
Argument the family is not in the database. What is the distribution of this number of people in the family?

684
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:16,510
I assume that is what we care about. Now, how do we go from this agreement and to this and give in to that?

685
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:23,090
We need to use this power and so we can use the Bear family to help us achieve that,

686
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:30,700
to switch the order of this to rhinovirus from any argument and to aggregate it even a.

687
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:36,260
So before we move on, it's want to.

688
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:49,589
This a cohort of one given family size equal to and you can use it on expansion or use just that brief how break down this one

689
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:58,890
minus beta to the power and if they are small then all this higher order terms kind of vanish more quickly the lower on our terms.

690
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:05,880
All right. So the result that is approximately equal to end times theta approximation.

691
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:09,450
Okay. With that,

692
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:18,660
we can evaluate the joint probability the drawing does for and to be and times beta times point

693
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:25,800
and we can use this theorem to switch the order of the to the numerator is going to be the joint

694
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:34,260
PMF and the denominator is the Mars Akiyama for eight equal to one or the other words any given

695
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:44,370
end times the marginal end and use this for our total probability theorem to get that numerator.

696
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:58,650
Other result, we can have the marginal distribution of any given a to have this formula and times P and over and out is the summation of and here.

697
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:12,980
So that just gave us the marginal that part of the conditional distribution of the number of family members given it is in the database.

698
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:21,290
Furthermore, we can tell with the expectation of that conditional expectation, which we're going to introduce in more details next time.

699
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:29,660
A conditional expectation is just the summation of this and times this conditional.

700
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:35,570
Yeah, with some derivation we can find is equal to these term times.

701
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:42,650
This one plus sigma squared over the square and that is always greater than half.

702
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,070
Meaning if the family is in the database,

703
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:59,100
the expectation of the average family size is greater than the general average of family size in the general population, which is a.
