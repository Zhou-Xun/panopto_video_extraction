1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Central Line-Associated.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,097
Up go.

3
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:09,494
[LAUGH].

4
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:11,195
Hi?

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:12,493
Jackie White.

6
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:16,508
I am an infection preventionist at Michigan Medicine.

7
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:22,542
I'm going over Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection or

8
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:27,958
CLABSI background for you before we get into the definition.

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,037
So what is a CLABSI?

10
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:34,441
A CLABSI is a primary bloodstream infection in a patient with intravascular

11
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:38,292
catheter or central line that terminates at or close to the heart or

12
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,970
in one of the great vessels.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,739
So the diagram on the lower right of the heart,

14
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,011
you can see many of the great vessels.

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,847
So the central line will terminate in

16
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:54,683
subclavian vein, pulmonary vein,

17
00:00:54,683 --> 00:01:01,396
could federal vein as well Internal jugular vein.

18
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:06,010
There are many different great vessels

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,355
that essentially can terminate it.

20
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,720
So there are different types of Central Lines.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,962
There are Temporary central lines.

22
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:19,239
These are short-term, they are not tunneled under the skin.

23
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:24,315
So those of you who took the previous hospital epidemiology class,

24
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:29,300
you may remember I went over some details of what a tunnel line looks

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,629
like versus a not tunnel line.

26
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:37,174
But those are a couple of pictures of some short-term not tunnel blinds.

27
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:38,730
Some longer-term lines.

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,268
So these are central lines that could be in place for many months.

29
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,244
They're tunneled.

30
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:51,627
So where the central line actually inserts into the into the vessel.

31
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:55,643
The line actually goes under the skin before it comes before

32
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,985
the puncture went out of the skin.

33
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:06,478
This does include ports which are completely implanted under the skin.

34
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,583
One difference is an umbilical catheter.

35
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,066
So this is used in neonatal population.

36
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:17,075
So the umbilicus that is the then what will become

37
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:22,084
the belly button line can be inserted either into

38
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:27,968
the umbilical vein or the umbilical artery in a neonate.

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,084
So this is one example where a central line can be inserted into an artery.

40
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:36,570
Persons of vein.

41
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,055
Other arterial catheters and peripheral IVs are not central lines.

42
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:48,038
So to give you some additional background on CLABSI data.

43
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:52,645
So there are approximately 15 million central line days

44
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:56,600
in United States intensive care units each year.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,224
The US has approximately 30,000 CLAB days every year.

46
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:04,863
This actually may seem like a lot but that's actually

47
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:09,759
a 46% decrease from 2008 to 2013.

48
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,520
The attributable mortality of a CLABSI is anywhere between 12 and 25% and

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,511
can cost the health care system anywhere from 35,000 to an additional $56,000.

50
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,843
Which when you add all of this up,

51
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:31,677
can cost the US health care system up to $2.3 billion.

52
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:35,050
CLABSI is also have various implications.

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,931
So for example, CMS The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

54
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,301
The value-based purchasing program there.

55
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:47,266
So the value-based purchasing program is an initiative that

56
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:52,803
rewards acute care hospitals that enhance patients' experience,

57
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:56,443
experiences of care during hospital stays.

58
00:03:56,443 --> 00:04:02,610
This program was actually established in 2010 in the Affordable Care Act.

59
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,824
And this provided hospitals perform while they get a ranking and

60
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:14,474
then they actually will get a payment for their Medicare.

61
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:18,044
Basically incentive payments to perform well and

62
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:21,530
to not have these infections such as the CLABSI.

63
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,428
And then also Magnet.

64
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:28,414
So Magnet is a nursing quality designation if you will.

65
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:33,779
And in order to have a Magnet designation, you have to perform

66
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:39,572
to a certain level in terms of healthcare-acquired infections.

67
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,345
For example, that's just one measure that magnet tracks.

68
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:47,434
But that designation is a designation for quality patient care nursing

69
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:52,113
excellence and innovations in professional nursing practice.

70
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:57,103
And being a magnet institution or having magnet recognition,

71
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:02,466
it actually has helped national rankings for example the US News and

72
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:06,338
world report rankings for health care centers.

73
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:10,544
It is important almost all of the highest ranked hospitals have magnet status.

74
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,099
And then just a brief overview of CLABSI prevention.

75
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:20,139
So we just talked about the impact of CLABSI on the health care system.

76
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,301
So different ways that CLABSI can be prevented.

77
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:26,288
One miss insertion, insertion of that central line.

78
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,611
So making sure that insertion bundle is followed.

79
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:32,923
Which includes hand hygiene, choosing the appropriate site for the line.

80
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:38,068
Doing appropriate skin antisepsis or skin preparation immediately prior to

81
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:43,378
central line insertion and then also following maximum barrier precautions.

82
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:48,020
So that's a full bed drape for the patient and

83
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,440
then the gown, gloves and mask,

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,219
and cap for those inserting the central line.

85
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:00,625
And then also any open hubs on the catheters should have a cap placed

86
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:05,189
immediately and then finally after insertion is completed applying

87
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,269
that sterile dressing to the insertion site.

88
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:13,006
So for example for choosing the appropriate line site, the federal site or

89
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,821
the groin site is not ideal.

90
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:20,287
There's a lot of moist site, there's a lot of bacteria in that area.

91
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:25,940
So that's just one example of choosing an appropriate site for the line.

92
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,986
And then you wanna use your surveillance data to guide your interventions.

93
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:31,535
And I'll talk about an insertion

94
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:36,188
versus maintenance-related CLABSI in a couple of slides.

95
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,733
And then besides insertion of a central line for CLABSI prevention you

96
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,927
also then have maintenance practices for CLABSI prevention.

97
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:46,207
So it got hand hygiene extremely important.

98
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:49,815
I'm doing a daily assessment of the line to foreign line necessity.

99
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:54,186
And can that line come out and try to get that line out very quickly?

100
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:54,803
Dressing changes.

101
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:56,189
Are they being done appropriately?

102
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:01,069
So seven days for a transparent dressing or two days for a gauze and tape dressing.

103
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,185
And then tubing changes.

104
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:07,871
Tubing changes must be done at different frequencies depending on

105
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:12,391
the medication that was administered or blood products they all

106
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:17,175
have slightly different times that would require tubing changes.

107
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,721
And then using alcohol caps on all access points.

108
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:24,933
So this really makes sure that, that access point is clean before

109
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:29,690
you're going to draw labs or administer any medications.

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,877
And then using a close system I said back on the insertion side

111
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:39,963
making sense sure any open sites are covered with a needless

112
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:46,286
injection port you can see in that picture with the white and blue device.

113
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:50,257
And again you're gonna use your surveillance data to guide these

114
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:51,348
interventions.

115
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,135
I really like this image.

116
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:57,290
It shows you different ways that could potentially lead to

117
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,249
a bloodstream infection.

118
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:05,522
So for example skin organisms, we all have bacteria on our skin.

119
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:09,743
So making sure skin is scrubbed making sure we perform hand hygiene so

120
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:13,238
indigenous skin organisms obviously are gonna come from

121
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:17,550
the patient's own skin flora around that insertion site of the line.

122
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,530
So it's really important to make sure that that site is cleansed when dressing

123
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,812
changes are performed.

124
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:27,588
But then any time as a health care worker you're gonna touch that

125
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:31,134
central line making sure your hands are clean.

126
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:36,018
The catheter hubs could become contaminated again with skin flora

127
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:40,908
from the patient or from the bacteria on health care worker hands.

128
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,873
Hopefully, we would not see any contaminated infuse say.

129
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:51,019
But there have been contamination events coming from various pharmacies.

130
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,874
There was one handful of years ago in the local area.

131
00:08:54,874 --> 00:09:00,350
A lot of patients not for CLABSI but a large number of patients actually got

132
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,936
meningitis from contaminated fluid that was used for spinal injections.

133
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:10,789
And then also within the patient there could be an infection

134
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,768
at another site that then spreads to the blood and

135
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:18,862
then causes a secondary bloodstream infection.

136
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:24,071
So when I went over the insertion and maintenance practices to prevent

137
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:29,206
CLABSI I said that you want to use your data to guide your activities.

138
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:34,213
So this is when early versus late CLABSI come into play.

139
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,854
So for example an early BSI or

140
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:42,254
early CLABSI occurs within seven days of line insertion.

141
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,655
We refer to these as insertion related.

142
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,973
So we will also look at insertion practices that occurred and

143
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:52,479
if there were any breaches in sterile technique for inserting that central line.

144
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:56,299
But then also maintenance practices do start right away as soon as that line is

145
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,898
inserted.

146
00:09:56,898 --> 00:10:00,456
So we don't wanna ignore those but it's more likely that maybe

147
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:04,562
something happened with insertion that may have led to this infection.

148
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:09,430
Anything that occurred after any CLABSI that occurred more than seven

149
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,419
days after line insertion.

150
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,396
We do not think of being related to that line insertion at all.

151
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,278
And we consider those maintenance related.

152
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,060
So we look only at the maintenance of that line and

153
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,395
any potential breaches in best practice.

154
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,052
So why is CLABSI surveillance important?

155
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:33,740
Well, it is important because it can helps you develop those infection rates for

156
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,260
units and or patient populations.

157
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,357
So this is again going to guide your best practices to improve patient safety and

158
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:43,542
patient care.

159
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,640
Clumsy surveillance also allows you to evaluate pathogen trends within your

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,466
institution.

161
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:53,220
So you can see if there is a large increase in one type of bacteria or

162
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,006
another.

163
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:58,868
And then obviously CLABSI surveillance you're gonna calculate those rates.

164
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:03,683
So it will allow you to detect increases and decreases in your rates and

165
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:07,450
it helps you identify and evaluate control measures.

166
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,503
So we talked about using that surveillance to guide your interventions.

167
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:17,083
Your data is always going to help you guide those interventions and what steps

168
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:21,606
do you need to take next to continue to reduce your CLABSI numbers and rates.

169
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:25,677
And then in turn with that is it will allow you to evaluate patient care

170
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:26,457
practices.

171
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:29,114
So talking to staff observing practices and

172
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:33,437
finding out maybe more education needs to occur on certain practices.

173
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:38,986
Or again adopting different practices.

174
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,150
If you have any questions.

175
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,756
My contact, my email is on the first slide so please feel free to send

176
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:48,017
me an email and I would be happy to answer any questions you have on this lecture.
