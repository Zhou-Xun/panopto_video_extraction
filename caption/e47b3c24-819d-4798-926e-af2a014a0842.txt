1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,120
Okay. Used to be my field recording.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,300
Yes. Your semester going?

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,860
It's going. You have? He's going. Do you have midterms?

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,650
I was sorry. I haven't had them yet. They have my stuff, but it's tough.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,210
That's official AP and statistics there.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,770
Wow. Good. Out to us. You are busy. Yeah, we know that that is true.

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:47,729
Okay. I hope that you're doing well. Okay. Today I wanted to talk about the video, how to establish a daily writing practice,

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,500
and also just which I would do it on my own experience and also learn from you out of your own experience.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,270
Now, do you have anyone?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,620
But of course you do. And especially with writing.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,670
Nicole. I'm a writer by trade.

12
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,740
I publish writer and magazines. I write technical documents.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,010
I write web content. So I write every day of my life.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,690
Right. You do just naturally.

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,340
I do manuscripts when I was doing my masters. So for me, like, I know,

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,920
like it's very important what they mentioned in the with you because you want them to

17
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,160
like you are in a good mood and now I'm ready to write my thing one month to start.

18
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,940
Yes. Sometimes I'm like in your phone, but sometimes I get the idea to write the back of them.

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,580
I didn't complete everything in me and I feel like I'm going to write it now.

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
So for me, having this constant, like, consistent.

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,320
Yes. I mean, it's very helpful to finish what you want to do.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah. And there was an important message that we have these, you know,

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:09,180
the fog that we think that we need to have this huge block of time to write or we need to be inspire or to be able to write.

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:18,390
But I think our key message is to take advantage of those space, of even the smallest space of time to write, to be consistent, even 10 minutes a day.

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:30,360
And then you would be amazed how long have you right now have you before we discuss that video?

26
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:46,790
Do you have any special time today to write or just when you able to do it or how I mean, how are you processing what I went through that morning?

27
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:55,280
In the morning? I mean, I have periods where I need to write a lot in periods where I don't need to write as much.

28
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:04,580
So there are huge fluctuations there. I'm kind of a night owl, so I like the late, late night reading, writing.

29
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,380
And I'm tired. I'm always tired.

30
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,500
That's right. Okay. Well, yes and no.

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,649
Yes. That happened also when we had to submit this grant proposal so that usually if I am working before,

32
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,960
a few years ago, the usual grant proposal where 25 pages long.

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,600
What did that research part. But I think maybe five years ago,

34
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:44,759
it's about that time they shortened the proposal to just left base and without pay it'd be followed by writing 2512 pages.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,310
They would be able to do it in just one week, but that usually doesn't work if that is harder because you need to go.

36
00:03:51,320 --> 00:04:01,370
If you need to summarize to maybe to convince the you just in that short that this place of of of is based on is is harder now.

37
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:11,960
And I think I found this very important about this myth about writing the fact that we need a huge block of time to write,

38
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:24,530
that I must be inspired to write. And also that writing that ended by thinking I used rather writing thinking because we need to to be okay.

39
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,160
What I'm going to put in this paper, how we're going to replace these.

40
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:37,170
Now, let me ask you. What do you do when you have these?

41
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,830
Because for me, that the hardest part is to write that maybe the very first two sentences of a paragraph.

42
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:54,480
How do you do this in a paragraph? Just a writing? Or do you think in your head, okay, that's a sentence.

43
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,260
A lot of time I'm having. I like to write the middle of a paper first and then go back and write the introduction,

44
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,320
because I think it's harder for me to think about all the things I'm going to write about rather than one really specific thing.

45
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,230
So if I start with like the really small stuff, then I can write a bigger introduction move.

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,000
Work for me. Like a lot of thoughts are occurring all at once.

47
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,780
Like if I can just like at least write down the keywords until like a document and then that will kind of like,

48
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,920
help me, like, outline what should come next. Mm hmm.

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,980
For those of you, that English is your first language, because that happens to me.

50
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,450
Do your thing in your maternal language and then translating English or your own.

51
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,900
You try to think in English and write directly in English. How do you do it?

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:59,670
I think over the years it has been shifting towards thinking in English to the point where I go back to Greece, I kind of structure my sentences.

53
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,660
Like it was just kind of a problem in terms of writing and getting started.

54
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,960
I think the outlining helps me like the table of contents, and maybe if I start with the introduction,

55
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,879
I'll write the first sentence, but then I'll get overwhelmed by everything else I need to write.

56
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,190
So I'm wondering, are I still thinking even in Spanish?

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:34,420
And I think that that be partly because in fact, right now I, I don't know, you have no reason for, say, writing in Spanish to do it.

58
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:42,160
Sometimes I hope it's not too much, but that's on time.

59
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm talking. I just say that sentence sort of work in Spanish, something I might say a word book in English.

60
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,769
Okay, let's continue our discussion then. I'm going to just to give you some advice from my own experience.

61
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,390
And also and again, I will be interested to know your own experience about writing.

62
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:11,340
Now, my own experience is that it's difficult to start is when I'm thinking out a paper.

63
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:25,129
Just writing into a long show is so hard for me. Sometimes what I do when I'm writing papers is just to first put together that table.

64
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,090
Let's say I'm writing a scientific manuscript. Then what I do is just first that they what?

65
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,300
Because if I have that table very small, then more or less I know what I'm going to write about then,

66
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:41,600
and I try to get the introduction to point to that result.

67
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,270
Then something that I do to distract the writing.

68
00:07:48,270 --> 00:08:00,090
Then sometime within the news yesterday to give my phone up so very far away.

69
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,970
And also another problem that I found with myself, I'm not going to see my own experience,

70
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:14,910
what I'm going to write to go round to a scientific paper and try to do almost completely editing review with that topic in particular,

71
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:27,840
I needed to write about the topic. Let me explain. Let's say I'm working about, I don't know, this Italian mortality.

72
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,880
Then I try to read every paper that have been read, the writer done about digital mortality.

73
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,370
And I spent a lot of time doing that. That is counterproductive.

74
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,590
We I went to this cause I think in a couple of weeks how to do I needed to review how to be systematic about it.

75
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,920
I needed to review that that they need to we don't need to spend a lot of time doing that now.

76
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,880
Try to make a daily writing routine. This is also very difficult for me.

77
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,140
I still working on it now.

78
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,409
I strongly advise these shared throughout early.

79
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:17,850
Would you advise for us or your colleagues because even these sometimes you have a

80
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,340
student that they sent me the proposal like that they before that need to be approved.

81
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,970
I haven't seen any early version but of course I then say what is what is this about?

82
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,419
But I'm getting this until now, not with you.

83
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:41,910
Then I suggest to chair do the specific game early that after your proposal early with the advice and because also

84
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:50,460
these are you know they to ABC they need time to read it to give you back comments then please plan with that.

85
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,190
You are also working in grant proposals.

86
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,780
Shared your draft with your colleagues early in the during that process.

87
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,290
Now of course they are some day that we are not going to be productive that they that we just we can no

88
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:14,640
right but that they happened to your only quote or not and then you want you have more experience and right.

89
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah. Yes. But then I just I have a process.

90
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,520
I it swallow the frog, which is I don't because I have deadlines and clients, you know.

91
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:33,530
So I get to say I'm not productive right now. And so it's called Swallow the Frog, which is like you have to swallow a frog.

92
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,880
If you leave swallowing the five to the end of the day, it is going to ruin your entire name.

93
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,940
So if you swallow the frog in the morning, you've got it done.

94
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,610
And so if I have projects that I'm just putting off because it's not interesting or it's going to be difficult.

95
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,420
I just in like that's just get it done and I'll know it.

96
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,750
I'll feel better on the other side of like whenever that thing is.

97
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:03,530
Yeah. But yeah. And I think that that's an important point because that in the video we wash down the hours from work.

98
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,520
The House on accountability building for example, coming for me here to class and for you to be here.

99
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,440
They tend to contact me if I don't show up. Are going to do without being with the chair.

100
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,459
What happened in class is what's going on.

101
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,410
Then there is an accountability.

102
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:33,860
However, for for grant they are also accountability because we have some deadlines that we have to like to to to meet them.

103
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,490
We have that ability, however, for manuscripts, for scientific work that we need to publish.

104
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,970
That is not exactly like how you may send your manuscript anytime you want, uh,

105
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,620
the school back from not to publish some number of manuscript per year, but it's not a car you don't publish, did you?

106
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,010
What you are one to when what to fire you then.

107
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,320
Is that the same for all faculty members, the number of publications expected.

108
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,020
I think there is no I having. Okay, I'm going to to be more specific.

109
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:21,320
No one has told me yet. You need to publish, for example, five or six paper per year.

110
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,250
Uh, I don't know what it is. Petition to it or thought to be honest with you.

111
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,130
I think expectation is, I don't know, three or more.

112
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,490
Three or more. I'm, I according to my own experience.

113
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:54,230
Uh, now the approach, the, the problem is that we need to sort of an on my review of our work then like you have to compete,

114
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,100
you can get those publications out and sometimes you respect that to the very, maybe the last month to send those publications.

115
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:10,820
Okay the mean in review right now then that is that's a spectator that you need to publish but you no I,

116
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,940
I don't recall any actual number of publication that I need to publish.

117
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,120
And also you are you don't have to and yet you don't.

118
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:34,310
How these work year when we are higher we first as assistant professors we are in the position they say six year maximum.

119
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,720
Then during those six years, you need to be productive.

120
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,990
You need to be a great teacher. You need to the research, to the service you are,

121
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,260
you meet all those requirements and then you are promoted to associate professor and

122
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,410
then you then your means that you for them assistant professor to get the tenure.

123
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,220
Shouldn't they have like specific publications, specific number.

124
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,189
Yeah. They need to publish, they need a requirement here.

125
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:12,530
This year's budget. I don't know what is the meaning of what I'm trying to say that I don't know what is the minimum application that you need to get.

126
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:23,239
And also and also depends because they are different fields when is lesser easier to get publication than other?

127
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,059
For you, for example, you are working in a lab with less a animal.

128
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:36,350
More is take more time to conduct all this barely means to get all the analysis and to get the publication.

129
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:44,330
Then I think they are awareness from the university that they are different fields that get more time to get publications.

130
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,819
Now they are all their field. What is easier to the publication,

131
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,430
but also where I do not you have seen this article when you have at least two or

132
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:01,879
four like 100 offers because they are now this big collaboration for example,

133
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,630
in getting genetics, they are big collaborations.

134
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:14,480
Then even we, we have this little hole for our maybe my name is in the middle of that 100 that rule is that that the.

135
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,540
The old said, you are to the first place. The closer you are to the last place, the better.

136
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:28,499
Because the first places are the usually the researcher usually post door for doctoral student that will do the analysis,

137
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,510
write the paper at the end of the list.

138
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,630
They are what we call senior authors.

139
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:43,710
I like other people that superbike the war people that they have developed, but still they are all places in between.

140
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:52,590
I think that is this acquiring awareness that they are different feel that the easy to get publication now

141
00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:04,320
because of science and is in the genomics field where I work now is I would say harder and harder to get just

142
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,700
a better with just one or two authors you get because you need to do these collaborations you need to the

143
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,639
collaboration that you will get is just an opinion piece and this is an opinion piece or something like that.

144
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,870
An editorial. I agree with you. Yeah.

145
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,090
Nice. Did you find those those type of articles.

146
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,860
But again, that that think that day to day work is there is no accountability for that because for classes,

147
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:40,199
for homework, for your midterm, there is accountability. But for the day to day fact of writing, that is enough.

148
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,270
What they read and they see that the hard part questions will far.

149
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,309
Now my arguing based on my own experience.

150
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:57,490
Don't try a perfect bear from the beginning. I confidence usually due to these.

151
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,530
I'm trying to look at the very fact that back from the very start.

152
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,730
Now write your fault. Just start writing.

153
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,270
Writing right in writing on your way into or just after that to work those thoughts.

154
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,710
But at least they start with with thing for me or for more music, a good time to start.

155
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:25,710
Usually the very first thing they try to do before checking emails, before checking, you've got to write at least half an hour.

156
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,880
What is the best time for you to write? Morning.

157
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,680
Morning after monthly after lunch. Late night.

158
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,690
Late night. For me, it's less time than our place.

159
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,190
I have ADHD, so there's a lot going on around me. It doesn't matter that it's more I can't, okay?

160
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,169
So it's whenever I leave my house, that house is quiet.

161
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,620
I go, it doesn't matter what I'm doing. I will sit down and just start writing.

162
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,980
No. Whenever I can not be distracted. Well, yeah. I have found it for me that he's beautiful too.

163
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:14,550
You are going to think I'm crazy. But yeah, to say in loud boys what I'm writing about, I need to be alone.

164
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,200
So you read it aloud or do you talk about it? I talk about it more about.

165
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,040
And I'd like to write that. Look, I thought it had been working so far.

166
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,630
So good. Does your brain ever move faster than your hands can type? Yes, that's very hard.

167
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,200
That's easily happen. But yes, I have found that the beautiful.

168
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,820
For me. That's true. To think I love boys, but I'm trying to write.

169
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,379
And this is helpful because in order not to have the other thoughts, I get distracted.

170
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,910
You know, when you are talking loud and writing what your what you're saying,

171
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,419
you feel that you think you are doing that you're not thinking about something else.

172
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm trying to write. That's what I feel, because that's what I usually do sometimes.

173
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:13,510
So no, yeah. I catch myself actually saying things out loud and then I'm like, What are you doing signing this for someone else besides me?

174
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,200
That's what I do. Maybe I should remove the guilt from myself doing that.

175
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,260
Yeah. How do you do it during. Now we are now more bags on two pairs of glasses.

176
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:39,090
We confident if I can get to my office more often, but during the last two years were very hard to me to write because it was harder to separate work,

177
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,680
let's say, from family, from home, because that's what I wanted to ask.

178
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,470
If you want a specific place where you write, you prefer to come to your office to write or Oh,

179
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:59,069
okay, now I prefer my office here and that's cool to to write now at home.

180
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:10,590
I also because my my daughter right now she's in campus in Detroit Wednesday thing I got

181
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:18,180
more space I mean and then I have my office now I'm at home but I prefer working here.

182
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:29,730
I feel also also that I something that I miss during the last two years what this opportunity to just to say I'm walking in the hallway,

183
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:38,129
one drinking coffee in the cafeteria. I meet with someone at random and it's two, then another faculty, one colleague or me,

184
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,650
because sometimes some of the best ideas just came from that type of meetings.

185
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,149
Usually when we have this planned meeting, they are like, okay, we didn't like it.

186
00:20:48,150 --> 00:21:00,080
We are very happy in a box. I found that these serendipitous meetings are more at least from good ideas come from what?

187
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,230
Have they worked for you during COVID, stupid?

188
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,520
Well, it's been going back better now. We are more here with you.

189
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:16,920
I mean, it was harder to write or how did you do to separate work from from your day to day, you have to go to a library.

190
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,850
It doesn't to be designed to be any specific one.

191
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,160
I will travel to somewhere and I'll look up the closest library.

192
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,859
I'll go there and I find myself very productive, which is totally normal.

193
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,570
Anyone that's the new library is the best way to do stuff and stuff like that, right?

194
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:45,180
So the new library and once I sit there and they all my people in my thoughts, I think about what I want to do.

195
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,709
It is 3D. I see pictures, I don't see words.

196
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,350
So what I need to do is I need to draw them. I need to draw what I want to do.

197
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:03,990
And like you, you that I actually force myself into is talking about like what's on my mind.

198
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,480
So I record myself and then I share that with my students.

199
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:18,330
And when they see and I saw myself talking to that, I start to put the key points down and then put on the cue cards.

200
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:25,170
And I draw the logical order of how everything should be in every regard with talk to other person.

201
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,769
So there is a system. System yet?

202
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,000
Not exactly that we need to find our own own way.

203
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,499
What? Work for us. Okay.

204
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,890
Now, you silly, to distract now with social media.

205
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,750
We need to avoid distractions. Yes, we do.

206
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,460
From very far away. Don't security matter, don't you?

207
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,130
The news? No, I have found that for me.

208
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,060
Here is home. Hong Kong music. How does it work all the time?

209
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,090
Recordings on day one to be played.

210
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,710
It depends about the mood. Now find.

211
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,959
What? What? What for you? That's my advice now.

212
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,300
Because that's what you're going to be doing either to use here.

213
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,260
As a matter of fact, use of the students you will be writing.

214
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,390
You are going to going to be writing for both sides. You are going to be writing your theses.

215
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:39,320
You are going to do presentations. All of your results are talking about presentation and you have experience with oral presentations in poverty,

216
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,930
you find it stressful or you are used to.

217
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,860
I think if I'm prepared for it, I just want to do it, get it over with and move on.

218
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,940
Yeah, I enjoy public speaking. She's really good at it.

219
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,710
I think we have at the end some the last two classes, some presentation from you.

220
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,690
That's all that's cool. That the booth improvement group,

221
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:21,770
what you are planning to do for your thesis even if you don't have a topic right now but as to to to have one general ideas then yes, I will.

222
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,590
Now I'm used to work in public.

223
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:36,829
I remember when I was a student I had get to use an Airbus on Wolfgang because the problems of my of English is not being my my personally English.

224
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:45,709
I remember I used to memorize everything that was going to talk about but but the pretty what that doesn't do to not to run its like

225
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:56,930
that you I grow but I want to help you be more comfortable so and if you are more comfortable you're more likely to elaborate,

226
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:09,140
right? So I like preparing because in my head, if a mistake happens while presenting, it takes like the central stage.

227
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:15,290
Oh, my God. How come you said that? So yeah, it echoes in my brain.

228
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,690
So it helps to it helps to be getting my health differently is still for when

229
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,070
I have to attend scientific meetings I still like I don't memorize anymore,

230
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,730
but that is in the head from like a framework I'm trying to do.

231
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:43,669
I think you may be referring to some presenters that don't even change their tone of voice and sound like a recording.

232
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah. Is that what your you have in mind? Yeah, exactly.

233
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,050
Yeah. Yet another day would tell you so.

234
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,750
Please. Okay, then we are going to discuss this topic,

235
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,200
I feel in a couple of weeks how to do a little review when you're looking for papers about your topic

236
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,679
because we need to know what have been done before then we will talk more in detail about that right now.

237
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:21,410
What my advice is to start with some systematic review for your topic to provide an overview of your plan for researchers.

238
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,250
What is known, what is known, what is new in the research?

239
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,610
Because what you are going to propose to do is something new.

240
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,840
The idea that you are going to generate knowledge, new knowledge, and to share with that with your scientific community.

241
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:47,870
But again, I want to talk more later in this term now, and this is some of the a bite from that video that may try to make a daily routine.

242
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:57,110
I would advise, again, at least half an hour per day more work better for me, try to increase the time that you probably to use it.

243
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,170
Okay is easier said to do but to.

244
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:11,420
But some time we don't have time but do want to get at least 30 minutes or four whether possible try to have that time of the day.

245
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,680
Mornings, afternoon late afternoon night.

246
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:25,360
I came for morning sees the better time now what I also what I have found useful for me is using the afternoon of the night when I'm very tired.

247
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:32,780
You have to do that repetitive work they need to do. For example, meeting tables, writing task, go searching papers.

248
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,500
But again, that's my own experience. Use what?

249
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:43,080
Best work for you. We still need to create one thing.

250
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,190
I think we need a clearer mind in the morning tonight.

251
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,260
Yes, that's that's true. That's not really coming naturally.

252
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,150
That's true. You are. What kind of software you use for your analysis.

253
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,740
Ah. For my for registered users.

254
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:09,260
No I use more sass by the now. Now I'm moving more to do our programing.

255
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,570
You are. I'm moving more to our right. You are.

256
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:23,960
Why now? Why is because for the first year, this all this huge amount of free packages go.

257
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,210
And that's one reason. The other reason is because of more total genomics data to use.

258
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,170
You need to use power. There is no way around.

259
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,410
I mean, you can work in SaaS.

260
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:46,050
You have relatively if B is more data sets, for example, data that you can save in your own computer and your hard drive.

261
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,510
But most of the analysis is using the cloud.

262
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,610
Hmm. Then you need to start. Doesn't work with a starter with data.

263
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:08,160
I used to go a pool of times a long time ago. Then you like I did the course you've been doing next semester, I'll be faster.

264
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,610
Ah. So it was still accessible. Which way?

265
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:21,800
Because I had that. What I teach is based on size, because we have large dataset they had already set up for size.

266
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,020
He says born that I said that you can you can save for your own computer.

267
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,200
Mm hmm. Yeah. Oh, computer programing is just like cars.

268
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,340
And you when you go sometimes you drive on the left side.

269
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Some of them. Right. Sometimes stick. Shift them. But just.

270
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,300
Just know that logic programing, which is logic programing.

271
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,719
Just another tool. Just another the way to declare, but just not.

272
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,800
Sorry about the formality, but really getting to what we're learning.

273
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,279
So it doesn't matter. Size. Ah, I took them and just, just focus on the left lunch and.

274
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,930
Well, I need to do. Okay. Okay.

275
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,139
Before that, any question?

276
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:14,010
Comments. Yeah. We will use us in the next semester then they say so.

277
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,820
I'm very nice teacher though, I assume.

278
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,800
Well done. Okay. I think I already told you about that.

279
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,990
I think you have to have individual advice of what you are. And again, you remember your advisors are busy people.

280
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,020
Then we as a favor to your by self try to share early draft.

281
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,140
Don't give the final back from your proposal a couple of they before they need to be approved.

282
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,410
Give them time to read it and do them because also that will be more usable to get for you to get that very usable feedback.

283
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:05,010
The earlier debater not of course, remember one of the one of the early lecture that we had here down that you need to find these.

284
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:17,590
Trade off with Europe buys for that type of all bets on what to see in a regular basis draft or your proposal.

285
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:27,879
Or you'd rather the type of person that want to see your case on Belgium but with some work going on then that that made buys for a while.

286
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,090
Or you will know what type of person you are bases.

287
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,990
And of course, I know the game from my own experience.

288
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:50,420
Is that gave you that day that you are not productive and I put productive among quotation marks because even for those data,

289
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,170
I didn't write any page, a single page.

290
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,490
I feel that those also have a purpose.

291
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,690
You have to do research, but there is to take a break to think about new fields and life happens.

292
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:12,290
Don't be too harsh on yourself. QUESTION I'm tough.

293
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:20,730
I always say this to my students. You are going to hear, too, you are embarking on a long flight of gardening.

294
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,950
You are not only getting a degree, but also you are learning a new topic.

295
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,880
What is more important? You are going to be that expert on that topic at the end of your research.

296
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,610
When you present your thesis at that very moment, you are our expert because you know more than anyone else,

297
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:47,150
you are more than your advisor because you are going to be you are you have read you have done the analysis.

298
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:55,549
You have write a paper to your thesis at that very moment where the word expert can have fun and also is quite,

299
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,530
I will say, a pleasure to fashion your knowledge.

300
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:10,620
Question. Now, before I finish, I want to show you some resources that here we have in that university.

301
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:21,150
Do you know the writing lab here at the school? Then they they are very helpful with different type of issue related to writing,

302
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:30,730
not only for your proposal that you want to for them to review later, even if they can help you with your CV, will your resume meet this?

303
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,700
Then these are very helpful. Then you can go here. You need to do an appointment with them.

304
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:44,190
But at least some of my former students, they have been in there and they have taught me that they are very useful.

305
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,620
Even getting checking on the CV's and that kind of stuff.

306
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,870
Also the are still writings they're reading that you can use,

307
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:04,709
then you can look into it more related to the heart with the scientific writing, how you kind of format.

308
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,850
That way you will that kind of language that we use for scientific writing because

309
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,860
it is fitting of the writing that we use for all the people that you're doing.

310
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,220
I recommend reading some of these work there.

311
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:23,700
Also, we have been using the website. These are the faculty diversity.

312
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,210
Some of the examples I saw you have, I really noticed that they are directed more to faculty.

313
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,310
They talk a lot about their new associate professor, assistant professors,

314
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,830
but also they have different resources for the different stages in your career.

315
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:50,100
I think that with the student, I suppose dogs, they are they have some workshop, useful workshop for writing you as a student.

316
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,340
Yet in the university you have free access to those resources.

317
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,920
Then I will again recommend and advise getting the most of these resources.

318
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:10,780
Question. Now before we finish then today, remember that next Monday we don't have classes.

319
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,160
This is study day for you to prepare for your midterms.

320
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Then after in two weeks, I think we would be discussing about leadership review.

321
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:39,070
But also I want for the Mastery Students for for those of you that still don't have at least an idea about your master thesis, please.

322
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:56,520
They start looking around and I. I'm going to put here in this week in the campus website some potential project for your thesis for Mastery Students.

323
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:10,680
I got this one. I think I have mentioned to you some of these, but here at the school we have this study, the element called Wired.

324
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:17,570
Dr. Peter Stone, the chair of the department, work with them.

325
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,239
Please read this. This is a potential project to use data from.

326
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:30,030
The element called where to put in for this particular project is to study the intake of of of different

327
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:37,860
type of fat during the lactation periods and this portion to metabolic this is needed in life.

328
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,089
Then if you are interested on that, please read the D here.

329
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:51,030
I put here the email contact email for that researcher by doing that type of research and I'll I'll you can write to me was the if you want that I,

330
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,440
I made the introduction then I would be more than happy to do it.

331
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,480
Also, I know that in that area, I mean over the Apple, that type of data that can be used for due to the thesis.

332
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:13,190
I think I mentioned to somewhat you these potential for you about epigenetic aging.

333
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:29,069
Remember the we talked I'll call it captain gave two weeks ago about epigenetics in dynamical what then.

334
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,080
There is a lot of epigenetic data here.

335
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:39,440
One interesting point is about epigenetic aging is that by your marker of and you see molecular telomeres by using DNA methylation,

336
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:47,010
you see another study that you are interested, please talk to me and I can make or you can write directly to,

337
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:56,170
to, to Dr. Peterson, who doesn't have a still masters student.

338
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,800
Uh, an idea about your project. What is a potential mentor that you have to talk with?

339
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:12,500
I have talked to this doctor and she has she she's in the internal medicine.

340
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:20,140
She has a few colleagues who study and use alternative medicine using what I do.

341
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,820
That's why they. They're waiting for me, you know? Yeah, I with them.

342
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,489
Okay, let's do this. Be cold by the end of the semester.

343
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:35,410
By the end of the fall. Matters to them have to have already are not your proposal.

344
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,330
But you have your need to have already a mentor and at least an idea what you would need to do.

345
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,950
I will talk more about that after the following week.

346
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,540
But yes, you don't have a steal, an idea or a potential mentor, please.

347
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,979
Looking around because time flies. And when you see really in the winter and the winter,

348
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:10,840
you will be working on your proposal and again takes into account that you will have more or less, I will say,

349
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,280
one year to do the actual analysis, to write the paper to pieces,

350
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:23,210
then take into account the kind of work that you need that you want to go to do, because some from work can take more time.

351
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,880
That is that the two years then please be aware of that.

352
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,820
Then again, I would be posting here in this link some ideas about in this project.

353
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,360
Feel free to look into it and also to reach out to that person here or your take.

354
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,580
And you can reach out to me and I will make any introductions.

355
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,280
Okay. Any questions then? You don't have any question then.

356
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,840
I think that's all for today. I will see you in two weeks. Good luck with your midterms.

357
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:08,820
And I don't know what happened next week, but then we have a full break before going through the whole thing.

358
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,240
I don't think I need to.
