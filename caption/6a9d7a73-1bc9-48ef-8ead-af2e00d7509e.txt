1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,980
So here we go.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:17,000
I believe I have your. Christian is back.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,560
Very delighted that she was willing to do two lectures for it's not very user friendly.

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,480
So there we go, covered. Hi, everybody. How are you doing?

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,820
It's Friday. I'm in the thick of construction stuff right now.

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:45,690
Like, Yeah, there's a lot going on and I actually am revising our construction policy and presenting it while it's revised,

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:56,459
and I'm presenting it next Monday. And there's a lot of things related to this that I might just point out that there's changes

8
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,620
happening and sometimes there's a little resistance from different groups about it,

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:10,180
so I'll just kind of go through it. Okay.

10
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,979
So construction. Why do I still see infection control issues?

11
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,450
My age? Infection prevention?

12
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,090
Why does infection prevention get involved in construction? And there's a lot of reasons,

13
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:35,950
but it actually started really becoming a big deal in the early 2000s with there had been over

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,850
the previous couple of decades lots of outbreaks in the literature related to construction.

15
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,780
It took a little while for people to catch on that we could do something about

16
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,639
it in the hospital setting and it took even longer to actually get it done.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,520
But there started to be an upswing of recommendations.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,929
And actually in the 2003 CDC environmental guideline,

19
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:13,210
it focused a lot on construction and providing kind of a scenario where construction could happen safely in the hospital.

20
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,459
So we want to have two things.

21
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:25,300
We want to mostly prevent infections in the hospital related to construction and think about infection prevention for the future.

22
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:33,220
So design is a really big part of it and I think a lot of places lose that in the design aspect of it.

23
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:42,400
I feel really excited that we've impacted some of our buildings designs over the years, specifically the Children's and Women's Hospital.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,740
The sinks in the hospital were like specked out by me, so it's kind of cool.

25
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:55,690
I don't know. It's a little, little legacy. So I'll show you why that might be important, why we care about things.

26
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,120
But infection prevention is is both in that to prevent infections.

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,189
But also we do these kind of we call them ACRA. And I think probably you've heard of that word before,

28
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,159
but it's infection control risk assessment and it still uses the old infection control wording because it's from the 2000.

29
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,989
It's early. The Joint Commission actually requires and inspects to those guidelines.

30
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,569
And unfortunately, the CDC hasn't updated their 2003 guidelines for 20 years.

31
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,750
So but they're still fairly relevant.

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,030
But, you know, the world's moving on.

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:39,609
So I'm really hoping that there will be an update coming specifically that there are some things that I'm learning right now that really are needed,

34
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,570
some guidance specifically for hospital laundry facilities, which we could go down, a whole discussion about that right now.

35
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,990
But there's also building standards for health care called the Facilities Guidelines Institute,

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,480
FTI, which is basically our building code for hospitals now.

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,480
And it gets revised every four years and that's that's included acro process for many years.

38
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,940
But it actually says you must do many things related to design.

39
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,300
And during the building of of anything, any major renovation it describes what you have to do.

40
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:22,750
So that's that's been really helpful in getting people on board because they kind of have to.

41
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,110
But why do we care? So immunocompromised patients are at risk for serious infections following exposure.

42
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:38,559
The biggest risk is related to mold and mold spores released through demolition and renovation, mostly.

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
Aspergillus, as you may have heard,

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,100
that Aspergillus is really the most pathogenic of those molds and a lot of those outbreaks are related to Aspergillus.

45
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:55,720
However, there's been some really prominent ones related to other lesser common molds like squirrels, barium or mucus.

46
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,520
In those they all when they infect the patient,

47
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,659
they have a very high fatality rate because those patients that do get infected are very, very susceptible.

48
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:16,000
And and it's actually really hard to treat a disseminated mold infection up to 50% of invasive infections.

49
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,790
The patients will die from it. So it's once they get that invasive infection, it's really hard to care.

50
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:32,800
And highest risk is in the chronic lung disease because most of the time the route of exposure is through the non they're breathing it in.

51
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:43,420
So it usually starts off with a pneumonia or some symptoms in the lung and especially people with difficulty clearing lung infections are at risk.

52
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,420
But also certainly those immune compromised patients that are susceptible to any kind of mold infection are at risk.

53
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,739
It actually isn't just what you commonly would think of as immune compromised patients.

54
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,960
Certainly transplant cancer, but also surgical patients.

55
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,360
There's been outbreaks of surgeries with mold infections, actually a really big one I think I'll mention in a minute.

56
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,370
And then also newborns and premature babies. Does anyone know why newborns and especially the premature newborns are at risk?

57
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,129
You think of a reason you're desperate for a system is one of the last systems to develop and especially for premature babies.

58
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,310
A lot of those babies have an underdeveloped respiratory system.

59
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:34,000
That's a really good point. There's that there's actually another reason, too. And that's that's a very big one is a little bit.

60
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,040
I think people don't really get this and are finding it in other infections, too.

61
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:48,640
It's their skin integrity. So those really low birth weight infants don't really have good skin and it's almost like they're a burn patient.

62
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:56,730
So like their burn patients are also susceptible to skin ulcers and mold infections and their skin integrity.

63
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,090
I mean, our skin is our biggest defense mechanism is pretty amazing.

64
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,660
And those babies, you can almost see through their skin sometimes and it's very susceptible to tear.

65
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,400
They get lung infections sometimes or sorry, they get mold infections right through their skin sometimes.

66
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,629
And it's usually it's from an opening or it could be like a catheter that's been inserted or something.

67
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,870
Some tear, some bandage that tore their skin.

68
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,990
But it is their skin is very fragile.

69
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,220
These patients are everywhere, like surgical patients, anyone with a fresh surgical and they're everywhere in our hospital.

70
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,020
Transplant patients are pretty widespread also in cancer patients.

71
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,840
So we can't just focus our protective precautions in one area.

72
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,380
It has to be everywhere, even in the public spaces, because they move around.

73
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,060
So this is a picture of invasive aspergillus in the lung.

74
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,410
You can kind of see the blast. I mean, it looks kind of like mold in your on your wall, in your shower or something.

75
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:09,790
It's black just like that. And then I can't read radiology results, but apparently there's a pneumonia down there, all this cloudiness.

76
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,430
Right. And it shouldn't be there in the lens, too.

77
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,390
Now, those are arrows, right? Arrows of a billion arrows are pointing in them.

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,030
And that's always very helpful when they're real. Just puts an arrow.

79
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,290
But I mean, it's to me it's a little vague, but yeah, it should be a lot more dark.

80
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,229
It should be clear. So that's a pretty significant lung infection.

81
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:38,230
And radiologists learn to read what kind of infection might be this or might be the cause,

82
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,790
because mold infections actually look pretty different than bacterial infections in the lung.

83
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,650
So yeah, exposure is typically through inhalation, but also other other routes like skin or wounds, fresh wounds.

84
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,990
So mold is pretty amazing. Once it has it's it's water and a food source, it can grow super quickly.

85
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,670
Within three days, millions of spores can be produced in a square foot.

86
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:13,420
So I always teach this to my kid construction workers when when we do education and they look a little this, you know, disbelieving of me of that.

87
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:21,490
But it's if I mean, you can see spots, but within each of those spots is, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of spores.

88
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,379
So even in just if they were tearing out this wall, which is pretty significantly moldy,

89
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,080
well, if they were tearing out this wall and they didn't have it contained and protected,

90
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,840
they could be releasing so much into the air because that's what mold spores are designed to do,

91
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,520
is when they have the right scenario and they're disturbed, they go poof.

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,740
Like I always think like a puffball mushroom if you've ever seen those kind of released their spores.

93
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:54,490
That's a very dramatic example, but it's kind of like that. So water damage is a really significant thing.

94
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,810
So mold spores are everywhere. And you can't you can't prevent mold spores from getting around.

95
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:09,969
It's you can minimize it and through cleaning and also through your air air systems, but you can't prevent it completely.

96
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:18,070
They're going to be everywhere there, especially in soil. Aspergillus loves decomposing matter, so it actually lives really well in Campbell's piles.

97
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,870
I think it's what gives some of the compost, like the compost and earth that smell.

98
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm very sensitive to mold smells and they if they have moisture in a food source,

99
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,880
they're happily growing and it's spread through things like any kind of disturbance,

100
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,380
like removing carpeting or something like this is an extreme example.

101
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,640
I don't know what happened here, but probably a flood and then they left it.

102
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:56,210
Yeah, but that's somebody's house. I don't know where. Separate, you know, what do we want to do to prevent these spores from getting dispersed?

103
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:03,650
So we don't always know or we we don't always suspect that there's mold growth prior to demolition of a site.

104
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,610
So we have to protect for that scenario every time.

105
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:16,520
So that means they're going to build a dust type barrier between the work and the patients or staff or the active non construction area.

106
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:23,300
So dust tight is the key word. It doesn't have to be air tight, which is really close to the same thing.

107
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,890
But the construction people use the red dust.

108
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,059
Right. You really should be minimizing the escape of that.

109
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,180
Now, you want you don't want air tight. Can you guess why?

110
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,559
It's kind of a tricky question. It's because we want to make sure there's a negative pressure generation.

111
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,160
So if you have an air tight space, you can't have a pressure differential.

112
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,860
Really, you have to pull air from other sites and then get rid of it somewhere else.

113
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,320
So you have to have some airflow.

114
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,840
Dust tight would mean if you have negative pressure, you could have a crack this big, but you're pulling that air in one direction.

115
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,080
So it's is a pretty, I guess, important difference. We don't want people sweeping, dry, sweeping.

116
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,110
And I used to see I went into a construction site like maybe a while ago, ten years ago,

117
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,639
and they were literally broom sweeping and the dust was just going like this.

118
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
And I'm like, okay, it's going to look better when you're done,

119
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,020
but you're making a huge dust thing and they're like, Whoa, they're looking at me like, it's just dirt in.

120
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,520
I'm like, That's exactly where the mold spores are.

121
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,570
So they were it was, you know, it's just hard for people to understand that it's everywhere and that we have to be so careful in the hospital.

122
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,860
So we want to cover all the debris as they, of course, during demolition.

123
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,370
They're removing a lot of old material. When we're renovating.

124
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,670
They might be pulling out drywall, they might be removing tile.

125
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,150
They might be especially in bathrooms where there's tile, as you've probably seen in your own experience,

126
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,809
cracks in the tile or wherever, there's cracks in a wet environment.

127
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,100
There's a really good chance that some water got through to the backing.

128
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,180
If you've ever have you ever pulled off tile and seen mold?

129
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,740
I have many times personally. So it gets their water.

130
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,020
It doesn't even have to be an active leak.

131
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:23,750
It's just the moisture gets into the board, the, you know, whatever's behind it, drywall, whatever it can grow on that substrate.

132
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,750
It doesn't take a lot of nutrients from all the ground.

133
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,910
And so anywhere there's moisture and a substrate that which could be cellulose in the drywall, mold can grow.

134
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,629
So when they're removing all this demolition material, it could have a lot of mold spores or it could have a few mold spores.

135
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,710
But we want it to be also kind of a dust type cover on it.

136
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,700
So whenever I see I used to see people transporting stuff uncovered all the time and I rarely see that now.

137
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,269
But that's a really frustrating thing,

138
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,879
is that they'll cover it with a sheet that's not on the sheet as you're pushing this cart

139
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,680
through the hub sheet kind of flowing and billowing up as you're pushing it through the hall.

140
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,569
And I'm like, that is not really preventing anything from coming out.

141
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,459
So there's still a lot of gap and understanding of what we need to have happen.

142
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:25,760
So we've actually created an item where our our M learning is our educational online tool for the hospital staff.

143
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,760
And we've created one for our maintenance workers and for people that usually contract with us,

144
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:40,850
like people that are often working in our hospital and to kind of formally keep track of who's taking that education.

145
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,640
And I just gave an educational talk to our i.t.

146
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,709
People and their contractors who pull cable through the ceiling.

147
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,730
Can you guess why? Why? There's an issue with pulling cable in those drops ceilings.

148
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,620
So you ever have you ever seen above a drop ceiling, especially an old one?

149
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,920
There's usually a a layer like this thick of dust because it's just settling.

150
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,319
And there's there's not a ton of air movement up there,

151
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,620
but it comes from other spaces and it could even just be the dust from the ceiling tiles themselves.

152
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:25,250
But over time, this dust settles and then when they pull out a ceiling tile, I've sometimes actually little literally seen the rain of dust come down.

153
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,280
So every time, almost every time they pull out a ceiling tile, we want them to have it in a barrier.

154
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:40,969
There's some exceptions and the exceptions are very kind of controversial in my my mind because I really want the barrier every time.

155
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,610
But it also means that any time a contractor wants to know what's above the ceiling and in a hospital,

156
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,880
there's a ton of stuff going through the hallway.

157
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:56,470
Above the ceiling piping. Each rat could be cabling for computers and I.T. and phones.

158
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,830
It's complicated up there and they need to see what's really there before they can plan to do a renovation or change in.

159
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,450
If they have to move a barrier every time, it it just takes them so long.

160
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,960
So we have some exceptions, but I don't love them. And maybe someday we'll figure out a better way to do that.

161
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,100
We do want to have a special attention paid to floods.

162
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,129
So I hate floods.

163
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:35,380
But we have we spent time in the cancer center about 12 years ago, had a flood so bad there were waves of water coming down the hallway.

164
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,670
Like it was such a flow that there were waves.

165
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:52,390
There was a lot of water. A huge pipe burst in the ground outside and just rushed into the the public hallway of our cancer center.

166
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,040
I was not onsite right away. I was there like after the water receded.

167
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,259
But I saw pictures and I heard stories about it.

168
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:06,310
And the cleanup from that took four and four because it affected so many areas and it was pretty deep.

169
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,760
So we had to, you know, and then people when they do flood cleanup and this was fresh, clean water,

170
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,149
it wasn't sewer or anything like that, they wanted to skimp on how much of that wet material was removed.

171
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:28,660
And so you can try to dry after a flood, but you have to do it really quickly cause you guys remember I drying quickly is important for mold.

172
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,669
72 hours the molds for your legs. So maybe 48 to 72 depending on the type of mold.

173
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:46,840
So if you can dry it in less than three days, the chances of the mold actually being able to spoil late and cause an issue is pretty small.

174
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,390
But in a huge flood drying, everything is almost impossible.

175
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,650
Yes, you can remove carpet and that's a really simple one or you can try it.

176
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:05,380
Sometimes people try to dry the carpet in place with those giant dryers and in a non-hospital setting that's probably reasonable.

177
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,139
But in the hospital, it's just a huge risk if you let it go much longer.

178
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:20,440
And I'm still often arguing sort of with people about the time when they have to just give up and remove the wet material.

179
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:29,139
It's a huge cost and it's an insurance claim. And I've I've talked to the people who are handle the insurance stuff lots of times and

180
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,850
had to give like kind of it's not really a deposition but just I had to argue for it.

181
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,390
So and then the location of where this flood happens is also important.

182
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:47,860
So is it a really critical area or is it a more public area?

183
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,629
Really in the hospital, there's almost no area. That's not an important area.

184
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,660
Even our office areas, we actually had a kind of minor flood in a it's in the clinical building,

185
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,250
but in an area pulled off from the main hallway into where it was just offices.

186
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:10,060
And we knew there had been a flood kind of just along a wall and got that some carpet done and they replaced some of it.

187
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:16,870
Well, the staff complained about mold smell for a long time and we had to investigate it.

188
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,739
They called us. They complained to us because they wanted us to be on their side.

189
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,670
And we went there and did some investigation and showed that there probably was some material that needed to still be removed.

190
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,450
And I had a I, I'm pretty sure they did it. That was like years ago that they removed this material.

191
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,040
I haven't heard any more issue in that space, but even said, you know,

192
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,670
staff can just smell it and some people are more sensitive than others to mold and can cause allergies, of course.

193
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,770
So then there's emergencies.

194
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:56,230
So it took me a while, but just recently I created some form because for floods and for emergencies so that people could pull it,

195
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,940
read it really quickly without having to get an answer from our department and act.

196
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,570
Because in a flood you have to stop the water. You have to act quickly.

197
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,800
You have to, you know, pull out tiles to get at things, to get at the plumbing, you have to do a lot.

198
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:19,299
And we didn't really want them to be bogged down by waiting for us to tell them what to do and kind of they're just going to do it anyway.

199
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,870
And I'd rather have them have a little bit of information. So we made these form.

200
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,820
It grows for that also for things like loss of air pressure.

201
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:35,080
So air pressure can be impactful if you're in a critical area like an operating room or a pressurized room.

202
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,350
And if there's a problem with the air handling system,

203
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,889
the pressure relationship can be affected and that can be important for those immune compromised or surgical

204
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:52,000
patients because it can actually reverse and pull dust into the room that you want to be extra clean.

205
00:20:52,690 --> 00:21:04,510
So that's a problem, too. So air monitoring is important if you are concerned about whether your fix of the system has worked.

206
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,580
We don't do a lot of air mounted air monitoring. We have particle counters.

207
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,770
We actually just purchased one for our own department and we actually just hired a staff person that specializes in environmental health.

208
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:24,130
And his his focus is air. And he's in our department, in the infection prevention department, which I think is really cool.

209
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,360
We also have someone who covers water and other environmental health specialists.

210
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,069
So we're we're really like we got the whole health system here.

211
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:39,070
But air monitoring, we're probably going to do more of to try to tell the difference between,

212
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,240
you know, what you're testing for is, is your air system filtering out what you want it to.

213
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,670
And then also we have pressure gauges to check where is the airflow going.

214
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,260
So we're probably going to start ramping that up a little bit more, especially with construction.

215
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:03,190
And it's not a perfect tool because you have to really take some caution in interpreting particle count results.

216
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:14,950
It can be very confusing and it could be as simple as a lot of persons walking past in, you know, when you're doing a particle count,

217
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:21,159
it can kick up enough particles just from the people being there to to really skew your results.

218
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,260
So you have to be careful about when and how you do it. So what is our role?

219
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,530
So as I mentioned to we both want to protect the dust.

220
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,700
From getting out. We want to create we create lots of policies in forms and the aircraft form

221
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,140
to tell people what we expect them to do depending on where they're working.

222
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,690
But we also care about the architectural finishes. So this is one that I actually find to be really interesting.

223
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:53,410
It's a little bit of interior design with infection prevention perspective.

224
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:05,910
So, so I guess I think I just missed rearrange the site's construction documents.

225
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,030
You can look at what is planned. They don't always tell you the finishes like is it going to be Formica or is

226
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,960
it going to be solid surface countertop or is it going to be stainless steel?

227
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,530
But when you look at the drawings, you can tell where things are.

228
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:31,690
So that's like the physical layout that's really important both for flow of soil to clean, to patient ready,

229
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:38,710
and especially in a reprocessing area which we're we're doing major renovations in several reprocessing areas right now.

230
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,440
And then also for where the handwashing sinks are and where the countertops are.

231
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,290
Can you guys guess why countertops and sinks are important in the design?

232
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,130
There's a couple of reasons. So there's lots of right answers for this one. Very good.

233
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,640
I think your phone lines are faster. Yeah.

234
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,530
So how would the pharmacist be more relevant to the countertop in the sink scenario?

235
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,850
That type of supports. Uh huh.

236
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,270
Yeah. I mean, we almost never would have anything for us in the hospital.

237
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,920
But what. What I'm getting at is this.

238
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,990
The sink is both important for hand hygiene, so you have to have it convenient to the staff to be able to use and not blocked by anything.

239
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:35,320
But another piece of that is if the sink is in a very busy area where they're setting up for procedures and things,

240
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,030
you have to prevent the sink from causing the contamination.

241
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:50,470
So sinks, water splashing. There's lots and lots of references in the literature related to contamination, both from the water itself,

242
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,839
which is not sterile of course, and from the drain especially, and causing outbreaks in some of my most.

243
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:07,940
I think my favorite outbreaks are related to Sink Splash, which I've actually yeah, I've done a few investigations on that too.

244
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,540
We actually presented one of them. So sinks are really important.

245
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,880
We also on the drawings expect that they show where and how they're going to do negative pressure.

246
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,200
It depends on the you know, if it's a major renovation, almost always we expect negative pressure within the worksite.

247
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,900
That means the air is drawn into the worksite and exhausted somewhere out side of it safely.

248
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,830
So there's a couple of ways you can do that. You can exhaust directly outside, but that's hard to do in a hospital.

249
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,220
We don't like opening the windows if we don't have to. It's it's not really easy.

250
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,650
They're not intended to be opened, and it's just complicated.

251
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:55,540
And it can cause more problems than it's worth. So usually what most construction sites do is use a HEPA filter unit.

252
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,680
So HEPA filters, I don't know if you've heard of those,

253
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:10,510
but it's a very high filtration filter and it filters down to 0.3 microns at 99.9575% or something like that.

254
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:19,660
It's Amazon 2%, filter 2.3. So it's going to filter almost all of your biological particles, not viruses, but other things out.

255
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,790
So it's going to filter mold, it's going to filter any bacterial spores and things like that.

256
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:31,180
So if you put all of that air through the HEPA filter and then you can exhaust it actually

257
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:37,560
back into occupied space and it's actually a better filter than is on most of our buildings.

258
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,960
So the building air intakes, HEPA filters are a step up.

259
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,750
Now I will say, Eric Children's and Women's Hospital, all of its air intakes go through HEPA filters.

260
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,469
I don't know how greatly effective that is because there's still other ways for

261
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,360
air to get in and there's people in like people because of the contamination.

262
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,160
It's like a it's a level that might not be as helpful as you would think, but it's there.

263
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,600
They change those filters. They they there's no set timing.

264
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,860
They keep track of the pressure differential across them. So they have like a pressure.

265
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:19,299
I don't really it's it's a pressure gauge and they keep track of it.

266
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,380
And when it gets highly pressurized, they know it's getting too full. So they really keep track of that.

267
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,160
The HEPA filters are really expensive, so they don't they don't change them unless they see that they're getting filled up.

268
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:38,510
Now, what they should do, and I'm not confident that we do well, is to make sure the filters are put into.

269
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,940
We actually just implemented this in our huge air handlers.

270
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,649
I should have a picture of our air handler in this presentation, but they're giant.

271
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:56,140
They're like 15 feet by 20 feet high, and there's like 20 of them in this mechanical space.

272
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:05,470
You can walk in them and they're like way bigger than me. So the filter array is huge across this like panel.

273
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:12,930
And what they haven't always done is check to make sure that they put the filters in the way they're supposed to.

274
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:22,480
So filters are very fragile. And as they're putting them in, if they do it, they bump it or they let their tools fall against it, it could tear it.

275
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:31,150
And what what they really haven't been doing as well as we would like is making sure there's no damage and that they're seeded correctly.

276
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,560
And we just implemented one a check. It's really simple.

277
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,890
They take a flashlight, turn the lights out, and they take a flashlight, and one person stands on one side, one on the other.

278
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,450
That's like, really simple. But we did it and we found we were the ones that did it.

279
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:54,009
My department and we thought we thought of this to check because we were having some unusual infections in a certain area.

280
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:06,570
So we looked at the. Air handlers serving that area. And we found gaps not in the filter itself, but in the in the the metal kind of.

281
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,590
I don't know what you call it, the frame that holds the filters.

282
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,400
And so they're welded together. But there were gaps in the welding and nobody had ever found them.

283
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,630
I don't know if that's what was the problem, but it was something that needed fixing.

284
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,520
And this wasn't a HEPA filters. These were just the regular building filters, but still the same issue.

285
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,760
And it's really tricky to put them in perfectly.

286
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:39,209
And the people who put them in don't always understand the importance of having them really handled carefully because any hole in a filter,

287
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,040
the air is going to go to the path of least resistance. So you've got unfiltered air coming in.

288
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:52,259
So yeah, that's a good important question and I could talk about this whole time and I'm not really following my slide,

289
00:29:52,260 --> 00:30:01,920
but we do have on the construction drawings, we want them to show how they're going to get in and out because the path is important.

290
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:10,530
And you can imagine the construction workers, we expect them to clean themselves off and to use sticky mats to collect dirt from their shoes.

291
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,569
They like, you know, kind of stamp on nails like that. And those are just helpers.

292
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,510
But really, we need them to be owning their own clean ness as they leave.

293
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:29,250
And there are varying levels of help. If you can ever seen construction workers come out of a construction site, they can be covered in dirt.

294
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,270
They shouldn't be in the hospital for sure. And if they're getting that dirty, we expect them to either vacuum themselves off,

295
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:44,100
which is an imperfect process, or to wear a cover garb and then take that cover garb off before they leave.

296
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,380
That is a hard one to get, you know, compliance with. That's really hard.

297
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,659
So we we do expect them to tell us where they're going to be walking and then they have to clean.

298
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,890
So there's even things beyond that. They're pushing their carts, their materials are coming in.

299
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:05,939
There's a lot of traffic. So we expect them to be cleaning that whole way wherever they're leaving and going to

300
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,089
and including elevators frequently and almost always on a major construction project.

301
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,700
They have one person dedicated to cleaning and cleaning, both inside the site and outside,

302
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,470
and that actually has really helped once they started really the managing they needed to do that.

303
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,680
So I talked a little bit about sinks. There's a lot of issues with the type of sink.

304
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,230
Sometimes they put in a sink that's too big and that's a different issue.

305
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,490
That's more of an ergonomics issue or it's just a waste of space.

306
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,809
And actually just one of those yesterday where they were going to put in a sink

307
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:48,570
that was going to be two basins sink 77 inches long in a really small room.

308
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,670
And I'm like, What are you going to do in that sink?

309
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,410
And they're like, Yeah, we don't really need that sink that big and will then get a smell or something.

310
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,370
So they're going to yeah. So sometimes you find things like that, but sinks do have to be big enough, especially for him washing.

311
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,679
We found in our study that we did in a really small, shallow bowl sink.

312
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:17,760
The splash is much greater and it actually can splash both from the drain and from your hand washing process up to four feet from the sink.

313
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:26,010
And we showed that really fun by using glow lotion and we turned off and use UV lights and it took pictures.

314
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,070
It's pretty fun and it's not good.

315
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:36,580
But what we did find is that most of our sinks, there is only a couple of things in our whole clinical space that we checked.

316
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:43,590
Now, we didn't check every sink, everywhere, but in the inpatient settings we checked almost all of the different styles of handwashing sinks,

317
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,469
and almost all of them really did contain the splash pretty well.

318
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,890
It was within one foot to two feet.

319
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,980
And and where we did have splash guards, they worked.

320
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,380
So we use this glow lotion, we put it in the drain and sometimes we put it on our hands.

321
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,610
So both whatever it would be on our hands could splash, but also just the water hitting the sink could splash back.

322
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,540
And so we measured that. And, you know, it's not perfect if we had to use like a phage marker or something and like

323
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,830
swabbed for some phage across the room and I know people that have done that,

324
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:26,459
that would be a little more scientific because it's smaller and it's not just dependent on your visual eye to detect,

325
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,330
but it's pretty simple study that we did and it still showed.

326
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,420
Four feet was a possibility. That's pretty far.

327
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:44,970
And some of the outbreaks related to sinks have definitely shown by genomic typing that the same bacteria in the same drain,

328
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:53,159
same strain was what was causing the outbreak. And now they didn't necessarily you know, you can't it's hard to prove that.

329
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,649
Exactly. Mechanism. It's getting out of the sink drain.

330
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,870
It could be splashing back onto people's hands.

331
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,180
But they did use that same kind of glow thing, the fairly nonscientific glow comparison with the UV light,

332
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,950
and they found splash from their sink drains onto their patient beds.

333
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:21,639
So the patients sitting there with their catheters and their I.V. lines and anything could be getting splashed on from that sink drain.

334
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:30,190
So a lot of places have made changes. And actually the building code now requires more distance from the patient bed space.

335
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:38,350
But sometimes in older facilities or in unusual like designs, it can still be really close.

336
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,840
So we want an easy access. We want to have the water flow not too high, but not too low.

337
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:52,360
Not too high because we don't want too much splashing. Can you guys guess why we will want the drains offset from the spout?

338
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,659
Have you heard of that? And that was actually a major change that one of the people in the study did.

339
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:09,590
And we actually have it in our hospital building code that all safe drains must be offset from new faucets.

340
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,069
If we if we replace it now that there's certainly some that were put in before that.

341
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,770
But so it's so that you don't have a direct splashback from all this water flow hitting straight into the drain.

342
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:27,690
There's a lot of stuff about drains. You can learn a lot about biofilms if you get into that.

343
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,870
There's a lot of interesting studies and also we don't want aerators.

344
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:40,389
Can you guess what you know, aerators are that that kind of thing at the end of the faucet that kind of it increases or it spreads out

345
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,070
the flow of the water to make it feel like there's more water and it actually can rinse things better.

346
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,680
But it adds like kind of distance between the water droplets a little bit.

347
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:57,130
It's called. NARRATOR Those little mesh things on the end can actually kind of clog,

348
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:03,219
and they don't usually clog a lot, but they can get like debris on them and then form biofilms.

349
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,930
And we definitely have found some evidence of that in our setting.

350
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,190
And there's lots of other people that have. So we'd say no aerators anywhere.

351
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:20,680
And that was a pretty recent development like in the last five years that we have really gotten rid of those also electronic eye faucets,

352
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,310
which I kind of hate because they just don't work when you want them to.

353
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:31,120
How many times have you been frustrated in a bathroom and you're like, Come on, I'm just trying to wash my hands and people give up.

354
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,409
They get too frustrated and they're like waiting to get this water going.

355
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,980
They're just going to walk away. And in the hospital, that's really not okay.

356
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,740
We have busy staff there. They really don't have time to mess with that.

357
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,709
And so we really don't allow electronic eye facets anywhere except in public restrooms.

358
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:58,090
They're nice because people don't have to touch. There is that, but they're frustrating and they don't come out and you want them to.

359
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:03,579
And there's a whole nother issue that most people don't know about is that in that electronic eye,

360
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:10,209
there's a lot of convoluted water flow patterns within the faucet, and I don't know if I have a picture of it.

361
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,560
I haven't. Oh, yeah, I do. So here's the inside of a electronic eye faucet.

362
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,310
It's kind of hard to see, but most places would not have this stuff in them.

363
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,340
They're just a hole for the water to go through. It's pretty simple, but this is like palms and little water things.

364
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:31,870
And then they they go through this thing down here and there's I've actually seen them cut in half at displays and stuff.

365
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:37,749
And there's a lot of moving parts and things where biofilms can form and where they're stagnancy.

366
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,659
So in parts of this, I don't exactly know what it's called,

367
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:47,049
but somewhere in here there's like water that just kind of hangs out in the water when the faucet turns off.

368
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,210
Now in a normal faucet, usually separate, but, you know, like usually they kind of go like this.

369
00:37:52,510 --> 00:38:02,680
So at the aerator, there might be just a little bit of fluid sitting there, but most of the time, the gravity just pulls it back down into the piping.

370
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Well, this has a stagnant area, and many, many people have found that that is a really good place for biofilm growth.

371
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,280
And plus, it also has access to air and it's at room temperature.

372
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,340
So it's not kept cold like in a cold water.

373
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,759
And and another thing is that almost always in these electronic faucets,

374
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,840
because you don't have the option of changing the hot and cold, there's a mixing valve.

375
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,460
So it's combining hot water with cold water to a reasonable here washing temperature.

376
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:39,399
Usually the problem with that is that you've now taken the hot water that's supposed

377
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,810
to be a certain temperature to prevent other bacteria growth like Legionella.

378
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,050
And you've combined it with cold water and you've mixed it to put it right in the nice Legionella growth temperature.

379
00:38:50,890 --> 00:39:02,350
So I really don't like electronics. So we just actually just took them out of one of our ambulatory care buildings or some other faucet could or some.

380
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,059
So these are not kind of normal faucets. They don't have as much stuff.

381
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,540
They do still have like kind of that plunger kind of thing, the off and on thing.

382
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,470
But you can kind of see that it all would flow down from gravity.

383
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:24,490
Yeah, some are more simple than others, but I never thought I would learn so much about plumbing in infection prevention.

384
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,540
But I kind of like it. I don't. I'm glad I don't have to fix the plumbing, though.

385
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,709
So yeah, there's a lot you could get into in this this topic matter.

386
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:44,710
And I think we are just scratching the surface of our environmental systems and how they impact infection in the hospital.

387
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:51,760
And there's a lot more study to be done and there's a lot of studies coming out that are really interesting.

388
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,210
So this kind of we talked about. There's nothing, nothing clean or patient or patient ready or sterile.

389
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:07,090
The patient themselves should not be within three feet. That's actually a a building code design, a newer building code design.

390
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,670
But none of our buildings were built under that building code.

391
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:19,180
However, we had our U of M design code that made sure that we had flashcards and that the everything clinical was kept away.

392
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:27,250
I'm sure there are some places where we missed it, but as you walk, like if you go in the children's and women's hospital,

393
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:32,560
you'll see splash guards everywhere and that allows people to put clean things next to a sink.

394
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,260
There's not a lot of space when we want to use our counters well.

395
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:44,950
So they want to put, like the patient's new blanket or the dressings that they're going to change on something.

396
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,520
They want to stage it somewhere clean and dry while they're getting all their supplies ready.

397
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:54,640
Well, if they put it right in the splash zone of the sink, they could be contaminating the outside of it.

398
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,840
So, yeah, it makes it more useful. And this is my favorite outbreak. This is the one I was telling you about from 2009.

399
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:09,880
Really unfortunate outbreak of in. Sometimes it takes a really unusual organism to make us realize that we have an outbreak.

400
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:18,910
Unfortunately, someday in the future, when everything is going to be like identified down to its like strain in the micro lab,

401
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,320
we could tell where things are coming for a lot more easily,

402
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,460
but sometimes you have to have a weird organism to know there's something strange going on.

403
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,079
So they had multi-drug resistant pseudomonas. Pseudomonas is everywhere in the water.

404
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,850
It's just common. But if you when you have a multidrug resistant one, you kind of wonder what's going on.

405
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:42,010
So they had 17. Now, this one is pretty significant.

406
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,610
17 patients in three months with several 17 dying.

407
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,319
That's a big deal. You would probably thought something was going on there. Really unfortunate.

408
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,129
In a pediatric ICU, they used a fluorescent marker, like you said, and they showed the splash zone was a meter from the sink.

409
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:06,700
This was done in Canada. And this study just was like really pivotal to me, changed how I looked at things a lot and a lot of people.

410
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,660
So yeah, we use backsplash. So Backsplash is very important for multiple reasons.

411
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,910
We want a very water resistant backsplash.

412
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:23,360
We don't want any cracks in the black backsplash because water will find a way in.

413
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:32,480
There's that we have. I see. I love having sinks in accessible locations, but if you don't do it right, it can be more harm than good.

414
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:39,140
So in our some of our schools and university hospital, we have sinks just kind of out in the ICU hallway.

415
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,120
I mean, like Emily. But Emily, have you ever noticed the sinks in?

416
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:53,870
The secu that are in the corner is kind of their limit, so I don't know if you've ever noticed the backsplash of them is always falling apart.

417
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,030
I can't tell you. There's always tons of there's tons of crap there.

418
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,320
So I don't think I would know. Which is not good. No. So anesthesia.

419
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,810
Yeah. Anesthesia parts will be right there.

420
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,400
Anesthesia equipment used for emergency intubations and these high risk patients, others that nursing supplies.

421
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,669
I just want to remove those things. So every.

422
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:24,290
Every time I walk up there, there's something else falling apart behind these sinks because they didn't put a really wide backsplash behind it.

423
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,280
So they have a little backsplash just like this high. That's not enough.

424
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,300
When they get used for here washing frequently and there's no side guards.

425
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:39,890
So we had them put plastic side guards on them too, kind of like jerry rigged it and the plastic side guards keep falling off.

426
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,309
So these particular sinks just are not a great design.

427
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:49,370
And they were put in before I knew what I knew, so I really want to get rid of them,

428
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:55,700
but I also kind of feel bad taking away sinks that people might use, but I don't know if they're more harm than good.

429
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:04,370
So what? Instead I just go and inspect them and tell them they have to come up and repair them and put more like stuff around them.

430
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,260
And they have over time added water resistant backing, but they're still not great.

431
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,870
And then any time you have cork, cork is a great substrate for mold to grow on.

432
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:25,609
If you've probably seen in your own showers and tubs, it's the first place mold grows because it's got so it's got food material for the mold on it,

433
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,420
whereas your tile is really, you know, unless you have biofilm on your tiles,

434
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:37,100
we probably always do, but it can't really live there very well, but on the clock it can.

435
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,270
So the cork is an issue and they're always recording it.

436
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:55,129
And then like and then sometimes the, the nobody notices and I'll go up there in the carcass like brown black mike to record those.

437
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:01,520
But so there's a lot of stuff that you have to think about related to water and water sources and things.

438
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,490
So I'm gonna kind of skip through this because I think I'm talking a one time.

439
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:13,010
There's also cork code expectations for how many sinks you have to have in a space based on the number of patients.

440
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:23,930
So we have to follow the building code, but sometimes the building code just isn't up to speed with current understanding of best practice.

441
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:31,700
So sometimes we have to fight a little bit about that and then we have a lot of hand sanitizer everywhere and I think that's been great.

442
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:40,550
The one thing downside to hand sanitizer is it it does sometimes destroy surfaces.

443
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:50,600
So we have a hand sanitizer mounted in our hallways and almost all of our inpatient areas and especially in University Hospital,

444
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:58,550
the particular flooring, the tile or the kind of like continuous flooring that they have,

445
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:05,810
it totally gets discolored and it looks terrible under each of those hand sanitizer things.

446
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:15,379
So then they have to go repair it and then there's construction, you know, like, so that's that's a downside.

447
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:21,260
But yeah, so, so hand sanitizer where it really catches the drips is important.

448
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,149
And I don't think there's very great designs on that. We also really want to think about space.

449
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:33,050
So sometimes infection prevention are the only ones talking about, do you have enough space for storage?

450
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:43,220
Storage is huge. Can you and there's a reason why storage minimal storage space can be an even bigger problem than you anticipate.

451
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:50,150
And this is maybe more like human systems engineering, and I don't know a lot about that, but I have had a few courses and classes on it.

452
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:58,250
But if you think about it, when people are working in a crowded, cluttered area, it is just not good for the human psyche.

453
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,549
It makes you want to think this area is dirty, even if it really isn't.

454
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:11,490
But it is harder to clean if you've got a ton of clutter. And so you've got this, like, really cluttered.

455
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:19,090
Everything's out on the surface. You have no workspace, and it makes people feel less careful.

456
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:28,680
It's a psychological thing, and it's so space is important and having clean storage space is really important and it always gets cut.

457
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:38,010
So when they're trying to cut corners on cost, the storage space goes and then we're having problems for years and years after that.

458
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:47,339
And I hate that soil work rooms are important because you want to make sure that you're not increasing the

459
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:54,480
risk of contamination for the staff and that your workflow is going from soil to clean to patient ready.

460
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,070
And if you don't have the right layout, it can be really hard to do that.

461
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,469
And then we have these things called hoppers, or they're also called clinical things which where they flush the bedpans.

462
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:10,920
And so most of the time in an inpatient room, if someone's using a bedpan or a commode chair,

463
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,250
they'll flush it right in the toilet, in the patient bathroom. And that's logical.

464
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:23,129
But if there is no patient bathroom, like in an ICU setting or in a clinic space, that they're using a bedpan,

465
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:29,340
which is kind of rare and there's just, you know, they put these hoppers in where they dump body fluids.

466
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:38,790
And so you can imagine this is like, you know, a toilet basically in a soiled room and the nurses dumping it so there can be splashback on the nurse.

467
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:44,100
So we put these guards to protect their body, but it's not perfect.

468
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,910
And then when you flush the hopper, it's just like a toilet flushing and it can contaminate the environment, including the person standing there.

469
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,470
So flushing is a big I don't know, it's a big deal.

470
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,979
We don't think about it enough. There's lots and lots of studies.

471
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,800
You can go to whole conferences, which I have that talk about splashing from toilets,

472
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:12,030
but they still don't put lids on toilets and no, no, they don't because it's too hard to clean.

473
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,060
People pee on the lid, you know? Yeah.

474
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:29,070
Like at home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. So I actually lobbied really hard about four years ago to put lids in our new inpatient renovations.

475
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,900
There's no building code for it, and they don't even really make them that work.

476
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,540
So nursing doesn't really like them because then they have to just deal with them,

477
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:47,159
they have to flip them up and sometimes they fall down but when they use have a bedpan sprayer is often attached to

478
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,310
the toilets is a lot of detail but it's bedpan sprayer it looks like a little showerhead it's attached to the toilet.

479
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:05,249
They could literally not find one a lid that fit to work with our bed like it conflicted with the bedpan sprayer they to make it look like so.

480
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,540
So there's sometimes like this like disconnect of studies and research.

481
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:20,520
I mean C difficile in a patient bathroom that there's tons of studies that the toilet flushing spreads the spores throughout the bathroom tons.

482
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,130
Yet. We don't have live covers for them.

483
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:36,100
You can just tell that there's a very yeah, there's aerosol and even even bigger than that there's literally sometimes you can visibly see the spray.

484
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,570
Yeah. It's more reason to wear your mask in a bathroom.

485
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,410
Yeah. Yeah. And that's a problem, you know, especially in shared bathrooms.

486
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,770
We have so many private rooms and many hospitals do.

487
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:56,799
And so whatever the other patient, you know, like you're kind of sharing those germs in shared bathrooms,

488
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,780
which is kind of a bad idea, but it's expensive to build all private rooms and private bathrooms.

489
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:09,010
It's it's building code now. So any new building has to in the US has to have private inpatient rooms.

490
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:16,750
I'm sure there's some exception or loophole, but like our new construction over there is all private and it has to be a building code.

491
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:23,350
So yeah, then there's air, there's, there's all these air issues and the air is really important for construction.

492
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:31,630
As you can guess, the pressure relationship is important both in the construction site, but also making sure this is this is what gets missed so much.

493
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,750
So when they're designing the room and they need a pressurized space.

494
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:44,470
So like an operating room or an airborne infection isolation room, you have to design the room so that you can maintain air pressure differentials.

495
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,040
And that is just not understood.

496
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:55,030
It's been talked about in the literature for like 20 years, but there's no building code.

497
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,780
There's a code that says what your pressure differential should be.

498
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,659
But but the air handling engineers just say, okay,

499
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,310
I'm going to put enough air in and exhaust enough air out that you'll have this pressure differential.

500
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:12,130
But they don't take into account that there's holes behind the sink and behind the drywall and in the ceiling.

501
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:19,690
And all those holes allow the air pressure to normalize and then they can't maintain the pressure differential.

502
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,430
And we are struggling with that in almost every area of our buildings, and everyone does.

503
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,200
So now we're going on this huge construction project in our emergency department.

504
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,070
We have several airborne infection isolation rooms in the emergency department.

505
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:39,249
They could not maintain, no matter how much air they pushed into there, they couldn't maintain the pressure.

506
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:43,300
And then it was starting to get to be too loud because the air was airflow was so high.

507
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:51,280
So now they have been taking down one isolation room at a time, taking out the ceiling, filling all the cracks,

508
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,330
looking behind the sinks, because often behind cabinetry, there'll be like a piping hole or something that they didn't caulk around.

509
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,079
Now, that's actually a fire code issue, too. You're not supposed to have gaps like that when it's a firewall.

510
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:13,270
And most inpatient, not the emergency department as much, but inpatient rooms, they all should be fired, protected from the other rooms.

511
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,610
So it's multiple reasons, but it actually really helps maintain pressure.

512
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:23,740
And we're doing that both in the emergency department and in some of our isolation rooms in our university hospital.

513
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:31,299
It's working. It takes a room down for like five or 6 minutes and and they hate it.

514
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,330
So it's taking us years to get this accomplished.

515
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:41,479
So yeah. We do like monitors for knowing what their handling is.

516
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:51,000
But as even this year we're finding that our management of our urban isolation room and our pressure monitors is substandard.

517
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,549
Like, you have to be maintaining those really often.

518
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:00,230
And it's a it's just a task that doesn't seem like a big deal to maintenance.

519
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:05,330
But the little tiny holes and detail, that little tiny holes,

520
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:11,930
they get dust clogged just from being there and they have to be blown out or they can't detect the pressure.

521
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:17,810
So we now that we have staff in our department that can go and check with another meter,

522
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:24,230
we're finding major discrepancies between our monitors on the wall and what the real pressure differential is.

523
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,770
And they check it by looking under the door while with a shut door.

524
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:34,310
So they stick a little tube on both sides. And we're finding big issues.

525
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:41,120
And maintenance is like has yet to really in the knowledge that yeah, we're not something's wrong here.

526
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,610
So we're dealing with that right now. So that's a fun stuff.

527
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,450
So yeah I talked a little bit about pressure differentials point a one you don't have to probably

528
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:58,240
remember this number but building code specifies that that's your aimed for a pressure differential.

529
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:03,790
But because of all those holes and gaps, it's really hard to maintain it in many places.

530
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,700
Operating rooms less so because there is a lot of airflow coming in to an operating room,

531
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:15,280
both for temperature control and just from the array of air vents coming down.

532
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:22,390
But in our pressurized isolation rooms and our protective environment rooms for bone marrow transplant patients,

533
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,860
those have a hard time maintaining their pressure. And so we have to do work on those.

534
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:33,160
And that's why the well sealed room envelope they call it is really important.

535
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,969
Also in pressure at maintaining pressures, you have to think about things like things like self-closing doors,

536
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:46,420
like if somebody can leave a door open, go into a door and it doesn't want to close on its own, it is just kind of sitting there.

537
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,620
Your pressure is just neutralizing. So that's a real problem for operating rooms.

538
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,300
The types of doors you choose are very important in any pressurized space,

539
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:04,570
and it can be really seen in a pharmacy clean room where we have really clean rooms are some of the most regulated places in the hospital,

540
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,459
the pharmacy clean rooms.

541
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:15,190
And I think it's good, but it's pretty out there, like it's orders of magnitude more specific and more stringent than our operating.

542
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,520
Okay, but the pharmacy clean room guidelines are really specific.

543
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,299
They have all these pressure differentials that they have to maintain and they have to

544
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:30,730
monitor their amount and very specific time frames and make correct corrective actions.

545
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:38,320
They're finding that they have a hard time finding doors that work because if you have people coming in and out,

546
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,910
that door has to close so fast to get the the air back to it's pressure.

547
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:52,570
It's just not easy to do. So tricky. I don't know how to help them with that other than they need to fix they need to create better doors.

548
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:02,860
I don't know. So interior design is really big and there's little simple things like what kind of flooring are they going to use?

549
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:10,480
What kind of wall is going to be? Is it a wall impervious to a water wall in a highly wet location,

550
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:19,360
or is it a very cleanable flooring or in our I just brought it up yesterday in a construction meeting.

551
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:29,200
If you have a lot of weight on a linoleum type floor, like a solid one or they call it a continuous vinyl floor,

552
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:35,590
the vinyl might not be able to handle the weight and it will tear over time.

553
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,770
So it's just that pressure. It compresses it and makes it tear if there's any kind of movement.

554
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,360
We're finding this in our inpatient rooms from the patient beds.

555
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:54,010
So the weight of the patient on the bed and the movement of the wheels and the pressure under the wheels is actually clearing our floors.

556
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,229
They never would have thought of that when they put those in. Nobody knew that that would be an issue.

557
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:08,830
But if the materials you need for health care are just kind of different than are easily available, so you have to really be careful.

558
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:13,270
Sometimes you don't know until it's too late that that wasn't the right choice.

559
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:18,219
And solid ceilings are really important in any pressurized space,

560
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:24,879
and people don't always know how to manage that because a solid drywall ceiling is a problem if

561
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,080
you ever have to do repairs because then you have to cut into drywall and it's really messy.

562
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,680
So there's like pros and cons with that.

563
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:40,240
They make tile ceilings now that are gasket it to hold air pressure and their cleanable surface.

564
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:45,670
Those are more common now in places like pharmacy clean rooms and because they

565
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:51,670
have to get into the ceiling to fix things and stuff and it seems to be better,

566
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,350
but you have to do the gaskets. There's a lot of stuff maintenance.

567
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:03,640
If you talk to our maintenance staff, they'll give you a long discussion on gasket and ceilings.

568
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,730
There's just a lot of stuff. Emergency department.

569
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,530
You can imagine that there was a lot of stuff done for COVID.

570
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,659
And I'm not even I don't know if you guys have like had a lecture and all the things

571
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,710
infection prevention was involved in uncovered in dealing with COVID and airflow.

572
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:31,509
Hospitals everywhere did tons of things that way outside the box and sometimes went too far outside the box.

573
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:39,040
But even, you know, we put in HEPA filters to create negative pressure and exhausted those HEPA filters outside.

574
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,989
In many of our patient rooms, we actually at one point had 150 HEPA filters.

575
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,050
We had a really hard time getting enough of them to make all these.

576
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,740
Negative pressure rooms out of a normal patient room.

577
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:59,219
That was really out of not you know, it was a little bit of fear response in trying to make the staff feel safer.

578
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,920
And that was really early on in 2020 when people were really, really, really scared.

579
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:10,710
And the health care workers, you know, people were dying and it was a scary time.

580
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:15,899
And so we did everything we could think of in our engineers thought of this and other hospitals had done it.

581
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,030
So we we bought all these filters.

582
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:25,259
We put them in, we built these things across the windows, took the windows out, which is something we almost never do, took the windows out,

583
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:35,070
put this thing across the windows, put a HEPA filter plugged in with a hose and and then had a negative pressure room.

584
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:43,230
And they did pull negative pressure. However, people didn't like the noise, so sometimes they would turn the HEPA filters off.

585
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:49,290
So when you have an open window, the HEPA filters off and you have this flex hose coming.

586
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:55,950
If you don't have a perfect seal around this outside window, sometimes the wind's going to blow stuff in.

587
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,870
And it did. And the windows were cracked, in some cases just a little bit to let the air in and out.

588
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:09,149
Well, guess what? Birds thought that was a great place to nest, too, because it was protected.

589
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:13,799
So we had bird nests in our inpatient room windows and we weren't the only ones.

590
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,780
This happened in other places too. It was not super common, but it was more than once.

591
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:25,079
And like little baby birds hatching in our inpatient room windows, unintended consequences.

592
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,470
It. So now almost all of those are removed.

593
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:36,790
And the ones that are left, we require that they leave them on all the time so that the air is blowing out.

594
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:43,850
But that's not a perfect thing. We're not there all the time. I'm sure they get turned off sometimes.

595
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:50,900
And we we do think that some of that unfiltered air getting into the building has been a problem with Aspergillus infections.

596
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:55,730
There's also a big thing called COVID associated aspergillus.

597
01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:00,979
We just heard of that because we talked about it in our department meetings.

598
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:10,640
But the immune compromising agents that people who are very sick with COVID, what we're getting to prevent their body from going crazy.

599
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:16,580
The immune response also made them immune, suppressed enough that they got aspergillus infections.

600
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:23,030
So they were almost like a transplant patient or a bone marrow transplant patient, and they got sick with Aspergillus.

601
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:31,250
Now, the good part is when the immune agents, immune suppressing agents were removed or tapered off,

602
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,770
most of those people recovered and their body immune system fought off the Aspergillus.

603
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:45,050
It was rare that it caused really invasive disease, but a lot of people were sick and in the hospital even longer because of that infection.

604
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,260
And we can't say and I'm not sure exactly it could have been from other things in the environment,

605
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:55,850
but a lot of those people have negative pressure rooms with HEPA units with their windows open.

606
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,659
And that's our that's our philosophy.

607
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:05,719
So we really went on a big kind of about face to remove all these HEPA units that created negative pressure.

608
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,049
And then we had to sell the idea to the staff that no,

609
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:16,910
COVID is really not an airborne disease and there's still people that don't trust that that's true and it's not perfect.

610
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:23,150
You know, nothing is perfect. So air circulation is important and it can have big consequences.

611
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:31,790
I talked a little bit about carpeting. I used to see carpeting in lots of places where you would not expect it to be in a clinical space.

612
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:39,439
Because if you can imagine if there's a a urine spill or blood gets on something, it's really hard to clean and carpeting.

613
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,549
So we really don't allow it. In most places in outpatient areas and hallways, there's still carpeting in a lot of places,

614
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,630
but most of our even exam rooms in outpatient have solid flooring.

615
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:55,400
We also don't have decorative fountains and pools most everywhere.

616
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,530
Can you discuss why this is occurring?

617
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,930
This was something that I was really surprised with.

618
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,320
Yeah, we said no and they ignored us. That happens sometimes.

619
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,360
It's very nice, but it's beautiful. It's very calming.

620
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,669
I like going over there. I don't go there very often, but we do monitor it independent.

621
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:27,350
We monitor it. So one of our classes, probably my assistants went over and cultures that took water from there.

622
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,700
There's stuff in that water. Oh well can you share that?

623
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:38,030
So we just test for Legionella because that's the thing that, you know, is really, really scary.

624
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:43,700
And obviously, inpatients are usually getting wheeled over to the cardiovascular center atrium.

625
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,540
We have this little river and it's not like bubbling river, but it's a water feature,

626
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:56,359
as it's called, and it's this cute little like kind of bubbling over rocks or not really bubbling.

627
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,889
It just flows and then it goes down and it's recirculate and they treat it with allergies,

628
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:05,480
signs and other I don't know if they usually put in those features.

629
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:11,060
So it's a service that comes and maintains the system. We test it for Legionella.

630
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:15,320
So that's what you worry about with any kind of water feature, especially if there's a spray,

631
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:24,980
is that you could be aerosolized in Legionella, but there could be other things like mycobacteria, pseudomonas, other water organisms.

632
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,740
There's no real aerosolization there and that's kind of thing.

633
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,459
That's one of the things that seems okay. But yeah, we did say no and they just ignored us.

634
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:43,520
I think if that came up now, I think we would have a lot more ammunition to say to really hold them to it.

635
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:51,229
But it is really pretty. But a lot of hospitals used to have those big fountains out front and and stuff like that.

636
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:59,120
Those are almost gone. There's multiple reasons why fountains are out and mostly the spray, but it also often they had lights in them.

637
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:05,510
So Legionella only grows at warm temperatures. They can survive at cold temperatures, but it doesn't grow and multiply.

638
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,889
It only really multiplies above 90 degrees, 85 to 90.

639
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:18,140
90 is starting to get into its growth range and they often have those lights in the fountains that would make it look pretty and light it up at night.

640
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:25,970
Will the light bulbs heated up the ladder near the light bulb enough that legionella could grow.

641
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,470
Two significant numbers right around that light bulb. Who would that?

642
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:37,880
So that was one of the reasons the fountains or so probably if it was always cold water, legionella probably wouldn't have been an issue.

643
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:43,100
It would have been there, but it wouldn't have been in high numbers. So lots of things.

644
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,780
And then I really don't like shower curtains. I have a lot of issues.

645
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:55,790
Cubicle curtains. Cubicle curtains are less. I just read a really interesting article about cubicle curtains and culturing.

646
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,210
You know, those are like the dividers between a patient space.

647
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:06,650
Health care workers touch on back and forth. So yes, they do get contaminated by hands he can contact.

648
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:16,340
The good thing about most cubicle curtains is the fabric is not a great substrate for re dispensing the bacteria they get.

649
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,390
I feel like they kind of get locked in the weave. I know that's my theory.

650
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:28,670
But so people artificially inoculated the couple cubicle curtains and then tried to transfer it back to hands or gloves.

651
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,010
And it was a really low transfer rate, which is good. But those things are really hard to wash.

652
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,250
They're very tedious to remove and put back up.

653
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:44,660
Environmental Services hates doing that, and it's a time consuming thing, so they don't get changed very often.

654
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:55,010
So there are there's lots of technology about antimicrobial shower shower curtains or shower curtains with like a plastic edge that you can disinfect.

655
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:03,530
We don't have any. And I think I think that's partially because they haven't been implicated so strongly in outbreaks.

656
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:07,609
But it's an issue. Shower curtains are an issue because of spray, spray and splash.

657
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:13,290
So getting water in the environment, we actually have a problem with that in one of our buildings where they.

658
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:24,070
So zero entry showers so for ADA access reeling people in or people that can't step up into a shower, there's their flap.

659
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,130
So you're in the toilet room and there's a toilet sink shower.

660
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:33,680
No difference in the flooring. Just a little slight slope in a drain.

661
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:39,800
Well, if your shower curtain isn't pulled just right, you can have spray across the whole bathroom.

662
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:47,870
The problem is, they didn't plan on that much water getting on the walls across from the shower and even on the doorframe.

663
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:55,069
So we had mold rust on the door frames within a few years and some of our shower areas.

664
01:08:55,070 --> 01:09:00,470
So there now. So then they had to replace all that as a construction project to fix all that.

665
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:07,610
Okay, I got to get to my actress stuff and it's a 1012.

666
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,750
Okay. How long am I supposed to be here?

667
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,650
About 20 minutes. Okay, let's do that, Kristen. So we talked a lot about that.

668
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:24,320
So it was a process. We were close area process is we think about where the construction is happening,

669
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:32,840
what kind of construction is happening, and then decide what we minimum we minimally expect the contractors to do.

670
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:41,240
So that's what an area is. It's an infection control risk assessment and we want them to do it for any really any dust generating work.

671
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,799
And sometimes that's hard to define for who is doing it.

672
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:56,870
So maintenance might do it. Construction contractors, vendors that are installing equipment sometimes to make dust generating work.

673
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,660
We also want to think about how long it's going to take and how long this is going to be ongoing.

674
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,100
That relates to the type of barriers we would choose. So.

675
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,090
Next is so we get involved in construction projects.

676
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:16,380
We like to be involved pretty early on, especially to get involved in the design.

677
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,140
So I just found out one yesterday,

678
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:27,570
it's a series of renovations for this one department in different buildings and they didn't pull us in for the design.

679
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,760
I don't know how that happened. It happened during COVID. A lot of stuff just like went crazy.

680
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:39,540
I think of like the really big 20, 20, 21 things just kind of fell off the wagon a little bit.

681
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:48,300
But we're getting back together. And they didn't consult us for how they were going to do the design of the space.

682
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:53,790
They did consultants to get the construction iqra the part of the ACRA,

683
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:59,339
which is not really thought of is what do you need to do in this space and what should you put?

684
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,900
How should the room be?

685
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:11,840
So we're finding that they missed some things in the room layout and it's already done and built and but in the next one, I'm like, no, no, no.

686
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,149
Yes. So they're like, Oh, well, we didn't do that.

687
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:19,800
And the other one and like, yeah, so that's part of the aircraft.

688
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:26,489
So but for the actual construction work itself, we want to know what type of construction is happening.

689
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:32,400
So it includes a dialog or at least sending documents and some sort of description of what's going to happen.

690
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:38,040
Then we identify what the spaces were. Is it a low, medium or high risk space?

691
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:47,400
And we have categories for that. And then we have a thing called the EP Infection Control Matrix, and the Matrix tells you what kinds of stuff to do.

692
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,320
So I'm going to show you that. So it's a little bit small font, but the the point is that there's type A work,

693
01:11:52,980 --> 01:12:02,820
be work and see where C is like our biggest dust generating work, demolition, cutting into big chunks of drywall, pulling out ceilings.

694
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:08,639
Type B work is a little trickier because it might be like a little bit of dust, but not a lot.

695
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,340
And it might be that it's just a really small area.

696
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:20,940
Like maybe they have to cut out for putting in a socket cover or something like that, like a plug cover.

697
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,370
Really small, but they have to cut into drywall that would usually be tight, be a small amount of work,

698
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:30,540
a little bit of dust, something that can be handled with pretty simple clean up.

699
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:38,309
Unless it's in a really high risk area, removal of carpeting can be done in a way that it's very low dust generating.

700
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:42,450
They if they're careful, they cut and they roll really carefully.

701
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,130
It's really not that much dust, but they can also be really bad at it.

702
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,420
Removing ceiling tiles to put cabling in is usually what type B work.

703
01:12:53,430 --> 01:13:00,120
They're not drilling, they're not cutting. But just the fact that they're moving the ceiling tiles is potentially dust generating.

704
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:09,059
And then there's type A, which is really, you know, not so much like painting, but however, whenever there's painting, there's often sanding involved.

705
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:14,580
So you have to be really careful about what's happening, putting in like a vinyl floor.

706
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,780
If the floor is already there and it's just putting it in the floor, that's really low dust.

707
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:27,599
But if they have to remove the old and that's a different story, so there's a lot of questioning involved.

708
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,350
So then we want to think about what area this is in. And sorry, that's a little hard to be.

709
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,300
But so like office areas in health care buildings are probably our lowest risk area.

710
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:46,920
There's lots of medium risk outpatient areas, radiology areas, places where there's not like a critical procedure happening.

711
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:52,200
And then the hallways actually just change this in our construction policy that

712
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,729
the hallways or corridors in high risk areas are the high are also high risk.

713
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:06,090
So I just move that so that this is a little bit old. And then the high risk areas in our matrix is any inpatient, any operating room,

714
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:13,829
procedural area, central sterile supply where they're processing instrument instruments.

715
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:27,150
On the clean side, the soiled side is different cath labs, things like that, emergency room, a lot of things are in the high risk and then the matrix.

716
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,300
So you look at the type A, B or C, low, medium, high, and it tells you which class.

717
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:37,410
The class then has a bunch of list of things that we want them to do.

718
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:43,410
And this is just a little old, my revision, it's a little bit to update it after this policy change.

719
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,059
And then this is the stuff we want them to do and I don't expect you to read it,

720
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:55,260
but it involves things like this one talks about negative pressure using a HEPA filter exhausted outside.

721
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:58,830
It also talks about anti rooms for air lock.

722
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:07,680
That's kind of optional, but we try to do that and most of the places and then up here in the class three it's a little bit.

723
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:14,449
Little bit less stringent, but still negative pressure, keeping things cleaned up frequently.

724
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:22,040
And then the class two is really just clean up after yourself, don't use a dry broom and don't disperse the dust.

725
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:32,959
So we're going to do a few examples and I want you guys to tell me how to figure out the aircraft risk class,

726
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,650
which is one, two, three or four, and the four is the higher risk.

727
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,709
This is an example of a construction drawing where it's the same space, but they're working in different phases.

728
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:48,290
So this often happens in health care because you can't just take over a whole space for three months.

729
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:59,689
They want you to slowly move between spaces. It really causes a lot more trickiness for the contractor because they have to build different barriers.

730
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:04,040
They have to think about it differently. But so here they were building a space here around a counter.

731
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:09,050
Then they were taking over like the check in area, and then they were working on this room up here.

732
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:15,350
So that's all one construction project. But they moved sequentially to try to get there.

733
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:20,840
And so that's a pretty common typical thing. So let's go through a scenario.

734
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:26,060
Here's a scenario. We need to add some new monitors in the nursing areas.

735
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:33,649
It will include cable pulling, which you guys we already talked about that in the hallways and a little bit of cutting like a small

736
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:39,680
area of cutting like that size less than a square foot in the hallways near the patient rooms.

737
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,230
So let's figure it out. We're going to go through well, let's go back to our four matrix.

738
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:52,310
So. So first it was cable pulling and you remember that was tape B.

739
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:00,070
You know, you can't really read it. It's sort of small. And then it's in the it's in the in-patient area.

740
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:03,850
So that was high risk. So be high risk.

741
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:07,180
And then we got to figure out what it is. It would.

742
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,740
It would be. Right.

743
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,640
Three, three. So then it tells them that we're going to fill out the form and they have to do this class three, plus all the things above it.

744
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:23,080
So that'll be what we highlight to them when we meet with the contractors.

745
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:29,860
And then we put it in a signed document, and they have to sign it and we sign it, and then they post it on the construction site.

746
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:35,350
That's a requirement actually by a joint commission that they have to have the aircraft on hand.

747
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:45,240
If it's not posted, they have to have it right there readily available to suppress it says Class three, something that Michigan Medicine came up with.

748
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,090
Or if you went to another hospital, would they also? That's a really good question.

749
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:56,050
I didn't talk a lot about that, but it is fairly standard. However, some let me just go back once.

750
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,450
Some hospitals have an extra risk class.

751
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:04,180
So low, medium high in a lot of places have a highest.

752
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:09,400
I think that's funny, but I don't know. It didn't make sense to me to do highest.

753
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:18,160
But they have an extra high risk for things like their bone marrow transplant, their operating rooms and other pharmacy clean rooms.

754
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:25,860
We just lumped it all together, and maybe that means they do a little bit more for some things that they don't need to.

755
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:32,319
But honestly, I don't think it's that different because we really want very high protection,

756
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,870
even for your standard patient, non-cancer, non immune compromised patient.

757
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,790
So it didn't make a lot of sense to me.

758
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:49,989
But there are and in fact in our professional organization has a kind of toolkit for construction and they have our highest risk category.

759
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:56,550
So it just adds another. So they have class 1 to 5 in their risk.

760
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,280
So it's just another layer. We just yeah.

761
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:06,309
So it's unique to us, but I think there are other places that are very similar and not none of them are very different.

762
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:14,740
And I actually just had a discussion with a contractor who works at lots of hospitals and they were asked, Do you have to do this everywhere else?

763
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:23,110
And they're like, Yeah, that's a good thing that the joint commission is that you're following your own policy.

764
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:32,469
Yeah, absolutely. They will hold us to our own policies and we have been cited for not having the across signed at the

765
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:40,720
construction site is kind of minor but and the but they're also not technically following the script perfectly.

766
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,890
So we had a place that said if they didn't have an interim,

767
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:51,760
it's it's in our policy that they have to use a HEPA filter just outside the door to clean the air for when the door opens.

768
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:56,770
They didn't have that HEPA filter there, so we got cited for that.

769
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,940
And so we've really implemented since that was like four years ago.

770
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,550
We are three and a half.

771
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:12,700
We implemented construction rounding a lot more strictly since then to make sure people are really doing what we think they're doing.

772
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:19,150
And we just started it back up. We went on hiatus during COVID and we just started it back up like last week.

773
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,570
Not that we weren't rounding and looking, but a very formal every construction site.

774
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,540
We're going to go and check it out once a week at least.

775
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:36,100
And then we went we're going with our construction people who are in charge of the contractors.

776
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:41,290
Who are the crawlers of the contractors. Okay, let's do one more across.

777
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:44,410
I see. I don't I think it's almost like a room in radiology.

778
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:49,900
I don't know if you guys remember what risk level that area is.

779
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:56,560
We'll go back to it. It does have inpatient and outpatient, but it's radiology is its own space.

780
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:05,740
We will be completely gutted. That means totally every surface removed in the space, all new equipment and facilities.

781
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:09,190
So very high amount of construction. So let's go back and look at that.

782
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:17,550
Okay. So what what construction type would that be?

783
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:23,850
The ABC sees the highest level. And then what risk level do?

784
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:31,290
I don't know if you can read it. Yeah. Medium is the reason for that is the patients aren't there a long time.

785
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:38,760
And if a patient is well enough to be transported to radiology, sometimes radiology comes to them.

786
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,110
We feel it's like kind of more like an outpatient.

787
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:50,579
But there are some areas where we will we have the flexibility within the risk assessment to make modifications.

788
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:54,569
Like if we say this is a super high risk spot of an MRI,

789
01:21:54,570 --> 01:22:03,180
it's kind of high risk because patients will go to MRI and we can up the ante level if we need to.

790
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:13,280
So let's go to that. Oops, sorry. So that's a type C and medium risk.

791
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:21,060
So that would again be class three. We have just modified a little bit and I think I made this one.

792
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:25,739
So any kind of dust generating work and we still have flexibility,

793
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:30,540
but we're just changing this one to Class four so that they have to do certain things.

794
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:38,129
But with with some exceptions, because some of the pieces in the class for work like the anteroom are really hard to do.

795
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:45,780
And for a really short duration project, it's probably more effort to build an anteroom than to just get the work done and have a barrier,

796
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:51,840
you know, a barrier, not necessarily an answer. So there's some flexibility in some decision making that has to happen.

797
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:58,950
But it it really does help us be more consistent in the contractors kind of know what to expect.

798
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:06,120
So this form this information will be put into our big contract bids so that the contractor

799
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:11,250
knows how much they're going to have to spend to build the barriers to the negative pressure,

800
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,870
all of those pieces. And that's important. That happened about ten years ago.

801
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:22,500
They started putting it right into the bid. And that was a really key thing because we get a lot less pushback.

802
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:25,900
It's in their contract. It's good.

803
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,740
Any question? Thanks for your attention.

804
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:39,890
But my question on the anti-microbial surfaces, has there been anything to show that could lead to antibiotic resistance?

805
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:45,980
No, usually. I mean, so there was a historical where they put antibiotics in it.

806
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,620
And anytime you're putting an antibiotic in, you could be selecting for antimicrobial.

807
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:57,710
Most of the things like triclosan, which has its other issues, toxicity issues,

808
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:03,160
but triclosan and was more like a chemical disinfectant, not an antibiotic.

809
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:11,660
And it's a lot harder to form resistance to a chemical agent like a disinfectant than to an antibiotic,

810
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:17,150
although it's possible over time, you know, that selection can happen.

811
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:22,600
I mean, there is resistance. There is a little yeah.

812
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:28,280
I think more of the reason was that the health effects that we took it away, that's why it was banned.

813
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:37,070
But they've come up with materials that showed skin based on shark skin and reptile skin.

814
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:42,590
Yeah, it's pretty awful not to be really rich, their physical instead of chemical,

815
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:49,040
but probably bacteria can form resistance to almost anything if given enough time.

816
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:55,700
Right. Like they the replicates of the replicates have something to eat.

817
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,490
Yeah. Mutations occurring for nucleotides, the same as they do in humans to replication.

818
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:06,589
So they're going to outcompete or evolve us probably pretty easily.

819
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:13,850
But maybe we can keep thinking of new materials, like sharkskin, like materials or and there's certain things that are hard,

820
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:23,180
like copper is a is a very hard one for bacteria to form resistance to because because of how it reacts with their heavily chemical.

821
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:28,370
You probably could explain this better. Thank you. Yeah, through there.

822
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:35,370
Like, I mean, it's a chemical thing, but it's like they're ions and but covers.

823
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:38,720
You can't use a lot of disinfectants on it. Yeah.

824
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:42,379
After Cancer Center is kind of what we wanted to put copper.

825
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,800
I mean, copper doorknobs are a thing. You probably have heard of those.

826
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:54,439
They really do filter out. They mean it's a low level germ, antiseptic ish kind of thing, but then they look terrible.

827
01:25:54,440 --> 01:26:01,340
They turn green and they're like, Yeah, it's oxidized and and so nobody likes the left of them.

828
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,840
So this is. Well, thank you so much.

829
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:22,550
Keeps you up. Why don't we take a five minute break and I have to ask you to come in.

830
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,660
Oh, yeah. Okay.

831
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:52,590
Would. Okay. I.

832
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:02,110
I don't know how it feels right now.

833
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:22,020
I live with so many other things, you know, right now.

834
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,620
You know, based upon got hit.

835
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:39,110
Oh, yeah. You know, cause, you know.

836
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:47,760
Yeah, I can. No. In relation your life.

837
01:27:47,780 --> 01:28:07,140
Yeah. I get them like well you know, they get a nice day and I like, I think I want to be, you know, even that.

838
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:21,000
Would you like to home? I mean, this is like.

840
01:28:21,030 --> 01:29:00,990
It's like, I mean, I'm like having people that me so I just like, I just wanted more people, you know, everyone wants to give, you know, also.

841
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:17,320
You know, I think they were like, oh, yes, you know.

842
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:27,450
But I was there, she said.

843
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,430
I was sort of like, Oh my God, I don't know.

844
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:42,130
I was like I was like, this is one of the first lines.

845
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:50,460
So, yeah, I know.

846
01:29:51,730 --> 01:30:04,840
And I just go, you know, they're not in the camera anymore.

847
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:17,540
I was like, this is like I was like, okay, I'll bring in the questions.

848
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:26,660
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

849
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:42,070
You know, it's better than like she's like my brother and I was like, do you think, like, around, like, you know.

850
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:57,530
Like I said. They at least.

851
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:12,820
But like the first couple times, like I did, you know, I really had no idea that,

852
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:29,730
you know, I read it and, you know, it's it's like it's really getting together.

853
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:39,500
And even like, I mean, when I was there, I was like, I hope it doesn't, you know, visit with like.

854
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:51,170
But I think that's what I take away.

855
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:57,190
Yeah. I don't. Right.

856
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:08,900
I know you are. I want to be. Like I said.

857
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah, like. Oh, you should. Yeah.

858
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:33,750
This is just like the last that I ever got.

859
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:47,600
I don't think I want. Well, you're finally part of human life, and you could.

860
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:00,210
I think that's a good idea. Shall we reconvene General Motors?

861
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:08,969
Yeah. Yeah. So it's really nice to have you here, Amanda.

862
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:13,490
And can you talk a little bit about your path to infection control?

863
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,249
And many of you maybe have heard it, but so, in fact, when I was a student here,

864
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:26,489
I was an environmental health epi sort of dual program and not entirely sure what I wanted to do.

865
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:30,479
And I didn't even know that hospital infection prevention exists and I didn't even know it existed.

866
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:37,040
So I finished the program. I was thinking, maybe I want to go to medical school or I'm not sure.

867
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:46,350
So I started just job hunting and I had interviewed for some different AP jobs, like, you know, there was an HIV epidemic, maybe a TB epi job.

868
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:51,219
And then I read a job description for it was at Sparrow Hospital for Infection Prevention.

869
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,990
And I was like, this sounds really manly. And it did say you had to be an hour.

870
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:58,050
And then I was like, Well, I don't know, apply anyway, what the heck? So I did.

871
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,040
And in fact, the person who hired me had gotten her master's here she was in her speech.

872
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,310
She had gotten her master's in public health here. And so she took a chance on me and hired me.

873
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:10,110
And I loved it. And I was like, this is exactly what I was meant to do.

874
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:15,030
And so I started infection prevention and I was there for about seven years, I think.

875
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:18,929
And then I came here and have been here since the end of 2012.

876
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:23,190
I think so. Somedays I feel like I'm not a surgeon.

877
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:27,460
I do really like it. There's a lot of things that are challenging, but I,

878
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:33,629
I think one of my favorite things about infection prevention is that you learn something every day, like you'll never know everything.

879
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:37,320
Something you never anticipated will come up every single day and you have to figure it out.

880
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:44,519
And I do think that my environmental health background has really helped me from like a risk assessment exposure assessment site.

881
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,809
So those kinds of classes I found really helpful in how I think through problems.

882
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:55,050
So today I'm going to talk to you about evaluating the cleanliness of the environment.

883
01:34:55,430 --> 01:35:01,649
And for those of you who have heard me talk in the past about anything related to cleaning, you know, it's something I'm very passionate about.

884
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:05,610
And I have long covered environmental services and support areas.

885
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:14,250
So it's definitely one of my always projects and this is a huge challenge and I'll talk to you about why because,

886
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:17,460
you know, there's not a lot of guidance out there on this.

887
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,719
And the guidance that is out there is pretty old. Right.

888
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,890
So you have to click this one. Yeah.

889
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:32,159
Okay. All right. So obviously we see a ton of sick people and a ton of compromised people in the hospital.

890
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:39,240
And every room and every piece of equipment needs to be properly cleaned between patients to avoid spreading germs.

891
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:46,830
And so as an infection prevention, as you'll be determining what products should we be using, who's cleaning it and how is it cleaned?

892
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:52,830
And I will also say that it's really a challenge because because you you have policies and procedures,

893
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:57,149
but a key piece is making sure they're actually happening, because I think that we'll talk about this.

894
01:35:57,150 --> 01:36:03,120
But for some equipment, it is difficult to have a reliable process for cleaning it.

895
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:11,249
So when you are looking at how to clean and what to clean with, you always need to look at what are you cleaning?

896
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:15,659
So is it something in the environment or a piece of equipment? What are you trying to kill?

897
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,290
What are you most worried about or what's the hardest thing to kill that you're worried about?

898
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,310
And then what? Disinfectants are usable for that?

899
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:30,020
So I think we've had introductory talks about the Spaulding classification.

900
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:37,610
But just a reminder, it classifies three levels of risk critical, semi critical and non critical.

901
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:44,090
And that depends on how the the object is going to be used and what it's going to have contact with with the body.

902
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,180
And then as a result of that,

903
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:54,259
it basically says that you either need to sterilize high level disinfect or we say low level and low to intermediate level,

904
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:58,190
depending on what you're trying to kill disinfect. So this is what we use in infection prevention.

905
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:05,210
And it was first described in a hip pet guideline in the sixties and it's been updated since then and part of the cleaning protocol.

906
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:15,980
So just a reminder, sterilization does destroy all forms of microbial life, including spores.

907
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:26,900
And then high level disinfection kills most microorganisms, except for small numbers of bacterial spores, and then the intermediate level will kill.

908
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:32,809
It's interesting because we often use TB or MYCOBACTERIAL as a marker for how well something kills.

909
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:38,480
And it's funny because TB is never spread by surfaces, so that really doesn't matter, but it's hardy.

910
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:47,360
And so if you can kill TB, you're an intermediate level disinfectant and there are vegetated bacteria is typically really easy to kill,

911
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:54,260
but there are viruses that are harder to kill, so the intermediate level often will kill many viruses as well.

912
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:58,850
You sometimes have issues with non envelope viruses and you need sort of different levels for that.

913
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:03,770
And then low level would be your vegetative bacteria, some fungi and some viruses, but not all.

914
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:07,969
So just being aware of what the kill claims are on the product you're going to

915
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:11,780
use and what you're worried about is kind of how you go about selecting things.

916
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:20,719
So for disinfectants, first, consider what you're cleaning, and if you're cleaning the environment,

917
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:26,000
you might imagine that you probably don't want to use disinfecting wipes because you have to use a whole container trying to clean the whole room.

918
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:30,380
That's not right for the environment and it's just difficult in general.

919
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,900
But if you are cleaning a piece of equipment,

920
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:40,670
you probably do want to have something real easy for the end user to use that they can just pull up and wipe with the materials.

921
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:46,040
Really important. I think that we're building the new pavilion right now and we've built, you know,

922
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:50,989
obviously various buildings, but getting involved in the design and what surfaces are going to be used.

923
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:57,469
We talked about the copper, antimicrobial surfaces, upholstery, the chairs that the patients sit in.

924
01:38:57,470 --> 01:39:01,040
We want to be comfortable, but they need to be cleanable and same thing for visitors.

925
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:08,840
Waiting rooms often will have fabric on the seat and then, you know, they things do happen.

926
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,700
Whatever you think won't happen will happen. And then you have to figure out, is this the salvageable chair or not?

927
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:23,239
So anything that you can clean is helpful. Also, be thinking about what you typically use to disinfect because like if you're using bleach,

928
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,809
it really does, you know, color and things like that and so does a lot of alcohol wipes.

929
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:34,940
So just making sure that your material can hold up. I've had our design people give us a roll of the upholstery and we just hit it with everything,

930
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:40,579
you know, and just try to figure out, you know, what will be the hardiest that might last the longest.

931
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:44,780
And I know that I think we recently replaced most things in the children's hospital because the

932
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:49,100
upholstery that was used in a lot of that discolored colored with the with the wiping over time,

933
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:57,530
how you're going to put it on a surface. So the floors are typically done with maps, sometimes microfiber maps.

934
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:04,819
You can use rags for cleaning or microfiber. There's kind of pros and cons to both and then disposable wipes.

935
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:09,860
Of course, we talked about making sure you're thinking about what you want to kill.

936
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:15,769
The kill time or the contact time or the dwell time is really important, too.

937
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:21,319
And if you pick something that has a ten minute kill time and it doesn't stay wet for 10 minutes,

938
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:25,040
then it's probably not going to be an effective way to to clean your environment.

939
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:33,319
Ready to use versus mixing is important to me and so if you're mixing something you need some type of

940
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:38,479
quality control for you know is it are you actually cleaning with what you think you're cleaning with?

941
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:45,830
And I will say that when I started working here, we had some seed issues in our bone marrow transplant unit and I covered environmental services.

942
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:53,360
So I did some shadowing with the person who was cleaning and I can smell things from like a mile away.

943
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:59,630
I have a very keen sense of smell and we did our set of cleans with diluted bleach in those days.

944
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:03,350
And so I was in the room with the person. They did their cleaning.

945
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:11,330
It was somebody who didn't usually clean in the bone marrow transplant unit and did things out of order for my like infection prevention brain anyway.

946
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:18,350
But I could not smell the cleaner. So I thought, gosh, they must not be using bleach, they must be using the cloth that we used to use back then.

947
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:22,609
And so when she got all done, I said, Hey, what are we cleaning this with?

948
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:28,440
And she said, Oh, it's C to serve. And I'm thinking, I can't believe there's no way this is strong enough.

949
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:31,139
And back in those days, we were mixing the bleach.

950
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:37,320
So they had like a bottles of bleach with like measuring things in an environmental services work room,

951
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:44,190
and they would mix up the buckets and head out. And they weren't doing any test strips at that time to determine that it was the proper dilution.

952
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:47,670
And so we actually, instead of instituting the strips,

953
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:53,190
we just decided we're going to bleach with bleach wipes and we switched over to bleach wipes when we were doing bleaching.

954
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:59,159
So that is one area if you that we aren't actually using mixing bleach anymore.

955
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:06,780
In almost any case. Now our current disinfectant is a it's called oxy side.

956
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:10,019
It's a peroxide kind of acetic acid.

957
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:17,190
So like a vinegar peroxide concoction, it's spore aside, which is really nice, but it smells like vinegar, which not everybody loves.

958
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:20,700
And we certainly get feedback about that every probably six months.

959
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:30,029
It kind of rears its ugly head. It has a dispenser that you just it's hooked up to the water and you just put your bottle in and push it.

960
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:35,099
But it has like this little red flag that comes up when the concentrate is gone.

961
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:40,649
You have to pull the concentrate out and put a new bottle in. And the problem for me is that it doesn't automatically stop.

962
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:45,570
So you actually if you weren't paying attention, you could fill your bottle with water and go and clean with it.

963
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:53,310
So we do have some testing methods in place to try to make sure that what people think they're cleaning with, they actually are cleaning with.

964
01:42:54,930 --> 01:43:03,060
Well, and then the manufacturer's instructions for the disinfectant will tell you how long it needs to remain wet.

965
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:10,469
And I think the other key piece about cleaning that people often miss is that you can't disinfect crud, if you will.

966
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:14,760
So if there's anything visible on a surface that needs to be cleaned first and then the surface

967
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:20,130
needs to be hit with the disinfectant and allowed to remain wet for that period of time.

968
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:27,050
So these are just examples of many of the wipes out there.

969
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:33,140
I believe we had all these in-house at some point or another, maybe even all at once here until we did some standardization.

970
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:39,500
But there are quaternary. Quaternary ammonia is often used, especially with alcohol.

971
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:46,270
So that has a quicker kill time. Often when you when you pair it with alcohol, bleach just typically around 10% bleach.

972
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:51,320
That's hydrogen peroxide. I would say those are the big ticket items.

973
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:58,640
But there's new wipes coming out every day and they all have a slightly different chemistries and things like that.

974
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:05,480
So why not just pick one product and use it for everything? That is the goal.

975
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:08,690
That is the dream. But there's a couple of issues.

976
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:17,710
There's tradeoffs for every product you use. So our workhorse wipe here is a peroxide wipe, and it kills just about everything in one minute.

977
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:24,380
So that's why we use it for almost everything, because it's quick and it's not very toxic and it kills almost everything, but it's not spores.

978
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:30,020
So that's our workhorse wipe. But when we need a spot, a side of the way, we use a bleach weight that has a three minute kill time.

979
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,179
So in it is more destructive.

980
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,979
So that's why we don't use that for everything is a longer kill time and it's a lot more destructive and probably a little more toxic as well.

981
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:43,969
So paired with that are what are you allowed to use on surfaces and equipment?

982
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:50,360
And and many of you have heard me go on rants about manufacturer's instructions for use and all every

983
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:54,650
single piece of equipment that you have in the hospital will have a manufacturer's instructions for use,

984
01:44:54,980 --> 01:45:01,520
and it should tell you how to properly clean and disinfect it. But you'll find that many times it'll be really limited.

985
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:07,669
It will be old, it will be antiquated, it won't have newer products on it, and sometimes it won't even tell you how you can disinfect.

986
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:15,890
It will tell you to wash with a mild detergent. So you can't do that in health care, but you get put into kind of a regulatory pickle, if you will,

987
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:21,709
because the joint commission expects you to follow the manufacturer's instructions for use in if you're at odds

988
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:27,140
with it as an IP because it doesn't follow the Spalding classification or it doesn't include a wipe that you want,

989
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:33,290
then it's problematic. So that's kind of you kind of had to find the balance of that for your institution.

990
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:43,610
I will say the odor is is significant. When we moved to the oxy side, we called it the new smell of clean, which was vinegar.

991
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:47,330
And people the people who hate it, really hate it.

992
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:50,209
So I don't mind vinegar. I'll clean with it in my house.

993
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:54,950
It's a, you know, but people who don't like it don't like it and they don't think it smells clean and they think it smells like urine.

994
01:45:55,310 --> 01:46:02,030
And there was also a lot of scuttle about whether or not the Pyrex acetic acid,

995
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:06,979
that's the byproduct of the to the peroxide and the acetic acid whether of that was toxic.

996
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:15,620
So we did tons of air quality sampling and stuff like that. And we just you just really have to manage people's sensitivity to the odor.

997
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:22,970
So there's various masks that we offer and they get evaluated by occupational health or safety management and we'll wear those masks.

998
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:31,429
Residue is key. Having a residue means you have to do another step, and you can't wear the residue off until the kill time has been completed.

999
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:35,329
And you can imagine with how busy things are that that's not typically a feasible thing.

1000
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:39,380
So trying not to have a residue, that's another negative of bleach.

1001
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:46,040
Sometimes peroxides can leave residues. I would say that the oxy side isn't terrible or the acts of the air.

1002
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:46,670
That's our wipe.

1003
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:55,640
We talked about the surfaces being able to be cleaned and disinfected any time you have a lot of crevices and things, that's problematic.

1004
01:46:56,030 --> 01:47:01,459
One of the things that recently came to me was they want to roll out iPads for patient use,

1005
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:06,320
which is lovely, but the cases they wanted are nice and they stand up on the desk.

1006
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,899
But Getty making sure that those stay clean is tough.

1007
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:14,900
So we're kind of piloting that now and having some extra sort of testing done at intervals to see if we're

1008
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:18,950
actually getting them as clean as we want them because they're actually at the bedside with people.

1009
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:28,759
So that's something that that concerns me. So getting involved with not just product selection, but equipment selection is important too.

1010
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:33,979
And Kristen, who was just here, we just had a discussion this week because our sleep lab sent her something that

1011
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:38,570
they want to buy and we do not like the if you go and once you buy something,

1012
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:42,709
then you're stuck with it. And so we continue to say no, we should we should find something else.

1013
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:49,340
But it's definitely a battle and that's one that you certainly don't always win for C difficile.

1014
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:59,479
So that's our most significant spore forming organism that we see and we have a response plan for it and it includes the patients who

1015
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:07,340
have C typically are in contact precautions D or diarrheal and there's specific handwashing with soap and water upon exit requirements,

1016
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:11,690
the bleach wiping of equipment. And we actually do use that AC side as a spray side.

1017
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:17,630
We use that for daily and discharge cleaning across the board, which actually did impact our teeth levels at the time.

1018
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:22,270
And then the last thing that we do is we hit the room with a with a fall.

1019
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:29,540
We do a peroxide machine to sort of fog the room after terminal cleaning to get anywhere that may have been missed,

1020
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:35,450
which is a significant operational ask because it usually makes these rooms stay down for at least 90 minutes,

1021
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:39,499
which when we're, you know, boarding 50 people in the emergency department is really significant.

1022
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:45,160
But we really it really was prioritized by our hospital leadership that we do not want to see the personnel.

1023
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:49,640
So it was something that we all agreed that we were going to go in to strive to do.

1024
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,200
I talked about our current disinfectant. This is that dispenser.

1025
01:48:54,470 --> 01:49:00,760
So like the little flag I think comes out here or something like that, but it doesn't stop working.

1026
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:05,150
So I've given lots of feedback, but they they haven't changed anything.

1027
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:08,720
And we, we are always looking for a new and better disinfectant.

1028
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:16,729
But finding a spot aside with a good dwell time that doesn't leave a residue is challenging.

1029
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:22,280
So we've kind of looked at there's some now more chlorine options, like the tablets,

1030
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:27,349
more like a swimming pool, but they still leave a bit of a residue. So it's kind of a tricky, tricky one.

1031
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,880
So we still are stuck with exercise.

1032
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:38,569
So in patient rooms we want to focus on high touch surfaces, especially in this kind of gives you an idea of all those high touch surfaces.

1033
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:42,379
And this is like a pristine room. This is this would be glorious.

1034
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:46,790
So this is what Eaves came into. But when a patient's in there, there is stuff everywhere.

1035
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:52,190
And so getting the room clean is really challenging. The patient's sick, they have a bunch of stuff around them.

1036
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:58,700
And I think the things that I worry the most about are the bedside table and the handrails in the hallway.

1037
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:00,620
And those are all right around the patient,

1038
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:06,080
which makes the environmental services person often very uncomfortable to get right up into the patient's area,

1039
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:10,250
you know, when they're that sick, especially if they're ventilated and things like that.

1040
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:15,409
So that's that's something that we work on just to show the importance of that and

1041
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:19,940
empower people to do that and also work with them and the nursing colleagues too,

1042
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:25,790
because the other things that need to be cleaned at the bedside are like IV pumps and things like that that people are constantly touching.

1043
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:28,249
But environmental services is not going to clean those because they don't want to

1044
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:31,790
accidentally push a button that may deliver something that they shouldn't do.

1045
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:35,450
So sort of making sure that there's a partnership there is very important.

1046
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:44,780
So I'm trying to re-institute this now. So I think probably people everywhere there's like a staffing crisis.

1047
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:50,689
But in environmental services, it's, it's extreme. And we really have a lot of open positions.

1048
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:56,360
And so people are getting rotated around and pulled from areas that they don't necessarily always clean.

1049
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,690
And so in the past, we had this this checklist.

1050
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:01,610
It was a laminated checklist and all the cards.

1051
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:09,200
And we had one for each hospital, for the children's hospital, the cardiac hospital and the adult hospital, general care room, an ICU room.

1052
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:13,310
And it gave all the sites so that people who weren't familiar would know.

1053
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:17,899
Okay, I did clean all the sites I was supposed to clean. So we're working on resurrecting this.

1054
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:24,170
Given the current staffing, it's something that kind of went away and I really think there's value to this checklist kind of thing.

1055
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:28,490
And I experienced it when I shadowed the person who wasn't used to cleaning the bone marrow transplant unit,

1056
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:31,850
and she cleaned the bathroom first and we went to clean the bathroom last because

1057
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:34,909
it's super dirty and we don't want bathroom germs getting back to the patient.

1058
01:51:34,910 --> 01:51:41,360
So things like that are initiatives among infection prevention and environmental services.

1059
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:49,730
So evaluating room cleanliness there in and this is in the references at the end, CDC does have a document.

1060
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:59,000
I find it not very helpful. It talks about two types of programs and largely focuses on fluorescence or ATP, which we're going to talk about.

1061
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:03,710
But it hasn't been updated in a really long time, and I believe a lot has changed since then.

1062
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:08,230
So fluorescent markers can be really useful.

1063
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:12,560
You mark high touch surfaces and then you can check it with the black light after cleaning.

1064
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:18,530
So some of the concerns with that are you have to make sure the stuff that

1065
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:21,649
you're using and putting on a surface actually can be cleaned off that surface,

1066
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:28,670
that was one issue we ran into where the stuff didn't actually come off easily.

1067
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:33,860
So it had been scrubbed and everything, but it actually still looked like it was dirty.

1068
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:42,139
So that's one issue. The other thing is that that's got to come from somebody's got to put it on there without the person cleaning,

1069
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:46,850
knowing for it to actually, you know, get a good sense of what's happening there.

1070
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:50,720
So that piece is typically an environmental service supervisor,

1071
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:58,580
but then it's a little bit of a conflict because if the room isn't cleaned properly, the environmental services supervisor is on the hook, too.

1072
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:05,450
So there's this is a little bit of a conflict there that, you know, it's better to avoid those types of things, if you can.

1073
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:12,440
Sorry that a low blood sugar with the kiddo just going to have a juice box given and then I'll keep going.

1074
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:20,549
Okay. And then the data entry piece, too, because those are often not automated.

1075
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:27,720
So then it's another thing. So if somebody is kind of writing everything down, then it's got to go somewhere, put on a dashboard and shared.

1076
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:35,070
And so if it's not a manual or it's not an automatic process and it's a manual process, then there's often that often gets lost.

1077
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:38,370
You know, I do that all round and write things down and think I'm going to enter them.

1078
01:53:38,370 --> 01:53:41,820
And then I find it on my desk a month later and it's no longer helpful.

1079
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:46,610
So that's one thing. Now there are new programs now that are much better.

1080
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:52,589
And this this is one of them. The Ecolab has one of them, I think it's called the diesel thing.

1081
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:56,669
But they have little individual packets that you dot the surface with.

1082
01:53:56,670 --> 01:54:02,069
They make a nice little that they have the black lights and they actually have like a data entry program as you go.

1083
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:08,070
So I think that they do that on the iPads as they go. And we're actually working to institute this.

1084
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:12,300
We haven't we haven't done this in the past. We actually had done the ATP more in the past.

1085
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:22,530
And the ATP is the one that we're actually going to do a demo with today. And so with that, you swab the surface in a standard way.

1086
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:28,070
So we usually would have like a template or instructions on how big of an area, you know,

1087
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:38,189
you want to swab because I'm doing it and I swab a little square and then I'm compared to somebody who swab this much,

1088
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:41,250
they're going to have a lot more bacteria in their sample size.

1089
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:45,840
So I think that that's the key piece as well.

1090
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:53,970
It basically you put the swab into the reader and it gives you a reading called a relative light unit.

1091
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:59,669
And you basically there's not a real standard around what's acceptable and what's not.

1092
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:06,280
So you kind of have to do some testing in your in your facility and decide on baseline

1093
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,609
and what you're going to consider clean and what you're going to consider dirty.

1094
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:16,830
And so we typically have been in like the 250 range and below being clean and anything about that being dirty.

1095
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:28,860
When we did this, we would typically swab five different sites in the room and then if any hits were beyond the acceptable level, they would re clean.

1096
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:32,370
And if they had multiple positives, I think they re cleans the room.

1097
01:55:33,870 --> 01:55:37,829
Downside to this is it captures both viable and not viable bacteria.

1098
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:44,400
It's just the ATP, so it can be dead stuff. So the mechanical scrubbing is always important.

1099
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:50,760
But if that wasn't done well, but the organisms are still dead, they'll still read as positive on this.

1100
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:55,770
And the the cut offs are kind of made up. So you just have to know what you're dealing with.

1101
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:58,739
And this is the kind of data that you really need,

1102
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:03,750
somebody who knows what they're talking about to explain it to people or it can look bad really easily.

1103
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:12,239
The nice thing about these things, though, is that the data management software is included.

1104
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:18,149
So after you do your swabbing, you just take it with the computer and, you know, populates your spreadsheets and dashboards and things like that.

1105
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:21,629
So that's a little bit better and there's a lot more multiple companies that have these.

1106
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:30,750
So that's something that we've used in the past that we're kind of moving away from, largely because with some of our chemicals there seems to be.

1107
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:36,000
Thank you so much. The swabs have arrived. So I guess all my stuff up last night, but not the swab.

1108
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,629
So swabs are here so we can do the demo again. But what we found is that with some of our class of chemicals,

1109
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:46,980
we were having some interference and we did a lot of testing and it just didn't really

1110
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:50,160
seem to add up and it really didn't seem to be telling us what we wanted to know.

1111
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:56,580
So we kind of moved away from that and are going to restart with fluorescent markers and a couple of other things that I'll talk about.

1112
01:56:56,940 --> 01:57:08,190
There's also some newer options. I have not really used the micro stamp, but it gives you results in 8 hours and it's organism specific.

1113
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:12,719
So they make like a micro snap, I don't know, and rollback. They make like a couple of different organisms.

1114
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:19,620
You have to kind of pick your organism and be able to look for it in the environment.

1115
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:22,739
So you can imagine that that also be trying to be that specific.

1116
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:26,150
So it's like would you then just do like a CRC room after cleaning, you know,

1117
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:30,840
because you hopefully you wouldn't find that in great abundance in most environments.

1118
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:37,790
Banana breath we did do kind of a study with and it was kind of cool that is something that you go it's

1119
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:44,490
specific to cedar and you swab the room and you incubate it and if it's negative after 72 hours or no seed,

1120
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:48,899
even if it turns yellow any time in that period, then there is c diff.

1121
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:51,030
So that was that one's pretty interesting too.

1122
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:58,260
So when you think about the first two options, the fluorescent and the ATP, they give you real time results.

1123
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:01,560
So if I'm in there cleaning the room and it's not clean, it can be re cleaned.

1124
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:07,140
These don't give you results for hours to days. So as you can imagine, the room is going to be occupied for that.

1125
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:12,300
So you just have to know what does that mean and what are you going to do about it if you find out about this after the fact?

1126
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:18,200
Next patient doesn't get infected 100% and they're already there.

1127
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,430
So there's really nothing you can do about it at that point, right? Yeah.

1128
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:30,140
Yeah. So. Exactly, exactly. So this is newer and this is actually we're working with a startup company right now,

1129
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,150
and I'm actually doing environmental cultures to assess the cleanliness of the environment.

1130
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:41,000
And so they come in and we've picked some units and they do certain surfaces in the units,

1131
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,850
and then they provide us this dashboard and it they upload the floor plan, which is kind of cool.

1132
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:51,140
And then there's like a heat map that you can see and then there'll be a listing of each site,

1133
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:54,889
how many colony forming units and what through there, which has been really interesting.

1134
01:58:54,890 --> 01:59:03,110
And so we've done this on a few units and we're sort of trying to pair this with the fluorescent testing to sort of build the program.

1135
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:08,959
And my Pie in the sky plan had been to whole genome sequences with certain

1136
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:13,910
patient organisms to the company we're working with that is on kind of a pause,

1137
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:18,410
so maybe a future project. But it has been actually really interesting.

1138
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:23,840
What we're finding for the most part I think reinforces hand hygiene more than anything else.

1139
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,870
Like for the most part, we're seeing just like small levels of skin organisms on things or sometimes higher levels that appear to

1140
01:59:29,870 --> 01:59:35,020
just be areas that people probably touch a lot after they're clean and before the next patient number,

1141
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:41,000
like the stock carts and stuff like that. So getting feedback around that to the staff is one of the action items.

1142
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:49,700
But we also had been investigating some bacillus serious cases in a neonatal population and so

1143
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:57,409
we did do some environmental cultures in one of the neonatal areas where we resuscitate them.

1144
01:59:57,410 --> 02:00:00,650
And we did have hits on bacillus series that we were not expecting.

1145
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:06,110
And it has led us into a big laundry investigation. And so we're looking at laundry in the literature.

1146
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:11,870
Bacillus in health care is is often related to laundry issues.

1147
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,770
And so looking at where your laundry can be contaminated,

1148
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:23,870
there's many spots along the way from where it gets cleaned and packaged and delivered and sorted and sent to units and stored on unit.

1149
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:31,310
So we're working through that now, but I don't think we would have gotten down the same pathway had we not been doing this level of environmental

1150
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:37,460
culturing because it really we really found like this is unexpected and this is not what we're seeing in other spots.

1151
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:38,810
So what's going on here?

1152
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:47,990
So still under investigation now, but it was an added bonus of this and we were able to have this company then go and do the cultures,

1153
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:53,420
the same methodology and all the spots that we want to do for laundry, which has been really helpful as well.

1154
02:00:57,070 --> 02:01:01,270
So then I'll evaluate the cleanliness of room cleaning.

1155
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:06,700
Robbing equipment is a whole nother animal, and it's often unit based and it moves around the unit.

1156
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:12,790
There's not a clear owner. It gets used and hopefully cleaned by whoever used it.

1157
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:18,969
And it should be cleaned after every patient use for for almost anything.

1158
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:23,140
Anything that has contact with the patient should be cleaned after after use before the next use.

1159
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:29,049
So kind of the challenges is everyone thinks that somebody else is cleaning it and you

1160
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:33,430
can't really tell when something is truly clean or ready for patient use in an easy way.

1161
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:40,659
So you can imagine that if I use an ultrasound machine on a patient and I clean it and I park it where it goes,

1162
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:46,569
the next person who comes 3 hours later isn't going to know that I cleaned it or you know, that it's clean.

1163
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:49,720
The hope there is probably assuming it is, but you don't really know.

1164
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:53,890
Somebody could have used it in part to their thinking. Somebody else would clean it.

1165
02:01:54,610 --> 02:01:59,320
So we did a couple of different pilots with with our units.

1166
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:03,519
One was a tagging system where we had like a tag that got flipped about cleaner dirty.

1167
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:07,179
So once you cleaned it, you flipped it. It wasn't super effective.

1168
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:16,479
And so we actually landed on which is more was was less was less opposed than I thought it would be, as clean before, clean after.

1169
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:22,660
And so basically when you pull something out of it's spot, you just assumed the person before,

1170
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:25,210
you didn't clean it and you clean it and take it and you use it,

1171
02:02:25,450 --> 02:02:30,009
but you do clean it on your way out just of all the standard precautions and not sort of bring anything out into the hallway.

1172
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:35,979
So we cleaned before clean after on the inpatient side for all of our equipment that doesn't come tagged.

1173
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:41,770
And it gets tricky because if it's unit based equipment, the unit staff that use it,

1174
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:46,390
clean it before and after some equipment comes from our patient equipment department.

1175
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:50,170
And when that comes, it actually comes like wrapped up with a clean ready for use sticker.

1176
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:54,219
So that's a little bit easier and you can just rip that off, use it and then put it away when you're done.

1177
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:59,740
So it's not perfect, but I think things are a lot better than they have been.

1178
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:06,850
So we have specific equipment and cleaning instructions before and after use with both wipes

1179
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:12,040
just to have like a quick and easy guide that can be laminated and put at the site if needed.

1180
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:19,239
We obviously have lots of policies and procedures for that as well. One thing that if you if you do go into IP,

1181
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:25,930
one hot button piece of equipment that I think kind of gives you the temperature of your facility is the glucometer.

1182
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:33,040
And the glucometer is used to check blood sugar. And there have been a variety of documented hepatitis outbreaks over the last decade,

1183
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:39,129
and it's really associated with not following basic infection prevention procedures.

1184
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:44,320
And it's really cleaning this after each users, you know, sometimes blood droplets, etc.

1185
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:52,389
So with this, if you are an IP in a facility, my recommendation, recommendation whenever you around is to look at who parameters.

1186
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:55,120
And if you ever see blood on glucometer, you've got a problem.

1187
02:03:55,180 --> 02:04:00,400
So it's just a quick kind of a quick and dirty way to assess what's happening on the unit level.

1188
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:07,780
And glucometer is here are used in the ICU and a patient the whole time they're here.

1189
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:11,469
And so they maybe wouldn't be cleaned between on every use,

1190
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:16,780
but they'd be cleaned at discharge and then on the other units they are brought in and out.

1191
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:23,079
So they have like a docking station with the cleaning wipes and all that and they're cleaned and then, you know, brought back out there.

1192
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:27,070
So they should be following clean before a clean after for the glucometer.

1193
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:34,570
These are really dirty workstations on wheels or computers on wheels.

1194
02:04:34,950 --> 02:04:41,760
So I think what I used to cover the medical ICU, and so I would go swab things in there.

1195
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:47,850
And so I think the highest reading I ever got on and something I don't remember what it was, but it was one of these wows.

1196
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:54,090
And so I always would share that with the residents whenever I did their education sessions in the morning.

1197
02:04:54,780 --> 02:05:00,690
The good news is you shouldn't ever be touching this and then touching a patient without washing your hands.

1198
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:03,600
The bad news is that's probably not 100% compliance.

1199
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:11,009
I also took the fluorescent markers and marked up a keyboard of one of these and checked it every couple of days.

1200
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:16,620
And it was the marks were undisturbed for at least a week, so they were not regularly clean.

1201
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:20,999
So having the wipes and those, you know, providing that education and frankly,

1202
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,350
really making sure that people are aware that if they touch that they need to wash their hands before they touch.

1203
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:31,169
The patient are important. We have cleaning protocols, like I said,

1204
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:38,190
for everything and are kind of in the process of updating all of these and putting them into our new policy system right now.

1205
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:44,940
But it outlines the frequency of cleaning, who's supposed to do it, what products you can use, and that kind of stuff.

1206
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:49,799
And so our rubric is those manufacturer's instructions for use and tries to make sure

1207
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:53,070
everything's aligned or at least do a risk assessment and why it's not aligned.

1208
02:05:53,520 --> 02:06:02,549
When we when we roll these out exam rooms and clinics are another challenge because they're high room turnover.

1209
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:07,230
So they have to disinfect those surfaces really frequently and it can destroy the surfaces.

1210
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:08,460
Think about those tables.

1211
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:15,900
The other really bad thing, in my opinion, about exam rooms are those tables get rips and once something has a rip, you can't clean it.

1212
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:20,969
And so paying attention to that stuff and getting it fixed or replaced is important.

1213
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:24,780
We actually got cited at our last joint commission visit in our eye clinic.

1214
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:30,839
We had a couple of chairs that had little rips and so minor, but still something that's important.

1215
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:40,250
And then going back to that bacillus investigation, one of the places we kept growing, not just bacillus but other things, was a worn out keypad.

1216
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:48,570
And the equipment storage, they had like a nest cart where they keep different supplies and there's a little code keypad and it was really worn out.

1217
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:53,639
And you can tell if the surface isn't intact, you can effectively clean it.

1218
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:58,440
So we're working on getting all those replaced, but just little, little things like that that don't seem like a big deal,

1219
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:04,470
really are a nice place for microbes to hide and hard to eradicate them from.

1220
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:11,280
So with the high room turnovers is important. They also usually use what I call an alcohol for vitals.

1221
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:17,700
So when you come into the clinic, there's like a little alcove area where they do your blood pressure, where you know, all that kind of stuff.

1222
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:25,679
And so what typically happens is they do that and then they wash everything before they take you to the next the next room.

1223
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:31,070
And then after you leave the room, they wipe the high touch surfaces, you hope.

1224
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:37,200
Exactly. I will say I'm a consumer of health care here, and I don't know what happens in the room after I've left.

1225
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:40,079
But every time I've been in the alcove or had a kid in the alcove,

1226
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:44,490
they they scrub everything down while we're watching and they say, I like that when they do it.

1227
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:50,819
Yes, yes. From a technology standpoint, I talked about what we use.

1228
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:53,850
We use these well, actually, this was the bioequivalent.

1229
02:07:53,850 --> 02:07:57,480
I think our new one is Halo. I don't know if it's up here.

1230
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,779
We so there's a couple of different peroxide machines.

1231
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:10,230
The bio pill is what we initially bought and we actually got that during the 2014 Ebola outbreak as part of our plan to disinfect a room.

1232
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:16,620
And then we used it for C difficile. But what happened with this and the old hospital where I and I think because lots of layers of

1233
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:22,680
paint is it bubbled the paint so so we got it looked like it looked like a pox on the walls.

1234
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:26,280
So we had to get rid of that and that's retired.

1235
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:33,480
And then we found another one called Halo that doesn't appear to be disrupting the paint and that's what we use for our CDF.

1236
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:43,800
Now I will tell you that I get an email from like an executive or region pretty regularly about, Hey, are we using UAV and we don't use UAV here?

1237
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:50,040
I am not a fan of it for room disinfection and there are a ton of companies out there.

1238
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:53,519
And to be fair, I have not trialed recent machines,

1239
02:08:53,520 --> 02:09:00,960
but in the work that I did when I first got here with our UAV machines and swabbing rooms and we did lots of projects,

1240
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:08,610
it didn't really appear to be adding anything beyond the typical disinfection and probably for a lot of reasons.

1241
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:14,069
I mean, maybe they're more powerful now, but the gases can get everywhere, the UV light can't,

1242
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:19,410
and we don't sound like we have reflective paint and there's, you know, so I think those are the major limitations.

1243
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:22,559
You know, I'm used to UV and a hood.

1244
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:28,740
Perfect. It's a small enclosed space that works really well. But when you're trying to put a light in a room, it's, I think less effective.

1245
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:38,340
So it's not so. The thing that we typically use here, we do have one because we got one during the first COVID surge to use to disinfect masks.

1246
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:44,219
We use heating. We like to disinfect masks, which was really effective for the rooms.

1247
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:49,650
I haven't found it to add anything beyond while I have found that the peroxide does,

1248
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:54,540
but there was a lot of emergency management funding for UV lights during COVID.

1249
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:58,890
And so I think that I think that's really driven some of it.

1250
02:09:58,890 --> 02:10:04,590
And so I think that leaders get a lot of emails about this and so then it trickles down.

1251
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:11,219
And so you kind of need like a canned message about what you found and why, why you don't support using it and that kind of stuff.

1252
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:18,840
Because they come through the door all the time. And I just went to a conference this week and there were probably three or four UAV vendors there.

1253
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:22,709
And I try let's try to be really nice, but I'm not interested right now.

1254
02:10:22,710 --> 02:10:28,350
So then if you go into IP and then have a good experience of the U.V. light, I would love to hear it.

1255
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:37,740
Emerging pathogens. So we talked about COVID. It was a disaster during that first initial surge because nothing was available.

1256
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:41,309
You couldn't get your hands on anything. It was hand sanitizer. You couldn't get your hands on products.

1257
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:47,160
You had to just see what we had. The good thing is that COVID is not hard to kill, but other organisms are.

1258
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:57,059
And so the EPA pretty quickly usually puts out lists of the cases just like this for a side list for seed at the list is for candidate or so.

1259
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:01,410
You can look on there to see if your disinfectant is listed, if it's not on the label.

1260
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:09,149
But the tricky business is that sometimes it's not the the product name when they actually got the EPA certification isn't always the same.

1261
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:15,840
So sometimes it's a little, little tricky to figure that out. And then sometimes the kill time will be different on those two lists.

1262
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,810
So just making sure that that you are aware of what your products are capable of is important.

1263
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:32,700
So what do you do with all of this? So I think that a key piece of this is besides having the good products and the

1264
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:37,040
policies in place of actually being on the units and seeing what's actually happening.

1265
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:42,660
But any time you have a problem, if it's an outbreak like the SSI outbreak, whatever,

1266
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,980
I always think the best thing to do is go and see what's going on right now.

1267
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:50,400
Just just get your eyes on it, chat with people, see if anybody have any ideas.

1268
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:56,969
But actually seeing what people are actually doing is a is a key piece asking them

1269
02:11:56,970 --> 02:12:00,060
and they run through the policy is less helpful because they might not be doing it.

1270
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:11,830
I think that making sure that there is orientation competency, is education a backup plan to like, if you like,

1271
02:12:12,070 --> 02:12:16,440
you would be shocked about how often like it's one person's job to do X, Y, Z,

1272
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:19,749
and if they are sick, nobody knows what to do and that's not a good thing.

1273
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:25,840
So just having some backups there to the quality assurance and improvement, making sure things are clean,

1274
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:31,540
we have almost our process back in place for the room, cleaning for the equipment.

1275
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:40,479
We don't have anything as robust. And so that tends to just be part of our C difficile response plan or an increase in anything on a

1276
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:49,690
unit where we'll go to the unit and and do swabbing ourselves and looking at areas that are cleaning,

1277
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:53,830
you know, and doing this work to just assess for any, any issues.

1278
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:58,839
Definitely the product selection is key. I think that's it.

1279
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:04,569
IP week is next week. So happy early IP week. And first, if there are any questions, I'll answer them.

1280
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:07,720
And if not, we'll do the demo.

1281
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:14,180
Okay. So, all right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass around.

1282
02:13:16,590 --> 02:13:24,870
And what I'd like people to do is take two. And I want you to pick something that you're going to swab and then clean and then swab,

1283
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:34,649
and then we'll just kind of go through and it'll take a minute. So we have the one reader and the only just for our transparency.

1284
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:38,850
The only wipes I have are like the Clorox, like over the counter kind of wipes.

1285
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:44,550
And then I have our Octavia White. So if you have something else you want to clean, you can do that too.

1286
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:53,590
But don't don't do something. You don't want to use one of those lines. Yeah.

1287
02:13:55,980 --> 02:14:00,780
So we need to have one the before and one after.

1288
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:05,520
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But I do have left.

1289
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:12,420
You don't want to touch the cleaners. The SPF. Don't say that it's going to kill what the peroxide is doing.

1290
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:25,920
That and this stuff's very good.

1291
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:33,090
So. All right, so I'm going to tell you what to do so we can get going and get this bad boy fired up.

1292
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:40,260
So you're going to take this swab, pick your surface, I think.

1293
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:48,450
Now maybe do this mouth, make just make sure you're going to do the same surface each time.

1294
02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:52,890
So you're going to do kind of a four by four, almost like you're streaking a plate.

1295
02:14:55,480 --> 02:15:00,040
One way and then the other. And then when you have the reader in front of you, I think I may have a bad sign.

1296
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:06,910
You are going to punch it through. Don't do this until you're ready to put it in the reader and then shake it two times.

1297
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:12,960
And then when my thing loads up, I'll put it in and I think the side is broken because the outside was dry.

1298
02:15:12,970 --> 02:15:23,510
So that happens to you as soon as it loads you put it in and then it just gives you a little hourglass and then it will give you your reading.

1299
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:27,610
And so just write it down and clean it and then do it again.

1300
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:39,450
One of the ways I always felt uncomfortable with the baseline setting for this and that it wasn't really super valuable.

1301
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:45,540
So we did have a period of time where we did like before and after swabbing just to see like what production was acceptable.

1302
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:50,610
So that was that's another way you could do it. But it's really labor intensive. Anything that it's done.

1303
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:56,399
Yes, 100%. We consistently have 50 people waiting for that.

1304
02:15:56,400 --> 02:16:00,450
So, yeah. All right. So I don't know.

1305
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:04,169
How important is it?

1306
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:11,370
I don't know. She did a most. Oh.

1307
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:20,720
Yeah. Down into the alley.

1308
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:29,030
And then do you want to write them down so we can look at the differences across the class?

1309
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:38,570
Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll put it on the whiteboard and you can put your arms around everybody, she said.

1310
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:43,760
Don't punch it through if you can. But I mean, this is not.

1311
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:47,830
Oh, no, not officially. So you did this.

1312
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:59,910
This comes up on your network. Does this degrade with pollution at the bottom?

1313
02:16:59,930 --> 02:17:04,670
Is that right? I don't think it degrades it, but I think I think it could amplify it more.

1314
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:08,600
Oh, possibly. But you want, like, a standard reading, maybe?

1315
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:13,280
I think so. Yeah. Cause, like, that's why you do kind of, like, the same surface area and whatever.

1316
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:14,570
Like, you just kind of move it.

1317
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:27,400
So once you punched in like that little bioluminescent pathway start, you know, it's going to be one person on the beach.

1318
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:32,680
And then I thought, Oh my God, I know somebody must do this.

1319
02:17:32,690 --> 02:17:38,659
Or she'd be. We're just so happy that we're making another film.

1320
02:17:38,660 --> 02:17:42,260
But I've never had any bad luck with that.

1321
02:17:42,890 --> 02:17:55,640
Yes, but like, I know it isn't right, but I like how they were using them and just taking a bit too low, if you like.

1322
02:17:55,640 --> 02:18:02,940
I spent entire. That makes inspections like Obama's leads, right?

1323
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:06,570
You get credit almost like this never feels clean.

1324
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:14,370
It is like you don't really care what I think about nine over 11.

1325
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:20,250
I can't tell you how I think it's clean, you know, religious.

1326
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:35,990
So you just do a sampling of rooms like, oh, so we'll be like street guys, you know, like carpet, like on the same time and clean it up.

1327
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:53,800
And like I talk about culture and basically be like a president, like managers, Jesus, which is like how you know.

1328
02:18:55,130 --> 02:18:56,940
Oh, they're everywhere, right?
