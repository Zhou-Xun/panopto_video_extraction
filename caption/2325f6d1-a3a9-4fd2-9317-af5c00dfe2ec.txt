1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,500
It's going to be you anyways. Well, welcome back. Nice to see everybody.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,549
We're we're homestretch here, right? It's today. It's Thursday.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,330
It's Tuesday. And then let it. Can that be?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,720
It sounds like this is the National Day, Jim.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,970
All right. We'll see you next Thursday.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:28,080
So we have two weeks to go to wrap things up, but I'm glad that we're going to have some time to talk this week about pattern analysis and mediation.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,200
When we talk about structural equation modeling, next week,

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,760
we'll be able to link what we're doing here with some of the measurement stuff we do in week seven and the regression stuff we've

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,870
done every single week all together in a big framework that's getting more and more popular and is great for the social sciences.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,679
So we'll look out for structural equations next week, but this is going to be part of analysis and mediation today.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,830
What I'm thinking will do is I'll start with you folks.

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,350
Get those juices flowing after a long Thanksgiving break. Then I'm going to give you a conceptual example.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,700
Then we will work through an example together via R and then Thursday.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,820
Ideally, if all things go to plan, you'll have time to work on an example of your own using somebody.

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,690
Does that sound okay? That good? Wonderful.

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:23,280
Welcome, welcome. Welcome, welcome. You are just in time to find a friend and I want you to start thinking about some of the mediation.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,110
Take questions that you would want to answer. And you're also not right or wrong answers here.

18
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:36,690
But let's do try to think about one just a theoretical problem or even an operational problem that we can think about via the lens of panelists.

19
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,360
And let's think through what those different variables are going to be.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,100
We're not actually going to run the analysis here, but just from a conceptual perspective,

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,300
let's get some of this jargon out of the way so that we can talk about it as a class.

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,820
All right. So, my friend, what's your take on this? Because obviously.

23
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,469
Already fragile or sorry.

24
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:18,440
It's eight months in the United States is also in the United States.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,680
But that's not her birthday. Oh.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Oh. You know, I'm married, but, you know, I think that would be mediation, unfortunately, was not my intention back.

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,880
And the reason why I'm here,

28
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,080
I think that was a because it was a very limited surveillance and let us hope to

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,580
resolve it and sort of what I look like and might want to take the time to give her.

30
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:22,630
What you have that is, I think, is really look at the fact that they think they're focused on this.

31
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,870
Yeah, I think yes.

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:43,160
Sources. I'm going to do something that's very interesting that we can do.

33
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,290
And I think that they are losing together every year.

34
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,430
And I'm thinking like, yeah, I don't like exercise, you know.

35
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,730
Genetics. Okay.

36
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,840
And one of.

37
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:43,040
I just like. The ultimate expression is that just like Elvis you were presented with doesn't make sense.

38
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:55,620
What's your independence? I think the violence and I guess the violence leads me to do anything revolutionary was, I guess you could say.

39
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,590
I mean, it's a way of life tied in with all that counselor.

40
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,670
And, you know, everything works out like new directions here.

41
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,300
So I think, like, for me, I felt like, you know, hypothetically,

42
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,450
it sounds like the bathroom in it needs to see like mental changes or that as an escape.

43
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,880
It's just focusing on the right. Former mayor.

44
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,970
Just so you know.

45
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,340
So I that I never imagined I.

46
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:54,910
Right. You are getting ready to this.

47
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:19,560
Yeah. To do that. So we're also presented as a nation that is doing that, thinking that this is the kind of thing.

48
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,149
All right. So do you know what I'm getting at, for example, here?

49
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:38,140
And what would folks come up with if you would like to walk us through their example of a mediation question?

50
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,490
Yes, I was here. I have I am doing a lot of writing throughout their classes here.

51
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:57,730
No, I didn't. What we had proposed is that we in this proposal, proposal ten programs.

52
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,940
But if you measure these associations between library accessibility and quality

53
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:12,730
and the suicidal thoughts and behaviors and adolescents here in this library,

54
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,510
access high ability or ability.

55
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,560
Ability. All right. All right.

56
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,600
Make it still. Check whatever library accessibility and and his suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

57
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:40,850
Suicide. Okay. And as we within our conceptual model, we talk about having very psychosocial risk factors and leaders.

58
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,280
Okay. And the three main ones were perceived burdensome as targeted belongingness.

59
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,450
And then locus of control occurred in some.

60
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,930
Yes, belonging. And then what love is in conjunction with the self-control part.

61
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,870
So now you agree that the three main variables are at least a set of variables.

62
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,210
Your independent variable is at the library. All right.

63
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,140
And that's going to be in your mind related to suicide positively or negatively.

64
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:26,730
The higher or at least we're hypothesizing that there is definitely quality that lowers suicidal thoughts and mediators occurring.

65
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,170
It's a positive association. Negative association. Negative association.

66
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,470
Excellent. All right. And then our is there are these mediators coming into play.

67
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:50,460
So all through literature, we found that those three mediators are connected to suicidal ideation and attempts.

68
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,090
Right.

69
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:07,730
And one way that I think that the simpler way of thinking is that higher versions of this would lead to higher suicidal measures like that low rate.

70
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:15,000
Higher belonging would lead to lower. Yeah. And then a higher level of self would be to lower.

71
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,190
Got it. All right. So step one of the mediation analysis.

72
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,510
Now, this is a controversial step, controversial step that we do,

73
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,250
whether we assume that there's an association between our independent variable and our dependent variable.

74
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,250
Right. This was back in the 1980s. This was something that you need to start with before you ever got to ask a mediation question.

75
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,630
That assumption has now relaxed a bit, I think, in current and current thinking,

76
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,670
because the idea that you could easily have some sort of indirect relationships that are

77
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,620
explaining some of that variability might not necessitate having this kind of direct effect here.

78
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,640
But that said,

79
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:59,710
we do typically want to try to establish that there is some sort of overall or total effect of our outcome variable on our dependent variable.

80
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,820
Wonderful. Second step. It does not matter.

81
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,580
It does not matter how strongly these two things are related if these things are not related to your outcome variable.

82
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,150
Yeah. An indirect effect or mediation is not going to happen.

83
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,090
All right. We are ultimately assuming so very something very specific about this association.

84
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,260
But before we ever get into that mumbo jumbo, we got to make sure that this works.

85
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,060
So that's step two. Excellent. All right. And now the key question, the mediation question.

86
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,660
Tell me about the relationship between accessibility and these three variables.

87
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:45,880
So we're hypothesizing that essentially your living environment has either a positive or a negative association with these mediators,

88
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:54,070
and through them is how you begin to either increase or decrease those suicidal thoughts.

89
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:03,850
And through some literature, we found that these third spaces is what furniture sometimes refers to them to,

90
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:14,350
is that the quality of them and being able to access them increases these positive, positive things like blind control.

91
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:21,550
And you, I guess, feel like you want to have safety.

92
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:29,020
This is the third space. You have safety and a place to go.

93
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,440
Looking at the resources, computers and.

94
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:43,960
Just somewhere to be. That's not okay. I'm not sure if it's relevant here, but you're also looking at moderators on other cases.

95
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,080
Okay. Just to make sure that we know there there's nothing else.

96
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,500
And one of the things that's to be higher or lower.

97
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,280
And the difference between mediators and moderators for the group is what?

98
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,380
So for him, for mediators, I don't think understand it correctly at this point.

99
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,249
Mediators are more sort of the collective mechanism through which the outcome is happening,

100
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,780
or as moderators are expecting that relationship to be stronger or weaker

101
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,249
between that independent variable and then you write down if you didn't know.

102
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,740
Therefore, the answer to that question was an excellent explanation.

103
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:38,330
So when we're talking about a mediator, we are assuming our independent variable explains some of the variation in our mediating variables.

104
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,830
That's key. So in our size, definition or explanation,

105
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,879
it's that these third spaces have some sort of influence on whether or not used or whomever feel like they belong.

106
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,080
And it explains some of that belongingness which we think is in turn related to suicidal thoughts or behavior.

107
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,950
That's really important when we talk about is this really a mediation question or a moderation question,

108
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,819
contrasting that more mechanistic piece of it to something that changes the strength or

109
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,950
direction of the association between our independent variable and our dependent variable.

110
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,370
Right. So folks are getting confused. That's typically where the confusion is going to happen.

111
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,670
Usually people can identify, okay, that's my I've used my DV.

112
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,460
I know I have some third variable that's going to come into play here. Is a mediator or a moderator.

113
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,470
Well, it depends on how you think things are operating. This association does not need to exist.

114
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,780
Other spaces like, I don't know,

115
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:45,140
churches or community centers or whatever else it might be don't necessarily have to be related to your independent variable.

116
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,830
All you care about is at different levels of this third variable.

117
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,380
Do we see this association where I do see past shapes?

118
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,350
Right. That's our definition of a moderator.

119
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:06,170
Again, contrasted to when we believe our independent variable first changes something about our our intervening variable,

120
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,970
which then in turn explains some variability in our outcomes or how much or what the direction, all that.

121
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,170
That's part of our mediation analysis.

122
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,549
But that first assumption needs to be made and we are explaining some of this variability because of our independent variable,

123
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:30,260
which is why we regressed this piece of the model onto this one, ultimately when we start to actually operationalize these things.

124
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,630
Uh, which of these variables are endogenous?

125
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,149
Library accessibility. No problem.

126
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,330
Badges with arrows coming. Coming in.

127
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,970
So there's nothing coming in to it. I got see this coming out?

128
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:13,320
All right, you got it. So if endogenous endogenous is kind of predicted by something tomorrow, there's a hero coming into it.

129
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,210
Something that does not have an arrow coming through. It exaggerates kind of an external outside external influence.

130
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,990
This would be potentially a exogenous variable as well.

131
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,450
Questions about this. Does anybody else want to provide an example?

132
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,590
You may have questions. All right.

133
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,900
Well, I hope you get to talk about some funny invariance again.

134
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,290
Yes.

135
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,880
The mistake folks will often make is they'll claim something, might be a mediator, but it's really not going to be explained by library accessibility.

136
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,650
Does participants sex mediate the association between library accessibility?

137
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,650
Well, library accessibility is unlikely to be explaining variability in participant sex, right.

138
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:15,160
That's probably not going to happen. So unless you can make a case for why that's true, it's not going to be a mediating sort of relationship.

139
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,450
The problem is just if you have the data, you can always plug it into a model, but theoretically, conceptually, it needs to be there.

140
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,549
Just give you some examples here from my own work, uh, what do we do in our testing?

141
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,780
And let's see, folks, remember this one. So this is my Sandy Hook promise work.

142
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,670
In this case, we're testing the intervention, which is like a social inclusion and see something, say something sort of intervention.

143
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,339
We think that ultimately it's going to be related to reduction in violence, specifically firearm outcomes.

144
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,580
In this case. How how is it supposed to do this by first kind of changing some stuff at multiple levels?

145
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,510
But really, we're focused on what it's doing to individual students. So by assuming that if we teach you how to see something and say something,

146
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,450
you're probably better and you're going to do a better job of recognizing when someone might be a danger to themselves or others.

147
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:15,370
Increased Actions to report firearm risk. I hope this is now a screening like Help Believe Model and theory of planned behavior or whatever.

148
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:23,110
So we think by having some of these training sessions around social inclusion, around how to make a report,

149
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,649
if you're worried about something, your attitudes about it are going to change.

150
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,170
Your subjective norms about what you think other people are going to do are going

151
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:34,000
to change your self-efficacy in your intentions to report are all going to change.

152
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:42,159
So this is hopefully starting when we think about whether this is like a mediator or a moderator, you're starting to see, well,

153
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,319
what's reasonably going to be because of our intervention versus something that's external

154
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,010
to our intervention that might be changing how some of these relationships work.

155
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,510
And then we are assuming that with you like an inclusion related curriculum,

156
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,680
you're going to see more youth empowerment and better school crime and all that kind of stuff.

157
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,620
So intermediate outcomes at the individual level, we think by having a whole bunch of individuals changing,

158
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,390
we're going to see that manifested at a school level in terms of some of these outcomes here,

159
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,140
all of which are going to be related to firearm outcomes. So.

160
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:26,520
What's my primary independent variable? Hmm.

161
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,350
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's my. That's Maddie, right?

162
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I was very, very. You show now?

163
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,770
Jenny, go to the park right there.

164
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,120
Yeah. Somewhere right is going to be firearms, mental distress, whatever else it could be.

165
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,500
Yes. Lots of different images from here.

166
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:59,780
What variables here are in dodge in this? Let me try again.

167
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,530
All right. Okay.

168
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,820
Now you can do purple on me. You got the outfit?

169
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,510
Yes. And then at the school level and the outcomes.

170
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,210
Yeah. All these are indigenous. Right. Predictor by something as well.

171
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:30,200
Uh, mediation brush. And somebody give me a mediation question because what?

172
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:43,960
Mediate the association between what? Matters?

173
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:55,120
Yes. Does the receptionist see of it as the individual's perception of safety influence?

174
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:05,420
I believe in outcomes like basically saying the school climate is a mediator between a lot of the intermediate outcomes.

175
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,820
I really do not. Okay, so where is my perception of safety?

176
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,690
I'm listening. All right.

177
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:22,400
So perception of safety is going to mediate what the relationship between an individual and then they're like, I guess, fire behaviors.

178
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,380
Okay. So taking something from this model by recognized by a rabbi is so if you have

179
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,900
improved knowledge of when someone might be a danger to themselves or others,

180
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,850
that might explain some variability in your perceptions of how safe the environment is.

181
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,129
Well,

182
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,460
I feel like people kind of know what's going on and they might be that a report if somebody is considering bringing a weapon to school or something,

183
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,469
which in turn might explain some variability in some of our outcome variables, that would be sort of the argument behind a mediation story.

184
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,270
If we were looking at the individual level moving through a school climate level down to our specific goals,

185
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:11,980
empirical conceptual models like this, are you tending to place individual level before, like group level ones, or do you ever watch them up?

186
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:21,860
Yes, that's a good question. And we struggle a little bit with this because you have people that are nested within, you know, schools.

187
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,170
And what happens first is that the climate that changes first and then that affects the individuals,

188
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,990
or is it the individuals that start to change person affects the climate.

189
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,820
The reason why we have it in this order is because this is all even though it's a school level intervention, it's all very geared toward individuals.

190
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,520
So they're talking about what you can do, how you can identify a trusted adult, and how you can make a report,

191
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,970
how you should try to invite somebody to consider with you at the lunch table or, you know, a certain group project or wherever, something like that.

192
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,180
Right. Those are the kinds of messages that they're trying to get across here.

193
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,900
So we think that's going to change some of these individual things at first.

194
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,750
And then once you start to see this critical mass of people starting to behave this way or think this way or whatever else it could be,

195
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:11,510
you will start to see some of these things changing at the school level and then ultimately coming down to some of the actual individual behaviors,

196
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:17,600
again, that are also kind of at a school level metric, too. So you can operationalize it in a few different ways.

197
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,840
Again, a conceptual model is designed to help you start to plug in some of these variables that you think can be

198
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,030
measured and to see how they relate to each other a little bit different from like a theoretical model,

199
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,080
which would be how do you choose which constructs are the most interesting, right?

200
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:41,690
Which are the ones that we need to assess if we're going to be talking about how a an empowerment slash

201
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:51,350
surveillance or a lateral threat like a lateral surveillance intervention is going to change in violence outcomes.

202
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:30,140
And at this point. But you talk through this now pretending that these are moderators and not mediators.

203
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:52,730
You can answer if you like. I think you can use the statement to look into whether the perception of inclusivity will make a change this.

204
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,290
That's it, knowing that you are safer.

205
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,900
I guess it's that relationship stronger with a negative environment.

206
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah, potentially so. Here, here's the thing.

207
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,730
If we're trying to change, you know, improve trust and connectedness among a bunch of people in a school,

208
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,089
and we think by changing trust and connect connectedness,

209
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:31,740
that a school is going to have an influence on whether like mental distress or aggressive behavior within schools.

210
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:39,059
The more, trust me or trustworthy folks feel their their peers are, the less likely you're going to see kind of aggressive behavior that could,

211
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:46,080
in theory, look different at a school that's already has a lot of inclusivity built in versus schools that don't.

212
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,070
Right. So thinking about the schools with different levels of inclusivity, kind of like the broad level of the population level,

213
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,989
does that change the association between any sort of trusting connectedness that we

214
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,790
can create through an intervention and how that might relate to aggressive behavior?

215
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,210
And as I talk through this, you might be thinking, well, that makes a lot more sense to me than if I use trust and connectedness,

216
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,300
which is then explaining some of the school level inclusivity, which then relates to our often variable.

217
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,570
Just because I see this as a media relationship doesn't necessarily mean it's a mediator relationship.

218
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,669
You might have just as good of an argument that these are all moderated or confounding

219
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,150
variables or however you want to think about these third variable influences.

220
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:37,500
Right. It's conceptual. It's theoretical for us. But at the same time, we can test all these different manifestations remote.

221
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,890
We can test mediation model and a moderation model.

222
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,680
In one way, it's just a third variable that's influencing the outcome.

223
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,350
We're kind of controlling for multiple regression, basically, and then compare all of those different models to each other.

224
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,899
So then we can look at our empiricism relative to our theoretical orientation and

225
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,470
see which one maps on the best or which one has the strongest level of influence.

226
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,490
All right. Remember, this is all just coming from me, me and sheep on here.

227
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,070
We came up with this model. We helped Sandy Hook kind of talk through out loud what they think their program does.

228
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,190
And then we've put it down to this picture.

229
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:17,190
But this picture in picture may be more or less accurate when we actually start to collect the data and see how it all sort of maps out.

230
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,240
That's what's fun about this work. Go put in questions.

231
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,690
Yeah, just to make sure that I understand.

232
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,440
So with a moderator, the pathway is going to happen no matter what it's like you're going to get an outcome based off of the independent variable.

233
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:44,190
But it's just like whether it's strong or weak, right? A mediator can do more than that, basically, and obviously not necessarily more.

234
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,700
But so the this relationship is the same.

235
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,220
So regardless if we're talking about a mediator or a moderator, this relationship is kind of assumed to be there.

236
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay. When we talk about a moderator, we're assuming the strength or the direction of this relationship varies as some function of these variables.

237
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,880
So at different levels of, uh, I don't know, disciplinary incidents, schools with a lot of incidents versus scores are fewer.

238
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,240
We might see that these associations look a lot different.

239
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,100
The relationship between the health belief model stuff and mental distress,

240
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:26,430
what's different at a school with a lot of disciplinary things going on versus schools with medium levels or low levels?

241
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:34,950
All right. Contrast that to we believe that the way that these variables all sort of interrelate is by changing

242
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,650
some of these norms around reporting and your confidence in reporting and your willingness to report.

243
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:49,560
If you feel like somebody is, I don't know, maybe at risk for for suicide or something, we might see sort of changes in some of these variables.

244
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,640
We can explain some of that variability. And by changing some of these variables, we can see a reduction here.

245
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,690
Right. So what's going one with specifically with disciplinary infractions?

246
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,470
If we've developed a lot of trust and connectedness, maybe we don't see quite as many disciplinary infractions.

247
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,530
So this development is explaining some variability here.

248
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,720
When we have fewer disciplinary infractions, maybe we see a reduction in some of these outcome variables.

249
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,400
People don't bring firearms to school because maybe it starts with a disciplinary thing.

250
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,190
Somebody brings their like a retaliatory weapon to school and I mean thinking through some of the interactions.

251
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:36,300
Yeah. Can you create models where let's say you take school climate, so you create a model where you have that simultaneously as a mediator and.

252
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:46,660
I can use the same variable. Yes. Um, or do you have to separate the two?

253
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,770
Or do you have to make a case for one being more of a moderator?

254
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:58,750
Or you you can have a moderated effect to serve as a mediator for a relationship.

255
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,360
So in that sense, it's kind of operating as both a moderator or a meet and a mediator.

256
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,840
You can't you can't take because you have to be a mediator.

257
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,860
All you're really doing is calculating an indirect effect, which we'll be talking about.

258
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,270
Right. So any sort of variable or any sort of fixed effect that you would calculate,

259
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,540
manner, effect, moderator or whatever, all of those could be served as New Years.

260
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,270
So we have things like mediated moderation and moderated mediation.

261
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:42,780
So like a moderated mediation would be as if this indirect effect, for example, varies by some third variable, right?

262
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,330
Or you could also have moderating happened here or moderation happening here.

263
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,180
So, I mean, these are all just more advanced conceptualizations of the same sort of idea.

264
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:03,070
A mediated moderation is where you have this moderating, this interaction term, also serving as a mediator.

265
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,760
So you're calculating the indirect effect of the interaction term.

266
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:21,190
And that's really comes to us. I mean, if you watch the video, all those indirect effects are actually kind of automatically calculated.

267
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:29,290
They're always behind the scenes. We just haven't been pulling them out. Now we're going to be exposed to people in the car, but they're there again.

268
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,290
Whether you consider things as mediators, moderators, the different ways that these can all kind of work together.

269
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:43,900
And I can show you a great book that has different pictures of all sorts of ways that you can think about variables and how they relate to each other.

270
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,920
It really comes down to the analyst. Like, for example,

271
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,809
this would be a potential example of serial mediation where you have independent variable dependent

272
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:03,300
variable mediator one mediator two independent variable first explains variability here,

273
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,050
which in turn would explain variability here, which ultimately explains variability here.

274
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,930
Those are actually two mediators. We assume that this one precedes this one, which then leads to this one.

275
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:22,890
Right. And then you'd have this kind of direct path all the way down at the bottom. So lots of ways that we can go.

276
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,660
We're going to stay simple for now or it's kind of basic,

277
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,669
but just knowing that we can plug all sorts of different new relationships into this model and that's what that's the beauty of structural

278
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:41,680
equation models is because you can start to play around with all not only different ways that variables could be interacting with each other,

279
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,730
but also multiple independent variables, multiple dependent variables.

280
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,760
And then you can see how these would just blow up kind of exponentially.

281
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,249
Now we're always limiting the number of things that we can plug into a model, but the sky's the limit.

282
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,640
We just talk about kind of theoretical orientation. All right.

283
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,700
I am going to walk through a classic mediation example. This is from some data.

284
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,060
Let's see here. This is from some facts. Data.

285
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:14,590
Sorry for all the fire and violence stuff, but this is an explosion of violence is predicting firearm carriage.

286
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,299
We're school safety.

287
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:28,240
So what we're thinking here is that if you are exposed to violence, there is a higher likelihood that you are going to carry a firearm.

288
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:36,830
But that could be mitigated by how safe you feel at school.

289
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,840
Okay. So that's what we're kind of test.

290
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:47,500
We can think about this potentially as a moderation question, too, but for now, we're just going to talk about it from a mediation standpoint.

291
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,290
All right. And I forget what I put this little star up here, I think, is because we're going to walk through the burning kind of steps.

292
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,230
I keep referencing Burning Jenny, do people know what that is? It's an article that's posted on canvas.

293
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,930
You might worry that it might be worth reading sometime. It's the seminal piece on a mediation in moderation.

294
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,840
It was written and written in the ladies. It kind of talks through how you approach a question like mediation.

295
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:21,700
Start by testing this path and this one, then this one, and then you can calculate the indirect effect still is used in some circles.

296
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:28,300
So often is referenced by almost everyone. But I think the thinking around mediation has moved forward a little bit.

297
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,430
And it's it's less common to say, well, Americans did this and this is why I'm doing this.

298
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,320
All right. The variables of interest here.

299
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:44,650
So school based victimization and I think this is kind of important because we're not just talking about exposure, violence that can happen anywhere.

300
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,830
We think it's domain specific. But here at school, have you seen people fighting?

301
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,800
Have you have you seen threats early students bringing weapons to school?

302
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:02,500
So we think that this is sort of kind of coming together as a way of saying this is happening quite a lot or not happening to me much at all.

303
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,079
Perception of school safety. I feel safe at school.

304
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,460
I feel safe getting to and from school are two items that we're going to combine together.

305
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,399
So both of these are going to be we're going to use these creative means. Cause the mean of these three items, I mean,

306
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:27,910
it is two items in terms of that question around mediation and moderation actually an outcome variable which might my independent variable very.

307
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,520
Maximum school based school district with an independent variable.

308
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,930
The outcome variable is in the past 12 months, have you carried a weapon to school?

309
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,950
It is a how often life in the zero times all event. How many times?

310
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:52,340
Now a lot of people carry weapons to school. Usually it's less than 5%, which actually turns out to be a lot of incidents across the United States.

311
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:58,290
But in this case, only about 2 to 3.3% of respondents reported any sort of weapon carriage.

312
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,980
So we're going to dichotomous this variable to simple yes or no, which allows some amputations in just a second.

313
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,479
This is my outcome variable. This is my mediation.

314
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:18,830
Very the idea here one more time is that variability here is explaining variability there.

315
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,500
If that doesn't make sense that we don't ask that mediation question.

316
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:31,220
I can already tell you that this is probably going to be true and this is probably going to be true.

317
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,270
Right? This is my CPF. This is my beeper.

318
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,330
But whether or not these feasibility would explain variability here is kind of whether it gets you I mean,

319
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,520
that's getting down to that mechanistic piece.

320
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,770
I think if I have been hurt at school or been beaten up or something like that, I'm going to feel less safe at school.

321
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,620
If I feel less safe at school. Am I very to school? That's the only question about this.

322
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,050
And for that, sure. All right.

323
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:11,290
So the only thing I want to show just to highlight for folks is because this is a dichotomous variable.

324
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,370
We are using a generalized union.

325
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,920
All right. So it's a logistic regression. So let's just keep that in mind as we're looking at these estimates.

326
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,900
The other thing that I just need to be aware of, although we're not going to go into doing a whole lot,

327
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:34,570
this is a national survey dataset from Gallup, about 2000, 2000 students.

328
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,810
But because it's a national representative survey reviews weights,

329
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,380
which more or less provide a little bit extra for people who are less represented in the sample.

330
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:55,710
So depending on if it's the characteristics we typically use are race and sex, I don't think that's really there's enough variability there.

331
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,620
So I don't ready to do that. But anyways, so we use the response rates to inform some of these effects.

332
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:11,739
Yeah, it's kind of a little bit unrelated, but how would you like to take the fact that if you give a survey like this and a lot of

333
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,220
people even say they carry a better school faculty when they would be just mathematics Ed?

334
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,200
Well, I think it's it's kind of like a recognized flaw in any sort of self-reported data.

335
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,879
Right. I mean, I think there's at this point,

336
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,980
there's been a fair amount of literature to suggest that people generally are honest when they feel like their data is going to be protected.

337
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:45,220
And there's not that. There's there isn't. It's an anonymous thing. Um, whether that's actually true is probably, it's probably debatable.

338
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,490
But I mean, I think people tend to be fairly forthcoming about some of their behaviors.

339
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,270
That said, it's easily possible that this is an underrepresentation was anyway, say, about two and a half percent.

340
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,959
And that's within the realm of what other data have.

341
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,810
So that gives you some feasibility for the argument. But yeah, it's absolutely a possibility.

342
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,570
There is that threat that it today. So these are control variables.

343
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:24,950
What we're really interested in here is this kind of initial direct effect or the overall effect of exposure around the school on fire and fury.

344
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:33,030
So just potentially I mean, anybody want to interpret that for me, even just in words?

345
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,030
What's the relationship between being exposed to violence in school environments?

346
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,719
Melody for a complex answer. And so everything's backwards.

347
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,530
But the school violence increases by one unit.

348
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,090
But they're huge, huge increases they want to do.

349
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,410
Yeah. In this case, this is this is a logic to this delay the odds.

350
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:15,710
But still the basic sort of idea and, you know, change in exposure to violence in school is associated with an increased predicted

351
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:23,300
probability of firearm carriage controlling for sexual identity and racial.

352
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,750
He's busy. Not nothing different. Him. And that's the next step I'm skipping.

353
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,610
It's not a pass over that this my my iPad.

354
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,530
I'm skipping this path right now.

355
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:48,730
This path, though, is establishing a relationship between my mind independent variable and my mediating variable where we see.

356
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,000
Exposure to violence leads to a decrease. This school makes sense.

357
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,870
You're exposed to violence in school. You might feel the school is less safe, a less safe place to be.

358
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,500
So exposure to violence is positively related to firearm carriage.

359
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,210
It is negatively associated with perceptions of school safety.

360
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,650
Now comes our big question. We are interested in whether or not the indirect effect,

361
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:34,780
the indirect effect is taking this path and this path and quite literally doing what you may remember from video watch.

362
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,860
It was supposedly. Actually just multiplying them together.

363
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:52,990
So calculating an indirect path is not that difficult. Calculating the standard here to test an indirect effect is quite difficult.

364
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,510
That's why we like computers.

365
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:06,550
But if you're ever interested in trying to figure out what an indirect effect is, it's taking this value which is right there at this one.

366
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,810
There's value in sort of multiplying them together. All right.

367
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:18,100
That's all it really is, which is why we have actually been doing we've been able to calculate indirect effects

368
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,270
all semester long because it's all it's really just happening behind the scenes.

369
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,260
We're taking coefficients from our model and multiplying and multiplying it to gather.

370
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:38,530
What's only the new and different part about it is we now want to calculate the whether or not this AB had a B to a B path is significant.

371
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:49,060
That's what that's what an indirect effect is the effect of exposure to violence on firearm carriage through your mediating variable.

372
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,840
The total effect of an association,

373
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:33,230
which would be everything else out of out of the way between exposure to violence and firearm carriage is a combination of the direct effects,

374
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,300
plus all indirect effects.

375
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:48,170
So whenever you just look at a binary correlation, you are getting the total effect of two variables together.

376
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:58,010
When we start to add in additional variables behind the scenes, again, we are getting sort of these indirect effects as well.

377
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:09,120
And when we sum all the indirect effects up and add in this conditional direct effect, we are going to have our total different.

378
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:17,120
So that's happened every time we ran a multiple regression where again, we realize it or not.

379
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,640
Now we're just going to test some of these things explicitly, right?

380
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,490
Just because it's there doesn't mean it's important to text.

381
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:34,240
Right. There are indirect effects that we could probably ask or could probably calculate, but that wouldn't make sense.

382
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:42,310
Right. None of these are going to be mediating variables because none of these are going to be explained by exposure to school violence.

383
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,520
Now we can flip it on its head. This is cross-sectional data.

384
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,690
We could certainly talk about whether your sexual identity is related to school safety.

385
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,700
And then ultimately firing parents or something like that. That might be a testable question.

386
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,420
And we can go through our due diligence and test the direct effect, indirect effects, etc.

387
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:07,920
Right. But again, just knowing that these things, these numbers aren't coming out of nowhere.

388
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,580
But at the same time, we're putting them together in a meaningful way.

389
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:20,460
So what we'll be doing with mediation in just a second together, in a probably more straightforward example, is calculating this indirect effect.

390
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,560
What is the effect of exposure to violence and firearm carriage through school safety?

391
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:31,020
In this case, there is a slight positive indirect effect,

392
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:37,889
which is telling us that there is at least some of the effect of exposure to

393
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:44,190
violence on firearm carriage is because students feel more or less safe at school.

394
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,340
That was kind of our hypothesis. This is all is supported by our data.

395
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:58,650
My guess is the vast majority of it is somehow related to this just direct association.

396
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,620
It's not so much the school safety perceptions, but at least some of it.

397
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:15,150
Some percentage of it is actually if you take the total and look at the mediated effect, it's a little less than the three seven.

398
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,980
35, 40%. It's not insubstantial.

399
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:30,430
So when I think about that way, maybe 35,

400
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:39,070
40% of the effect of exposure to violence on firearm carriage is because of changes in their perceptions of school safety.

401
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,680
And that maybe that doesn't happen to I'm getting threatened at school.

402
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm seeing kids get in fights at school. I think my school is less safe.

403
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,690
I think my school is less safe and more likely to bring fire.

404
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:13,370
At a high level. How is this for? It's kind of the same thing here, maybe a little bit more complexity.

405
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,910
I apologize. But it's recently been published this year. Don't still.

406
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:21,820
Same type of idea.

407
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:32,140
We establish a relationship between accessibility and suicide behavior, but we want to see whether or not these variables are related to each other.

408
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:39,910
These variables are related to each other. We at least think some of the effects on library accessibility and suicidal

409
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:44,950
thoughts and behavior are because we are changing individuals sense of belonging.

410
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:55,870
We think some of the reasons why exposure to violence in school might predict firearm carriage is because students feel a little bit less safe.

411
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:08,290
I don't know what the other reasons are, but this one seems to be a plausible one and have some of the questions and concerns.

412
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,850
Kind of show you how we did. Excellent. All right.

413
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,270
So if you're so inclined, you can pop over in our studio and we're going to do this together.

414
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:29,290
Yet another Miles example. I'm sorry, but in this case, we're gonna be looking at students from Flint, Michigan.

415
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:36,430
They were sixth graders, and they want to respond to this survey. Another explanation for why bad,

416
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:46,210
violent behavior happens is that or the expert in a similar relationship is exposure to violence and some sort of violent behavior outcome.

417
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:52,389
That's a lot of what my work does. So another explanation for why that might be that might be happening in this case.

418
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:59,770
It was because I'm scared. Another one might be, if I'm exposed to violence, I might see that as a way to resolve my conflicts.

419
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,110
So one of the ways that we think are that exposure to violence could be manifesting in

420
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:10,330
some sort of violent or aggressive behavior is by changing attitudes towards violence.

421
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:17,560
Now, I'm on the fence about this because I don't know what a truly overwhelming exposure to violence does to individuals.

422
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,180
In some ways I think okay becomes normalized or you become desensitized to it.

423
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:29,470
Your attitude might change in a direction that then makes violence more like, okay, I see this as a way to resolve my issues or my conflicts.

424
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:36,820
The other thought is it's traumatizing and I would want to do everything I can to avoid engaging in violent behavior.

425
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,350
I don't know how this operates in practice, but it is a question that I'm interested in asking.

426
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:47,169
So while behavior is going to be my outcome, home exposure to violence,

427
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,280
this is violence that you might see model with in your house and attitudes towards

428
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,190
violence is going to be many questions about at least the conceptualization.

429
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,030
All right. We're going to do this twice soon.

430
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,640
We're going to start with the Bear Anthony approach.

431
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:16,850
I just it's kind of your standard way to build a mediation model and then something that Berni Kennedy didn't come up with.

432
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,980
But it was also another seminal piece within the mediation literature is the civil test,

433
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:29,300
which is a test of an indirect effect bearing, and Kenney hypothesized that they exist.

434
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,880
So we came up with a way to test it, right?

435
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,970
And it's essentially whether or not that indirect effect is nonzero.

436
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,360
I mentioned that these are kind of an archaic but less common way of doing things now.

437
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,860
Now, with computing power,

438
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:52,550
we are able to use a different method where we basically simulate a lot of different runs of the same sort of mediated analysis.

439
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,770
And we can use something called the bootstrap method to determine whether or not that indirect effect is there.

440
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,930
All right. Well, we'll go through this in a lot more detail. All right.

441
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:12,080
If you want to again follow up in our studio, we are going to be using this dataset called ETV.

442
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:34,130
I think the script file is on canvas. Right there.

443
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:49,180
And the data is the CSP files. All right.

444
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,540
Step by step or skip chunks that folks already know.

445
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,370
What was that? Step by step is absolutely fine.

446
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,200
What am I doing when I take. Yeah.

447
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,530
What does that mean? And I tell you.

448
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,790
Yes, I love it. I love it here.

449
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,959
Just reading in the file. This is going to allow me to take a peek at the file.

450
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,310
What is that SDR command do for me? Structure.

451
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:34,560
I see it as an ellipses structure. Going to give us an idea of what kind of variables we're looking for.

452
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,520
In this case, I don't see any variables that should be categorical.

453
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,170
So that all looks good. You can take a peek just to make sure the data look okay.

454
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:51,510
You can take a look here on the in the console to make sure if you have your 302 variables, you have 302 observations.

455
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:57,900
You have nine variables. All good, all good. 31 is just just in being lazy because it doesn't like using the caps lock.

456
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,750
And then here's our very first model. So this is not super complicated.

457
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:12,030
And so rather than me, before we throw in a whole bunch of control variables, all I'm doing here is plugging in some of our number.

458
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:21,030
So what's my dependent variable again? Yeah.

459
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,410
Ross, that's Malcolm Turnbull.

460
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,960
Yes, this is what I'm thinking.

461
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,910
But I'm a rehearsal editor and I was an idiot.

462
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,410
But as it's.

463
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,190
Excellent. Keep that in mind. The very first thing that.

464
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,170
Bernie, can you suggest that we do? Yeah. I don't think this is the worst thing for folks to try.

465
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
It's a kind of a similar model building.

466
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:59,610
You'll see that we can just jump right to a command at the very end that's going to do all this stuff simultaneously.

467
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,580
And that might be where you end up going in the future. But for now, this line 40 is just regressing.

468
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,570
What our outcome variable on our independent variable.

469
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:16,200
This is a, B or C path. CPR.

470
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:22,170
This is our CPR. Yes. The folks in by.

471
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:33,660
Right. Just a regression. I mean, interpret this from your quick.

472
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,650
The association between exposure, violence and aggressive behavior is a positive and negative or not even there.

473
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,870
Mm hmm. Well, that. Yep. So this is a it's a positive effect here.

474
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,840
A unit change in home exposure to violence is associated with 0.31 predicted change in our outcome variable.

475
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,640
And this is significant, suggesting that it's unlikely to be zero.

476
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,510
That's our first step. Barrett and Carney would say, if this relationship doesn't exist, we stop there.

477
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:20,380
I'm going to push you not to step there if you really do think mediation could be happening.

478
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:32,020
The next step is to establish a relationship between our what, our mediating variable and our independent variable.

479
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,049
Okay. So Barron Kenney did not push for that.

480
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:47,470
The path which again, if that D path is not there, then there's really no point in following this mean further following through with the association.

481
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,440
And you can see that if really what an indirect effect is, is to multiply this by this,

482
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,670
if either one of these are zero, you're not going to have an indirect effect.

483
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:07,730
Right. That's why. In my practice, what I would do is take those three variables, plug them into a correlation matrix right at the beginning.

484
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,689
Right. Let's just look at how the Bivariate Associations buy all three of them.

485
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,070
And matter of fact, then we should put that in here,

486
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,080
because then it can help you determine whether or not you should even mess around with some of this stuff.

487
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:23,840
But anyway, so still not doing anything, super complicated things that we've done many times before.

488
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,370
What's the association between exposure to violence and or mediating variable?

489
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,640
Positive right as exposure bonds in your house goes up.

490
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:45,830
Your attitudes towards violence. These would be things like using, I mean, fights to resolve problems or is acceptable.

491
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:56,420
What else is there and if we get with some of the other ones are there are three or four items, maybe five I can't remember.

492
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:02,360
I look up and then we're just three variables.

493
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:11,450
This final model is just a multiple regression model where we have our outcome variable regressed on our two variables.

494
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,690
The independent variable in the mediating variable order does not matter.

495
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:27,729
Now we see that after controlling for one another the effects of home explosion,

496
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,420
violence and attitudes, word towards violence look a little bit different, right?

497
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,520
But not too different. Anybody want to just interpret one really quick for me?

498
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:54,910
You know, maybe this. I don't know. As attitudes toward expense increases as opposed to the cessation or.

499
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,570
I guess. All right. And I know what it is, is.

500
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:14,790
Yes, it was good practice as a device goes up to prevent a violent behavior.

501
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,680
Also. It's positively associated.

502
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:25,069
Controlling for. Yeah. Yeah. So we could absolutely interpret this like a multiple regression equation.

503
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:34,129
What percentage of the variability in outcome are we? Were we explaining? A 70 to 80% write about there.

504
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:41,209
Wonderful, wonderful. Now, the the mediation question here and the old bear and a Kenny method was kind of interesting.

505
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:52,400
What they wanted to see was whether the effect of the independent variable reduces when you control for the mediating variable.

506
00:57:52,970 --> 00:58:02,570
So the way they kind of tested mediation was to see if this variable went from being significant, whether positive or negative to Non-Significant,

507
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,270
which would suggest when you have the independent variable and by itself there is a significant pathway,

508
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,570
exposure to violence predicts our aggressive behavior.

509
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:18,320
But as soon as you control for attitudes towards violence, that effect is reduced or goes to zero.

510
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:29,780
That would suggest that the way that exposure to violence is associated with the outcome is first by changing your attitudes towards violence.

511
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,710
That was the rationale for how you could test an indirect effect.

512
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:42,170
Sobel came along and said, Well, we can do better than that. We can actually look at these paths simultaneously the A path and the B path.

513
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,870
We can calculate the indirect effect by multiply them, multiplying them together,

514
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,800
and then testing whether or not that indirect effect is different from zero.

515
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:58,340
So here the social test is a little different from how we set this up.

516
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,980
So it's my data is just whatever you want to call that.

517
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,710
The day that we're using the function here is Sobel.

518
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:16,250
We have our predictor variable, independent variable or mediated or mediation variable in our outcome variable.

519
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:21,980
This comes from that multilevel package that we have here at the bottom or at the top.

520
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:29,750
Okay. So this is independent of those three regressions that we ran above.

521
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,210
Those were just kind of a model building showing you ultimately how we're going to get all these different values.

522
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:43,910
The Sobel test is going to run all three simultaneously and then also give you a value at the end.

523
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,420
So notice up here. So this is the output for a simple test.

524
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:54,410
It starts with that first direct effect equation. And this should be the same thing that we ran in model zero.

525
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,990
We have model two. Here is what we called Model Y.

526
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:04,460
The Model three here is the mediator on the independent variable.

527
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:13,610
Okay. So the same three models that we ran above different order, different connotation, but the same thing.

528
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:22,850
It will do this behind the scenes, but it's going to multiply those and be passed together for us to get this indirect effect.

529
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,950
And then the hard part about all this is calculating the standard error.

530
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,170
This is what tells us whether or not that indirect effect is different from zero.

531
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,540
Okay. That's the question of whether or not, again,

532
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:47,810
some of the association between exposure to violence and aggressive behavior is in part due to changing attitudes towards violence.

533
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:55,309
This indirect effect relative to the standard error gives us a T value or Z value.

534
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,870
It's the equivalent as well as how many people were included in the analysis.

535
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:16,840
So we can compare the Z value to a table with what I guess it would be 266

536
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,560
degrees of freedom and whatever critical current values that we want to use.

537
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,020
And we can determine not whether or not that's significant.

538
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:30,280
Usually we're looking for a value that's like 1.96 or greater, which we see this is greater, this is going to be significant.

539
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,099
So there is a significant indirect effect,

540
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:42,130
at least part of the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes towards B or on aggressive behavior is due to changing your attitudes.

541
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:51,670
This indirect effect is also positive. So if we think through how all of these variables are related in this case, I think we're almost all positive.

542
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:55,030
Right? This is positive. This is positive.

543
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:02,860
This is positive. And the indirect effect also was a positive or is a point of some point of five.

544
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:13,810
So we want to use some of those labels. We can say the first more exposure to violence predicts or more permissive attitudes towards violence,

545
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:18,190
which in turn predicts more aggressive behavior. That's how that's working.

546
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:29,500
You know, the indirect effect they impose, we see a times be intense, but the direct effect is see.

547
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:35,950
And specifically the direct effect when we didn't have this mirror, the third variable in the model.

548
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:46,570
And as soon as you have the third variable in the model, this this model Y up here, this is actually considered a conditional direct effect.

549
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:54,040
You sometimes I see like all the time you see prime so to be just a little more exact.

550
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,360
Direct effect. Sorry.

551
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:24,260
Very conditional directive. Prime.

552
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:34,800
And for Marin County, it was whether or not this sea that was formerly significant was either reduced closer to zero or became zero.

553
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,060
That was indication of mediation. Same kind of idea.

554
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,760
But essentially that was their test. So the test is just going to be more explicit about it.

555
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,360
It's going to take these two effects. It's going to multiply them together.

556
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:56,010
It's going to compare to a hypothesized distribution of indirect effects, just like we do with all the other coefficients in our model,

557
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:03,840
and give us the significance test or gives us all the tools that we need for a significant test.

558
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:17,200
Folks feel about this stuff. We got some time.

559
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:23,590
Yeah. Ask away. I'm sorry. So if you.

560
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:29,720
Right. Then it's a sign of mediation.

561
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:36,350
Or can you say that one more time? The indirect of trying to create.

562
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:42,530
Is it if the indirect effect gets closer to zero, that it's a sign of mediation, resisting the direct effect?

563
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:52,820
So that the hypothesis for a Sobel test is that the indirect effect is not zero.

564
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,550
The null hypothesis is that this value, if you multiply the path and the B path together,

565
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:05,150
that this value is going to be zero or very close to it if there's value is not zero.

566
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,590
If it is, you know, relative to the standard error of what it could be.

567
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:15,620
If it's not if it's not zero, then that's a significant indirect effect.

568
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:26,170
It's also significant mediation. So what do you do if it does leave?

569
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,300
You say the z value is just because I don't know why that doesn't give you a test.

570
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,910
This would be the equivalent of like a t value up here. Right.

571
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,810
So you divide this by this, you get this, which is compared to a t test table and you get a T and you get a p value.

572
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:48,010
You divide this by this, you get a z value.

573
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,380
The exact same thing is the T value, really. And then we just don't have a z table that it compares it to.

574
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:59,680
Here will be nice if we did, but it doesn't have a z. You can just assume that it's not since.

575
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:07,090
No, no, we don't make assumptions like that. What we do is we think about our sample size.

576
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:16,240
And if our sample size is over about 100, then yes, we can say that 1.96 is a good threshold if it's less than 100.

577
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:23,650
Got to go back to those tables, folks. Those annoying Z, T and Chi Square, whatever tables.

578
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:31,330
And you look to see how many people you have in your sample and then whether what the critical value 4.5 cut off or whatever it's going to be.

579
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,620
If you didn't want a 2.5 cut off, you're going to have a higher Z value threshold.

580
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,220
So it works at over 100 than the cut of and there may not be 1.9.

581
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:50,500
Yeah. So when you think about like a normal, like a normal table, normal distribution table, as soon as you hit like 100 or more.

582
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:58,210
It doesn't matter, though, that 1.96 is your critical cutoff value, 4.05 for T for the T distribution.

583
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,530
As soon as you get to 100, you are working with a Z distribution.

584
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:10,090
You're working basically with a normal distribution, a T table for those who really care when you have less than a hundred people.

585
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,810
Same kind of bell curve, just fatter tails.

586
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,519
Pharaoh tails just means a little bit of a different rejection zone to get out.

587
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,800
2.05 because they're fatter that rejection zones a little bit out as out a little bit further.

588
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:30,440
Right because 5% two and a half. So you remember this from this from Intrastat, right?

589
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:37,330
Your two and a half percent on both ends of the table. So you can imagine how that gets truncated a little bit if the tails are fatter.

590
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:45,410
And that study showed us the indirect effects. So that's the point of the supplement.

591
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,640
Yeah. So what about the direct effect then, you.

592
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:57,820
No, because you have both here. So you have the direct effect up here, which is what we kind of did also up here, too.

593
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:02,230
So, I mean, again, it is just basically it's just kind of a regression.

594
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:12,340
So it's going to give you your direct effect and your your direct effect with the mediator, your conditional direct effect.

595
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:38,210
And then also just this is that mediated one. I am not positive about this.

596
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:45,890
But I think behind the scenes, this is doing something helpful probably.

597
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:58,400
So you notice that this value of two point or point two, June 4.099 is a little different than this one was .31.

598
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,680
I think that's because this one has through one or two people in the sample,

599
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:13,030
whereas we dropped down to 264 and 263 respectively because we have some missing data and attitudes.

600
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:21,070
I think that this test helpfully is dropping those missing observations out from the calculation of the direct effect as well.

601
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:28,420
And I have to confirm that. But I'm. 85, 90% sure that's what's happening here.

602
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,910
Other questions about this.

603
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:47,400
If our folks at least get any idea of the concept behind what an indirect effect is doing for us, that's the formal test of that.

604
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,560
Yes, by changing my mediating variable, which then in turn changes my outcome variable.

605
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:58,320
Otherwise we only have from our kind of standard regression approaches.

606
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:03,120
We can get this C value. Sorry. We can get this A-B value.

607
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:08,300
Even give this C prime value, which is just multiple regression with these two values in the equation.

608
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:14,610
But we can't multiply them together. That's that's what we miss from a regression output.

609
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:32,250
I also mentioned that you might in the future decide to skip these three steps.

610
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:39,660
I wouldn't hold it against you, because as you can see, I just want it running on 56 here we get that same information.

611
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:44,100
So it's more or less replicating what we saw above.

612
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:51,780
And so it's not necessary to go through all this process of model zero M and Y really, we can just run a simple test right away.

613
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:58,440
Now, simple test is completely defensible. I think you're going to see it in published literature even up through through today.

614
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,990
But the new way of running mediation analysis is to use a bootstrap.

615
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:11,970
Bootstrap is just a resampling procedure. So what it does is it takes a samples of size, whatever, 264,

616
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:21,240
however many people we have in the sample that samples them with replacement, which means you take 264 people, you draw out 264 people.

617
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,730
Every time you draw somebody out, you take their values. You plug them back into the into the pot.

618
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,330
So it's possible that somebody's going to get drawn multiple times.

619
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:39,240
When constructing our sample of 264. We do that hundreds of times or thousands of times, depending on what you want.

620
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:46,200
We run the exact same analysis that we just did, and we now look at the distribution of indirect effects.

621
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:57,470
Right. If you don't want to know all the details, this is perhaps a more methodologically rigorous way of testing your indirect effects.

622
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,540
Okay, this is from the mediation package.

623
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:14,730
You basically just need to identify what's your mediating variable, your model, or your your outcome variable and plug them in.

624
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:21,410
So if this. Seems a little arduous for the Sobel test.

625
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:26,020
I agree, but you need to do this part for your bootstrap.

626
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:32,980
So what you do is you're going to use these these values, these equations, these seed models.

627
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:38,540
You're going to plug them in. So this model M here is just this model M up here.

628
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,090
This model Y here is this model Y here.

629
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:49,120
And the reason why I think this is worth talking about is that first model, that very new.

630
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,500
CARNEY Important first step. It's not in there. You don't even use it.

631
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,450
It's unnecessary.

632
01:12:56,350 --> 01:13:04,330
That's the that's the argument of the the leading thought around mediation analysis is treating the variable as just your your independent variable.

633
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:09,760
You may you're meeting variable queries, you're meeting variable bootstrap.

634
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,680
We're just saying, yes, we want to use that resampling procedure. Simulations is just how many times it's going to do this.

635
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:19,570
How many different indirect effects is it going to calculate? In this case, we're going to calculate 500 of them.

636
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:27,040
You're going to have 500 indirect effects that we're going to compare and see where that distribution is by chance.

637
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:31,060
Some are going to be big. Some are going to be small. Some are to be zero.

638
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:38,350
Some are going to be non-zero. We're looking to see if the vast majority of them are either positive or negative and different from zero.

639
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:43,090
In this case, we're assuming the vast majority of them are going to be positive.

640
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:47,710
There should map on to this point estimate of what our indirect effect should be.

641
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,570
When you run it, you're going to save it as a model object. The summary.

642
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:59,230
Here we go. Is their outcome variable. This is their immediate effect.

643
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:12,100
All right. Notice that it's the very similar to what our point estimate for the mediated effect was from our Sobel test.

644
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:19,390
Matter of fact, it's the exact same thing. The only difference here is because we ran 500 of these things,

645
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:28,990
we can now construct a confidence interval to figure out where the majority of these simulated indirect effects landed.

646
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:36,610
And we can see that 95% of them landed between about 0.23 and about 0.08.

647
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:44,050
Just like with other decision rules, with confidence intervals, we're hoping that that confidence interval does not contain zero.

648
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,950
Right. This is the direct effect.

649
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,810
Direct effect. Plus mediated effect equals total effect.

650
01:14:53,590 --> 01:15:06,070
Proportion mediated. I did this kind of back of the napkin with my last example, but of the total effect, about 1% of that is mediated about 16%.

651
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:17,740
Then we would say about 16% of the effect of exposure to violence on aggressive behavior is because of changes in attitudes towards violence.

652
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,510
Now, if I had maybe gotten to this example half an hour ago, I might have seen some excitement from this group.

653
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,910
I think that's pretty darn cool. This is good information right here.

654
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,550
You know, you can't just tell me that this is your car. I need to know. All right.

655
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:38,010
We've taken something over, theoretically made sense. We do.

656
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,860
We take some actual data from Flints.

657
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:47,270
We find out that not only is our mediation happening just like we predicted, but it's a not insubstantial amount of the effect.

658
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:53,700
So now I understand why exposure to violence is related to aggressive behavior, which to me is a big deal.

659
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,440
It doesn't make sense. I've been in a fight before. It hurts.

660
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:01,310
Why would I want to be in another fight? Why would I want to be a behave aggressively?

661
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,570
Well, perhaps because some of that exposure to violence is training me.

662
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:08,570
It's normalizing the way that I'm to resolve conflicts in the future.

663
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:16,310
And maybe that's why people who have had exposure to violence in the past could be more likely to behave aggressively later on.

664
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,219
Those are the kinds of explanations that mediation allows us to kind of think about versus, you know, multiple regression.

665
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:31,790
Yes. Great. Wonderful. That we could tease out that the effect of exposure to violence after controlling for attitudes.

666
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:39,170
Still positive. Different kinds of questions. Different kinds of data that we can then use to support our theory or wherever else it might be.

667
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,440
That's what I got for you folks. I'm sorry if this is not your cup of tea.

668
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:52,640
I'm going to try to make it your cup of tea on Thursday. We are going to go through an example using wait for it the data.

669
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:58,420
If you would like to use some of your own data or something to try this. You're welcome to.

670
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:03,080
You'll notice that there are two more examples here. This code is not bad.

671
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,930
I think folks could knock this code out pretty easily.

672
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:12,020
I encourage you to try it and maybe just give a if anything, it's maybe the interpretation part of it.

673
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,410
What exactly is happening here? What effect is getting mediated?

674
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:22,220
How are these variables interrelated? If you're really kind of struggling with this right now, I would very much encourage you to draw the picture.

675
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,520
I think the picture is super helpful if you want.

676
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:29,630
One of the things I do like about mediation is you can calculate all these values.

677
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:35,690
You can reproduce this point zero for eight by multiplying the coefficients together and seeing where those come from.

678
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:43,770
You can do this math really quickly. Divide whatever .2999 by point four.

679
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:47,329
Wait and see that it's 16%, right? It's not too bad.

680
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:57,080
Not too bad. Not too bad. So, again, the closing comments on this in practice, I think this is a much stronger way to do it.

681
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:04,850
This is completely fine. If this is like kind of a quick assessment, do I think mediation might be happening?

682
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:13,310
So I could see running a correlation matrix, then running a Sobel test and if that's promising, maybe follow up with a bootstrap.

683
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,580
Really up to you. But you have three variables. You think they're all related to each other.

684
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,070
You can do this. You can do this pretty easily.

685
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:27,800
Now comes the tricky part of explaining why you think it should work this way, because that's not quite as easy.

686
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:33,020
We saw that with my Sandy Hook promise example, but yet here you're looking at like, Oh, I don't know about that one.

687
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:38,330
J But we tested all right, folks, we're okay.

688
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,030
Thursday we made it through the first time ever. It took me like 12 to 14 weeks, but we made it to our examples.

689
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,920
So Thursday is all you doing a mediation analysis?

690
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:52,760
You can run examples two and three here if you want. I have an F dataset that you can use.

691
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,200
If you have any of your own data that you want to come in and play with and try to these bootstraps or whatever.

692
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,830
Go for it. That's it. A great day.

693
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:11,570
There's good scene. Anybody? Oh, that was optional, right?

694
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:19,260
Yeah, they're all optional at this point. So I will. And I also have an assignment that folks want for remediation to.
