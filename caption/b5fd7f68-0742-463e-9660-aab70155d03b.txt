00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello, welcome to this
lecture in Bio-statistics,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,195
in which we discuss the
normal distribution

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:10,280
and its application to the
Central Limit Theorem.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,295
Now if we never have data
for the entire population,

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,630
then how do we know what

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,075
the population
distribution looks like.

7
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,775
As I said it earlier,
we never will know,

8
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,145
but we need it in order
to make inference.

9
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,560
So the solution is
that we have to assume

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,190
a plausible model for the
population distribution.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,750
The normal distribution is

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,370
the most commonly-used
probability

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,795
model in public health.

14
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,610
Not only is it realistic,

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,170
but it has desirable properties

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,490
that make it very useful for

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,894
inference and once I decide
to use a normal distribution,

18
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:43,805
I can estimate any probability

19
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:45,830
that I might want, such as,

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,400
what proportion of
the population has

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,430
ages above 30 years old or

22
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,080
what proportion of
the population has

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,530
ages between 20 and 30 years old.

24
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,910
I can do all this without
having to measure

25
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,865
ages from the entire population.

26
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,620
So our learning objectives are;

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,670
first to visualize what

28
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,595
a normal distribution of
population values looks like,

29
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:06,110
to then understand how a normal

30
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,550
population is described by

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,350
its mean and to understand how

32
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,545
it's described by its
standard deviation,

33
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:16,485
to apply the 68-95-100 heuristic
to a normal population,

34
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,050
and then to understand
the purpose

35
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,370
of the Central Limit Theorem for

36
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,575
describing the sampling
distribution of the sample mean.

37
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:26,040
In front of you, you
see the picture of

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,135
the normal distribution
with a mean of 20.

39
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:31,730
This distribution is bell-shaped.

40
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,950
It is symmetric, meaning
that the mean of

41
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,470
20 is equal to the median of 20.

42
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,000
In other words 50 percent
of values are below

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,280
20 and 50 percent of
values are above 20.

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,470
The mean of a normal
distribution is represented by

45
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,760
the Greek letter Mu and

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,440
the standard
deviation represented

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,045
by the Greek letter sigma.

48
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,235
We therefore use the notation n

49
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,470
with Mu and sigma
in parentheses to

50
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,690
indicate a normal
distribution with a mean of

51
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,450
Mu and a standard
deviation of sigma.

52
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,020
Now the equation in front of
you describes the height of

53
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,265
the population distribution
for any value on the x axis.

54
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:09,515
So for example for
this value of x,

55
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,615
this age in the population,

56
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,430
there is a height y associated

57
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,140
with the normal distribution.

58
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,635
For a different x, we get
a different value of y.

59
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,660
The exact value of y is

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,765
computed from the equation
you see on the right.

61
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:26,870
Now, the first fact of
a normal distribution,

62
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,730
is that normal
distributions that all have

63
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,960
the same value of the
standard deviation,

64
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,890
we say have the same
scale or spread.

65
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,410
So here is a normal
population with

66
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,170
a mean of 20 and a standard
deviation of four.

67
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,600
If I then show you a
normal population with

68
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
a mean of 12 and a standard
deviation of four,

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,140
you can see the shape of

70
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,005
these two distributions
look the same

71
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,130
except one population is

72
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,500
shifted eight units to
the left of the other.

73
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,910
The difference in their means is

74
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,010
20 minus 12 or eight units,

75
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,685
but the spread of these two
distributions is the same.

76
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,840
Likewise, I could have
a population with

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,670
a mean of 24 and a
standard deviation of

78
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,800
four and these two
populations look

79
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,270
identical except one is shifted

80
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,935
four units to the
right of the other.

81
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,895
The difference in the
means of 20 and 24.

82
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,585
The second fact for all
normal distributions

83
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:15,080
is that if they have the
same value for the mean,

84
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,405
we say they have
the same location.

85
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,820
So again I have a
population with a mean of

86
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,025
20 and a standard
deviation of four.

87
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,580
I then show you a population
with the same mean of 20,

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,950
but now it has a standard
deviation of two.

89
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,935
This distribution is
much less spread out.

90
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:33,590
You can see this through
the base of the histogram.

91
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,310
It is not as wide as the
other population in yellow.

92
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,750
Conversely, I could show you

93
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,280
a population has the same mean of

94
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,145
20 but now has the standard
deviation of eight.

95
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,845
This population is
much more spread out.

96
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,810
The values in the
population are much

97
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,715
more variable as evidenced by

98
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,230
the base of this histogram being

99
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,400
wider than the other
histogram in yellow.

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,050
The third fact about
a normal distribution

101
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,520
is that 68 percent of

102
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,845
all values in a
normal distribution

103
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:03,920
must lie within one standard
deviation of the mean.

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,390
So in this example here,

105
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,620
if we have a population with

106
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
a mean of 20 and a
standard deviation of

107
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,130
four and this population

108
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,665
has a normal distribution
for its values,

109
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:14,960
then I know that one
standard deviation

110
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,970
from 20 on the left is 16,

111
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,925
one standard deviation on
the right of 20 is 24.

112
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,730
Therefore 68 percent of
this population must have

113
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,595
values that lie
between 16 and 24.

114
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:29,330
Similarly, 95 percent of

115
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,100
a normal distribution must lie

116
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,320
within two standard
deviations of its mean.

117
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,060
So in this population
with a mean of

118
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,285
20 and a standard
deviation of four,

119
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,915
we know that because the
distribution is normal,

120
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:44,035
that 95 percent of values
must lie within 12 and 28,

121
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,710
which are the two values that are

122
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,495
two standard deviations to
the left and rate of 20.

123
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,900
Finally, nearly 100 percent,

124
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,260
it's actually 99.7, of

125
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,595
a normal distribution is within

126
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,650
three standard
deviations of the mean.

127
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,330
For this population
with a mean of

128
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,210
20 and a standard
deviation of four,

129
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,530
I know that 99.7 of
the distribution

130
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,750
must lie within the
values of eight and 32.

131
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,600
You can see that this
is nearly all of

132
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,370
the normal distribution
except for

133
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,415
a very small amount
of the distribution

134
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:17,535
that is to the left of eight
or to the right of 32.

135
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,240
The combination of these
three values is known

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,510
as the 68-95-100 heuristic,

137
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,840
is that we know that

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,370
one standard deviation comprises

139
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,305
68 percent of the population,

140
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:30,155
95 percent is within
two standard deviations

141
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,910
and almost all of
the distribution

142
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,665
is within three
standard deviation,

143
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:37,145
if the population has
a normal distribution.

144
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,560
Now if we assume a
normal distribution

145
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,730
for the population,

146
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,340
it also gives us two facts
about the data that we

147
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,415
draw in a sample of data
from the population.

148
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:50,000
The first fact is that
the sample mean x-bar is

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,270
a good or in statistical
terms unbiased estimate

150
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,430
for the population mean Mu.

151
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,590
So that if we assume we
have a normal population,

152
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,810
we believe that the
sample mean is very

153
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,665
close to the actual value of Mu.

154
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:04,760
Similarly, the standard
deviation from

155
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,770
the sample f sub x is also

156
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,540
a good or unbiased estimate for

157
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,850
the population standard
deviation sigma.

158
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,800
So again if we draw a sample from

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,770
a normal population and the
sample standard deviation,

160
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,930
we believe is a number
that is close to

161
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,765
the population standard
deviation sigma.

162
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:23,120
Now if we make the
assumption that

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,230
our population has mean Mu
and standard deviation sigma.

164
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,510
Those are the only two
assumptions at this point.

165
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,190
I have not mentioned normality.

166
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,800
So we know the mean and we
know the standard deviation.

167
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,510
We do not know the shape.

168
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,820
Now if we move one step
further and say that we

169
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,205
do know that the
population is normal,

170
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,595
and we know the following fact,

171
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:46,295
that the sampling distribution
of the sample mean x bar.

172
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:47,825
So this is the histogram of

173
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,490
all the possible sample means

174
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,650
that could be drawn
from the population.

175
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,090
That histogram is also a
normal distribution with

176
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,580
a mean of Mu and

177
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,365
a standard deviation
that is equal to sigma,

178
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,630
the population standard
deviation divided

179
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,300
by the square root
of the sample size.

180
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,770
This fact is exact.

181
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,375
If the population is normal,

182
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,390
then we know this to be true.

183
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,620
More importantly, if we have data

184
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,170
that are not a normal population,

185
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,980
the sampling distribution
of the sample mean still,

186
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,284
approximately has a mean Mu
and a standard deviation

187
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,250
that's the standard deviation of

188
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,400
the population divided by the
square root of sample size.

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,790
So again, if the
population is normal,

190
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,250
the fact is exact and if the
population is not normal,

191
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,245
then the fact is
an approximation,

192
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:39,320
but it is a very very
good approximation.

193
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,170
In fact, it is known as
the Central Limit Theorem.

194
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,820
So that I do not need to know

195
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,475
the underlying distribution
of the population.

196
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,220
I still can figure out the
mean and standard deviation of

197
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,425
the sampling distribution without

198
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,945
needing to assume normality.

199
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,970
The Central Limit
Theorem is a very

200
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,560
powerful theorem and is

201
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,240
crucial to all the methods that

202
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,910
we'll discuss in the
remainder of this course.

203
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,730
As I emphasized before,

204
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,285
the population distribution
does not have to be normal.

205
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:10,060
Any shape for the
population will lead

206
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,640
to a normally shaped distribution
of the sample means,

207
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,695
if we have enough data.

208
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,945
So the power of the
Central Limit Theorem

209
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:19,105
relies upon the sample size.

210
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,770
The more data we collect,

211
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,890
the better the approximation
is and the assumption of

212
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,805
normality becomes irrelevant
as the sample size grows.

213
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,430
We recall the three
population distributions

214
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,480
I showed you before.

215
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,345
On left was a symmetric
normal population.

216
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,830
The middle is a
population that has

217
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,600
a skewed distribution and

218
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,160
the population on the
right had what we

219
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,870
call a uniform distribution,

220
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,445
one in which all ages were

221
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:45,130
equally likely in the population.

222
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,770
If we return to the normal
population and we draw

223
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,090
a sample of 100 people from

224
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,595
that population and
compute a sample mean,

225
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,265
and then we repeat this
process many times

226
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:58,465
getting many sample means
from the population samples,

227
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,190
if we make a histogram
of all sample means,

228
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,380
we have the sampling
distribution.

229
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,910
The sampling distribution is

230
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,380
normally distributed as a mean of

231
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,115
55 which is the same as the
mean in the population,

232
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,050
but we can see that the
standard deviation of

233
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,515
this histogram is smaller.

234
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:17,660
The range of ages in the
right histogram is basically

235
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,095
51-59, instead of 15-95.

236
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,150
The sampling distribution
of the sample mean

237
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,310
has a smaller standard deviation.

238
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,470
It is the standard
deviation of the population

239
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,590
divided by the square
root of the sample size.

240
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,050
So if the population is normal,

241
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,365
the sample means have
a normal distribution.

242
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:39,110
If instead my
population comes from

243
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,720
this uniform distribution
and address samples of

244
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,930
100 people and compute
sample means many times,

245
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,570
you can see that the histogram
on the right has barely

246
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,070
changed from the histogram

247
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,915
when I had a normal population.

248
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,880
This is the power of the
Central Limit Theorem.

249
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,595
The population distribution is

250
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,700
unimportant if my sample
size is big enough.

251
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,800
I still have sample
means that have

252
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,495
a normal distribution centered

253
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:05,485
around the population mean of 55.

254
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,490
So the Central Limit Theorem is

255
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,680
an incredibly powerful concept.

256
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,900
With a large enough
sample of data,

257
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,730
we can use those data to make

258
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,760
statistically valid
conclusions even when we do

259
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,020
not know how values are

260
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,405
actually distributed
in the population.

261
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,715
So specifically, we can combine

262
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:25,310
our data and the
normal distribution

263
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,080
to first make statements about

264
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,500
the population from only
our one sample of data,

265
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,485
and then two to conjecture
how much those statements

266
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:37,103
might vary If we collected
a new sample of data.
