1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,570
I've been enjoying being back. Yeah.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,090
You were back in the classroom last year, but I was in that big auditorium over to speak to.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,020
And that's hard to, like, really engage with people when they're all spread out all over the place.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,560
So this has been a lot of fun. All right.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,980
So we were talking and wonder what we talked about last time.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,250
Again, this is our ritual. Any line, anyone.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,470
No. There is no general topic that we talk about ourselves would be a gas.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,690
Yeah, I think it was like community building.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,090
Right. So what are so when we talk about capacity building, capacity sharing,

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,930
what are some of the dangers of engaging in capacity building or capacity sharing with different communities?

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,340
What are some of the things we can do? Right. Yeah. Like not acknowledging in historical trauma.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,260
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So those are two good things. So one historical trauma, another is tokenizing because that happens a lot.

13
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,000
You know, how many times have you heard low income black communities and public health?

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,630
That's unfortunately a phrase that's used a lot. What does that even mean?

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:23,040
What else? But it's a major debt that we talked about, like who defines capacity and capacity for what's you don't want to,

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
like go into a community and you should have the capacity for this.

17
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,570
Right, exactly. Excellent. Isn't that.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:40,320
Oh, I think sounds like a lot of it feels like we're more harm could be done and like, yeah, all right.

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,540
That's okay. It can be like three quarters or 100%.

20
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:53,580
Yeah. So we can. Yeah, we can. Cause I bring about iatrogenic effects where we actually end up doing more damage than good.

21
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,940
We could be taking our Western values and imposing them on different groups.

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:09,239
Actually, just this morning I am on Tuesdays and Thursdays I meet with our different teams in Kenya.

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,399
And so the project I meet with this morning is for a lesbian body where women in western Kenya and we work with community organizations,

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,960
not universities, because we want to work with around community, not the folk community.

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:30,510
But one thing we were talking about today is how because we've been working with them on really

26
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:37,140
understanding cultural conceptualizations of the process of empowerment for helping women in Kenya.

27
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,690
And one thing that we talked about based on a focus group we just had is about how people often downplay

28
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:53,309
indigenous knowledge and indigenous cultures and traditions and how that's linked to colonization,

29
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,690
because with colonization, certain things were seen as good or desired and other things were not.

30
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,500
So one example they were talking about is formal education.

31
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,690
So formal education, post colonization is seen as a very desirable thing.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,410
So what that's done though is eroded some of the Indigenous cultural traditions and traits and and skills that people had prior to that.

33
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:28,830
So I was thinking that's a good example. If we come in and we say, okay, we're going to provide traditional education.

34
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,680
You mean now in Kenya, it's mostly the British system because that was the colonizers.

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:44,580
If we provide that, we could be actually playing a role in the erasure of indigenous traditions and indigenous skills and talents.

36
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:55,440
So I thought that was a really great example about how in the attempt to build our shared capacity,

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,310
we could actually be eroding local indigenous, traditional cultures.

38
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,079
So I think that's really good for us to think about because again, it's and that's why we start this class so much with critical pedagogy,

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,059
critical conscious to think about these things critically because on the surface it might sound really good, right?

40
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,570
So if we're going to provide let's say we're raising funds to provide school

41
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,340
fees for primary and secondary school children in a rural community in Kenya.

42
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,480
That sounds good. Right.

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:36,720
But what that may be doing is encouraging them to go a particular pathway that is not in alignment with that particular culture.

44
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,990
All right. Well, I will stop there and jump in because I know I was excited to talk to you all.

45
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,370
So we were talking about this model.

46
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,550
We talked about how to gain entry into communities.

47
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:59,340
You know, and again, as I mentioned last class, a lot of, you know, working with communities, you really learn the basic skills in kindergarten.

48
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,850
So don't forget them. You know, you're sitting there like this poster used to be probably years and years ago.

49
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,889
It's like, is it like everything I learned in are like all the rules.

50
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,970
I learn to categorize things like share your toys, people, things like that.

51
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:27,600
In the center part here, we talk about some of the different aspects that can support more reciprocal and collaborative partnerships.

52
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,910
So adequate communication and think about communication.

53
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,270
Is that communication on your terms? Communication on their terms.

54
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,330
So this is one that I hear a lot.

55
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:47,930
And when I was I used to teach master's students here and working with community partners and they'd say things like, why some an email?

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,280
They never sent me one back. It's like, Well, for some small nonprofits, they don't have time to be on email.

57
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,250
You know, they're in the field all the time. And so maybe the best communication could be a text or a call or things like that.

58
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:06,130
So you have to think about what is the best form of communication for your partner, not for you.

59
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,310
Because if you make them use your forms of communication, that's another form of oppression, right?

60
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,020
Because you're taking your values and your power and saying you have to conform to me.

61
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,470
If you want that, I'm giving to you. Whereas we need to go in and say, What is the best way for us to communicate?

62
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,260
You know, is it best to do this or that? One thing I see a lot now is people using Slack.

63
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,260
And, you know, again, I worked a lot of committee like, what the hell's the slack?

64
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,040
And now I'm not going to use it.

65
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,390
And I was actually meeting not long ago where people were really pushing and they just stopped and said, We're not doing this.

66
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:52,840
You know, this is not going to work because it's not what the community wants and needs respect for diversity, and that's diversity on all levels.

67
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,740
Culture of learning is learning is bi directional, reciprocal.

68
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,350
You're learning about the community. The community is learning about you respect the culture of the setting.

69
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:10,000
So I mentioned last time we talked about how different settings have rituals, they have cultural practices.

70
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:19,870
Celeste said mention about the one article that we wrote where we had this essay on this tradition of every day, like 1030 or so,

71
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:30,880
one of the women from the community came by with food and everyone would stop whatever you're doing and go out and get food from the food cart.

72
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,930
And I remember one time we had we had written a proposal for a big CBC grant.

73
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,090
We were a finalist. And so we had all these like big shots from the CDC coming to visit us.

74
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:49,150
And we were in the middle of the meeting and the bell rang and the entire like team went out to get food.

75
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,809
And all the CDC people were like sitting there, look at me like, What's going on?

76
00:07:52,810 --> 00:08:02,170
Where is everyone? And so I had to explain to them, this is the culture, you know, this is what we need to respect developing an action agenda.

77
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,530
And I think a lot of times work with community based organizations.

78
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:16,690
Sometimes people are more focused on what the public health professional wants, and that may not be the actions the community needs.

79
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,010
And sometimes we have to have multiple agendas. So you may have funding to do a program on healthy eating,

80
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:32,080
but the agency also needs help with some other aspect of their organizational functioning or their programing.

81
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,450
Take that on there too, and make sure that your action items are about them.

82
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,629
And then trust and mutual respect. Trust is not given.

83
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,780
It's earned. And sometimes people will test you.

84
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:53,950
You know, I've been tested by different community organizations. I think especially as a white man working in communities of color,

85
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,990
I should be tested because there's a lot of people that look like me who've done really [INAUDIBLE] things.

86
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,730
So I just expect that, you know, in some groups I will be tested.

87
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,560
The one organization that I worked with years ago, I had one woman who was running the young women's program,

88
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:20,049
was not thrilled with the fact that I was working with her organization and would give

89
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:28,150
me the the side I at all of our meetings and just really test me multiple times.

90
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Like we would go out to eat and she would give me the hottest salsa that they had because she wanted to see.

91
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,270
As she told me later, I wanted to see the white boy cry and it was hot.

92
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,930
I know now that I'm older I can't do that anymore. But when I was younger I used to love it.

93
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,650
So I'm like, Bring it on, sister. Just give me as much hot sauce as you want.

94
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,730
And then the true test she gave me was we were at a cultural event and a fundraiser,

95
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,830
and people were out there dancing and it was at a very gay friendly space.

96
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,510
And so she told me that I had to go out and dance with one of the men that was part of our group.

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,510
And so I'm like, Sure, I'll go out there. So we went out there and dance together and I came back and she said, Okay, you're in.

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,450
So that was like she was very clear and we talked about her.

99
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,550
She's like, Yeah, I was going to test the [INAUDIBLE] out of you to make sure that you were really connected with.

100
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,769
And you cared about us. And sometimes you are going to be put through the wringer.

101
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,500
And that's okay, because there's no reason why they should should trust you right from the get go.

102
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,150
The last part is recognizing the benefits and outcomes.

103
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,459
So, you know, with these partnerships, you can have increased funding for the CBOs and the researchers learning opportunities,

104
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,620
capacity and skills building and sharing. Also documentation of the CBOs efforts.

105
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,400
A lot of times CBOs don't have the time and energy to document everything,

106
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,390
and that's something that we can do more easily a lot of times, and then increased access and increased ownership.

107
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,769
This is just from another project one of my doctoral students did back in the day.

108
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:23,999
This was a part of a multi-site study, 14 sites across the US and we were interviewing people in these community university

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,170
partnerships to find out kind of what what advice they had for academics.

110
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,680
So it's really that community sign saying, this is what we want you to do.

111
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,259
Some of the other recommendations were to define partnership and project success,

112
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,040
because sometimes what we consider success from an academic or public health perspective is not what they consider success.

113
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,960
Our success might be we had 50 people go through the intervention.

114
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,730
Their success might be that they were able to find a staff member to work on this project.

115
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,710
So what, you know, how do we define what it is? Building mutual trust and respect that came up again, exploring power dynamics.

116
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:13,110
And one thing that was interesting in some of what we heard from people is that

117
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,090
that process of exploring power dynamics needs to be a joint process together.

118
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,569
And it's not just about the academics sitting in their little circle talking about, you know, their own power dynamics.

119
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,230
But you have to create space for those open conversations and then sharing power.

120
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,510
And the reason why we have, if desired, because some of the organizations talk about how they don't have the time to do certain tasks.

121
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,320
So I think I mentioned the last one. So sometimes they don't want to share power.

122
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,540
Sometimes they're like, Look, this is you, this is your word.

123
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,060
And I have that before where I work with organizations and I'm trying to be collaborative and have them work with us.

124
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,660
And I've had some people say, Gary, I really appreciate it.

125
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:07,080
I don't have the time. So if you could just develop this Pre-post test survey for us and I'll look at it at the end, that would be great.

126
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:15,180
So sometimes we do have to really find out if our because sometimes our power sharing could be more stressful,

127
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,929
because with power comes responsibility and work. And so sometimes we're just like, you know, I'm not having it.

128
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,220
I can't do it right now. Assessing strengths. And again, a lot of work with nonprofit organizations,

129
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:37,139
low resource communities is often very hierarchical and often focused on what are the

130
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,960
weaknesses in the community that you're coming in to kind of thinks or are improve.

131
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,860
So one strong message is look at what we do well, look at our strengths,

132
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,050
look at the power we have, and then creating an equitable resource access and allocation.

133
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,490
Unfortunately, with funding, sometimes through public health departments and through the federal government and working in community initiatives,

134
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:07,110
the money goes to universities, are lower large organizations, and then the community agencies get a smaller amount.

135
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:13,950
So they were really pushing to make sure that it's equitable. So all the funding isn't just going to the universities.

136
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm going to bring you through this next one so that we can jump over to culture.

137
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,430
So this is one of the articles that we co-wrote together with one of our community partners.

138
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,459
And these were at the end of the article after we we wrote a check that was it

139
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,080
took us about a year and a half to write that because it was truly co-written.

140
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,250
Sometimes I've worked with partners where they really want us to do most of the work and then they give input.

141
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,780
This was actually each of six of us who co-wrote it, wrote sections, and then we came together and discuss it.

142
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,360
We wrote section. So it was a very long process.

143
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,400
But one thing that we really wanted to do is to have recommendations for people who are engaged in collaborative partnership.

144
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,590
So one of the big things was building relationships.

145
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,490
So investing time and sharing information about work related constraints, demands and nightmare dynamics of us.

146
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,880
Again, making sure we're not coming in with our academic brains and thinking that our workspace is the same.

147
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,750
Define what the roles and responsibilities are.

148
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,549
Learn about unique communities and cultures by participant activities.

149
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,940
We've talked about that some. Share your belief and value system.

150
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,220
Sometimes your value systems may not align with the agency, and it's not going to be a good fit.

151
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,390
So if you're working, let's say, in the area of substance use and you're coming from more of a harm reduction framework,

152
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,830
and then you're coming from an abstinence, you know, abstain from all substance use framework, those don't align.

153
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,360
They're both legitimate public health approaches, but they don't align philosophically.

154
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:03,360
So you have to make sure that your belief systems are shared. And then we talk about about rituals also building on existing strengths.

155
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,070
So create strategies for decreasing power differentials.

156
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,490
So one big thing is just where do you meet? How do you meet?

157
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:17,610
How does that meeting go on? A lot of times it's done with academic frameworks, not community frameworks.

158
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,560
So going to the community agency and again, I think I've shared before, like in Kenya,

159
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,760
you never start a meeting with I'm talking about how did you sleep and how is your family?

160
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,300
So if that's a tradition, that's how you should should work.

161
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:40,470
Make sure people don't have too many responsibilities because your collaborative partnership is probably only one of 20 jobs that they actually have.

162
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:51,990
Connect educational sessions on the project, assess necessary skills, and then provide resources and training so people have the skills.

163
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,780
The last is building a sense of commitment to the project, so make sure you're again having efficient methods for communication.

164
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,950
Have recognizable benefits include short and long term goals. One thing we've done on different projects is the beginning of each meeting.

165
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:18,810
We have visual representations of our progress because again, if you think about the academic world, we're used to delaying gratification, right?

166
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,270
So it takes you four years in a bachelor's, it takes you many years to get a PhD.

167
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,459
We're used to that. If you're in a nonprofit organization, you're not used to delaying you.

168
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,880
Can you kind of to do that? So we found it really helpful to show visually different goals.

169
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:43,440
So we've done things like a giant thermometer with different tasks are in color coded, different diagrams with different things like that.

170
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,820
Get input from all members. Individualize your training, follow up lines.

171
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,030
Right. And that's it. Any question? And I talk really, really fast.

172
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,710
All right. Everyone said I already for the special guest appearance.

173
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,740
So put your hands together. So enjoy class.

174
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,820
If there is any emergency. I'm going to send someone up to my office.

175
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,310
Know if they're mean to you. You guys left? Right. All right.

176
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,300
Well, I'll see you again on Thursday. You're going to do an amazing job.

177
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:37,030
This is going to be like you that the typing is not all that great.

178
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:48,160
Okay. All right.

179
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,260
So let's get started. So Gary went through a lot of the framework stuff, which I know can kind of be,

180
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,710
you know, a little bit like just like listening to a lot of information.

181
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,970
So we'll start off with a discussion about culture.

182
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,490
The two calls that are here I thought were really interesting to start off this topic.

183
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,120
So the first is different cultures are produced when individuals get together to live their lives differently,

184
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,400
which I think is a really good just framing of what culture means.

185
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:29,290
And then the second is a people without knowledge of their past history, audience and culture is like a tree without roots,

186
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,960
which again, I think that that is another great quote to get us thinking about what we're going to talk about.

187
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,120
So actually, before I saw that image, what is culture?

188
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,850
I know you're like, start off with a class discussion.

189
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:58,490
So hopefully while a little bit awake now on culture, I just yes, I just think of like what it consists of for use like in history.

190
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,910
Yeah. Traditions. Traditions are very important.

191
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,980
It's using the shared experiences of those things that you mentioned to people for whatever reason.

192
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,370
Yeah, that's really important. The sharing is like also really integral with what culture is anybody else?

193
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:22,600
What is culture? If you were to ask your family, like, what is our culture?

194
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:31,430
What would they say? Like, what kind of things would they talk about? Of beliefs of language.

195
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,330
Both that beliefs and language and language. Yeah.

196
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,399
Language is super important, especially like I mean, everybody calls it something different,

197
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,000
but like slang or like casual language of like that's really just share within your culture or your community.

198
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:52,339
Yeah, that's a really big one. Yeah. I think kind of going off the beliefs thing like I think sometimes like religion can like have

199
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,940
a role in culture like kind of influence the traditions and the culture and stuff like that.

200
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:02,570
Yeah, it's super lean for a lot of people, depending on like what your religion is or where you're from.

201
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:08,690
And sometimes it's completely separate, but a lot of times it can be very linked to anybody else.

202
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,020
Yeah, you mentioned like, what would your family say? That made me think like, I think family plays a big role.

203
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:21,590
Yeah. Like family structure or dynamic. And then also, like, because your family has so much influence on you.

204
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,170
Yeah, that's huge. Family influence. Definitely. Anybody else?

205
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Yeah. So all of that is very important and all relevant to this image here.

206
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:45,880
So in thinking about what culture is and what it means, there's invisible causes and then there's also visible signs.

207
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,360
So especially with like living in such a digital world now,

208
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,650
so much of other people's culture that we probably would not have been exposed to in the way we are.

209
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,830
So especially when thinking about social media, it's so funny because when I was like, really?

210
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,420
And like I have questions for my parents or something or even my grandparents and I'll be on my grandparents house.

211
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,780
My grandparents had like this big, huge, like encyclopedia collection.

212
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,770
It was like all these books, literally a book book and like, it was huge.

213
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,250
And so if I had questions about something and they didn't know how to answer it, they would be like, Look it up in the encyclopedia.

214
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,000
So they knew, like go over, like pull out whatever letter it was.

215
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,260
And then and that's how you found stuff out back then. Like, I was like, I'm thinking back to like when I was like six, seven, you know what I mean?

216
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,659
And you could see pictures and like all kinds of things about whatever it was that you were asking about.

217
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:46,740
And so that is how we got to learn about other people, other cultures, other things or things that we just didn't know about.

218
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:54,160
And now we live in an age where you can literally just like Google it or like look it up on TikTok or like look it up wherever.

219
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,450
So it's like way different, but it's a lot more visuals.

220
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,620
The like is not just the image on a page, right? It's like a video.

221
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,870
It's like someone from within that culture telling you something about themselves and their culture.

222
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,969
And so it's a lot more engaged and the environment is a huge part of it.

223
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,090
And so that's something that you can see, something that you can feel like touch, and you can really get to know people in that way.

224
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,090
Or you can see like visually, digitally, on social media and then also behaviors.

225
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,680
You see how people interact, you see how people like talk, you see other people think because of the things that they share.

226
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,550
So those two things are like really important because there are things that you can like see and hear.

227
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:42,510
Right. And then there's also invisible causes. So like at the bottom here, you have a values and attitudes.

228
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,690
You know, you can learn a lot about a culture based on what they say about themselves, like what you see.

229
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,950
But sometimes that doesn't really share with you exactly like what they value and what their attitudes for something are.

230
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,750
So you really have to get to know people to really understand their culture, right? You can't just make assumptions.

231
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,569
You can't just, you know, think that's, you know,

232
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,340
you really have to get to know people because these are things that you can't just, like, see and assume.

233
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,100
Right. And then the last being the fundamental and some fundamental assumptions and beliefs.

234
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,459
So especially when thinking about when is easier to about religion, that's a good example about, you know,

235
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,920
something that's fundamental or something that people might believe that might be a part of their culture, or am I not?

236
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,660
It might just be something that they believe, but it's not related to like really, truly their culture.

237
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:40,050
And then in the middle here, I think that this sentence is a really interesting one because it's like things around here, you know,

238
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,790
have you ever heard like people say that before or like whether it's in your family or not, you know, that's really essential.

239
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:53,190
That statement is just really kind of like really framing what a culture means and what a culture is.

240
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:59,370
Sometimes it literally is just the way that they they do things, the way that I do things, the way that me and my family do things.

241
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:08,550
Right. So all of those are really critical. So actually, before I go on the next slide, who defines a culture?

242
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:24,360
How is that defined? How is that decided? I think for a lot of cultures, it's just.

243
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:35,070
Traditional. It's just the traditions we've had for years and generations and generations and what pertains to that culture.

244
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:42,360
And so sometimes it's a lot harder to define who is it that actually is influencing you when it's something you've done, right?

245
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, that's really key. Tradition is like a huge part of culture, right?

246
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,490
Especially when I think about that.

247
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,170
I think about like when you said that about my own family and the conversations that we've had about different things like,

248
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,690
oh my, my grandmother on my mom's side is from like a rural area of Georgia.

249
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:11,040
Cool. Like, to this day, I think they have, like, one stoplight, like when it was like like I've never been my mom has been a few times,

250
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,019
but my grandma is super, super southern like Southern dishes.

251
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:25,710
Like, I remember one time I told her I was in college and I went to college in the same city that she lived in or lives in.

252
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,930
And she was asking why she sent me home with like a whole bunch of food that she cooked and stuff.

253
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,770
And then later that week I was talking to her, she was like, Did you eat the food?

254
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,610
I mean, I was like, yeah, it, it, you know, I'm going to go to the grocery store signing tonight.

255
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,829
And she was like, What are you cooking? And I was like, I'm going to make tacos. And she was like, Why are you making tacos?

256
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:53,920
And she has never had a before in her life. And so it's so interesting because her response was, well, why aren't you making like some dish, like a C?

257
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,599
I actually really like it. Liver and onions she makes.

258
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:07,919
I know it sounds like really gross La-Z-Boy why don't you make that like you know I like it was hard for me to explain to her that like,

259
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,579
you know, we live in a society now where, like, you share recipes,

260
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,120
like people know how to make different dishes and that we only we don't only stick to like the dishes that we know or that are like handed down,

261
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,149
right? At least like my generation.

262
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:27,209
So like trying to explain this to her, she just doesn't understand it because back then there was not a lot of culture sharing,

263
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,750
you know, like there were no, you know, Mexican restaurants for her to go to.

264
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,239
There are no like Indian restaurants for her to go to or anything. And so it's very interesting to see that shift.

265
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,220
But it is all based on tradition. Right. And like what is passed down to what, you know, is shared to the current or future generations.

266
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,330
So anybody else, how else is culture defined? I feel like we're talking a lot about informal cultures,

267
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,200
but I also think there's a lot of like formal cultures that are defined kind

268
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,709
of by like some either the people within it or like some sort of authority.

269
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,270
Like we talk about like religion. Like a lot of times the culture of religion is defined by like the religious

270
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,059
leaders and they get like a lot of just go back to like history and tradition.

271
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,700
But like I also think or you think about like University of Michigan as like its own culture.

272
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,529
Like a lot of times it's like a very formal process of like what are our traditions?

273
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:24,359
And so I think that there is such a wide variety of like scope and formality and size of like the cultures that we're talking about,

274
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,360
that it can really be almost defined by body one or anything.

275
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,510
Yeah, that's a great point. Like it really can't be defined by anyone and everyone or anyone and everyone,

276
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:42,420
especially when love that you brought up like the University of Michigan because there is like there's a specific culture at each university, right?

277
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:51,299
And everyone is different. Every campus is different. And a part of that also is like the traditions that are shared down.

278
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:59,280
So like thinking about like the collegiate community and how different traditions, like I feel like for me as a doctoral student, you know,

279
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,189
like I'm a student here and I feel like I'm a part of Michigan, but my experience is completely different than undergraduate, you know,

280
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:13,620
like I feel like because you go to orientation, you get these like, you know, cool, like pieces of knowledge and like songs and like traditions that,

281
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,720
like, you learn when you first come here and then when you graduate, there are traditions surrounding that as well.

282
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:25,500
And so I think that that is a really good point that you bring up also related to that because of the doubt.

283
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:34,620
But it can change too. So yeah, that's a great point. Anyone else who defines culture like how else is it defined?

284
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,780
Yeah. Something that I'm thinking about is, like, intentionally, like, just kinda intentionally dismantle.

285
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,130
You know, I guess, like, thinking historically, like in the transatlantic slave trade,

286
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:57,250
like it was a very intentional decision to split like people from different cultures and different backgrounds and languages on the same.

287
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,400
And they want to have any form of like communication or something like a completely new culture came out of that experience.

288
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:10,040
Like you're with people that you've never seen, like you don't really understand their backgrounds and stuff, but within that like forms and cultures.

289
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:18,570
So I feel like sometimes cultures can be like shaped out of like I know we talked about in class classes like share trauma and things like that,

290
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,210
kind of just having to come out of the situations that you put in.

291
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:29,510
Yeah, yeah. That's a great, excellent point. There's definitely like you see that in in different ways even now.

292
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:37,690
Right. So thinking historically that, yes, the, the transatlantic slave trade really created that and it was very intentional.

293
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,990
And then you see the like remnants of that still today, right?

294
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:49,900
So like even like, you know, you would see or like an example I could think of is if someone was speaking another language here, right?

295
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,980
And then someone says like, you know, go back to where you came from or, you know, something along those lines.

296
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:04,569
That is a way of like stripping people from their culture to like form them and like make them assimilate to the culture here,

297
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,640
you know, meaning in this country. And so I think that that's an excellent point that you bring up.

298
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,540
And so I think now today it's definitely, I would say, somewhat more acceptable, becoming more acceptable,

299
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,530
I should say, but not necessarily like what dissolved or it's not like that has gone away.

300
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,280
Right. So anyone else any other thoughts?

301
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:36,570
Okay. So we're going to go through some definitions.

302
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,180
There's a lot of definitions about culture here. It's like a few slides just to give you a heads up.

303
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,120
So we'll go through these.

304
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:53,070
But the key here is that there are different definitions of culture depending on the discipline that you're looking at or thinking, right.

305
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,410
And so I'm going to show you different examples of that because I think is really key that,

306
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,470
you know, I think in public health, a lot of the times, you know,

307
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,140
we're pretty interdisciplinary, but we also still try to find things by like,

308
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,170
this is what this is the definition, the public health definition of things. Right.

309
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,020
But it is really important that we include other definitions of culture, other definitions of community,

310
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,879
like all these different things, because we're not really completely the experts of culture.

311
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,220
Right. We might be the the experts of like how culturally health or things like that.

312
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,250
But it's really important that we really think about what is the definition of culture as defined by other disciplines.

313
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,270
So first we'll think through anthropology.

314
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,920
So looking at these perspectives on culture.

315
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:52,950
So as you can see in the first definition that says that complex, that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law,

316
00:32:53,010 --> 00:33:01,079
customs and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society is pretty old definition,

317
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,200
but a lot of the things that you all share is like here in this definition, right?

318
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,670
And then also secondly, culture can be seen as a set of guidelines,

319
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,970
both explicit and an implicit that individuals inherent as members of a particular society,

320
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:25,110
it tells them how to view the world, how to experience an emotional part of behave in it in relation to other people,

321
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,890
to supernatural forces or God into their natural environment.

322
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,350
I think, again,

323
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:40,500
we talked about a few of these things are right things that a set of guidelines that are passed down from people who are told how to view the world,

324
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,110
how to experience it, etc. And so in this third definition,

325
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:53,910
I really like because it's talking about the way we transmit guidelines to the next generation through symbols, language, art and ritual.

326
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,840
You know, I think it's really important that no matter and again, people can have multiple cultures.

327
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,290
It's not like you are a member of one culture. And that's right, as we've kind of talked about.

328
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,750
But it is important that you share that with those that come after you.

329
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,240
Right? Like if my grandma didn't teach me how to make certain dishes, I wouldn't know how to make it right.

330
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:23,459
If, like, you know, if like when I think about when I was a freshman in college, at the school I went to, you know,

331
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,720
there are a lot of things that were shared to me that maybe transfer students didn't get,

332
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,830
you know, like different traditions at the university and things of that sort.

333
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:39,750
But you have to share that with other people. And then also culture can be seen as adherence it lens through which the people,

334
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,790
the individual perceives and understands the world that they inhabit and learns to live within it.

335
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:58,850
Okay. And so also thinking about sociology as well, I really like to go to a lot of sociology papers as well in my research because

336
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,620
it really I think it really is a great description of different cultural things.

337
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,429
And because a lot of my research also relates to culture as well.

338
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,830
And so I really like to go to sociology papers for a lot of different things I'm looking for for my papers.

339
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:18,560
But sociology is often focused on understanding culture through its focus on groups,

340
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,600
their norms, shared expectations, beliefs and ways of doing things.

341
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,680
So that's the reason why I kind of pose the question on who defines what a culture is, because it really is.

342
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:37,460
They're the focus of groups right through focusing on what is shared between people,

343
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:44,660
because really culture can be defined by really just people who want to create a culture of X, Y and Z, right?

344
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,880
Or who share some sort of experience. And those are the people that define the culture.

345
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,160
Right? It's really important that other people don't define it for them and they define it for themselves.

346
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,910
And so cultures are also generally thought to develop societies, deal with the geography,

347
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,320
deal with the geography that the group inhabits and the resources available there.

348
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:18,330
Why is that important? Thinking about geography, which I don't know much about.

349
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,950
I need to know. Why is that important?

350
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:29,050
Resources. Geography? Yes. And what we talk about, like food as culture.

351
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:37,890
And I feel like that could influence what food like or even like methods of transportation or like the kind of I don't know.

352
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,390
I don't know, maybe the communities like what those look like based on like where you live.

353
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,050
Right. Yeah. It's like around that. That's huge, though, Jason.

354
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,709
If I'm actually I think I when I, when I asked that question,

355
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:56,940
like that's a really pretty unique thing that you raised there because interpretation is really actually very interesting.

356
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,760
So like thinking about here in Michigan, you know, what is the big way people get around?

357
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,299
We do have a decent like at least here we have a decent public transportation system.

358
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,410
But, you know, that is much different than New York City.

359
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:16,860
Right? Is very normal in New York City to walk everywhere or like walk at least to subway station and things of that sort.

360
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,890
So yeah. And then also thinking about food, right.

361
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:28,320
Um, I think now that is still pretty important, maybe less so than like, let's say like 50 years ago.

362
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:35,610
Um, because of like just the development of like transportation and like sharing of foods and stuff like that.

363
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:42,689
But decades ago, people used to rely on what was grown like right there for them right at that time.

364
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,220
So now there's really surrounded the seasons changing and things of that sort

365
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,360
and that is really something that really developed a lot of cultural issues.

366
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,690
Why else why else is this important?

367
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:04,270
Yeah, I was thinking about how cultures can be differentiated through like geography, through like experiences shared in that region.

368
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,010
Resources pertain to that, that location.

369
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:15,560
And then also on the idea that like people like living within the geography can be just like other cultures sense.

370
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,700
Like maybe there's a little bit of like similarities in their cultures.

371
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,970
There's like unique approach to their culture that.

372
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,220
She's. Yeah, that's huge. That's a really great point.

373
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,430
That culture can be defined by location and that depending on where you live.

374
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,800
Like think about who has lived and who hasn't lived in Michigan like their whole lives or.

375
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,629
Okay. Quite a few people.

376
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:50,040
So like somebody share an example of something that is different from where they're from, like literally thinking about physically versus here.

377
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,170
How is that different? How how are the cultures different? We get one example.

378
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,660
Yeah, well, I was just thinking because like I grew up when I was younger, I grew up in Texas.

379
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,889
Uh huh. The opposite of Michigan. Yeah. And just like.

380
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:14,220
Even, like the way of life, like how people, like, everyone is more slower and, you know, like the like now.

381
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:24,700
Culture versus shaping culture. Right. It's a little bit more not like muscling per se, but I think it's more like.

382
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,430
I don't know. Yeah. There is a big significant difference between the two.

383
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,730
Yeah. So you, like, feel the difference even if you don't, like, have the words to describe it.

384
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,030
You like to feel like that's very important.

385
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,210
Anybody else want to share? You don't have to do that.

386
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:55,450
I feel like, yeah, it comes to like, for example, like I'm from like, Virginia, it's like more than it's like coming from like I can,

387
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,780
like, instantly, like, tell, like the difference of, like when I land here, like my land there.

388
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,649
I don't know why, but I think it's like I think like in Virginia,

389
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:09,300
there's always that like like this, you know, it's like people are always, like, on the move.

390
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,690
No one ever, like, stops to, like, talk or, like, do anything, really.

391
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,800
But then, whereas, like, here, like, everyone's, like, a little, like, more like, chill out.

392
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,240
Yeah, that's cool. Yeah. Did you hold your hand up, too? Yeah, we're from the same area.

393
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:28,690
Oh, okay. I was just going to add, I feel like there's a culture here around the weather, like the temperature specifically,

394
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,370
like there's a very specific temperature range where it's acceptable to bring out a winter coat.

395
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,850
Yeah. Like this morning, I was like, oh, no. Like, is it.

396
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,020
Is it cold enough to break it out? Is that too southern of me or whatever?

397
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,910
But I think that's really funny. It's like really strict norms like you don't see and yeah.

398
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,479
As are coming out as early as you do. That's hilarious.

399
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,570
I mean, but that is so true because I'm from a high of when, you know, the weather is fairly similar.

400
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,580
I would say, again, like I was downtown Detroit maybe like a couple of months ago, like sometime in September.

401
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,230
And it was a chilly day, but it wasn't cold. And they were playing the Houston Astros and there was a Astros fan and she had on a bubble called,

402
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,930
which was really cute because they match like their colors and everything.

403
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:22,660
All that all is super cute, but it's like 55 degrees, like, you know, or like my sister lives in L.A. so when I go and visit her,

404
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,110
like it can get down to like 60 and people are pulling out the bulk of the money that you say that,

405
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,350
because I'm definitely one of those people who are like, why are you doing that?

406
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:41,170
But it's a culture thing, right? So I think that's or it's like a, like you said, a social norm or something that like everyone from a certain place,

407
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,970
like, might believe or like, have attitudes towards. Right. So anyone else?

408
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,890
Yeah, I guess it's like a little different, but I'm from upstate New York and politics just aren't really talked about that much cause

409
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,410
it's already just kind of collectively understood that it's going to end up a certain way.

410
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,850
And just like New York State being in general, but like coming here, everyone's like in your face trying to convince you like different perspectives.

411
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,719
Just because there's so many, it's more diverse, I guess, in the political landscape in the state.

412
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,560
And your experience. Yeah, that is super interesting.

413
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:20,110
Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that like and how like when I was preparing for this lecture, how like politics is also related to that, right?

414
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,329
Maybe not how people think or like their opinions on their politics, but more so like, is it shared?

415
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:31,510
Is it talked about? Is it not like how like what is the norm and how people approach it as a community or a culture?

416
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,500
Yeah, just. Just presence and like conversation. Exactly. Yeah, that's cool.

417
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:41,170
Anybody else? Yeah, I just think it's like, interesting how, like, each group can also be considered a culture.

418
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,249
Like when I was here, like, you know, the time I eat dinner, the things that I do are so much more different than when I'm, like, home with my family.

419
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,170
And I'm just like, you know, a regular kid, like, well, even earlier, it's like all these things.

420
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,540
So it's kind of like it's own culture. Oh, yeah, definitely.

421
00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:00,940
That's actually really important too, because like one of my professors, she talks about this all the time of how like in public health,

422
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:08,830
we focus a lot of our public health interventions on like younger populations or older populations, but not like the in between of like 30 to 60.

423
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:17,859
And I think it's also because of that a little bit too, like you can target like public health interventions a lot easier to like 18 to 25 year

424
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,020
olds because kind of like the culture surrounding that age is a little bit more different.

425
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,170
Right. It's a little bit easier in some ways, maybe not others.

426
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:34,510
But yeah, that's a really important point for sure. And then also in the media, how like they're always like millennials are this way,

427
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:40,660
Gen Z or this way, like all that annoying stuff that on anybody else.

428
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,360
I really great thoughts so I don't get inspired by them.

429
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,500
And so like the third bullet point to it is culture is maintained by numbers and culture,

430
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,000
teaching newcomers, the values, processes and behaviors which we've talked about a little bit.

431
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:05,350
And actually this last time that I didn't really address, but that's related is that again,

432
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:15,070
those things are perceived as contributing to the group survival. So again, if different things aren't passed down, they will cease to exist.

433
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,160
Right. And then also thinking about psychology as well.

434
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,530
So looking at the psychological perspective,

435
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,630
some psychological researchers attempt to discover both universal and culture specific psychological principles,

436
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,909
which I thought was an interesting point, but also for cross-cultural psychology,

437
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:43,700
as culture is learned and bounded by groups, behavioral norms, values, beliefs and symbols.

438
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,910
So that second point is really important because you think about the psychology behind it.

439
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,110
It really is really driven by behaviors and beliefs, right?

440
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,930
Attitudes about certain things in the behaviors about surrounding anything.

441
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,280
So it's really interesting to think about that from the psychological perspective.

442
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:12,769
And then also the last bullet is believed to think that or believe that these culture bound constructs can

443
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:18,320
be used to understand and explain similarities and differences in psychological processes across cultures.

444
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,860
So let's talk about this one a little bit. Can somebody I know this is like, you know.

445
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,290
I didn't think I would say. Can somebody explain to me, like, what this bullet might mean?

446
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,940
And, like, a real standpoint. So, like, yeah. So I'm in a class right now.

447
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:42,530
It's a sociology class. We talk about like medicalization and how like diseases understood in different cultures and, and different groups.

448
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:50,330
And like something that's really interesting is we talk about how certain diagnoses exist in some cultures and not in others.

449
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,340
And like if what Gary was saying about how like what we might call like substance misuse,

450
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:02,090
you're like where he went into this global word, like drinking six beers is like normal and inappropriate and not a sign of concern.

451
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,309
So I think like connecting it to public health,

452
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:12,410
I think that it's so important to understand how a problem is understood in the culture or if it even is a problem in that culture.

453
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,340
Because I think that. Is so necessary for trying to like mitigate,

454
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:25,960
to understand how it's understood and what causes it in that culture that's spot on, like seriously such spotlight.

455
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,340
And that's a huge part of like, like my research as well.

456
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:35,520
I do research on black adolescents and college students and thinking about mental health and how it impacts them.

457
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,870
And so when you think about like when I look at some of my research, you know,

458
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,489
a lot of young people are saying, like, you know, I want to tell my parents that their peers.

459
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,910
Right, because of the culture and this isn't for everybody,

460
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:54,780
but because of the culture from a lot of people, a lot of blacks and how they view therapy and counseling.

461
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,870
Right. Oh, you don't need it. Just go to church, you know, things like that.

462
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,990
So you really have to really think thoroughly about how people understand things and like how is it

463
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:09,800
similar or different when even within the culture or like different than other cultures as well.

464
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,290
So that's a really, really keeping. Any other thoughts about this?

465
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:22,140
Anybody else have any other ways of thinking? Okay.

466
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:30,190
Okay. So let's also talk about subculture as well.

467
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:43,060
What does subculture mean? Without looking at the screen, because I know you all know what it means.

468
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,629
Yeah. This is just symbolic. Am I?

469
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:59,890
Why is that important to talk about? Because they can do things a lot differently.

470
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:09,050
Like the culture. As well as legitimate traditions and processes along.

471
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:21,680
Sure. Definitely. Yeah. I just think that's important because like we talk about a lot how like one person can be a spokesperson for multiple people.

472
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,390
And like I said, people are not a monolith.

473
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:37,190
So like having a subculture where people are able to maybe like step out of the defined stereotypes of what a certain culture can be or has to be.

474
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:44,780
And just like, you know. Shared experiences of people who look like them, but also don't look at how they're supposed to act.

475
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:48,110
Yeah. Yeah. No, that makes a ton of sense.

476
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:56,540
Like, I think everything you've all said is just super important, and it's not all that similar outside it, because that's how we talk about like,

477
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:03,590
you know, we've talked about tokenism and things of that sort and that, you know, one way that people define culture is by thinking, right?

478
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,759
They define culture by race or ethnicity.

479
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,600
And it's assumed that everyone that looks like that or everyone that looks

480
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,219
like me thinks the same way or have the same cultural values and traditions.

481
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:23,540
And that's not true. Right. And so that's the problem when we do have, you know, tokenism and things of that, sort of like, you know,

482
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,170
people shouldn't be asked to be a spokesperson for a certain group because there are plenty of different cultures within that group.

483
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,940
There are plenty of different ways of doing things, different values, different beliefs that exist.

484
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,840
It can be like specifically defined, right? And so when we think about some cultures as well, you know,

485
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:48,469
we really want to I think that this is more so like the way to think about culture and not necessarily only specific

486
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:54,920
to like race or ethnicity and things of that sort because it can be pretty different across different areas.

487
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,180
It could be based on location, it can be based on, you know, all of the different types of things.

488
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:08,750
So yeah, so it is a smaller and more homogenous unit of social organization that is bound by shared life experiences.

489
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:15,190
We've talked about, you know, colleges and universities, how specific different, you know,

490
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:20,930
that culture can be for different campuses or even like even within the university.

491
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:26,450
Like this university is huge, right? So like there are definitely subcultures within the university.

492
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,650
Like you can't say that, you know, everyone thinks the same here.

493
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:39,740
You know, every every school within the university is the same because there are like very specific cultural differences vary from school to school.

494
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,540
I don't know. Is that the case too, for like residence halls and things like that?

495
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,580
I don't know if that is here, but I know like that when I was in college, so I don't know.

496
00:50:52,910 --> 00:51:00,260
But these common experiences going to the second bullet point produced cultural customs and traditions that promote a mutual sense of belonging,

497
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:12,590
which are maintained within a larger culture. And so are there any challenges with some culture or we talked about long we talk about tokenism.

498
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:21,710
Not so. So let me clarify my question as well. Not challenges with having subcultures, but other challenges in public health surrounding subcultures.

499
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,670
We talked about tokenism as one area that has potentially or has been an issue and can put it will continue to be an issue.

500
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:37,549
But any other challenges maybe like targeting interventions because like maybe a subculture that's not as visible and like doing an intervention?

501
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:47,720
And then while you're doing intervention, yeah, I would definitely make it harder in the sense of like I must have a target subgroup now.

502
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:53,420
Right, exactly. That's exactly one thing that I was getting at too, because that's super important, right?

503
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,820
And like throughout the whole semester, we talked about why it's important to like work directly with communities,

504
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:05,660
why it's important to really, truly get to know communities, get to know each other, have that like share shared experience with them.

505
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:14,180
You might find that these aren't again, what you assume that they that they are to be or that the community working with,

506
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,170
you know, that they might not see the issue in the same way that you see it.

507
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,370
Right. That's why it's so important to do that.

508
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,810
Working with communities and the other challenges,

509
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:33,020
I think it's easy to assume that subculture shares the same values as the culture that it stems off of in trying to create intervention.

510
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:40,010
You might group it with the larger culture if it's like a small subculture as and so yeah.

511
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,970
So I think that's also a great challenge. Yeah, definitely.

512
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:50,960
I think. Yeah, just to add on to everything, I think it's hard because it's constantly changing.

513
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,240
So like when even like an intervention you could do in like a year ago.

514
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,850
Yeah. Is it the same subculture it has completely different meanings is constantly changing.

515
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,230
Like what's considered like a tradition?

516
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,550
Yeah, that's a really key point. Like culture does shift and change pretty quickly, right?

517
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:19,790
Maybe there are some things that are long lasting, you know, some areas of a particular culture that, you know,

518
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:26,419
might be tied to religion or might be tied to, you know, something else, maybe a location where they're like thinking about all those things.

519
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:34,610
Right? So there are some, you know, cultural bases or thoughts, beliefs, attitudes that might be constant.

520
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,669
Right. But there are others that can quickly change.

521
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,960
Right. It might even. Something happens that causes something to change, right?

522
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,950
Like thinking about, unfortunately, school shootings, right?

523
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,520
Like I know that probably a lot of you are.

524
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,330
I'm assuming, like had, like, school shooting drills and things of that sort.

525
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,700
Like you were in school that I've never had that experience right when I was in school.

526
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:06,409
I'm not that much older than you are, by the way. But my like all the way through high school, that was never something that we did.

527
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,410
We didn't have school shooting drills or anything like that.

528
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,480
Yes, school shootings happened, but very rarely it was not something that really was constant.

529
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,900
But now we are in a culture where that is necessary.

530
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,320
Right. And it's changed in like one generation, you know, which is really unfortunate.

531
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:28,549
So, you know, there are things that something might happen.

532
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,900
It might be the cause of a cultural shift as well.

533
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:36,170
Any other thoughts? Yeah, just like one more thing.

534
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,639
It's like competing subcultures, like I think with the example of they want to do the neighborhood intervention,

535
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,200
but there was like two competing gangs.

536
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,660
So sometimes I think trying to like balance the interests of multiple subcultures in the same area can be tricky.

537
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,560
Oh yeah. You know, that's actually a great point.

538
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:56,689
That's something that I've never had to deal with thus far in my career, like thinking about public health.

539
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,110
But that is an important consideration and thinking about how, you know,

540
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:07,430
some cultures might compete or might have issues with one another and you have an intervention or you're trying to reach all of,

541
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,900
you know, the people in that community like that might not work, but you might have to think about that,

542
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,200
you know, just to go back to like the whole generational thing.

543
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:24,350
Like it's harder for like past narrations to kind of understand like the norms and values that this generation now has.

544
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,549
And so that can kind of just create this kind of like in,

545
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:37,550
like because I totally agree with the whole like when grandma was like, why are you sitting in this house?

546
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:41,880
Like, like normal. That is universal.

547
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,720
Yeah. Yeah, that's actually really key too,

548
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:52,940
because I feel like especially like our generations are like way different than like our parents and grandparents.

549
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,350
Like they, you know, like that song from like back in the day, like Curtis was like Will Smith.

550
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,100
He used to like rap, like parents just don't understand. Have never heard the song?

551
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:08,510
No, never heard that thought. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Like, you know, they literally I think parents just don't understand.

552
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:16,310
And like he like literally rapping about that, about like how he's just talking about different stuff and like how his parents don't get it, you know?

553
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,260
But that's literally I think that's I feel like that is probably constant, right?

554
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,460
That'll probably never change.

555
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:30,750
But, you know, I appreciate, you know, our grandparents generations who try to understand, but there are some that just like dismiss it completely.

556
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,660
They're like, you know. So I think I saw a hand back here.

557
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:46,520
Yeah. So, like, sometimes I think certain subcultures can also, like, have conflicting ideas on like getting help, you know,

558
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:53,330
really oppose the idea of like having like outsiders coming into their culture and like dismiss that because it's like,

559
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:03,469
yeah, I would like to, like, find that line.

560
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:08,530
It's like. Like a piece, right?

561
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:15,430
Yeah, definitely. Because, like, there can be conflicts within a culture of how they view different things, like some people might like.

562
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:23,710
I think one good example I can think of in relation to like how culture really intersects with public health is like nutritional interventions, right?

563
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:28,629
Food is like a really like cornerstone, a lot of cultures. And so that can be a conflict.

564
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,440
You can see conflict within that. You can see people within the same culture.

565
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,620
No Group A might really welcome this intervention.

566
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,630
It might really be like thinking, you know, we really need to eat healthier.

567
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,219
Let's do this, let's do that.

568
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:48,940
And that could be a part of the same culture as like another group might say, like, no, we don't want to make any changes or like,

569
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,819
you know, these are these are this is our culture, you know, it's not really that unhealthy.

570
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,320
They might even be right. So it's a fine line. Definitely.

571
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,980
Any other thoughts you want to share?

572
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:10,880
Okay, great. So subculture is definitely a big thing to think about.

573
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,750
So let's talk a little bit about actually before our show, this slide.

574
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,000
So let's talk a little bit more about interventions, right?

575
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,080
And how it relates to this club is like way off.

576
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:30,200
So let me just keep looking at my watch. So let's talk about interventions, right?

577
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:35,600
Let's talk about how culture is a part of that and should be a part of program planning,

578
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,710
especially like, you know, with the summit that you are training that I'm still getting.

579
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:49,250
You know, a few people talked about that and like why like why that is central to their program or intervention.

580
00:58:49,580 --> 00:59:00,320
Right. So let's talk about how culture is used in public health and how it could be used better and how we could do better or how we're doing well.

581
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:06,650
Any thoughts? We talked about nutritional programs.

582
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,720
Any programs that you all are working on, whether it's like an internship or like other experiences that you have.

583
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:24,010
I feel just in general and like work I've done too. Like there's a lot of like engines and stuff that say like culturally tailored messaging.

584
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:32,160
Like, I feel like within like the last five years, I feel like we've seen a lot of that class too.

585
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:41,050
We've talked about like. That's a good thing because he's bad, like greatest stereotype him, like typecasting and all that.

586
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,560
So yeah, like you said, like that delicate balance. Yeah. That's that's important.

587
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,340
Like the buzzwords that we use, right? Culturally tailored messaging.

588
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:54,600
Like that's definitely like a very healthy communication thing to that. But like you said, there's a balance.

589
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:00,600
There are you know, it's a it's a fine line between, you know, recognizing,

590
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:07,770
respecting and uplifting a culture versus like using it to like as a means to an end.

591
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:13,110
Right. And the second option, you're not really valuing the culture.

592
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,280
You're just, you know, thinking about what you've heard, what people have shared with you,

593
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,390
and you're like just using it to, like, see better outcomes, right?

594
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,780
Or to see, like, you know, that your intervention worked,

595
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:32,280
but you're not really like truly valuing that culture and really engaging it in the things that you're doing, right.

596
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,690
And so while culturally tailor messaging is important, you know,

597
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:42,540
sometimes it is very stereotypical to like or you're stereotyping a culture or people.

598
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,880
So great point. Any other thoughts? Yeah.

599
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:57,469
And when we're talking about public health communication, it's kind of like the culture of the speaker.

600
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:05,220
And she was saying how? And she's like, like a little bit older than I was like, maybe your age or like, you know, like millennial, I guess.

601
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:11,400
But she's been a lot of time on social media researching what I heard, like target audience was like the youth.

602
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,170
So right before, like over 19 information.

603
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,100
And she does a lot of research on what's new and what's trending now,

604
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,000
how she can apply that within her public health communications to reach that certain demographic.

605
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:30,060
So I feel like adults take that time to really understand, like the evolution within that culture.

606
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,680
You can seem out of touch and like sometimes like you can make references that like nobody gives.

607
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,670
Like you need to like worth mentioning like that.

608
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:43,770
Like my dad is a high school teacher and so sometimes so not a lot more so than I will because yeah, I'm constantly right.

609
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,570
So make references. Don't just look at them with like face. Yeah.

610
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:54,030
Is like that they can really connect to. So I feel like you do take that time to really like talk with people and see like what are the current

611
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,050
like cultural trends and social norms that you can kind of better apply that to your interventions.

612
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:06,209
Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's huge. And like also people, especially when they're participating in an intervention, they know if it's genuine or not.

613
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:11,310
Right. Like they know you can tell by the way people talk like the examples that they use,

614
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,840
like things like that, if it's truly genuine or not, you know, like I could talk.

615
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:20,020
I can talk very comfortably about sick talk like in this class because I use Tik

616
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:26,010
to unfortunately my sister I was like an author can relate to very I'm like,

617
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:34,260
but you can tell like if someone like truly gets it or like they know like, you know, so I'm thinking of a tik tok references.

618
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,300
But yeah, the, like I feel like that's when it,

619
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:46,230
that's when you can like truly connect with like the community or group that you're working with or when he's just kind of like,

620
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,969
Oh, that community might be like, Oh, they don't talk to us about X, Y and Z.

621
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:57,750
Like, it might not really stick with them if it's not genuine and if it's not really relevant to them at a certain point in time.

622
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,960
Some like like anybody else.

623
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:12,950
I want to see what Gary is like that like any other thoughts on like I'm trying to think of any other probing questions.

624
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,880
Let's let's go to the next slide and this might be our last.

625
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:25,200
Depending on how fast you get through it, slide. So let's talk about how culture is misused in public health.

626
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:34,520
So we talked a little bit about your generalizations, right, about people's health, health behaviors, their beliefs, things like that.

627
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,110
But it's also important to differentiate between the rules of a culture which

628
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,830
govern how one should think of behave and how people actually behave in real life.

629
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,770
So in thinking about this bullet point,

630
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:50,870
because somebody give me an example or like what does this bullet point make them think of when they think about,

631
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,200
you know, the rules of a culture that tell people how to think but how they actually behave.

632
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:05,850
Yeah. Like the biggest thing that comes to mind is like actually understanding someone's culture from people

633
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:13,049
that are a part of that culture or like another person that has like experienced things like example.

634
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:17,500
I think it's like obviously people like, like I'm curious,

635
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:22,379
like I think a lot of people actually like different parts of my culture and like that's like cool for me.

636
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:30,270
But, but I think a lot of times I think people overstep and I think then it's kind of like, Oh, I wish I was Korean.

637
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:37,770
And like, like highlighting all the good things about, like, like not really understanding the stuff like who I am, like my culture experience.

638
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:45,000
But I think because of that, it's easy for people to just kind of like take things to the parts of someone's like,

639
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:52,230
like beliefs and like lifestyles and stuff. So understanding it's more to just like.

640
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:58,650
Yeah, that's a great point. And because especially when you think about culture, right?

641
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,170
Like, like when I think about my own culture, it's very important to me.

642
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:08,520
Right? And I think we will all be able to share that about ourselves and with our families and that friends like,

643
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:16,140
like people are very protective of their culture. And I think that that's valid because again, like it's very important to who you are,

644
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,920
who you've grown to be, how you changed, how you move around the world. Right.

645
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:30,659
And some people, you know, say certain things about it or like are being assumptive or, um, co-opting your culture in some way, you know,

646
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:36,420
that is like, that's a disconnect right there that causes a little bit of conflict and you're like, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

647
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,520
Too much, right? You're you're relating a little too much. And, you know, it just makes you feel a certain kind of way.

648
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,430
And so that's a really important point, especially when thinking about public health interventions, because,

649
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,830
again, we don't want to like co-opt someone's culture and misuse it in the way we build these interventions.

650
01:05:54,020 --> 01:06:00,440
I think that's another thing, and I think for me what came to mind was like abstinence only sex education,

651
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:05,999
how a lot of I'm thinking some religious groups really emphasize that as being like the rule of how

652
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,170
people should behave and then how people actually behave in real life often does not align with that.

653
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:19,830
And so being aware of like what risks are like being brought up with that behavior that people might not recognize or be aware of?

654
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:26,910
Yeah, that's a really good example of for sure. Like what is taught, what is there, what is told and like how people should act.

655
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:35,520
Or if someone were to ask, you know, a certain culture or even a religion, how do you how does your congregation view sex?

656
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:41,160
Right. And the answer is certain way, but like people of that congregation might behave much differently.

657
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:48,300
Right. And so that's really important to keep in mind because I mean, that's one thing about sex education.

658
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,660
We know from like public health, like from results from data that abstinence only programing does not work.

659
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,080
Right. And that is because of this very thing.

660
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:04,680
Like people behave a lot differently than what is believed to be the way people in that culture are.

661
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,470
Right. Any other examples?

662
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:17,320
Thoughts? Thought I was kind of thinking about like the elimination of certain people from certain groups is like,

663
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:25,930
like for me I feel like I'm like third generation. So I don't really feel fully part of like a culture but also not fully for I don't know.

664
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,690
And so I think but I think, like I,

665
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:35,260
I understand that there are people that know more about my culture than I do that maybe are not part of the culture.

666
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:40,929
But sometimes I feel like I let them kind of exclude me from my culture.

667
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:47,820
And like even though I probably still have experiences of the culture, just not in the same sense that someone else might.

668
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:52,030
So like I might be part of the subculture, but that doesn't mean I'm not part of the group.

669
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,799
So I don't know. I guess I was just thinking about that and like, how do you guys feel?

670
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,920
Make sure that you're being inclusive of like of those subcultures?

671
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:08,889
Maybe. Yeah. I again, I think that you raise a great point because that kind of relates to like as we think about

672
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:15,070
public health programing interventions is like making assumptions of again how people think that

673
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:19,780
are a part of a certain culture because you might have different thoughts or people who might

674
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,559
feel like they're really a part of the culture and others who might be a part of the culture,

675
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,860
it might not feel as connected to it. Right?

676
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,850
So you can definitely have a wide variation there. So you raise a really good point. Yes.

677
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:35,379
I think another thing that continually happens is like with people making assumptions

678
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:42,910
or like these sort of stereotypes that like does more harm than good in the long run.

679
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:51,320
And even if it's like not necessarily the intention, I guess like the person or the individual or the intervention, it's still like that.

680
01:08:51,880 --> 01:09:01,360
And that's one thing that like is like a hard line and you kind of have to avoid crossing right about like the culture conscious,

681
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,800
like more interventions that are specific to the circumstance. Yeah, exactly.

682
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:14,739
And it's like, like you said, it's a fine line. Like it's really hard to think about how to apply certain areas of a culture or not and

683
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:18,910
how to make sure you're not being stereotypical or like stereotyping a certain group.

684
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:25,950
And so it is a fine line for sure, and it's something that is difficult for a lot of public health professionals to do,

685
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:34,300
especially I think even more so when you don't have people on your staff, on your research team that are a reflection of that culture in some way.

686
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,809
But again, you don't want to tokenize people and things of that nature.

687
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:44,410
And so you really have to like kind of try in multiple lanes really differently to make sure you're not being stereotypical.

688
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,810
It's not to make sure you're not tokenizing people.

689
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:53,920
And again, it goes back to kind of what we've been talking about all semester of like this is why you really have to work with communities.

690
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:01,209
You have to really not just, you know, say that you're having a community based participatory research program, but you really have to practice it.

691
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:06,790
You really have to get to know the community for yourself to make sure that you're not doing those things right.

692
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:13,510
So yeah, I wasn't going to paint it. It just reminded me of like the whole look in the black community.

693
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:16,460
But yeah, like the HBCU versus Yeah.

694
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:27,300
And like how often like a lot of HBCU or people that HBCU is and feel and validate the experiences of people that I go to realize and they claim like,

695
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:33,310
yeah, I don't know a lot about their culture, our culture, because you didn't go to a HBCU.

696
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:38,190
So it's just interesting, like how it happens within the community.

697
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,310
Yeah, definitely. I like that whole discussion always.

698
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:49,870
I'm sorry, but but it's a really good example of, you know,

699
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:59,259
how different groups within a culture I think we mentioned this already how there can be like competing values within a group because you know,

700
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:04,290
on one hand you might have a part of a group that might w, you know, kind.

701
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:08,330
I like this. Not like my thoughts on.

702
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:17,520
Kind of like groups within groups, right. Is like thinking through what creates a subculture, how is it created and when.

703
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:22,670
With the conversation about HBCU and PWI, and I think that this will relate to other areas as well as like,

704
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,719
you know, that has been created, I think, out of necessity.

705
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:31,010
Right. Thinking about blacks attending predominantly white institutions.

706
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:37,159
Right. A lot of the culture around that has been created because of like it was necessary

707
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,900
because blacks can only interact with other black students at a certain point in time.

708
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:47,270
Right. And so it's very interesting to think about how different things are created and how different

709
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:51,090
subgroups within groups are created and kind of the conversations between those groups,

710
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,570
how they might be compete like how they might be competition in some way between that.

711
01:11:55,580 --> 01:12:02,000
So which is unfortunate, right. But it is something to keep in mind when you're planning different interventions because it

712
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,320
might look different at a PWI for is that it will look for black students ABC to bring out.

713
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:13,280
So. Any other final thoughts. Um.

714
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,650
I think we talked about I'm just going to finish the spiral for us before we get out.

715
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:24,980
We talked about generalizations as well and we talked about cultures changing, right?

716
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:33,870
They're never static. They're influenced by other groups and just the way of the world at the present time as well.

717
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:38,060
So we've covered all of this slide in some form or fashion.

718
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:45,050
There's a few slides left, so we'll come back to Misuses of Culture on Thursday.

719
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:53,960
Yeah, we'll get out a couple minutes early. I don't want to get to the next slide and right now, we don't have to do that.

720
01:12:56,270 --> 01:13:01,080
I didn't think I had a good Tuesday. I'm worn out there.

721
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:16,090
All right. Are you kidding me?

722
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:17,930
Ed?
