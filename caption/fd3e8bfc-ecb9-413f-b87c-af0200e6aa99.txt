1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,180
Maybe they'll. I suppose.

2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:35,220
You know, I get of.

3
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:58,830
We believe. Yeah.

4
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:12,380
So. Let's shoot.

5
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah. That's a. Yeah.

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,390
No. To the.

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:47,900
I know. I want to use an inhaler. Okay.

8
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:32,180
Yeah. I think we. Good morning.

9
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:43,620
Well, welcome back. I can't say that I'm too excited about being back.

10
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:53,100
It was 65 degrees in New Orleans when I left, and it was 40 degrees and snowing when I landed on Saturday.

11
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,780
So I'm joking.

12
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,420
I love Michigan. But that. Yeah, I was.

13
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:11,070
I was definitely enjoying my time walking around 70 degree weather and knowing it wasn't it wasn't a fluke like it was here.

14
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,090
So for those who will be. Can you hear me now? It seems like I'm mean.

15
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,920
Super low now. You can hear me okay?

16
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,100
Yeah. For those who will be here next year, I can't promise you that.

17
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,770
70 degree weather in November. Sorry.

18
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,360
So we've arrived to the end of the CDC steps.

19
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,930
We've gone through five, and now we're here at the end.

20
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,730
We've done all this work. Now what do we do with it? So today we'll be talking about step six.

21
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm going. I'm going to make an adjustment in the syllabus.

22
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,030
The syllabus says that we'll talk about the lessons learned or dissemination on Thursday.

23
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I decided, based on the amount of material that really falls under this step,

24
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:20,070
to actually use Thursday to walk you through an actual evaluation of mine that I did with food gatherers, which is a local.

25
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:27,420
I wish I had looked at the term They are the Feeding America partner for Washtenaw County,

26
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:37,980
so they essentially serve as kind of the central repository for all food that's distributed to the pantries within Washtenaw County.

27
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,750
I've kind of shared a little bit about the evaluation that I did,

28
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:55,259
but what I want to do on Thursday is just walk you through and point out how different things that I've shared over the course of the semester,

29
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,410
how they look when you're implemented, implementing them in a real life project.

30
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,340
So that's what I'll be doing on Thursday today.

31
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,570
So we'll focus on the material. So this will actually be the last unit where you will have quiz questions.

32
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:23,879
I'm reflected on the quiz, just so you know. And speaking of Quiz four, if anybody opened it, I'm not afraid to tell them myself.

33
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,280
I forgot to put the quiz in hand. I got on the plane, I went, I went,

34
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,409
start socializing at the ACA conference and I realized Wednesday night I totally forgot about the quiz, so I closed it.

35
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,190
It will reopen on Thursday. And it will.

36
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:53,840
But you have until November 29th, so you'll have all of next week, including that day where it's a workday on Tuesday to do the quiz.

37
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,430
It will still be 20 points. It won't be any longer than the other ones.

38
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,870
It's not like a it's not like a exam or anything.

39
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:14,140
So still 20 points. The only difference is that this one will ask you to utilize things that you've learned in other parts of the semester.

40
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,860
So it's more of a kind of an application. It will have some application questions on it.

41
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,640
Not too many, but just, you know, what would you do in this situation?

42
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,540
Type of questions. So, you know, anticipate that.

43
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,800
But if it comes to like factual questions like true or false.

44
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,040
You blah, blah, blah. Is a good reason to write a evaluation report.

45
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,370
It will have those kind of questions on there as well. But those will only cover last week in this week.

46
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,220
So that makes sense. So basically likely if you're doing a short answer question,

47
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,210
it's something that you might have to use material you learned over the course of the semester.

48
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:11,600
But if it's a concrete, objective question, it will only cover the two units last week in this week.

49
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:22,750
All right. So that's quiz for grading is almost done for the data collection plan and quiz three.

50
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,490
So you should have that by the end of the week to be able to review.

51
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:40,170
You may even get it beforehand. So if you have plans to meet with your group like on Sunday, well, Thursday you might have it before.

52
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,749
But you will definitely have it by the end of the week. And then your presentation days.

53
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:56,220
If you hadn't if you haven't seen Hannah's message that she said last week, she was on top of it.

54
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,880
I thought she was going to need a few days. She ran it that day.

55
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,880
She put your assignments for presentation days up.

56
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,730
Today is the last day we're going to entertain switches.

57
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,040
So this very important,

58
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:25,910
very important I'll view people people viewing the via I'll see if you need to switch for travel reasons like emergency travel reasons or just.

59
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,310
Really? We really got to get out of here before. Whenever.

60
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,960
Please do it today. Because that requires us to ask another group to switch.

61
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:45,840
And so we can't guarantee you, especially after today, that anybody will want to switch your last presentation on December 8th.

62
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:55,420
For, you know, something a little bit earlier. So with that said, any questions before we jump into material?

63
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,180
All right, we're almost done. I just. It goes from here, and then you're going to be at home sleeping.

64
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,850
I will be at home having my my kids ask me how much their Christmas limit varies.

65
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,730
They're already asking, what's our limit? I don't know.

66
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:24,620
Do you have a job? No. Okay, then. Zero. So today it will be I don't know where I'm coming from, behind the podium.

67
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,350
So we'll be talking about ensuring, use and share lessons.

68
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:40,610
I'm going to give you some some high level information about dissemination, ensuring, use.

69
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:49,470
Then with the rest of the time, excluding the 10 minutes I'll save for the final plan and presentation.

70
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,250
I'm going to show you some examples from some of the work that I've done.

71
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,030
So you can kind of see that part dissemination, part in action.

72
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,020
Right. So last week we talked about review.

73
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,960
I mean, we've talked about review. Yeah, I can see I'm just like, whew.

74
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,180
So what happens when you go to a conference for four days? You kind of.

75
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:19,320
And then have, like, 50 meetings on Monday. Whose idea that was?

76
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,040
I don't know. It was not mine. So review.

77
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,510
Last week, we talked about justifying conclusions,

78
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:44,530
the point of this process or this step and the CDC framework is really about taking the time to analyze data and interpret its meaning because again,

79
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,360
when we're thinking about the data that comes out of our analysis, you know,

80
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,650
the results of a regression, or we do some thematic analysis on the set of transcripts.

81
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,640
That as it comes out are simply results.

82
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,540
That really doesn't tell us what that means in respect to a programs mayor Worth is significant.

83
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,409
So last week we talked about how do we take what we have,

84
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:20,740
what we've collected and turn it into meaningful information that can be used by our stakeholders.

85
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:34,460
One important thing to remember is that when we are deciding the significance or the mayor or the worth of the data that we've analyzed,

86
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,270
it's really about what standards are we comparing it to?

87
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,470
And that part is is is really central to what evaluators do.

88
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:54,129
We're comparing information to a standard to decide whether or not a program has or to what extent,

89
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,790
rather, a program has merit worth and significance.

90
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,219
So it's important that we're not only coming up with conclusions,

91
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:15,190
but that those conclusions are justified to some type of evidence and consistent upon consistent with agreed upon standards.

92
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:24,100
And those standards can be agreed upon by stakeholders by existing evidence and peer reviewed or gray literature.

93
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,910
I'm going to actually use the term gray literature a few times today.

94
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,420
So I just want it to stop and make sure that when I refer to gray literature,

95
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm talking about reports, briefs, any publications that haven't gone through a peer review process.

96
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,220
So basically all those reports you see coming out of the think tanks.

97
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:05,060
Evaluation firms. Report research centers, though those are examples of gray literature.

98
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,400
And those those that kind of source of literature is another good source for standards.

99
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,450
And then oftentimes our evaluation work ends up in kind of that category of gray literature.

100
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:30,400
So that's but that is. So with that said, after we take some time, justify our conclusions, we're here.

101
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,360
We're at the end use and share lessons learned.

102
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:46,299
And this is you know, I say every step is important. This step is important because this is where we ensure that the work that we've

103
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,270
done as evaluators and the resources that have gone into that are not wasted.

104
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,910
So as you can see, arguably the most critical aspect of a good evaluation.

105
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,889
And there's one of the things that distinguishes us from kind of a typical framing of scholarly literature,

106
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:14,940
where you write a peer review paper, you hopefully publish it in the journal.

107
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:24,090
That's it. Typically, of course, there's moves to, you know, be more active in disseminating peer review.

108
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,700
But with evaluation, this process is central to the work that we do.

109
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,530
And in fact,

110
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:42,520
one thing that you will hear us lament and always hear and I probably heard it like a few times in workshops while I was gone at the AA conference.

111
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,320
We don't want that report to sit in the drawer. So this is how we ensure that our reports don't sit in a drawer.

112
00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:00,260
So if we don't go through this process. We're going to fail the share kind of serve the purpose that we.

113
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:09,870
The purpose of the work, which is to provide evidence for potential change and improvements in programs and organizations.

114
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,660
Bless you policies, systems, etc.

115
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:33,510
Part of part of ensuring the use of the work that we do is thinking and thinking about how our work serves a role in data driven decision making.

116
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,850
Definition is at the bottom. Now I'll just read it out.

117
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,440
Just the case is blocked for people data.

118
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:52,810
This data driven decision making is a process of decision making in which recommendations and conclusions are backed up by verifiable data.

119
00:16:54,150 --> 00:17:00,660
So now that, you know, this idea of verifiable again, we've talked about confidence in the findings.

120
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,860
We talked about using consistent measures, knowing that the way that we've measure things is reliable.

121
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,890
That's all part of getting to this process of data driven decision making.

122
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:27,150
We do really start to think about this decision making at the beginning of a program when we're thinking about the logic of the program,

123
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:37,200
selecting what approach we use to do the evaluation, whether it's a theory driven evaluation approach, which we haven't talked about.

124
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:49,980
Cree So a culturally responsive and equitable approach, utilization focused approach, which actually a lot of.

125
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:58,150
What I've talked about over the semester also falls within a utilization focused approach approach.

126
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:10,160
And then you also see data decision, data driven decision making emerge when we're thinking about what data collection and analysis to do.

127
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:18,140
Because ultimately, what we want to do is ensure that when we get to this step right here or here,

128
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,380
that we have the data that we need to make a sound decision.

129
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,900
So that's your first step in ensuring use that you ensure that you have quality, quality, high quality,

130
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:40,890
rigorous data that is going to allow you to make a sound decision about what about what is revealed in that purpose.

131
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,780
Because if you think about if you go back,

132
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,770
remember the purpose statement also tells you a bit about what decisions will be made and who the decision makers are.

133
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,400
So there's different kinds of decisions one might make when you are in this process of ensuring use.

134
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,930
Are we when it comes to process evaluation? Are we targeting the appropriate population?

135
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,640
How can we improve our services? You know, think about, you know, how things are delivered.

136
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:23,620
When we talked about the kind of six dimensions of process such as reach those delivered.

137
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,800
How can we implement programs that are more satisfactory to our participants?

138
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,990
So these are things that you might. And these are common decisions that are made in regard to process evaluation.

139
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,560
In terms of outcome evaluation, how can we improve our outcomes?

140
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,280
How do we how do we get to the outcomes that we anticipated or planned or desire to get?

141
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,340
How can we be more efficient as an organization?

142
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:05,670
How can we get to the same outcomes and use less resources or reroute resources to another another area?

143
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,919
How can we increase our impact? So say, for example,

144
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:21,630
you are implementing a program within a neighborhood in a city and you want to know how can we expand our impact to the rest of the city?

145
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,350
Those are the kinds of decisions that emerge.

146
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,910
Or kinds of decisions that we make at this point.

147
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:40,800
So overall, you kind of get when you are getting to where you are getting to a point where you justify your conclusions, right?

148
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,840
You're going to either be actually might be in the mix.

149
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,880
But in terms of different elements of a program, you're either going to have acceptable results.

150
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,970
Compared to the standards that you've set makes the results.

151
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,950
So some areas of the program evaluation revealed that the results were acceptable.

152
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,980
Some reveal that they're not. And then you're going to just across the board have inadequate results.

153
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:28,960
So when you get to this decision making point, there's oh, there's broadly speaking, different things that you can do in terms of acceptable results.

154
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,150
Chances are you're going to continue the program as previously.

155
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,370
So you ran this program. You're okay with the results?

156
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:49,930
You made, you know, likely your clients are going to decide, let's, you know, let's stay the course.

157
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,070
So you get mixed results or inadequate results.

158
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:05,510
And again, this is compared to the standards that you've set with your stakeholders and based on different sources of literature or other resources.

159
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,330
Chances are more likely than not,

160
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:18,330
you are going to need to conduct some further analysis to determine adjustments and different things can happen at that point.

161
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:25,970
Right? You can do further analysis and find that there are certain conditions under which the results are acceptable,

162
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,740
certain subgroups where the results are acceptable.

163
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,790
But you may find that upon further analysis that there are adjustments that do need to be made within the program.

164
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
And the question is, well, okay, how do we determine?

165
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:01,459
Whether or not we're going to continue or we're going to do further analysis or we just work together with our clients.

166
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,890
Bless you or stakeholders to make adjustments to the program.

167
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,700
So we need to elicit feedback.

168
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:18,850
And there's lots of honestly, I have four here, but I just want a list of these for to give you kind of a range of different types.

169
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,940
Of ways that you might elicit feedback as well as the one that's on the next slide.

170
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,320
If you're familiar with group process, you've done any kind of facilitation.

171
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,200
These techniques are likely familiar to you. So we don't create brand new.

172
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:44,400
We typically don't create brand new methods of group process that are specifically geared toward a valuation.

173
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:54,360
We're typically building on a really rich body of literature, on facilitation to go through this work of ensuring use.

174
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,720
So some some. I want it to highlight one Delphi technique.

175
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,560
The Delphi technique is essentially a process of our Ed Ed riff below.

176
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:24,610
Ed, I need to just drink a gallon of water before I come in here. This has been a problem my entire life.

177
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,030
I got to do speech therapy when I was a kid, too, and everything was really cool.

178
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:39,770
I got to leave class. Delft Dolphin Technique is a process of seeking the advice of experts.

179
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,710
So typically what this process looks like is that.

180
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,830
I summarize the results in one form or fashion, and then I send it to a panel of experts.

181
00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:02,650
Then that panel of experts respond to this summary and analyze those results, refine the summary.

182
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,639
And that summary could be, you know, recommendations and conclusions.

183
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:15,910
Typically, they give more feedback then that result, then revise the summary again, and then that's where we land.

184
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,840
It is. It is. I will be honest that I have not used the Delphi technique traditionally.

185
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,120
Typically what I'm doing is modifying. In part, you know, thinking about a career approach.

186
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,050
One thing we've talked about is who's in power, who has a say.

187
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:45,350
So. I may use this as a modified version of reaching out to a representative panel.

188
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,720
It might be said, you know,

189
00:25:49,040 --> 00:26:00,650
participants in the program or other stakeholders with attention toward those who may not typically have a voice in program decision making.

190
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,890
And of course, this is all up to the discretion of a client,

191
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,860
because we've talked about it's it's not as simple as just simply reaching out to program participants.

192
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:21,590
It requires a solid relationship with your client to be able to have that type of access.

193
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:32,520
So you can you even though the Delphi technique was developed in a way that reinforces power dynamics and, you know,

194
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:40,950
the and the unequal distribution of power, you can adapt it to be able to be more attentive to issues of equity.

195
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,340
Dot voting. And polling dot voting is a group technique.

196
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,150
You've likely all probably done it in some form or fashion.

197
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,750
You have ideas that are listed on the piece of paper, then people vote.

198
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:09,120
So this picture actually is from an example of when I used that voting for this was actually not an evaluation project.

199
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,810
This was a policy advocacy project.

200
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:20,660
That I did earlier in my career. But I just really like blue and green are my favorite color, so I just continue to use the picture.

201
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,520
But groups divide it into kind of big sections and they develop policies,

202
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,520
policy ideas related to women who are living in Michigan and living in poverty.

203
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:44,900
So then people they get that. They get maybe like a green that they get green backs, they get red dots, they get yellow dots and they vote.

204
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,730
And the ones that have the most green that wins.

205
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,510
So again, so it is a more, I guess, democratic, if you will, way of making decisions.

206
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,080
The trick is, is you might be in situations where.

207
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:18,540
There is some high resistance to recommendations or conclusions that actually have dots.

208
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,330
And so the issue is how do you resolve that?

209
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:30,870
So it's not the most consid consensus building approach, but it is an approach to making decisions about how they use the results.

210
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:46,380
One that's a little bit more inclined for consensus building is liberating structures and this is a facilitation technique where.

211
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:57,220
The best way they explain is that the activities are called structures and there are different activities that are meant and designed to.

212
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:10,970
Ensure that everyone who is part of the group, whatever that group is, is contributing to the results or the conclusions or the recommendations.

213
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:19,659
So it's a little more interactive than that building. But it does require some preparation.

214
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:27,040
So obviously it's not as quick as doing that voting because you need to be prepared to actually facilitate the structures.

215
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,560
But if you like facilitation, I would recommend building some capacity in that area.

216
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,740
They are very useful. They even have an app just in case you're walking down the street and need to.

217
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,860
You know, facilitate a group at random. And then the last one I listed polling.

218
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,020
Polling is similar to that voting. The thing about polling is that it doesn't have as much interaction.

219
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:02,320
Right. So with polling, you can see that people don't engage in conversation like they would with that voting where there you go.

220
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,250
Put your that. Why did you do that? Blah da da da da. There's simply people vote.

221
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,420
And you know what? Rises to the top goes.

222
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,950
So those are different ways that you can go through a group process technique in order

223
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,380
to be to get feedback and narrow down potential recommendations based on the findings.

224
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,210
What I most commonly use,

225
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:39,470
and I can use these in conjunction with any of the techniques that I listed on the last slide is a data interpretation meeting.

226
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:50,410
A data interpretation meeting is a central part of or I won't say central, but I'll say and you may part of utilization focused evaluation.

227
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,530
Again, utilization focused is really about how do we use these results.

228
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:05,320
So one thing that the creators of that approach introduced to our world of evaluation is that interpretation meetings.

229
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,030
So we go through, we analyze the data. We put it on some slides or in a book.

230
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:22,040
Not typically a report because it's not a final product, but some way of presenting the results.

231
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,820
And typically you would share all of the results. In that cherry pick.

232
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,790
And then what you talk about is what's useful.

233
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,770
What are some potential recommendations that are that you would.

234
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,670
Identify based on these useful findings.

235
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:54,330
What's feasible? So after you think about the recommendations, think about, okay, what can we feasibly, feasibly implement?

236
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,280
And so our role as evaluators is not to say you should do this or you should do that.

237
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:09,230
Our role is really to facilitate discussion with the group about, okay, so what stands out to you?

238
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,060
What feels most salient? What feels true?

239
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,780
So that's a big question that we will ask in that meeting.

240
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,040
Does this feel correct to you? And if not, why?

241
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:30,509
And so it's an opportunity and it's also an opportunity for a client to be able to see contentious results,

242
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:38,640
especially before it's solidified within some type of report that may likely go to a funder.

243
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:50,310
So these types of techniques. Delfi liberating structures that interpretation meetings.

244
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,680
They can be used in isolation. They can be used in conjunction with each other.

245
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:03,570
But again, the idea of the focus is working with whatever group is responsible for decision making,

246
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,060
working with them to decide, okay, what are we going to do?

247
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,750
What actions are we going to take based on these findings?

248
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:20,610
And that includes what findings are we going to share with the public or other stakeholders?

249
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,230
I found that it allows two clients to feel a little bit safer about the process,

250
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,120
especially when we tell them at the beginning that we're not just going to write up

251
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,940
a report and share it with somebody without them having a say in what's shared.

252
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:52,530
And yes, it can get a little bit tricky when there may be results that are considered inadequate.

253
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,720
When there's decisions made about do we share those decisions with others or do we share that data with others?

254
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:15,300
So that takes facilitation as well. So after we've gone through that process, we've made some decisions about what we're going to do with this data.

255
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:22,140
What recommendations for action are we going to take based on this data?

256
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,960
We go through a process of dissemination,

257
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:34,650
and this is really just the process of making evaluation results available to different stakeholders or investor communities and best IT parties.

258
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,520
And just a reminder, those and that includes those who are involved in program operations,

259
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,120
those who are served by the program, and those who are going to be the primary users of the evaluation results.

260
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:56,110
And it's really an opportunity for us as evaluators to be a voice for the use of the planning,

261
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:00,010
for the use of evaluation and planning in quality improvement.

262
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,270
This is our moment. This is our moment.

263
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,550
So some considerations. You know, we've talked about what findings will you disseminate?

264
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,010
And we've talked about that in terms of preference for clients.

265
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:23,740
But from a more neutral perspective, what types of findings might you disseminate when it comes to process evaluation?

266
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Description of event intervention, strategy, how well it was implemented.

267
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,980
To what extent there was fidelity to an existing curriculum.

268
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,880
Oh, no. Okay. I'm not going to worry about that.

269
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:53,130
So when do you this should say when do you and you probably can see it on your slides, but for some reason, it's not shown up here.

270
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,840
Okay. So when do we disseminate information about process evaluation?

271
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,270
We might decide to disseminate that when something is new,

272
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:19,340
when it's innovative or not well documented, as well as when an intervention is in its early stages.

273
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,990
And I should also give the disclaimer that dissemination doesn't need to happen just at the end.

274
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:36,190
And in fact, I've learned and am trying to be more conscious in my practice that clients get antsy when you save the data for the end.

275
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:46,930
They you know, and I've learned just a trick of the trade, that it's helpful to always be ready, always be ready with some findings.

276
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,820
Like, for example, I'm like, let's say it was a Tuesday, you know, because we have class on Thursday.

277
00:36:52,510 --> 00:37:01,750
Tuesday, as soon as I left here, I got on a meeting with one of my clients as part of kind of a larger network meeting.

278
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,300
I forgot to look at the agenda for the meeting. And guess what?

279
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:16,410
They wanted some findings. So I had the because I'm always ready with some kind of finding, even if it's just in my brain.

280
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,610
I was able to talk through some findings on that call.

281
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,600
So it is good to always be ready with findings.

282
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,980
But, you know, in just in terms of the general process,

283
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,930
it's good to disseminate process when it's really something that's going to add something to kind

284
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:44,820
of our understanding of programing or it's going to help the relationship between stakeholders.

285
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:54,830
Types of evaluation findings you might disseminate when it comes to outcome evaluation whether, how and for whom.

286
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,190
Intervention, change, knowledge, attitudes and or behaviors.

287
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,920
And I would also add, even though we haven't talked a lot about impact or social impact,

288
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:13,880
it's good to be if you have that level of data to include that as well.

289
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,830
And when you disseminate when the data has been collected and analyzed.

290
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:29,810
So given what I have already shared about. Always being ready with data.

291
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,010
That means that you are analyzing data as you go.

292
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,940
So that you can even so that you can say at the very least, here's some initial findings or confirming,

293
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,800
you know, through further analysis and further data collection.

294
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:57,940
But it's helpful, again, to be able to share what's emerging out of the process as you go, but obviously, definitely at the end.

295
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,870
How will you share your findings? So there's lots of different ways that you can share your findings.

296
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:20,600
These are probably the these are the more typical or yeah, the typical ways that we are going to disseminate findings from our evaluation.

297
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,890
Formal written reports. In-person presentations such as conferences.

298
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:39,450
Yeah, I got to do that. Peer reviewed journal articles, moves, press releases and social media posts.

299
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:48,959
So if you think and you don't have to just use one and actually the examples of that have will show you how we

300
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,400
take one evaluation and have different findings emerge or different dissemination materials emerge out of it.

301
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:07,200
But when you're thinking about which products to include different things to consider, formal written reports want strength.

302
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,410
They can be published quickly and can be free.

303
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,980
So I've been something. One of the reports that I'll share with you is actually available online.

304
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,620
Limitations. It's not peer reviewed. And when I talk about peer reviewed.

305
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,220
I should give you the disclaimer that it is.

306
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:40,969
I'm referring specifically to the process of a blind panel of reviewers providing feedback and making decisions about

307
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:49,040
whether or not the methods that you have use are sound and if the results make a contribution to the literature.

308
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:04,320
And I gave that disclaimer because just because something is in a formal written report, it doesn't mean that it's not peer review by somebody.

309
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:13,840
But it's not this blind process necessarily. So another limitation, though, to a written report is that it may be tough for an audience to find.

310
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,060
Partly because sometimes they're just not publicly available.

311
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,330
There's certain reports that I'm not going to be able to show you because they're not available to the public.

312
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,200
Presentations. One strength is that it provides opportunity to receive feedback.

313
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:37,620
So if you've ever done a poster, you've ever done a conference presentation, you get feedback.

314
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:50,940
A standing in front of a poster for 2 hours. Roughly right on Wednesday night and got feedback on that project limitations though

315
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,990
it reaches only the people who were there and it can be difficult to schedule.

316
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,940
And we found out that if there's reasons why, there may be.

317
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,730
You know, even more reasons to limit people's access.

318
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,690
A presentation can be even doubly problematic.

319
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:18,269
One of the projects that I did that kept the evaluation that I'll show you part of our dissemination

320
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:24,720
plan at the beginning was to disseminate through a town hall for the grantees who participated.

321
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:32,580
But guess what happened? COVID. So we did a webinar and by that point everyone was tired of Zoom.

322
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,160
So we did not have the turnout that we want it to have or nor do we have the celebratory process,

323
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,290
process that we wanted to have as part of that dissemination.

324
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,900
So keep that in mind. Presentations in dealing with people, scandals, etc.

325
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,250
Peer reviewed journal articles. Land. Scientific credibility.

326
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,930
Yes. But the limitation is that it has a long review process.

327
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,780
Has anybody ever published the paper? Couple of people.

328
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:14,920
So you probably know that. I don't know about you, but when I came by the time I got my paper published.

329
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:27,470
The data was like five years old. So the long review process can be so long that by the time it gets to a journal, it's out of date.

330
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,550
That's one reason why I don't like peer reviewed journal articles except for methods.

331
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,250
I like methods. It reaches a mainly academic audience.

332
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:44,300
Paywalls are real. It's also competitive and it also relation to that.

333
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,640
Typically, non-significant results do not show up in journals.

334
00:43:50,120 --> 00:44:00,739
But that doesn't mean that we don't we can't learn from them. So it's a it's a problem if we have information that shows this didn't work because

335
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,660
that's likely to not be published versus this did work and it was significant.

336
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:13,550
Statistically, news press releases are, you know, are great because they can be distributed widely.

337
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:26,299
You can even if there's certain listservs and lists that you can subscribe to to get press releases about all kinds of journal articles and research.

338
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,500
I used to do that a lot when I was still using the RSS feeds.

339
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:41,870
But again, it's also competitive, requires a newsworthy topic and it does need to follow a set format for press releases.

340
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:54,990
I have worked with clients that have had connections to the news, and so it makes it a little bit easier to get that information out there.

341
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,390
And then finally, social media. Easy free.

342
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,860
It's free for the viewers. It's not free for the person who's creating them.

343
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,120
Has a broad reach and it appeals to young audiences.

344
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:16,630
People are starting to look into things like tick tock to disseminate results, for example.

345
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:30,220
Cam like credit cam lack credibility. And then has the potential to lose control through the comments and it requires followers.

346
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,780
So you really have to be really you know, you have to be good at it.

347
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,780
My sister works for Michigan Radio. She does the social media for.

348
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,229
She's also the reason why I had a crazy focus group last year.

349
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:50,530
Around this time, I think I shared an example about how like 80 people in a virtual focus group,

350
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,170
it was her fault because she had so many followers that I asked her to share one flier.

351
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,080
And then I woke up the next morning and 200 people had registered for the focus group.

352
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,830
So that's how. If I didn't tell you how I got that many people, that's how I got that many people.

353
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,760
Because you have the followers. So you have to keep that in mind too.

354
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:17,470
Like you can work with somebody who has a lot of followers to disseminate information,

355
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:24,730
but be very careful because you might end up and you might end up losing control of the message.

356
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,190
So those are examples of products and some of the strengths and limitations.

357
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:40,250
In conjunction with doing these products, it's helpful to have an effective communication plan for your clients,

358
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,930
and that helps kind of resolve questions that they might have about what's going out.

359
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:59,090
When is it going out? It's also helpful if you're planning to do regular feedback with stakeholders, like a monthly email,

360
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:08,900
giving people feedback on the research and what's happening in the initial findings, etc. It just helps to keep all of that straight.

361
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:15,090
So when you're developing a communications plan, some helpful questions to answer.

362
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,920
Who's the priority? What's critical for them to know?

363
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,180
How often are they receiving information? Is it monthly?

364
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:30,320
Is it once? What is their preferred format?

365
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,820
So you might decide to do like a social media post once or twice to community members.

366
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,660
But because you know that a lot of the participants are on social media.

367
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:52,020
Also questions to ask. Again, thinking about equity, language level.

368
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:03,420
What language to use? Do you need to have things translated not just in terms of words, but in terms of cultural content, images, for example?

369
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:12,960
And thinking about if there's issues of tone like one of the actually I think this is the reading for Thursday.

370
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:22,050
But one thing to think about is how are you talking about the the program and its findings in the population?

371
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,900
Are you using an asset based form of communication?

372
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:39,740
Where you lifting up the strengths in the community, or are you blaming the victim in focusing on deficits or individual factors that,

373
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:45,860
for example, might mask the systems level changes that are needed?

374
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,000
So a communication plan allows you to be able to be able to.

375
00:48:51,090 --> 00:49:01,170
Document how you're going to go through this communication process and this dissemination process, but also reinforce this for you and the clients.

376
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:16,930
How we will be speaking with our audiences. I find that this is helpful in some ways to start at the beginning as well

377
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:22,959
because it allows me to ask and document if you need this report for a funder,

378
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,560
for example. When do you need it? So that I'm not surprised at the end.

379
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:35,610
You don't call me a week before and you're like, Oh yeah, by the way, I need to report for Kresge Foundation and they need it.

380
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,270
Last week I banks I'll do what I can.

381
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:51,020
Sometimes students also ask what an evaluation report should include, and it's the most basic level.

382
00:49:51,680 --> 00:50:04,040
You should answer the evaluation questions. You should talk about the conclusions of the program or the evaluation based on your evaluation logic.

383
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,350
So that's where you talk about these are the standards that we use to make judgments.

384
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,010
This was who who was involved in the judgment.

385
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:20,380
Any data visualization or other ways of providing snapshots of information.

386
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:28,780
So tables, charts, images that might describe the data in a different way.

387
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:35,550
I'll show you an example in a second. And then I've already kind of alluded to this.

388
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:44,910
How did you make the conclusions? I found that while you do want you do want to include.

389
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,330
Things like methods. Threats to validity.

390
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:58,280
The types of measures you used. Typically clients don't want that in the report.

391
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,220
They want it in another addendum. Or at the end.

392
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:08,320
So my general practice is to write that section, but put it at the end always.

393
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,070
And if they say they would prefer to be in the beginning, then I move it.

394
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:23,850
I very rarely have somebody say, Yeah, we really want that finding but that those methods to really, you know, be at the front.

395
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:35,350
Even if they understand the methods. I also tend to put tape like if if it's a really comprehensive report, I put tables of all the data at the end.

396
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:42,090
So they can have it. But generally the report is.

397
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,950
What the evaluation questions were,

398
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:53,890
what the findings were in any snapshots of information that may be particularly interesting to the clients and the stakeholders.

399
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,690
Okay. So before I go on to some examples, any questions?

400
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:22,230
All right. So I'm going to show some examples.

401
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:32,280
Oh. I think I should be okay.

402
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:42,160
Just navigating this way. All right.

403
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:46,150
I got, like, 10 minutes or so. So.

404
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,700
So the first thing I'm showing you is.

405
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:06,300
A infographic that I created for the organization that I now sit on the board for Urban Neighborhood Initiatives.

406
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:13,170
My first work with them, we engaged them. They they have in their form.

407
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,670
They convened an informal network of organizations in southwest Detroit.

408
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,140
Actually, I think if I shrink it like you let me go, that was too far.

409
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,430
If I shrink it like that, is it hard to read from your end?

410
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,499
Huh? You can't read it. Okay, well, I'll.

411
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:38,010
I'll shrink it back down, but at least you can get, like, an a sense of what it looks like the whole way through.

412
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:46,050
And unfortunately, because I did not ask for permission to share any of these today, I'm not going to share them today with you.

413
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,930
But if you would like a copy, you can email me and I can ask.

414
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,280
Except for the kept reports which are publicly available.

415
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:09,900
So that they wanted to make sure that they could disseminate what the network that is what they talked about at their retreat to community.

416
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,340
So they wanted something that was, you know, engaging.

417
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:20,130
So this was what we created. So at the top.

418
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:28,960
You know, iShares kind of the four areas of visioning that they defined.

419
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:35,380
So, for example, youth have access to services and programs that promote social emotional learning.

420
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:44,550
And then they lifted up some of the activities that they were doing to achieve that.

421
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:52,839
And they defined these categories. So, you know, different ones.

422
00:54:52,840 --> 00:55:02,250
We're doing education and youth development. Some of the organizations who are working on social determinants, employment and health,

423
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:07,530
and this allowed them to be able to share with the community what they were doing,

424
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:14,760
to communicate with community, that they were being accountable to the things that they were hearing.

425
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:25,180
So this was a way for them to share that information out. There was also a boring report to say a boring report.

426
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:37,620
This example was actually from a focus group, a virtual focus group that I ran with youth and.

427
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,290
North. West, Detroit. And this was during.

428
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:50,260
This was actually during. Closer to quarantine. So that quarantine period.

429
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:57,910
So we asked them whether it whether it biggest challenges it was regarding mental health same for mental health programing.

430
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:09,670
So as they spoke, I illustrated and then cleaned it up so that they could have they can have this and disarm and have it be in a decent,

431
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:13,720
decent the star form that would look better when you disseminate it.

432
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,600
So these were things that they said were challenges as they went through the focus group.

433
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,829
This is my favorite one. See all the little faces on the squares? I remember their faces in the squares.

434
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,360
You still got them? Everybody loves the faces in the squares.

435
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,840
You know, they talked about, you know, worrying decisions about when they were going to graduate.

436
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,790
You know, some of them are trying to figure that. I thought that was really interesting.

437
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:47,510
They were like, you know, I'm missing my senior year, so should I just not pass this class so I can stay next year?

438
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,270
And that was you know, that was what I thought was really interesting, strategically speaking.

439
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,490
So, you know, again, this was in a more engaging form.

440
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:04,860
I kind of just you know, I also put it into like bullet points for a report.

441
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:11,189
But this was so that the youth could be engaged with the data collection process,

442
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:16,080
but also have to see what they were talking about reflected in the images.

443
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,290
So the next three I'm going to show you are actually from the same project.

444
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:30,610
So I'll open this one first, actually.

445
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:41,250
So when I was still working at the University of Michigan, Atlanta, evaluation of Kresge Innovative Projects, Detroit,

446
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:49,139
which are essentially it's a granting mechanism that Kresge Foundation started,

447
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:57,060
and they have now passed on to a capacity building support organization in Detroit.

448
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:05,820
But they wanted to know more about the impact of the first three rounds of their granting.

449
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,620
So we. I want to go fast forward.

450
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,980
Because I actually it's been a while. I don't even remember all the data collection we did.

451
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:35,210
So we did 42 interviews, five focus groups, and those 42 interviews also included.

452
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:44,020
Most significant change in map. Most significant change no less.

453
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,350
The most significant change, yeah.

454
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:51,700
Was so we asked people what was the most significant changes they saw in their neighborhood based on these projects?

455
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,290
Oh, there it is. So that's who we did all the data collection with.

456
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,849
And this report is, oh, 50 pages.

457
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,840
And as you could see, it's a lot so likely.

458
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:20,430
And here's you know, I has doubts that. You know, as I mentioned, here's the methodology at the at the end.

459
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:25,840
So we have this the findings in this big report.

460
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,570
But then we also split up the findings in different ways.

461
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:40,110
So one example was. No, that's okay.

462
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:47,470
You know, let me do that. All right. We put an infographic within the report so that that can be shared easily.

463
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:52,720
That has a summary of what happened because of the projects.

464
00:59:52,810 --> 01:00:00,900
And these were community development projects. But we also created briefs.

465
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:09,170
That were geared toward specific audiences. So this particular one was for the community development sector.

466
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:22,670
And this is shorter. It's only eight pages. And it was organized in the set of lessons to make it a little bit easier to consume.

467
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:33,410
So one thing you can do when you disseminate again, you can use multiple sort multiple products to be able to communicate with different audiences.

468
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:42,800
So we actually created two other briefs, one for philanthropy and one for the grantees themselves.

469
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:55,470
And again, summarizing results. Because we knew that that full report that Kresge wanted and needed would not be the most engaging material.

470
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,120
So again, different ways of communicating different sizes, different lengths,

471
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:07,960
different forms, different ways to and allow us to be able to do different channels as well.

472
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,590
Another thing I wanted to show you.

473
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:37,600
Yeah. So this was a report for an organization in.

474
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,400
North East? No.

475
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:52,380
I can't exactly remember what more kind of close to central Detroit close to downtown that does community development community building.

476
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,010
Bumblebee is my independent practice. So just so you know.

477
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:09,430
And the reason why I wanted to pull this out is because there were a couple examples of illustrations that were done.

478
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:23,290
Again, for the purposes of dissemination. So among other findings, residents shared their vision for the neighborhood.

479
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:33,740
It was summarized here. But they're also created this illustration so that if they wanted to just have like a visual.

480
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:42,420
With a brief summary. Here you go. They can just, you know, put that up on Facebook or and then just have a little disclaimer.

481
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:49,500
This is the neighborhood. And then these are the five major findings that residents wanted to support youth.

482
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:54,600
They wanted to build community. They wanted to have a safe neighborhood.

483
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,720
Help. They want to help programing and they want it stable housing.

484
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:05,749
So you don't have to share like a lot of detail when you communicate findings.

485
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,760
But sometimes the communication is all is simply about accountability, right?

486
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,830
So here we know we can say we heard what you were saying.

487
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,810
This is what we're sharing. Back to you. No.

488
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:29,860
And again, you know, different tables. To just make the information.

489
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:39,580
Information a little bit more consumable. I mean, here I talk about, again, recommendations.

490
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:46,190
I didn't make these recommendations up on my own. This was emerged out of it, out of a process.

491
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:52,820
And I've also share that I don't just say the program was inadequate and the program was adequate.

492
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:02,510
I don't find that to be particularly helpful. So I shared different ways that this pilot program worked well.

493
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:12,920
So for them, community relationship building, they did a lot of negative change work in the neighborhood, but there were areas that could be improved.

494
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:23,720
They didn't have, according to stakeholders, enough education about advocacy, neighborhood organizing and structural policy change.

495
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:31,250
So these are these are ways that now a program implementer can follow up and say, okay,

496
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:41,650
what we heard is that we need to have more information in our programing about how to advocate, how to organize and how to make policy change.

497
01:04:49,060 --> 01:05:03,200
And then the last one I wanted to show you. Was from an organization here in.

498
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,170
Washtenaw County Court. We the people. Opportunity for.

499
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,880
And they they they really like. They really go that communication.

500
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:21,480
I will if you are interested in how to communicate, I would recommend that you kind of look at them as an example.

501
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:28,019
I don't know how the person how the the EDI did it, but he ended up recently well,

502
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:33,270
maybe last year on CBS News, like the morning news, like they came out.

503
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,780
Well, what's her name? Lisa. Some one of the reporters on there.

504
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:43,780
I don't I don't watch CBS Morning News. So they're really good at communication is my whole point.

505
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:53,960
So I did a report with them. They wanted to learn more about how they could strengthen their programing and their evaluation work.

506
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:06,330
So actually, before I show you that, I'm going to show you something else. So part of that project was doing a ripple effect mapping project.

507
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:13,350
This is where you get people in the room together and get them to talk about what activities they did,

508
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:20,010
what they did differently because of that and the commune and how that impacted the community.

509
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:28,770
So you can see on this messy, messy, messy picture that people share activities that they remember engaging in.

510
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,140
What they did differently based on their participation.

511
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:45,980
And how that impacted the community. And I should say that the idea of the farm is that formerly incarcerated citizens.

512
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:51,410
Learn how to work. The fire may learn work.

513
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:56,900
Different workforce development skills. So we did this ripple effect mapping session.

514
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:08,240
You know, I illustrated and wrote as they were talking. But obviously, this is messy and hard to disseminate.

515
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:18,410
Right? Like. But what I did is distill it down with the with the cooperation of different stakeholders.

516
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:35,390
And now we'll go to the report. Some among all this, you know, one wonderful, exciting text.

517
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:44,870
I created this illustration to illustrate in summarize what that whole map said.

518
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:57,920
Well, part of it. So one thing that I just wanted to make sure I pointed out, in addition to like the description is the butterflies.

519
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:04,130
I've never seen a grown man talk about butterflies, but they were serious about these butterflies.

520
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:15,290
And so but they they felt that those butterflies were like a kind of a metaphor for the transformation that they were experiencing.

521
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:25,240
So I made sure I put the butterflies in the picture. With different samba symbols to represent some of the other things that they talked about,

522
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:32,740
such as helping local residents, helping those who were struggling to eat.

523
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:44,650
You know. So just again, a different way of taking what they shared and putting it into a more consumable format.

524
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:56,209
I guess since I'm standing here, I'll show you the logic model too, because you're probably wondering another way.

525
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:01,780
Logic models look. So this is the one I created for them.

526
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:06,650
Note that I did not follow the rules that I've shared gave to you.

527
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,660
I have an impact column that is not population level.

528
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:21,540
So I even break my own rules. Yeah.

529
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:27,850
So, yes. So why? Why they decided to break the rule.

530
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:34,250
I just added this one more on time. We're making time.

531
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:39,229
A central part of it versus versus the way I present it.

532
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:43,630
Logic modeling to you was. More of a behavioral.

533
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:53,580
Health kind of way of doing it. What about behavioral health? That's more of mental health, but I want it the way I presented it to you divides it by.

534
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:58,799
Stages of health change or behavior change.

535
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,700
So first you gain knowledge and skills.

536
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:08,470
Then you change behaviors and there's a change in conditions.

537
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:22,210
But this one is more centered on time. So the outcomes are really what came out of the because it's a long.

538
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:31,820
March. It's about March, too. No, it's about either March or April to November.

539
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:41,360
So it's a long program. So the outcomes are the outcomes that they would experience at the end of that programing.

540
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,630
And the impact is what they wanted to see,

541
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,620
not only for the interns because that's what they were called interns, but the community that surrounded them.

542
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:57,390
So that's why. Mm.

543
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:09,580
And I'm glad you asked that, because it's just something you should always keep in mind, too, as was the audience for your materials.

544
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:19,860
So if I am, for example, doing the logic model for like Kellogg, the template I gave to you is the Kellogg's template.

545
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,820
So if it's a Kellogg brand, I'm probably just going to use a template because.

546
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,410
Frankly, why not use their template?

547
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,240
I know that they paid for my evaluation and they paid for the programing.

548
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:39,360
I just need to use that template. It's a political I mean, frankly, that's a political decision.

549
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:49,030
So. And so those are some examples.

550
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:54,270
Any questions or comments? And yes, I like to draw.

551
01:11:54,280 --> 01:12:02,080
I told you that at the beginning. I draw on the screen all the time. When?

552
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:12,930
All right. So all kinds of ways that you can engage with different findings and present them to different

553
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:20,010
audiences to be able to get the word out about what was done in as many ways as possible.

554
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:27,659
One thing I'm really interested in trying is other even more consumable forms of dissemination.

555
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,780
Like I've been entertaining doing comic books.

556
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,560
If I ever find the time to practice that one as well.

557
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,340
And I know some people are again playing around with Tic Tacs and.

558
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,300
It's not my gift. But. Hmm.

559
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,180
So for the last few minutes, I talk about the last assignment.

560
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:04,170
So. Final planning presentation.

561
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:12,090
I'll give the disclaimer at the end again, but the presentation is simply following the plan.

562
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:23,290
So as I go through this. Just know that the presentation should be lifting up these major sections as well.

563
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:31,510
One thing that will be new to you is when you submit the plan, the final plan.

564
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:36,870
One thing you should include is an executive summary. Just the abstract length summary.

565
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:49,720
That provides a brief overview of the intervention that you've focused your evaluation plan on, and then the purpose and key evaluation questions.

566
01:13:53,940 --> 01:14:00,840
So two, three, four and five. Those are sections that you've already done.

567
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,690
Either through that logic, my mining assignment or the data collection plan assignment.

568
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:20,780
So what are you all you will be doing is you will be revising those two assignments based based on the feedback.

569
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,130
And then bring and merging them together into one document.

570
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:31,780
Take care that there's consistent consistency through the document.

571
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:38,640
I know. Sometimes you might revise. The logic model.

572
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,770
And then the revise the data collection plan and then just put them together.

573
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:52,570
But I want you know, I can't stress enough that you make sure that there's continuity between the two documents.

574
01:14:54,100 --> 01:15:00,400
So the questions should inform the indicators which should inform the methods.

575
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:11,210
I'm. And we stress that because I know that there have been cases where people are kind of hopping back and forth.

576
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,660
And that's fine for your work process, but just make sure when we grade,

577
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:25,810
we're going to look to see if you have a question that you say is the focus of the evaluation.

578
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:32,440
We're going to look to see that you use the design and the methods that will allow you to answer that question.

579
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:41,580
With that. So just make sure I know some of you have like a lot of questions and you're, like really excited about them and kept them in the document.

580
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:47,810
Make make sure it's clear that even if you have ten questions that you share with us.

581
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:55,270
That if you're only answering five for the evaluation, that we understand that.

582
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:04,379
Preferably just take the questions out. But if you're not going to take them out because you just really love them and you,

583
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,900
you know, you curl up with them at night and you can't delete them.

584
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,360
I get I get it. I mean, I get it.

585
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:21,930
So but I'm what I'm saying is just make sure we understand that the evaluation plan is not focusing on those questions,

586
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,620
whatever way you put a disclaimer box around them.

587
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:30,330
These are the questions I love, but I couldn't I could not delete them.

588
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:35,370
I just make it clear. So.

589
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:42,410
And again, like, what's here? Are the same things that were in the assignment.

590
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,920
Social problem the need for the program logic model.

591
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:52,930
The three of the five evaluation questions in the design and the methods.

592
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:08,210
The new sections, the ones that we will have never seen one the analysis section and to the dissemination section for the analysis section.

593
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,250
This really is discussing implications for interpretation.

594
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,920
So briefly describe. How you collect.

595
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:25,240
How you're going to analyze the data. You collect it. And this this can be very high.

596
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,600
This can be high level. So, for example, if you.

597
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:36,410
You know, describe a survey that you run to analyze the survey data.

598
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:45,870
You can speak simply speak to we're going to do some descriptive read some descriptive statistics like counts.

599
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:57,400
Means averages will run inferential analysis such as regression ANOVA.

600
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:04,900
One thing that we might pay that not my one thing we'll pay attention to, though, is.

601
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,849
We won't necessarily be able to. Obviously, you won't have variables in the paper,

602
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:23,240
so we won't be able to confirm fully that you can run a regression versus unknown over those types of statistical decisions.

603
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:29,330
But just be attentive that you're not just throwing out statistical methods.

604
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:31,160
And.

605
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:39,340
You know, without some consideration, because we'll be able to tell if you just say something like, Oh yeah, we're going to run a logistic regression.

606
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:48,730
The first thing if like if I say logistic, the first thing I'm doing is looking to see is the outcome a yes or no dichotomous dichotomous outcome.

607
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:58,490
So if you say logistic especially I'm too because that's I'm going to look to see if it is even possible for you to run a logistic.

608
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:08,030
Now you don't have to obviously you can't confirm like have I met the requirements to run a logistic analysis but those are.

609
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:15,260
So keep that table in mind that I showed you for the types of analysis you can run in.

610
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,070
The same is what qualitative. If you say that you.

611
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,860
Aren't going to do a thing. I don't know.

612
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:30,740
Never mind. I can't come up with a good example for qualitative, but I simply want you to make sure that your speak,

613
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:36,790
that you're thinking about what kind of data you might have and thinking about the types of analysis that you could run.

614
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,290
You should also describe the standards that you will compare the evaluation findings to.

615
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,510
And again, we know this is we understand that this is a not this is not real.

616
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:58,820
So this can also be high level. And you know, we will develop.
