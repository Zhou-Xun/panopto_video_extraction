1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,750
Who's emailing me about. Okay. All right.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,160
So. Hi, everybody. Sorry, Josh and Joe, that you missed the announcement.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,760
We didn't have class last week cause I was sitting at home and I got an email.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,450
I'm here in class, but yes, we will have class today and Thursday.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,890
Just a few announcements before we get started.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:34,860
This is the last week of lecture. So next week we'll start your research presentations on Tuesday.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:46,290
Just to recap what the expectations are for your presentation, turning what you're turning in to canvas is the poster itself.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,720
When you come to class, you will be showing a PowerPoint that kind of hits all the main points of your poster.

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,050
So there's two components to it. You can choose to turn in your presence.

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,390
Okay. I was like, Is this a solid word to you?

11
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,469
The class again? So you can choose to turn in your PowerPoint if you want.

12
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,620
But I'm only really evaluating you on your presentation and your ability to answer your questions.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,130
Sorry, it's more about the presentation than the poster they're using.

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,969
They're both worth one. Oh, okay. You go. Yes, yes.

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:37,770
Yes. So there is a virtual option because Joe will be presenting remotely if for some reason one of you gets like RSV or something next Tuesday.

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,750
Then you can also present remotely that zoom link is setup in zoom.

17
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,160
You finished your last quiz. Yay. I think all of you should be able to finish presenting your posters on Tuesday.

18
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,639
So that means that on Thursday of next week we won't have class.

19
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,900
And then you can focus on your questionnaire. Yes. Bridget Long, how long is the presentation you have?

20
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,770
Because this is a smaller class. You all have up to 15 minutes and then there's 5 minutes of Q&A.

21
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,110
Is there a minimum time that you want us to? No less than.

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,030
Far? No. No less than ten. Okay. Because in the past, I've had students who did it in five, and I was just like, it's really bad.

23
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:31,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then 10 minutes seemed too short, actually, the previous semesters.

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:41,350
So you have up to 15 minutes. We've got. We've got the time. So I'll be curious to see what all y'all chose to focus on for your presentation.

25
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,050
And then. And then. And then just the finalization of your questionnaire and the write up.

26
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,740
And then we'll be done with the class. Yay!

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,050
Thank you for making the questionnaire you do during finals week.

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,550
Oh, yeah. Really appreciate that. Oh, good. You're welcome.

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,900
All other teachers are like, Yeah, no, actually, I have a couple of papers doing next week and it's kind of held for the.

30
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:14,499
Oh, okay. Well, yay. That worked out. Also, course evaluations are open, so if you fill out your course evaluation,

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,980
just take a screenshot that said like, oh, thanks so and so for doing 796.

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,380
There's an assignment in canvas where you can upload it and then get bonus participation points.

33
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:34,420
You all are getting 100% in participation, but it'll help, you know, just boost up your grade overall and it's helpful for me.

34
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,380
So yeah, I think that's all the administrative announcements that I had.

35
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:49,050
So today we're going to be talking this week where we're going to be talking about program evaluation and in particular today,

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:56,590
I'm just going to give you an overview of program evaluation. And then Thursday we'll specifically be talking about psychosocial factors.

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:07,090
Now I'm doing this because at least in the IHS aspect, I noticed there's a dearth of people with knowledge on program evaluation.

38
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,020
So how many of you have taken a formal program evaluation class scheduled to OC right now?

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,730
How how is it and what are you learning? I forgot that we had this class.

40
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,040
It feels like. Because I feel like the evaluation guys are my class. No.

41
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,980
Okay. Okay. I haven't learned really which one is such a thing either.

42
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:45,200
622 Oh, but I was, it was like at first it was she talked about like cultural codes, culturally responses and that was good and that was interesting.

43
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,429
And then she just went through like this CDC steps for program evaluation.

44
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,540
And then it got kind of like to me, it seems like it's just like research methods.

45
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,140
I don't know, like it just seems like research methods. And it's not anything that I didn't know before.

46
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,430
Okay. Who teaches at Ebony? Right.

47
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:12,170
Okay. I also did take on an undergrad, but it was like I learned less in that class.

48
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:22,490
I think. Undergrad class. Yeah. Oh, okay. I was that program evaluation is not like it was really cost benefit analysis or a little bit.

49
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,750
Yeah. But it depends on his or not or something. It depends on who teaches it.

50
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,340
Right. Because the the when I did program evaluation in my master's class, it was very quantitative, healthier.

51
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:41,720
So we're exclusively doing analysis and formulas on like how to calculate,

52
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:48,830
basically return on investment, whereas people focus on different aspects of them.

53
00:05:49,190 --> 00:06:01,909
So I will be going over at the CDC steps, but hopefully the same in it and it's probably going to be redundant for you too.

54
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,850
So that's good. I'm sorry.

55
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:11,720
You can totally do other things when I'm talking today, but just keep your bodies here physically present because that will make me feel better.

56
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,980
But you know, we'll have some discussion about this as well.

57
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,200
And then on Thursday, walk, contextualize it. So why you haven't taken an evaluation class?

58
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:30,210
No. And then a Josh you know taking this let's go let's go to prices program evaluation course that's going to be very different.

59
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,540
Yeah, it's like an international development work or at least sustainable development

60
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,460
that's going to be very different because I bet it's mostly going to focus on NGOs.

61
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,830
Yeah. Okay. You just get to pick which probably evaluation class you take.

62
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,229
There's there's like five of them, but like one of them is also public policy,

63
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,520
one which is impossible to get into, which is probably more quantitative. Was that at the Ford School.

64
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,890
Yeah. They don't like us. Yeah, they don't. They.

65
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,400
We have some dual degree students there. They have, they have what sounds like very cool class.

66
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,559
Oh yeah. There's you can't get into them unless you're where they're billed as being able to get into the classes.

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Yeah. Okay. No one else. Oh, already.

68
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,430
So let's see what's going on.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,200
So why program evaluation? Very open ended.

70
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:29,340
Why? Why all programs cost money in in order to determine if you're wisely using resources, you probably should evaluate what you're doing.

71
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,780
Is it making an impact? You know, it's like you set it out to do this stuff and help the world in some way or function.

72
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,290
Is it actually working to readjust? No recording.

73
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,680
I am okay. Yeah, I did.

74
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Yeah. Basically that most of the time, though, it is accountability to the funders.

75
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,610
And you'd be surprised how often programs are implemented and there is no evaluation.

76
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:09,430
So one of the main things is that if you apply for anything with federal funding, like a grant proposal, within your grant proposal,

77
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:17,810
you have to have some preliminary explanation of how you plan to evaluate the efficacy of this program or this intervention.

78
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:26,230
They want some foresight into that. But if you're getting like foundation money or the money comes from another source, or if it comes from like,

79
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:34,420
you know, a nonfederal entity, people don't necessarily think to bother with evaluation.

80
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:40,960
Then definitely if you're getting funding from like Medicare or Medicaid, they make you measure specific metrics.

81
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,090
So here it says these are zombie evaluators.

82
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,010
And they said, yes, I get it, you all want to eat brains, but why do you want to eat brains?

83
00:08:51,010 --> 00:09:00,790
What is our intended outcome here? I always thought that if there would be a zombie apocalypse, I would just let myself turn into a zombie.

84
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,770
I'd go to like a like I'm on a boat in like a lake and do what I find in island.

85
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,730
Okay. What kind of life is that? Yeah. What kind of life is that?

86
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,500
I can't run fast. I kind of dream of being like a fire watch lookout person sometimes.

87
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,830
I've seen a few on TikTok, and honestly, it doesn't seem that bad.

88
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,780
I mean, you have to climb down a lot of ladders to use the restroom, but I'm like, you never know.

89
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,320
Being a zombie could be nice. You zombie, would you even know?

90
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,259
Yeah, you wouldn't even know. Ignorance is bliss. But anyways, so the comic is just like they eat brains.

91
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,520
But why is it for sustenance? Is it for enjoyment?

92
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,100
Is it some primal need? So this is just a very rudimentary example.

93
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:58,240
So with effective problem evaluation, essentially this is what we want to be a systematic way to improve and account for public health actions.

94
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:07,210
And this involves procedures that are usable, feasible, ethical or proprietary propriety appropriate and then accurate.

95
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:15,370
So this is the CDC framework, which we'll talk about the six steps in a little bit more detail.

96
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,870
But of course, like, I feel like everything into public health folds into this,

97
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:28,449
which is why it's interesting to me that it's not a required course for all public health students, because you talk so much about making smart goals.

98
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,510
And smart goals are essentially the crux of building a public public health evaluation program.

99
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,810
So first, you need to assign some value to your programmatic activities.

100
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,190
What will be evaluated? In other words, like what is the program and in what context does it exist?

101
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:56,950
So if you think about previous case study examples that we've used this semester, going back to the L.L.Bean one, for example.

102
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,750
That program was about reducing musculoskeletal disorders and improving cardiovascular health,

103
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:15,190
and the context in which that existed was in the workplace, because their workforce particularly had an higher mean age for their workers.

104
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,100
And the second is what aspects of the program will be considered when judging performance?

105
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,090
It's tricky because you have to strike a balance between what is feasible to achieve and what is.

106
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:35,650
You're trying to measure too many things before you get really unwieldy because a lot of people, you know,

107
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,520
especially it's really tempting when you only have like $10,000,

108
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,010
a limited amount of funding to do something you want to try to accomplish as much as you can.

109
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:53,319
You want to really stretch that dollar, right. But are you actually making it worse by trying to cram all of these things into your

110
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,230
program versus focusing on like one very specific thing and trying to do it well,

111
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,350
then what standards must be reached for the program to be considered successful?

112
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,760
What evidence will be used to indicate how the program is performed?

113
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,000
And then what conclusions about program performance are justified by comparing available evidence?

114
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,720
So first is engaging stakeholders.

115
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,290
There weren't that many of fund comics for that program evaluation, so I just tried to find some.

116
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,610
So how many of you have ever partaken as a stakeholder before?

117
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,580
Sam Yeah. I mean, yeah, I guess it depends on how broad.

118
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,360
We're all stakeholders to this whole. Yeah. Okay. So in a public, um, intervention or program?

119
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,990
Yes. In my work, I have some areas of this.

120
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,970
Yeah. So what does that generally look like for you? And who are the other stakeholders?

121
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,889
Yeah, and I'm like the researcher on the team. So we're like kind of some of the people that are doing the work, but that's like partners people.

122
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,010
So we're among the steering committees and stuff and helping to move it along this program that we're doing.

123
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:17,460
So it's just kind of that my role just really just sat in on the steering committee meetings and stuff along other researchers and stuff here at best.

124
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,380
So it's just researchers. Well, then that's our, our stakeholders.

125
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,190
But there's a lot of informal policy people. We have community leaders, we have our students that are involved in the program, that kind of thing.

126
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,580
Yeah. Okay. Um, I mean, obviously we can't do our work in a vacuum, right?

127
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,670
So the main thing is that the evaluation findings might be ignored,

128
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,360
criticized or resisted if the evaluation didn't address the stakeholders concerns or values.

129
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,510
It doesn't matter if you have the most amazing intervention or the most amazing program.

130
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,990
If people didn't want it, they're not going to receive your evaluation findings positively.

131
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:07,469
So some stakeholders might be like people involved in program evaluations of the sponsors.

132
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:14,430
For example, collaborators, funders, administrative staff, those served by the program like clients,

133
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,020
family, neighborhood organizations, and then the primary users of the evaluation.

134
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,610
I'll give you an example, some sample reports towards the end.

135
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,580
So I will say like for example, when I interned at the Douglas County Health Department in Omaha,

136
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,089
we were implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program.

137
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:41,340
So this is a CDC nationwide program that they usually implement in specific counties with high risk of diabetes.

138
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,370
And so in Omaha in particular, North Omaha had a high concentration of black people,

139
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,880
and then South Omaha had a high concentration of Hispanic Latinos.

140
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,690
So they were doing dips in both both North and south.

141
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,410
Oh, but it was being rolled out by the YMCA.

142
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,800
So the stakeholders involved in that were the county health department representatives from the YMCA.

143
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,760
There was a lady who was from the local health system that took care of insurance.

144
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:19,620
We had like a case manager and a nurse on it, and then we had some representatives from the community that are on,

145
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,440
like the Latino Business Council and things like that.

146
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:30,389
So that was our attempt at engaging stakeholders and we would meet monthly to kind of discuss the progress

147
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:36,480
of where things were going and what the outcomes might look like and any issues that we encountered.

148
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:45,000
But a lot of times and researchers still do this all the time is that they'll just like helicopter into

149
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:53,010
a community or whatever and then determine for them what they feel like is the issue to be addressed.

150
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,629
And the community's like we didn't we didn't want this in the first place.

151
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:05,910
Right? So actually a parallel example for my class that I was teaching this morning,

152
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,979
we were talking we were watching a video on public health funding here in the United States.

153
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,180
So in the United States, according to one report from Trust for America's Health,

154
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,729
the United States spends about $24 per person per year on public health measures,

155
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,130
whereas Canada spends $7,000 per person per year on public health measures.

156
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:35,459
But they were comparing, you know, the United States funding in terms of public health versus what they spend on the military.

157
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,630
So they were saying, like with this many tanks, we could have bought like this many and 95 respirators and so on.

158
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,559
And with a lot of the military equipment that they developed for the technology, like in the video,

159
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:58,680
they said like the military didn't even need or want this anyway, but they sunk like billions and billions of dollars into it.

160
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:10,980
So, you know, that is something that I see is like a pervasive issue, for example, with the Michigan Healthy Meals on Cooperative that we do.

161
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:18,389
There are other Nielson researchers. There's some in Philly that we work with Canada, California, Washington State,

162
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:25,920
and there's some in Colorado and a lot of researchers who don't necessarily do the community based participatory research.

163
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:33,980
They start out with something very complicated, like trying to address ventilation and getting then.

164
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:41,960
Inhalation retrofitted in nail salons, which can be very costly because nail salons run on very thin profit margins.

165
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,180
And so retrofitting their ventilation system can sometimes cost up to $20,000.

166
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,590
But they don't understand the principles of air exchange.

167
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,149
They don't understand why ventilation is important in the first place.

168
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,620
They don't understand how to change their air filtration system.

169
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,899
So why would they? They didn't even ask for that.

170
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,520
Like, how about we start with like,

171
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:18,319
do you even know what these chemicals are doing to you as a baseline as a as a very rudimentary example or I'm sure we see this,

172
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,590
you know, happening in like communities of color all the time.

173
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,290
We're like researchers without asking the communities go in and say, okay, we're gonna address this for you.

174
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,540
And it's not necessarily very successful, but one pitfall is avoiding excessive stakeholder identification.

175
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,689
This is the issue of too many cooks in the kitchen.

176
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,799
Everybody's going to have different ideas and different priorities.

177
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,040
So whoever is leading the project really asked, Do these people need a seat at the table or not?

178
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,450
But definitely you should at least have these three main groups involved.

179
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:05,629
Now describing the program. This one here is a just a cartoon of a balloon animal vaccinations.

180
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,580
So they're tricking kids into getting vaccines by giving them the balloon animals.

181
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,030
But describing the programs, again, you know, I'll kind of gloss over some of this stuff because I'm sure you've heard it before.

182
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,800
What are the needs? What are your expected effects? What activities do you plan to conduct?

183
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,710
What resources do you actually have? What stages of development do you plan to see these and what is the context and what's happening?

184
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,410
But one of the key parts of program evaluation is actually a logic model.

185
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,950
How many of you have made one before? Okay.

186
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,870
Did you like it? You did not like it. I think there are only useful and very specific contexts, but what kind of context?

187
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:56,310
Lately I've been along a lot of our models for academic senses, and usually it's been like assigned an assignment.

188
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,590
That doesn't make any sense, but I've used it in like actual work context and if there's like a complicated

189
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,290
problem or I'm just trying to map out different departments or that kind of stuff.

190
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:16,070
I love logic models. You know, I'm like the black sheep, but I make logic models a lot for work and stuff just for my own use.

191
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,310
I like them. I don't like making them. Gantt charts into the Gantt charts.

192
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:30,680
Oh, huge. Okay. Gantt charts are more for, like, timeline management rather than like overall, what are we trying to achieve?

193
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,370
So this one here is a different kind of logic model.

194
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,570
This is a very rudimentary logic model. Your logic model would look a lot like the one I show you on the next slide.

195
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:49,489
But it doesn't have to. So this one here is a logic model for a tuberculosis control program where essentially they write,

196
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,510
identify the cases, identify who they've come into contact with.

197
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,140
We diagnose the disease. Prescribe treatment.

198
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,410
Begin treatment. Complete treatment. Cure the disease.

199
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,979
Okay. And then below that, you have your infrastructure components, which are health information systems,

200
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,450
staff, trained, community trust, effective organization, research results.

201
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,580
And ultimately that reduces TB incidence and improves population health status.

202
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,050
Have you all seen one like this one before? Do you prefer this?

203
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,730
Yeah. This makes sense. Going to the MRD makes more sense to you. This is more like a flow chart, right?

204
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,630
So this is what people usually think of? Yes.

205
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:38,930
Yeah. So you have your inputs, activities short come out, short term outcomes, mid-term outcomes, and then long term outcomes.

206
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,099
So your inputs are usually like what are your tangible resources?

207
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,950
And that includes personnel as well. So here they have staff funding, infrastructure, technical assistance.

208
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,259
Their activities for this are going to be surveillance, research and then programs.

209
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:04,069
So this is specifically a logic model focused on. Josh, you have these slides gathered here, you know,

210
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:11,090
mental health programs and then their short term outcomes are to generate an understanding that mental health is

211
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:17,840
fundamental for establishing physical health and then clarifying and confirming the role of public health in mental health.

212
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:25,470
Then midterm outcomes are, you know, in terms of identifying barriers.

213
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,860
Blah, blah, blah. Long term outcomes.

214
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:35,660
Sometimes what you might see along the bottom of this is that people will run a timeline that has months or years.

215
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:42,170
So it might be like zero months to 24 months, for example, but you usually don't have to do this.

216
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:50,540
I personally, I like it when I see one because it helps me understand what the program is trying to do.

217
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,890
But when I make one myself, I honestly feel like I'm phoning it in sometimes.

218
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,400
Is that how you all feel really bad making stuff out? Like.

219
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,430
Like this one does have outputs on it. Like, yeah, yeah.

220
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,510
For the life of me, understand what it output is, I wasn't able to figure that out and I'm like, We got it wrong on the project anyway.

221
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,930
I don't know. So, like, so the short term, mid-term and long term outcomes, does that kind of make sense to everybody?

222
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:24,020
It's like, what is the very, you know, acute thing that we can do versus like what's going to take longer.

223
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,490
Outputs are usually things like tangibles. For example, are you going to like do a community webinar?

224
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Are you going to distribute like a newsletter or a white paper?

225
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,400
Are you going to hold like community conversations?

226
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,680
Are you going to do like whatever?

227
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:51,200
So those are generally the outputs are more so like something that you can like hold in your hand or consider

228
00:23:51,200 --> 00:24:00,020
as a deliverable where the outcomes may be less tangible in the sense that you can see it with your naked eye.

229
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,740
Yes, we're thinking of it this way. I think of it, but I don't know if it's right.

230
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:10,159
I always think like outcomes is like the output or outputs as outcomes, like activities with activities and leads and these things.

231
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,280
Yes, but then the outcomes are from those outputs.

232
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,899
Is that a good way of thinking or is that wrong? No, that's another way to think about it as well.

233
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:26,300
But it depends on like there's so many ways to do logic models that there is no wrong or right way.

234
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,590
But I will tell you, if you submit any grant to the NIH.

235
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,709
Boy, do they love a logic model and you better have a logic model in their rational utility of them sometimes.

236
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:44,220
Or it's like sometimes they're like, this is so wordy that like I feel like just having a paper or something would be better.

237
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,090
We'll get to the utility bill, we'll get to the utility.

238
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:56,510
But like for example, one of the attenuate the activity, for example, form and strengthen public health partnerships with mental health programs.

239
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:04,999
So the output for that might be formation of a community advisory board consisting of at least five members.

240
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,750
Right. And then the short term is generate understanding, identify mental health, and then, you know,

241
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:18,890
ultimately get to resiliency or if the surveillance is create operational definition of mental.

242
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:27,080
Or [INAUDIBLE], an output of that might be like, you know, publication on website of,

243
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,120
you know, operational definition of mental health or like creating fliers or,

244
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,409
you know, if we want to improve understanding of impact and burden of mental health,

245
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,440
the output for that could be like dissemination of surveys or conducting focus groups.

246
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,280
So to gauge their own, this one is perfectly acceptable as well.

247
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,069
So if this makes more sense to you, you should go do that.

248
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:03,649
But this one, people love this one. I love this one. Now focusing in on your evaluation design.

249
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:14,510
So having a very clear defined profile well helps prevent premature decision making on how the evaluation should be conducted.

250
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:23,090
So you want to write explicit evaluation questions to be answered in a list, ideally, you know, up to ten.

251
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:29,690
Right? But you can have some questions. So what is the goal of your program or your intervention?

252
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,570
Are you wanting to change practice? Are you wanting to just assess what the effects are?

253
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,430
And there's the process evaluation of inquiring inquiry to affect those who participate.

254
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,509
So things that we have to think about our users uses questions, methods and agreements.

255
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:57,890
So that includes describing practical methods for sampling, data collection, data analysis, interpretation and judgment.

256
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,360
Now, the three terms that will come up the most is process first process evaluation.

257
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,250
An impact evaluation. An outcomes evaluation.

258
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:19,560
Do all the dolls know that the difference between any of those to be covered in tax?

259
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,290
I don't know. She called it something else I was do to talk about that.

260
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:32,740
I don't know if there were. I mean, just I know at least using the collectible terms of I mean impact is like what happens.

261
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,960
Like I imagine outcomes is like little bit different but.

262
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,270
Take a stab at it.

263
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:49,219
Yeah, because this evaluation is looking at the internal like the program itself and how they're kind of going about the work or the outcomes.

264
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,090
It's just like the program impact. You need your whatever. Um.

265
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:06,140
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Bridget I don't have like a fully formed OC that's like accessing like to what extent do you, like, meet your program goals?

266
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,340
Yeah, yeah, a little bit of everything.

267
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,770
Right. So process evaluation is internal to like the actual program or intervention itself.

268
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:23,390
The main key is that it is dynamic and it's happening while you're implementing the program or the intervention.

269
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,800
So you're not waiting until the end to do that evaluation.

270
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:35,150
You're evaluating as you go along and making dynamic improvements on things that need to change.

271
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,600
Now, sometimes it can be hard to change things midstream.

272
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,270
Like, for example, we'll get to this in a little bit.

273
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:49,310
If you decided on a specific way to collect data from your participants and then halfway through you realize that it's trash and then you.

274
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,430
Change it midstream to some type of other form of data collection.

275
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,160
How are you now going to combine those two if they're not the same, they're not comparable anymore, right?

276
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,690
But if it's something like, you know, we are flat,

277
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,560
we are distributing fliers in the community as a form of like trying to get recruitment that's not really working for us.

278
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,480
So we're going to switch over to recruitment via social media, via Instagram, via Facebook.

279
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,860
That is like a dynamic part of the process evaluation.

280
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,919
That is a good thing to do. But some things it's very challenging to go back and change.

281
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:35,990
But ideally, one, your improvement implementing a program or an intervention, you're doing a process evaluation as you go along.

282
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,250
And sometimes when you do it, you may not even be aware that you're doing it right.

283
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,810
I think you can even think about this as just like. Performance improvement.

284
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:58,250
So, for example, you know, back in the day as an undergrad, like I used to go, I think I've told you all before,

285
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,020
I used to do eye tracking on little kids where you like strap them into the car seat.

286
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,870
The first few times you go about it,

287
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:13,400
you don't really know how to set up the computer quickly takes you a very long time to calibrate things you don't know how to deal with the kids,

288
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,870
and then for the future. Subsequent times, when you're doing your population sampling,

289
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:23,120
you kind of know like what are the pinch points to address and how to iron out those issues, right?

290
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,810
Same thing. Last year when I was collecting saliva samples from waste workers,

291
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:38,840
I failed to tell some of them that they shouldn't have eaten or drank and anything with coloring right before because some people had

292
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,950
just immediately drank coffee and then gave me their saliva or they were like sucking on a cough drop and gave me like red saliva.

293
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:56,540
And while saliva is a very robust biomarker to collect having a having cough drop medication, it messes up your sample.

294
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,790
Right? So that's all part of the process evaluation. Now, an impact evaluation.

295
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes, you're measuring the impact, but this is more so quantitative.

296
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:14,690
So this is when you take like a methods in evaluations course where you do all the like equations and quantitative plug ins,

297
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,249
try to find out essentially like what that return on investment was, right?

298
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,740
Or what that savings was. Outcomes can be quantitative or qualitative.

299
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,120
They don't necessarily have to have a dollar amount or a value to it.

300
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:35,509
With impact, you're usually seeing things like money decreases in like fatality or morbidity rates,

301
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,490
prevalence rates, incidence rates, whereas outcomes can be more.

302
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,720
Holistic, if that makes sense.

303
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:54,300
So rather than saying like, okay, for every dollar spent on this diabetes prevention program, we save $5 on diabetes care.

304
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,660
That's more impact.

305
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:04,719
Whereas the outcomes evaluation may be like improved quality of life for those who participated in the Derby by Diabetes Prevention Program.

306
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,350
Like healthier eating choices, you know.

307
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,210
You know, greater access to, like healthy foods and things like that.

308
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:23,520
Does that make sense? So with this in particular, the third step is focusing on evaluation design.

309
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,520
So first you have to think about your approaches.

310
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:34,530
Are you going to do a theory driven evaluation, a developmental evaluation, an outcome, an impact evaluation?

311
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,110
What are you going to do for your process evaluation? And then are you going to conduct a needs assessment?

312
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,260
I'll get to this in a little bit.

313
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:50,309
And then for the evaluation designs, non experimental designs, quasi experimental designs, quantitative experimental designs, qualitative designs,

314
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:56,190
and then mixed methods designs, then data collection, which I'll get to in a little bit,

315
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,310
and then evaluation systems, which we won't really talk about.

316
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,470
So first, let's focus on actually evaluation designs.

317
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:18,380
What our non experimental design or I guess an experimental design would be fairly apparent to intervention server control or something.

318
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,620
Right. And so non-expert in design probably is just a single design.

319
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,880
So I guess you're not really to draw that cross-section up.

320
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah. Cross actually. Or it could even be a cohort right now.

321
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,470
What's the difference between quasi experimental design and quantitative experimental design?

322
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,240
Generally, quantitative experimental design you can think of as a clinical trial.

323
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,750
Right. And this doesn't necessarily have to be a medication.

324
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:58,460
But think about it more so as a control randomized controlled trial where you have an experimental group and then you have a control group.

325
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,290
Now, what is a quasi experimental design then?

326
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,760
I want to take a guess. I mean, it's like the same thing.

327
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,180
They don't control group. You're subservient to things, right?

328
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:18,080
Like two groups of people, but not to each other. Not to a different control group yet, b, more or less.

329
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,410
Yes. And you didn't do the assigning? Exactly.

330
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,890
Yes. You yourself.

331
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:31,670
So in the quantitative experimental design, you yourself or you're the group you're participating with, did the decide the assignment,

332
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,690
even if it might have been randomized or not randomized generally with quasi experimental design, somebody else collected the data.

333
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,430
You did not collect the data.

334
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:50,960
So there wasn't necessarily a treatment or, you know, experimental group per say and there wasn't necessarily a control group per say.

335
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,740
But now you're going to make it. So, for example,

336
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:04,820
I've done a quasi experimental design before where I use a national data set from not from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

337
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,590
Every four years they administer something called the Quality of Work Life Module.

338
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:19,100
And this is the only module or the only data set in the United States that kind of captures psychosocial factors in the workplace besides the well.

339
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,400
BQ now but the well because it was very new, it wasn't around, right.

340
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,030
Then I ask UW l has been around since 2002.

341
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,899
So with this study that I did, I was interested in understanding safety, climate,

342
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,720
the perceptions of safety, climate between workers at a union and workers that weren't in a union.

343
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,520
But because I didn't, like, do an experiment on them.

344
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,240
Right. Like the only thing that I can compare is their union status.

345
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:55,580
But I want to make sure that they are as comparable as they would be in an experimental design.

346
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:03,450
So in an experimental design, you and I, Josh, would not be paired together for various reasons here.

347
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,370
You identify as male, identify as female. We're different ethnicity.

348
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,170
We're different age. We probably have very different lifestyles.

349
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,650
Right? So we wouldn't make a good light treatment control pair.

350
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,920
So when you're doing quasi experimental design,

351
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,010
one thing you can do essentially is something called propensity score matching where you take a look and this is

352
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:31,730
more so possible in a large data set where you look at all your subjects and you kind of group together like,

353
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,610
okay, this person was a white male in his forties and this person is a white male in his forties.

354
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,780
And, and you're controlling for all the differences between them.

355
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:47,690
And the only difference between the two is that one is in a union and one is not in a union.

356
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:55,460
And from there, you're able to essentially do this quasi experimental design on a secondary data set,

357
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,740
because you can only do that with like a very large data set. So that is one form of design.

358
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:15,620
Qualitative design is, you know, focus groups, ethnography, semi-structured interviews, observation, and then mixed methods.

359
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:22,550
Design is exactly what it sounds like, which is fuzing together, quantitative and qualitative.

360
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:29,329
So we have a couple of methods where it there's something called concurrent mixed methods.

361
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:40,400
So that is when you're collecting your quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously, you have something called sequential explanatory design,

362
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:51,080
which means that you're collecting your quantitative data first, analyzing it, and then using that information to inform your qualitative design.

363
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,870
So for example, for my quantitative portion, I do a survey on mental health,

364
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:02,090
for example, and I find out that one of the big mental health stressors is work.

365
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,550
So from that, I might choose to do focus groups specifically for focus on.

366
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:13,400
Workplace mental health. Right. So I'm going from a quantitative to a qualitative.

367
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:23,510
Right. The other aspect of that is that it's a sequential exploratory design where you're going from qualitative to quantitative.

368
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,079
Now just say you conduct some focus groups on a topic.

369
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:34,450
For example, what do we think about the 60 credits that you need for the public health program?

370
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:43,310
Right. And then from there, you find out a bunch of information and then they do a and then they make a survey based on the focus groups.

371
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,620
So that's just a very basic example. That new information for people.

372
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,140
Is this a refresher? I believe the designs just like.

373
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,880
I mean, they're familiar link kind of different slightly different wording.

374
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,400
They're never heard before. Okay. Old hat.

375
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:09,150
Yes. Okay. All right. So next is a theory driven evaluation.

376
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:20,430
So, for example, you can use something like the PRECEDE Proceed framework to focus your evaluation around it, right?

377
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:28,110
So the PRECEDE Proceed model has of use nine phases where you do like social assessment,

378
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:34,320
epidemiologic assessment, behavioral environmental assessment, educational assessment, etc., etc.

379
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:41,910
And then you can choose the do a for use this framework essentially to like inform your evaluation.

380
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:48,089
Another one people use that we've talked about before is like the Lewin's stages of

381
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:55,080
change where you like aim to like freeze a unfreeze and then freeze a new behavior.

382
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,620
People also use the one in terms of like social adaptation as well.

383
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,879
So generally they consider evaluations to be more robust if it's centered around a framework the same way,

384
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:17,510
like how your surveys are centered around a framework ideally of like the job demands resources model, for example.

385
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,740
Right? It will make your evaluation more robust if it's centered around a theory.

386
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:30,990
So now gathering information, we want to make sure that we gather credible evidence.

387
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:42,540
So again, this enhances the evaluations, utility and accuracy where you can get valid, reliable and systematic information.

388
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:50,399
Now, a lot of times, yes, on most public health programs in terms of evaluation,

389
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,670
people mostly do surveys, but you can do any of the things on the lists here.

390
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:09,060
So case studies, group assessments, portfolio reviews, testimonials, semantic differentials, paired comparisons, storytelling, geographic mapping.

391
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:16,110
That's like basically GIS concepts mapping, free listings, social network, diagraming, all this kind of stuff.

392
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,690
One that kind of surprised me was role play and dramatization.

393
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,790
Okay, how many of them have seen that before in a public health context?

394
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,880
It's in role play for safety stuff. Yeah. Was that helpful?

395
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,839
I didn't do it as witnessed. It seemed maybe useful.

396
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,100
I don't. Okay. Um, what about the use of, like, diaries and journals and logs?

397
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:49,930
Yeah. In the diabetes prevention program that I participated in.

398
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:57,700
It was an eight week program, and the participants were asked to keep like a daily diary slash journal,

399
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:05,830
but it was like a food diary slash journal where, you know, nowadays somebody might use something like MyFitnessPal, for example.

400
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,920
So if you're doing just say like a very basic nutrition or like exercise, whatever,

401
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:17,290
you might be asked to turn over as part of credible evidence as a participant of the program,

402
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:26,030
like your data from your myfitnesspal for like the last eight weeks or for example, I don't know if you all have an Apple Watch, but I do.

403
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm participating in Doctor Nigel's Apple hearing study, and I'm also participating in the Harvard.

404
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,520
There's three Apple Watch studies that you can enroll in. So Harvard's cardiovascular heart study,

405
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,819
the apple here in a study here that Dr. Knights was doing and then Brigham Women's is doing a women's health study,

406
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:52,990
which I am not doing because I don't need them collecting my reproductive data at this point in time.

407
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,779
But essentially it's a multi year program and they just pull periodically,

408
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:05,109
pull information from my watch I give them permission for and then occasionally answer some research questionnaires.

409
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:13,750
But they're monitoring, you know, my my resting heart rate and how that changes over time, my exercise activity.

410
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,660
So those are all like legitimate forms of logs and activities and registries.

411
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:27,310
The role play and dramatization, interestingly, is used here at the University of Michigan.

412
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:38,120
Are you all familiar with CRT? It's the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, and they have something called the CRT players.

413
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:48,710
So if you ever sign up as like a GSI or TR or G.A. for a workshop on training, like you have to teach.

414
00:43:49,490 --> 00:44:00,050
They have role plays and dramatizations of different scenarios where they have student actors and like normal people, actors.

415
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:10,129
And this helps people contextualize or gather credible evidence because essentially what they do is that

416
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:16,040
they take a lot of people's personal reports about like something that might be commonly experienced,

417
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:23,120
and then they make a skit about it. For example, back when I was at Indiana University,

418
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,649
the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee that I was on thought about making

419
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:35,629
skits that faculty would act in to show people what a microaggression was,

420
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,040
and so they would understand if they were micro aggressing.

421
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,809
But the faculty were like, We don't have the time to do this.

422
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:53,959
But it was a nice thought, right? Um, and then like debriefing sessions, I don't, I personally don't do social network diagraming,

423
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,530
but there's a lot of folks in public health that specifically focus on social network DIAGRAMING In particular,

424
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:10,190
I've done a couple of peer reviews specifically on the influence of social media and anti-Asian racism around the COVID pandemic,

425
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:21,330
and then the coincidence of like political rhetoric about like China flu and kung flu and China virus and then anti-Asian hate speech on Twitter.

426
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:27,230
So that is also like a valid form of gathering credible evidence.

427
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:37,709
Yeah. Yeah. So this just is just like open up your eyes to some potential other methods that you can include that aren't

428
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:43,740
necessarily like I'm going to do a survey or like I'm going to ask people what they thought about this.

429
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,260
Like this means so. So the step five is justify a justified conclusions.

430
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,480
I love to jump to conclusions. We don't want to do that though.

431
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:04,080
So obviously with justified conclusions standards, you want to have standard established.

432
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,180
What is your analysis method and synthesis in terms of interpretation?

433
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,200
Who is going to be interpreting, interpreting the results?

434
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,210
It's always recommended that more than one person do it judgments, recommendations.

435
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:27,060
And then the three main outcomes of once you actually have your findings is summarize plausible mechanisms of change.

436
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:34,830
How? And then if you see something right, like just say, yeah, you hypothesize something would happen and it actually happened.

437
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,310
Hurray! Success! That's like the dream for everybody, right?

438
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,050
What are the plausible mechanisms of change now?

439
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,450
Also, you want to delineate between the temporal sequence of activities and its effects.

440
00:46:48,840 --> 00:47:00,360
For example, appropriate analysis method. So just say, for example, that you are one of the lucky researchers that happen to be.

441
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,310
Researching respiratory protection. Okay, here I am.

442
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:18,300
This is a hypothetical. I'm bopping around. I work for Nai, OSHA's National Personal Protective Equipment Laboratory.

443
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:30,720
And it is January of 2019, and I'm starting to do a study about voluntary respirator use.

444
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,650
And then halfway through my study, what happens?

445
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:41,040
COVID pandemic. Everybody is now wearing respiratory protection.

446
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:49,170
So how do I delineate between this sequence of activities and the impact of my intervention

447
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:55,349
versus all this other stuff that's going on in the world that could have an effect on this?

448
00:47:55,350 --> 00:48:06,480
Right. And it's really important to collect key information specifically like on the temporal sequence of activities.

449
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:14,430
I'm going to use another very narrow example or or maybe not not so narrow example.

450
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:26,610
So recently, Queen Elizabeth, the second died right in England, potentially, like a lot of people, really respects her and went to her funeral.

451
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:35,010
Right. But that could possibly give people the impetus like generally around these big life stages or like periods of grief,

452
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:42,179
people trying to change their lifestyle. So just say, for example, she was a huge advocate.

453
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:48,630
We know she'll have corgis and whatever. But what if she was a huge advocate for like exercise and health as well?

454
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,240
Like Michelle Obama potentially was right.

455
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:58,260
As a result of her death, people might begin to change their lifestyle because they are starting to reflect on life.

456
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:05,219
Blah, blah, blah, blah. But what if a large chunk of these people are also like enrolled in an intervention that,

457
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,480
like Oxford University is conducting that will affect the temporal sequence between their activities and effects.

458
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,730
So it's always important to not only like look in your program but see what's going on on the outside

459
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:27,060
and then searching for alternative explanations and show why they are not supported by the evidence.

460
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:35,970
So if you see something from your program or intervention that was so wild that you did not expect to see happen,

461
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:46,020
what might be the reasons for that and why do you think I have a picture of Analogy Bottle and Plato on this slide?

462
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,680
I was about to ask any guesses?

463
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,450
I wanted to play. Those was like playing around with, like, ideas.

464
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:10,140
I don't get the analogy. Okay. I think that's. So these were things that were created with one intention and used for something entirely different.

465
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:18,630
So when they sought to make Plato, it was not supposed to be a children's.

466
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,540
Plaything or like what do they call it for dogs? Like stimulation.

467
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:38,030
Intellectual stimulation. Right. Plato was originally used to get like crumbs and debris and gunk off of wallpaper.

468
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,510
So when people were really into wallpaper, I feel like wallpaper is making a resurgence, actually.

469
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,969
So I'd say, yeah, but now it's like you don't have to like, glue it on anymore.

470
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,160
It's like you just like peel and stick, which is nice.

471
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:59,900
So Play-Doh was originally manufactured for cleaning wallpaper and then kids start to play with it.

472
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:06,140
So the people are like, What the heck? Like, this was not the intended use, this was not the intended outcome.

473
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,850
So they kind of had to shift gears with what they used Play-Doh for.

474
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:21,590
Same thing with Nalgene. Nalgene has traditionally been used in laboratories and in like storage tank holding

475
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:28,430
facilities for chemical products just because of how strong and robust the material was.

476
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:39,290
But then all of a sudden, people started using bottles from the laboratory to take with them on the hiking trails to drink their water,

477
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,819
because it is unbreakable, essentially.

478
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,430
And that's why people know Nalgene now,

479
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:56,720
more so as like this outdoor like water bottle company rather than as that analogy rather than its initial intended use.

480
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:05,240
So this is just like a very parallel example of, you know, you intended to do something with this product,

481
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:13,850
with this intervention, with this program, and people decided to use it a completely different way.

482
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:22,580
I read some other interesting ones that I didn't include pictures on in the slide Listerine, for example, alcohol based mouthwash.

483
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,150
You know, now don't use alcohol based mouthwash.

484
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,570
It used to be used to cure gonorrhea. Mm hmm.

485
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:40,430
Yeah. And then Clorox, the cleaner used to be used as a vaginal douche for women.

486
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,660
That was its original intention. Yeah. Is that insane?

487
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,549
What's wrong with. I hope it's not. What? It it it doesn't.

488
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:59,180
It's not good for your thumbs up your ass. And it drives about really fast and it can cause, like, bad breath and, you know, other types of things.

489
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,729
So you shouldn't use a non alcohol based mouthwash as an aside, but the ones with fluoride,

490
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:12,200
for example, will keep your teeth less white, but it won't make them resistant against cavities.

491
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,870
So like. Pick your pick your lesser evil.

492
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,429
But yeah, it's wild to see.

493
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:31,140
Like if you look up like Google, like cool old Clorox ads, it's kind of like a like a like what you might expect to see from a plan B ad today.

494
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,580
And now Clorox is used for something totally different.

495
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:47,700
Right. Same thing with Listerine. So this is just to say, you can have the best of plans and intentions or what you're trying to do,

496
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:57,810
but you don't actually know how people will use it until you actually evaluate it and then justify conclusions of why they are using it in that way.

497
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,930
And then another key component is that showing that effects can be repeated.

498
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,850
This is like the biggest crux of like public health programing.

499
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:17,790
If they use if you use, if they give you money, they want to know how will this be applicable or generalizable to other communities.

500
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:25,619
Right. And so recently I had a grad that is projected, but this happens all the time.

501
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:31,559
So I like I'm so used to rejection now where essentially my grant was proposing

502
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,280
because I've been working for a long time with death care sector workers.

503
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:42,210
So these are like people who work in crematoriums, funeral homes, medical examiners, coroners.

504
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:49,049
They are literally responsible for every dead body here in the United States.

505
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:54,900
Right. They're a cornerstone to public health surveillance, but they're often like the invisible worker.

506
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,740
Right.

507
00:54:56,070 --> 00:55:05,910
When I submitted this grant finish, they said it was too niche because there's only 200,000 of them, less than 200,000 of them in the United States.

508
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:14,430
So why do we even care? I felt like I justified that pretty well by talking about how they handled literally every dead covered body.

509
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,880
But to them it wasn't generalizable enough.

510
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,700
So I have to go fix the grid and then resubmit it. Public health.

511
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:28,080
Still a lot of people, 200,000 not after them.

512
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,630
Which is interesting because I'm grants that we put on nail salon workers which are 400,000.

513
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:42,450
And while I think nail salon workers do like contribute to people's lives in the beauty service by making them feel good about themselves,

514
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:49,679
not the same level as someone performing an autopsy.

515
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,130
And they are just like, who cares about these people?

516
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,170
But it's very different in public health for sure. Yes.

517
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,329
Yes, it's very different in our discipline.

518
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:06,870
And especially like us working in nonprofits, you kind of have to beg for money anytime you want to do something, which is very interesting.

519
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,649
I have a friend I saw at Friendsgiving. She's an assistant professor at the law school there.

520
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,700
Not to write any grants now. They don't even know that.

521
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,120
So how will we judge our performance of our program?

522
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:28,770
So many different ways. Participant needs, community values and norms, objectives, blah, blah, blah.

523
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:36,120
But one thing that people really focus on now that they haven't is especially social equity.

524
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:48,900
And this has become a huge conversation point and you would be surprised about the lack of equity or that or to actually focus on that.

525
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,500
So again, in my other class, which was the infectious disease course,

526
00:56:52,500 --> 00:57:02,280
they had a homework assignment where they had to interview somebody who worked in the realm of infectious disease and or emergency response.

527
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,710
And they were to ask them this set of questions.

528
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:13,110
And one of the questions was, do you feel that there is a lack of equity in emergency response in this country?

529
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:20,250
And out of the 13 interviews that I read, only three practitioners said yes.

530
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:31,120
All the other ones said no. And these ranged from like physicians to people were to Washtenaw County Health Department, Wayne County national level.

531
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,310
And only three said yes. We asked where what was that from?

532
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:41,120
My other question is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,570
And it was it was surprising because a lot of people work in emergency medical services.

534
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:52,620
So to to their mind, if you think about most of people who work in public health, they don't they don't come from a school of public health.

535
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,600
Right? They get their training on the job. And a lot of other schools of public health are not like this one.

536
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,170
This one is that this Michigan is very progressive.

537
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:08,580
I would not be able to talk about some of the things I teach in my other classes or in other schools,

538
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,200
like at a school like Arkansas, for example, or Florida, because it would be considered CRT.

539
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:17,460
They would be like, What are you doing? Right. I would get phone calls from Perez.

540
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,990
So a lot of the practitioners said that they don't think there's an equity

541
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,700
issue because when there's a natural disaster or an emergency or there's 911,

542
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,330
when somebody calls, they come, right?

543
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:39,330
It's not like they don't come because of someone's race, but they are not seeing the structural issues with other response times.

544
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,729
And certainly, I mean, when you start breaking it down by if there is.

545
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,840
Yeah yeah. And a couple of my students because we debriefed about it this morning,

546
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:56,490
said that a couple of people were caught off guard by the question and then kind of talked around it.

547
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:04,500
Yeah. Yeah. So you'd be surprised of how many folks you encounter, like even stakeholders that aren't in public health,

548
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:11,610
that haven't necessarily, like put on their little cap of social equity to think about how they can make it equitable.

549
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:17,700
Yes, that's Hawkinson. I'm doing the project exactly on equity in emergency management in Detroit.

550
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,200
So I want to talk to you about more of that. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

551
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:27,860
Because just say, for example. Well, I don't know.

552
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:31,230
I don't know this area well enough because I haven't lived here long enough.

553
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,950
Okay. So just say, for example, I'm from Sacramento, California.

554
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:45,510
So California is one of the probably the most diverse state in the United States or one of the most diverse.

555
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:52,260
And then Sacramento itself, the city is one of the most diverse cities in the entire state.

556
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,540
So we have tons and tons of different ethnicities, blah, blah, blah.

557
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:07,830
So just say, for example, the county health department, Sacramento County Health Department wants to implement a vaccination program for COVID.

558
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:18,420
And they say we want to receive we want a 50% vaccine receipt for all residents of the county.

559
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,260
Yay! Okay. Just say they roll out the program.

560
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,540
We did it. 50% of residents are vaccinated.

561
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:39,089
Yay! Judging by their performance, depending on what their metrics are, if that's the only metric, the box is checked right now.

562
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:44,400
If they look closer to it. Okay. About 50% of the county residents are white.

563
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:49,409
Only white people got the vaccines. No black people got the vaccines.

564
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:56,610
No Hispanic Latino people got the vaccines. No Asian people got the vaccines by their metrics.

565
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,880
That program was still considered a success.

566
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:08,280
Now, we may not consider that a success, and we don't necessarily consider that as potentially equitable either,

567
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:14,970
because we don't know where they set up the sites. But because of the standards that they established at the start of the evaluation,

568
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:20,370
that is enough for them to say, check responsibility to the federal government.

569
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:27,480
Who are the funders? Are that okay? And realistically, that is how a lot of programs and interventions get by.

570
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:34,020
Mm hmm. So social equity is something very much that people are starting to talk about and

571
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:38,969
take into account even some of a place like an or a federal organization like FEMA,

572
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:47,670
for example. It's only in recent years that they are publicly admitting in their reports that they have racist practices in their FEMA response,

573
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,890
even though we kind of like could tell that all the way back in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina.

574
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,579
Right.

575
01:01:53,580 --> 01:02:03,360
But people in positions of power and those people making the policies shape what the program activities are and therefore what the outcomes are.

576
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,530
So this is just something that we kind of need to think about and also speak up

577
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:12,269
about as we implement these program evaluations and then obviously political will,

578
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:25,100
but also human rights. So last but not least, and then I will show you some concrete examples is ensuring use and sharing lessons learned.

579
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,920
So we spent the last three months writing the evaluation report.

580
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,180
Unfortunately, we drained the budget and were unable to share it with anyone.

581
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:40,290
This happens a lot actually, and evaluators cost a lot of money.

582
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:48,480
So if you get a like a contractor or a company to do your program evaluation, it costs a pretty penny,

583
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,490
which is why they try to teach us like social work and public health and how to do it ourselves.

584
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:59,700
So again, you need some kind of follow up or technical and ideally emotional support for

585
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,340
the users during the evaluation and after they receive the evaluation findings.

586
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,510
Right. So like with the waste sites that I did, the study audit found that, you know,

587
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:16,560
like they in order for them to have better work satisfaction, they need more praise from their supervisors.

588
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:21,720
But also they don't have they haven't had an infection control training in a year.

589
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,690
So I followed up with the supervisors, gave them some recommendations and gave them some resources.

590
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:32,070
And then how will they decide to essentially implement the evaluation findings?

591
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,470
And then for dissemination, thinking about timing, tone, style and all that kind of stuff.

592
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:43,290
So this year is just ensuring use and sharing lessons learned.

593
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,160
So they kind of provide some examples of like how you to do that.

594
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,910
But there's just to keep in mind that in public health, oh my God, I have so many emails just from students.

595
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:02,009
Okay. So they, they, they teach us to kind of write things at an eighth grade level.

596
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,250
But realistically, we should be writing things at a fifth or sixth grade level.

597
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,200
So I'm part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Worker Training Program.

598
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:16,050
And what we do is essentially provide workers training on different aspects on how to protect themselves.

599
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:23,040
And these come from congressional dollars. So we are funded through Superfund sites, Superfund money.

600
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,340
So that's how I've been like since 2016, like bopping around the.

601
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,430
Three doing these free trainings to like firefighters and whatever on like biosafety.

602
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:44,280
So every year we have something we have to do called a congressional report where our representatives from and I just go in front of Congress and say,

603
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:51,960
please don't cut our budget, but also please give us the same amount of money or better give us more money.

604
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,840
And if you think about the people who are in Congress, most of them don't have a health background at all.

605
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,530
Maybe a bachelor's degree, maybe. Wasn't there one?

606
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,660
Isn't there like a senator or a House rep that doesn't even have a college degree?

607
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,979
It's that Marjorie Taylor GREENE Yeah, we had one, I think it was.

608
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,280
She didn't have officially a high school degree, but. GIRL Oh, okay.

609
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,030
Yeah, yeah. And then one of the senators has a medical degree,

610
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:25,200
but it's not from like a license university because that was before they he so old that was before they like started implementing that.

611
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:32,100
Any who. So this is our evaluation report specifically for our Superfund related activities.

612
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:35,580
So this is what Congress members get. Okay.

613
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,030
So it briefly describes what the worker training program does when it was created.

614
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:45,900
What like, you know, funding mechanism it comes through.

615
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:51,300
And then we have to do these things like these boxes to capture their information.

616
01:05:51,630 --> 01:06:03,300
Between 1995 and 2021, more than 13,500 workers were trained in the early career worker training program, 70% job rate and then employment.

617
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:08,340
And then they talk about the hazardous waste worker program. We have some cute pictures here.

618
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:18,290
And then if we get into some of the tangible information, of course, they use percentages and then they talk.

619
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,280
This is more so, I would say a qualitative report, if anything,

620
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,890
because they use a lot of pictures and then they kind of use some like anecdotes and all that.

621
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,900
This one here is a longer evaluation report of our COVID 19 activities.

622
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:42,450
Again, they give the highlights between January 2020.

623
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:48,510
We trade rapidly trade almost 35,000 workers across a thousand courses.

624
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,480
And then they give some highlights here about like the breakdown of the level of courses,

625
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,370
our evaluation sources we use training, course data, progress reports,

626
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:04,829
focus groups and then grantee surveys and then, you know, some infographics,

627
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:10,080
online occupations, train, for example, nail salon workers, agricultural workers.

628
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:17,040
We use pictures in there because people love pictures and then throw in some very basic descriptive statistics.

629
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:25,110
Our NHS funded program and consortium provided COVID outreach in addition to training courses, 91.4% did that.

630
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,790
You know, again, pictures people love pictures in Congress.

631
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:37,800
So we tried to incorporate a lot of that. And then we have some qualitative data here, pull quotes from some trainees.

632
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:45,660
What we tried to do at grantees was what we tried to do was embed our COVID 19 presentation and anything we could has was refreshers,

633
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,200
any kind of training to find that 45 minutes to put in there.

634
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,370
And then just some like very basic appendices.

635
01:07:54,390 --> 01:08:00,420
Okay. And then this one here is a skip to the the main part.

636
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:08,129
So the early career worker training program is specifically focused on providing

637
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:13,350
pre-employment and health training to underemployed and unemployed individuals nationwide,

638
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:20,040
specifically people of color, teaching them how to do trade jobs, for example, like in construction,

639
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:26,520
so they can become a steelworker and get a union job that usually pays like 30 to $45 an hour.

640
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:34,440
So for this, you know, essentially evaluation and justification of the easy t like they said,

641
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:39,329
they've trained up to 14,000 workers with a 70% employment rate.

642
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:45,930
And once they finish the training program, the training programs offered to them at no cost placed in 30 communities,

643
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:56,220
trained with over 200 community based organizations, and then currently six grantees working with 25 different community based organizations.

644
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:02,070
Then we have these different programs both focused on each and then the Justice 40.

645
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:12,030
Again, people love pictures and then you talk about this is more of the impact evaluation rather than the outcomes evaluation.

646
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:22,080
So this analysis was completed by, you know, Economic Impact Report from 1995 to 2013.

647
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,190
$1.8 billion total value added by this program.

648
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:30,340
17. 717 million. And reduce spending.

649
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:36,310
Now that you have trained workers who are alike, less likely to turn over, get injured, etc.

650
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:47,559
$2.28 million in additional local support by adding to local jobs before the CW, TPI only about 20% of the people were employed.

651
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,760
But after they went through the training program, almost 80% were employed.

652
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:58,960
Now, for the average wages in the trades, if there was no easy way, the average wage is only $14 an hour,

653
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:07,090
whereas once they go through it, it's up to almost $20 an hour and their employability probability increased by almost 60%.

654
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:15,689
And then they talk about benefits in earnings, taxes, community input, safety savings, crime savings, and then hiring savings.

655
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:20,250
So these are all impact measures of evaluations.

656
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,980
The stuff you saw above that is more so outcomes.

657
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:28,720
Okay. So this is just, you know, something very tangible.

658
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:37,810
Money talks. So most of the time you will see in the worker room like an impact evaluation because it's very powerful.

659
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,110
And then these here are more qualitative information.

660
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:45,820
They have videos that they show specifically of people's stories.

661
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,220
So, you know, they're short featuring like women of color getting into the carpenter trades,

662
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,190
people who formerly struggle with substance use disorders like you kind of have to hit them with multiple

663
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:04,390
aspects of the impact and the outcomes in order to show like essentially the worth of your program.

664
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:17,020
So with that, that is all the examples that I had for you today hopefully was a more a good refresher of your other class.

665
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:22,060
Any comments or questions or like thoughts?

666
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:28,320
When you're in bonds as a cool program, it's still going on.

667
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:35,620
Yeah. Yeah. There's environmental jobs that, like, teaching people to, like, clean up, like, hazardous waste.

668
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:41,069
Yeah, they have that that some of those people do it, too. So not all of them work in the building trades.

669
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,220
Some of them become essentially hazmat technicians.

670
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:49,740
And so, like, if you see a spill on the side of the freeway or like a tanker truck.

671
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:56,909
Like have an accident or whatever. Most fire departments are equipped to respond to that.

672
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:06,030
But based on, like the the National Fire Protection Association, like the Triangle of Hazards, sometimes firefighters can't touch it.

673
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,190
And so they have to call in like a hazmat response team who is properly trained to address those, and they respond to that.

674
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:19,410
I mean, if it's like an accident like that, it's like you want it to be quick, but if it to call someone in.

675
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,550
Yeah. Every locality generally has one. The firefighters are public.

676
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,959
Huh. Like a private industry that would do that. Or the public.

677
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,820
Public. The public. I was has Lauper 40 certified.

678
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:40,440
I let it lapse because I'm not necessarily using it. But all our industrial hygiene students are has whopper certified and went through the

679
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,999
training and like put on the B you know what they call like the space suit or whatever.

680
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,950
So the fire department is good enough to like manage the situation where they at least clear

681
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:55,889
people out of the area and try to contain the spill if they can so things don't explode.

682
01:12:55,890 --> 01:13:00,720
But the actual like cleanup and remediation has to be done by hazmat workers.

683
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,280
So the worker training program has a hazmat program.

684
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,859
They have a hazardous disaster preparedness program.

685
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,320
So I'm in both of them in the early careers program.

686
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:20,219
They also have a small business program where them they make technologies and trainings that are like mobile friendly.

687
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:28,500
So it's all really cool. It's all funded by the super funds. So thankfully we were not affected during the Trump administration when all the

688
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,740
other programs got cut because we were nestled into a totally different area,

689
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,780
kind of like wound up on the down low, flew under the radar for that.

690
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:45,750
Yes. But I mean, taxpayer dollars do pay for this. So I think it's really cool, but a lot of people doesn't don't know exist anyway.

691
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,780
Other questions. All right.

692
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,430
I will see you.
