1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:12,770
Okay. So today what we're going to do, what I hope we can do is just engage in a discussion on different aspects of DNA,

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,020
diversity, equity and inclusion in terms of campus climate and specifically in our classroom.

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:29,080
Today's will be one of the last content lectures this and then I think three weeks from now somewhat we're going to have a couple of guests

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:39,010
come in and facilitate a discussion on equity focused teaching and talk to you guys about a project going on here called Project Heart.

5
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,400
It's really focused on anti-racist teaching.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,240
So so that'll be, I think, three weeks from now.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,010
And then the rest of the time is really dedicated to further presentations and peer evaluation and things like that.

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,110
So it feels like we're like halfway through forging forward.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,890
So today we're going to first just sort of take a look at what's going on at U of M.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:19,510
President Schlissel When he first started, one of his main initiatives was to really start some DNI efforts that were ongoing and had specific goals.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,159
And then we're going to reflect on social identities because these are these types

12
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,020
of identities can affect teaching and learning and how we deal with colleagues,

13
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,670
the students. And we're going to talk a little bit about intellectual development.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,670
This is really interesting because when we're talking about the traditional undergrad and even grad school,

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,770
there are folks that are just really different levels in terms of brain development and that can affect learning.

16
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:02,139
And then at the end, we'll just talk about there's a really nice figure that was developed a while back by folks at the Center

17
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,280
for Research on Learning and Teaching on is a continuum of different performance within the classroom.

18
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,770
Okay. I'm going to everyone. Okay.

19
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:23,500
So in general, the University of Michigan is known to embrace differences among faculty, staff, students.

20
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:32,110
And there's been some pretty significant and important incidents over the years at U of M that are directly DNA related.

21
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,420
So thinking about affirmative action in the early 2000s, there are famous cases that occurred here.

22
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,310
Hashtag being black at Michigan. Any one recalled this either news or they were around.

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,900
So this hashtag being black at Michigan hashtag review.

24
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:04,240
The goal was really to connect the decentralized community of black students whose numbers had really declined a sense in Michigan.

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:16,700
Affirmative action had been banned. And so, for example, when affirmative action was around, about 8% of the student body was the black students.

26
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:25,090
And after it was banned, how, say, being black at U of M in 2015, it was down to four and a half percent.

27
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,110
And I think I believe we're around 4%. Correct.

28
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,390
All right. And then there are those.

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,780
What was. Affirmative action.

30
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,210
And yeah, maybe I get. Yeah, maybe I can help immediately.

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,989
Didn't I know I'm I just keep things flaky really.

32
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,450
I'm just see how can the number change immediately? Well, I think it was over years.

33
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,530
Oh, yeah. The ban on affirmative action in early 2000.

34
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,840
This is 2000. Yeah.

35
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:15,620
So a decline over that time. Give me more context is on the increase unless you.

36
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Right. So the other thing I want to bring up is why I.

37
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,230
Neal. So this actually was one of our students, public health students in 2017.

38
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,700
Dana Green Jr from hb h e.

39
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,890
He kneeled at the diag in silent protest for equality across u of M.

40
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:50,480
So this lasted for 20 hours. But he wrote a letter to President Schlissel called Why, Neil if you can find it pretty easily and just read through it.

41
00:04:51,590 --> 00:05:01,340
So just some examples like famous examples that have occurred here throughout the decades overall at any educational institution,

42
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:15,400
whether it's higher ed K-through-12. There's data that shows that academic achievement is associated with exposure to diversity, equity and inclusion.

43
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:24,780
So in particular. Students immersed in a learning environment that's more diverse.

44
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,910
Are more informed decision makers, higher academic achievement, and in the future,

45
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,890
more likely to settle and establish themselves in a more diverse environment?

46
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:49,239
Okay. So just bringing to the specific strategic plan at Michigan, again, I know production is not here anymore,

47
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:58,569
but when he came into his first term or his term here, this was one of his major things that he started, contained and got jumpstarted.

48
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,040
Was this ongoing?

49
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:13,150
You and I plan and so the first and there's phases to it we have just completed phase I call it 1.0 and we're about to embark in phase 2.0.

50
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,380
But, you know, going into those starting it, it was you know, Europe is really decentralized right now.

51
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,720
Different units across campus, including the academic units, but also things like athletics.

52
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:34,960
And, you know, what's going on in terms of in athletics versus public health, the climate is very different.

53
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,650
And so the first really thing to get this started was that they just collected a lot of data from these different units,

54
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:58,570
but the data come together and form some unified goals in terms of the university as a whole for phase 11.0, I guess this these were the goals, right?

55
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:07,000
Pretty sort of standard for any working environments, creating an equitable campus climate recruiting.

56
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,060
Retaining diverse community, supporting, supporting total rights.

57
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:27,670
And so in terms of progress with 1.0, some tools and programs that come out of it, these are just some examples.

58
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,110
Wolverine Pathways, for example, is a pipeline program that targets Southeast Michigan middle schoolers and high schoolers.

59
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,810
It includes things like college prep workshops, campus visits, tutoring.

60
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:52,810
There's been a lot more focus in terms of preparing faculty for teaching more equitable, inclusive teaching practices.

61
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:03,790
And there's really been a strategy for hiring. Directors of diversity equity and pushing for every unit on campus and things like.

62
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:13,409
And then if you Google the strategic plan timeline, you'll come up with this figure and sorry,

63
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,670
it's small, but if you want to look it up on your own and read through it, you can.

64
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,860
We're in October 2022. Like I said, 1.0 is coming to an end.

65
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,910
There's actually a summit, a nice summit tomorrow if you all want to join.

66
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:35,420
And this year, this next academic year is really dedicated to planning to go phase 2.0.

67
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,320
And this just came out of a record article.

68
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,670
Really it looks like 2.0 is really going to be focused on community engagement and community.

69
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,550
Into. Into this strategic. I just want to get an overview.

70
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,360
We're all here at University of Michigan, so we should all just have a sort of a basic foundational understanding of what's going on there.

71
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,010
Any questions? Okay.

72
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,140
So one of your first worksheets there should just be the terms diversity, equity and inclusion on there.

73
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,009
And although we pump these together, they have distinct meanings.

74
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,319
So I just want you to take 5 minutes and just write down some definitions.

75
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:37,730
You know what comes to mind when you when you when you hear these terms, when you hear these terms, how are they distinct to you?

76
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,670
Okay. Let's let's just start with diversity.

77
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:06,370
And I just want to ask you guys sort of what comes to mind in terms of the importance around diversity or,

78
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,860
you know, provide the definition of diversity.

79
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,460
And everyone is. Now.

80
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,809
You know, one. Absolutely.

81
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:41,790
Yeah. And I think, you know, almost you're sort of combining, you know, diversity or inclusion, right.

82
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,030
As well in terms of not disregarding one. Yeah.

83
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:51,230
Differences and valuing those differences. Anything else anyone wants to add?

84
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,690
Let's jump down to inclusion. What do you guys what are your thoughts on?

85
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,480
But this is creating an environment for all groups, depending on whether there is any kind of background.

86
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,720
You heard what he said. Absolutely right.

87
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,660
Love that. Anything else anyone wants to add to that?

88
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,160
Okay. All right. Thank you guys for doing that. Just taking time and jotting down your thoughts about that.

89
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:43,050
I'm actually come back to this worksheet at the end. So who is in this photo?

90
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,450
It's. Lots of people have seen this, recognize it.

91
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:55,389
And number one, represents equality. Right. Everyone is treated the same, given the same resource sort of here.

92
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,330
And you can see the outcome is different in equity here.

93
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:08,980
People are given different resources with the end goal in mind that the outcome is essentially the same.

94
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,750
Right. So equality can be important in some situations, but in other situations,

95
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,940
when we treat everyone the same, it can actually erase our differences, right?

96
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,490
When we should actually be pride in ourselves. Right in our differences in diversity.

97
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:36,850
All right. So given that, it can often then make for an exclusive environment versus a.

98
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,400
And then this. You don't have to read all the captions, but.

99
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,590
Right. We usually take a look at what's going to benefit the majority of people.

100
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:03,040
Right. And in this scenario, this person who is not able bodied to be able to go up the stairs.

101
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,190
Right. Is disregarded these nuances or these individual needs.

102
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,970
And so, you know, if the the ramp was a shovel, then everybody could make it up to the doors.

103
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,239
And so last with equity. I just like like this.

104
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm just trying to get, you know, the point of equity across in different ways and everyone is different.

105
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,359
Fairness and success also differ. Differs. Right.

106
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,629
So just thinking as teachers and thinking about people come in and just like

107
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,390
the simple example of people coming in with different educational backgrounds,

108
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,579
right? Especially public health, right. We take people from women's studies to biological sciences and they're coming

109
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,050
in and they're all going to be taking the same public health type courses.

110
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,700
And so not everyone right for macronutrient metabolism, right?

111
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,400
Everyone is going to be at the same level, foundational levels, starting a class like that.

112
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,790
And so understanding the different tools, resources, encouraging them to get help.

113
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,200
Right. Is going to be really. Okay.

114
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,780
So another just self reflection, actually, what I want you to do is talk to someone next to you about this.

115
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,660
So just in what ways do you promote diversity,

116
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:32,020
equity and inclusion and think specifically in the classroom if you want to think back on that in your relationships or just in society in general,

117
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,270
how do you feel about that? So just turn to someone, one or two people next to you.

118
00:17:38,190 --> 00:18:02,230
And just talk us through. Cuts, which.

119
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:22,900
Amounts to. Particularly the first time.

120
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:45,090
I. Maybe it's always.

121
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,250
So you have. Today.

122
00:18:51,580 --> 00:19:01,350
It is true that sometimes there is also somebody who is super helpful.

123
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:10,340
And so I can go back. And I was never able to do it before.

124
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,200
It was have to. So it's not.

125
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,560
I was really. Yeah.

126
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah. Let's look at.

127
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,180
I like the other people. I just want to thank.

128
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,230
I feel like there's a benefit.

129
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,950
Yeah. I think they want to make sure.

130
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:32,430
Yes. They keep an eye. So.

131
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:46,560
Userspace. In particular.

132
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,580
How are you feeling, Senor Ocampo? Every day.

133
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:31,830
Yeah. No.

134
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:40,990
Okay, everyone. Thank you for doing that. I was trying to hear little snippets and I'm like, you're having some nice conversations.

135
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,020
So I just I just kind of wanted to close out with sort of that broad reflection.

136
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:56,460
But I do want to move on and I want to sort of shift our focus to thinking about more of the traditional undergrad experience.

137
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:05,230
Even a master's student at some master's students or graduate students as well are really in this phase of emerging adulthood.

138
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,780
It's a really interesting life stage. If you take a my lifecycle class, we've heard about this,

139
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:21,250
but it's really a shift in a time in their life when they're being very in a dependent sort of environment to becoming an independent in many ways.

140
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:28,630
Right. So for some, they're financially independent, learning to live on your own or, you know,

141
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,680
those of us in nutrition like ready to buy food for the first time, cook and understand how to feed yourself properly.

142
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,820
Social skills moving into an environment where you may not know anyone and figuring that out on your own.

143
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:51,790
And also, this also might be a time where your work in your work situations or professional life is developing as well,

144
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,800
and you might be taking on jobs that are actually really important for your future in the long term.

145
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,770
And so all of these really challenge these human beings in emerging adulthood, their existing beliefs and their values.

146
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:13,660
One of the readings by the person, the last name Ambrose, really described this as holistic development.

147
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:23,800
So really emotionally challenging their morals, their identity, and then also thinking on intellectually as well, their development.

148
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,330
And right now, we're just going to we're going to focus on the last two here.

149
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:36,160
We're actually going to start with identity, but actually, we're going to actually think about identity more so.

150
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,300
Well, the exercise we do is going to be more so about yourself and your role as a teacher.

151
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:50,680
But first, what I want to do is this slide is really just sort of a hodgepodge of definitions of social identity, right?

152
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,860
So you can read through it, but really it's socially putting ourselves in categories of how you perceive yourself,

153
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,040
but also how the world perceives you as well.

154
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:11,200
They play in sort of how we're these identities playing to how we are perceived in our personal life and our professional life.

155
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:19,600
And some may be really obvious. The color of your skin can indicates indicates race, for example.

156
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:26,050
Some might not be so obvious like some sexual orientation, socioeconomic status things.

157
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,340
And some people are really proud and self proclaimed.

158
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,440
These social identities were some others might not be as take pride in that.

159
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,170
Okay. So you see there's many layers to this and we're thinking about social identity.

160
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,000
So what I first want to do is just go through some data from a survey.

161
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,170
The survey study called you. You may.

162
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,090
University of Michigan asks you what it stands for.

163
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,959
And the participants were undergraduate seniors,

164
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:18,220
and they were just asked about their different experiences at U of M during their time at You have these three graphs that I'm going to show you.

165
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:31,190
Is their perception of the campus being welcoming and then it's broken down by different it's broken down by different social categories.

166
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,070
So just to orient you, the read is disagree, right?

167
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,010
They're disagreeing that the campus is welcoming blue is there green if you can't read the

168
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:50,170
colors sort of dark to light is agree on this side dark to light is disagree on that side.

169
00:25:51,130 --> 00:26:03,160
So this one is just breaking it down by income backgrounds so we can see the lower income students find campus not as welcoming as higher income.

170
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,270
We all know you have really known her to be a liberal campus, right?

171
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,740
There are conservative students here on campus.

172
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,010
And so you can see that there's disagreement among the conservatives of it being welcome in.

173
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:32,680
And then here, right, we can really see this broken down by different racial groups in terms of the disparities here.

174
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,580
Those that are not white. Right.

175
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:46,120
Have more disagreement as. So just some things to keep in mind sometimes.

176
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
You know, as instructors, Brooke, we really aren't always thinking about.

177
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,520
That's right. I mean, just this example, we're in public health.

178
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:02,330
We're at U of M and just thinking about liberal versus conservative, it's not really always on our mind.

179
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,950
So. Mine.

180
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,740
Okay, so now what I want to do is jump into this social identity exercise.

181
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,130
Okay. It should.

182
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:23,550
I think it's a social identity reflection on tap. And the front of it is really it's a non-exhaustive list of different types of social identities.

183
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:30,900
You can add to it if you want. So just read through them, read through the front circle what you identify with.

184
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,280
And then on the back, there's just a three questions for you to work through.

185
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,299
Because I know there's still some people finishing up,

186
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:57,790
so you can always come back to this and reflect on it and we'll continue to do some similar reflections.

187
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,969
I want to skip the first category just because I, I did prompt you that this is a non-exhaustive list that you added to it.

188
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:10,030
That's totally fine. And then I do just want to ask this last question on here.

189
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:17,439
Do this identity is a factor teaching or how do these how do these identities affect your teaching?

190
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:25,120
Or do they do their own thing? So I just want to put that out there if anyone feels comfortable sharing any thoughts that came across.

191
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,780
Yeah. Yeah. So one that I think I sort of thought about previously, but.

192
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:42,690
The belief is that a. And we spoke.

193
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,720
Relatively unknown to my students that I discussed.

194
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,540
But being young sometimes like certain.

195
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:01,140
Obviously you don't know as much about his experience here in Las Vegas here, but I do try to take that as an edge.

196
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:13,450
It's important to them. Whereas they may not feel. Yeah, I think that's right.

197
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,770
That is a great reflection. And you could sort of like, well, how do you cope with it in a positive way?

198
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,270
Age has definitely affected my teaching as well, and it's definitely something I or age I don't think I'm not anymore.

199
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:36,810
Right. But I look young and, you know, comments like you look like a student and I confuse confused person who actually really can get to me.

200
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,120
And so these are just things you have to sort of deal with and understand that they.

201
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,610
Might come off, but learning, you know, positive ways to sort of get past.

202
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:59,900
Yeah. Education. Especially in semester three zero.

203
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,350
There are many students who are. And this vein more.

204
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:11,450
Specific things that me interested. Interesting. So I feel very kind of.

205
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,570
Well, when I'm grading their assignments and they're writing.

206
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,890
You know, I says that I even understand so that if I don't feel.

207
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:38,580
Oh, yeah, that's very interesting. You know, a person at a master's level grading or teaching to someone who is at a doctoral level.

208
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,440
That's totally understandable. But remember a grade you get in that position for a reason.

209
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,429
You're qualified to be.

210
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:56,020
The GSI and Ph.D. students are focused, laser focused on one topic, you know, so it doesn't mean sort of the broad knowledge is where it should be.

211
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,650
And they're taking that lesson. That's a great.

212
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:19,880
We started the. Especially. Because.

213
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,060
The United States. And.

214
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,200
The sole factor. However, that seems to have fallen on deaf ears.

215
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:57,810
Anything else that. And so trying to navigate.

216
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,090
Being in an institution certainly makes it.

217
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:12,840
Does it mean? And so it does affect my teaching.

218
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:33,200
Go back to school. I feel like I have to go on.

219
00:39:52,780 --> 00:40:02,120
But I think it's. That sort of.

220
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:18,290
Thank you for sharing that, Rahim. And it just circles back to the systemic issues that we have, especially at the higher end institution.

221
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:28,540
But thank you so much for sharing that. It's something that I also I really like to pull it to go on stage.

222
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,790
So it's, you know,

223
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:43,330
it's just always been to be talking about these things that we're not talking and always actively listening and understanding or awareness.

224
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:52,089
She was. Just when I first came here to study, not here, but in this country.

225
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,220
And I thought I was the only one that was there, there.

226
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:04,300
And it was just me. And then when I would sit there and I saw this for everybody to look at me.

227
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:12,820
But you quickly, I realize now that I'm just so different.

228
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:21,700
So when when our company says, Professor, we'll say something like, the graph was just, well, I'm just excuse me.

229
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,380
I just wanted to point out that they don't even understand my English.

230
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,970
So let me show you. So. So he said they please show me.

231
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,100
I went and took his pen and I do it correct math.

232
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:47,450
I'm just telling him. Because none of the people will understand that you really are slaves.

233
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:57,690
Otherwise, I'm lying. I mean, I started teaching for a while, and then you were always looking at what people think of me.

234
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I'll never focus my passion or what I what I deliver.

235
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,140
However, I have other physicists teaching my professors.

236
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,830
They were all in their own plan and they're in it. We're down here.

237
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,500
We never engaged. That was wrong. So now I accept the differences between me and the people.

238
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,240
I accept that. But I want to know what each one of you would like to learn.

239
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,810
I want to find something that in your channel and your language, I can pass my passion to you.

240
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:34,160
That's my focus. But not all of you change the world without me being me and you being you.

241
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,980
We're saying how we communicate, right? I'm finding value in a.

242
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,720
I think that's doing your best.

243
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,220
Thank you. Thank you, you guys. Yeah.

244
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:53,250
I think, again, I'm just going to reiterate, always having these conversations and listening to each other and understanding that we're working right.

245
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:02,510
Society. There's always going to be perceptions from the outside and the inside that we have to deal.

246
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,850
Does anyone else want to share? I don't want to cut anyone off. They want what they want to share.

247
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,850
Kennedy. I think that's a good.

248
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,310
Like I. I've never seen.

249
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,900
Teaching. Like me being here for four years.

250
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,580
Two black teachers. They were great.

251
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:41,680
But this. Maybe in the moment I feel like I.

252
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:51,180
She's had that before. She. I feel like since I came here, it's.

253
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,140
I used to stand. Like putting all of that.

254
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:06,410
I think I would just. Parties are just emerged in the mindset that.

255
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:25,570
I mean. Take. We're not even used to being.

256
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,820
I would be. Yes.

257
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:45,320
Yeah. Anything else that he needs to share.

258
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,020
Thank you for those who shared it, because I know can't always be comfortable.

259
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,430
And I don't like for you guys to share just that. You do feel comfortable that you want to share.

260
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,880
Okay. So I want to move on now. We've talked about the identity piece.

261
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,120
I want to move on and talk about intellectual development.

262
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:26,459
And so, again, just thinking about diversity and intellectual development when you come into an undergrad space, but even like a doctoral program,

263
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:33,090
right, you can get something straight out of undergrad or you get someone coming back from years of experience of work.

264
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:40,310
Many. Actually, I do want to say that someone who's 18 can have a lot of life experience versus a little older,

265
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:45,890
but just different in terms of the brain and how it has developed.

266
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,530
And so there's a lot of models of intellectual development.

267
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:56,120
I really like Perry's intellectual model of development that has these four stages dualities,

268
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,780
the most simplistic sort of way of thinking, sort of right or wrong to the most sophisticated, which is commitment.

269
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,270
And I'm just going to walk through each of these,

270
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:14,360
and I'm actually going to put an example of a of student answers from a reflection that I gave in my under grad class.

271
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,209
And so duality is the first stage, right?

272
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,970
So this is really the most simple way of thinking.

273
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,880
These students, they are these individuals, they want facts, right?

274
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:38,209
They want right or wrong. They really look up to authorities of parents, older siblings and the professors right in the classroom.

275
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,670
Professors have all the answers. But like it says here, knowledge is the absolute.

276
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,270
So I'm going to go put an example to this. In my undergrad class,

277
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:59,030
I just gave a reflection and just it was a day when we talked about the composition of breast milk versus formula and just asked them,

278
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,020
what did you learn today?

279
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:07,670
And so this student, of course, I don't expect you guys to understand, first of all, composition, but it has very low levels of vitamin D.

280
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:16,550
And so I talked about that, but I also talked about all the other biochem active components in it and all the other nutrients that breast milk has.

281
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:22,700
But they really hang on to that vitamin D. So I always thought breast milk is better than infant formula.

282
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,360
As we learned today, this is not true because breast milk does not contain vitamin D.

283
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,910
Right. So there's sort of one example more in the duality stage.

284
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,890
Multiplicity. So this is where opinions start to form.

285
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:48,790
But so a person understands that there are different opinions, but they are still having difficulty understanding how to weigh these opinions.

286
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:56,530
So they're really relying still heavily on authority to sort of shift them to what opinion is.

287
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,230
Couldn't be there and. Okay.

288
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,850
So this one, I learned that you should not give an infant 0 to 6 months of age water.

289
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,550
I'm going to ask my mom what she thinks. Right. So she understands.

290
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:18,250
I had a no opinion opinion when I taught it, but that their mom also has as well.

291
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:23,800
Right. And whatever authority, I suppose they they.

292
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:32,810
Um, respect more. I think that they should respect more, I guess in this situation is probably going to shift them one way or the other.

293
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:42,010
Okay. And then relativism. So this is where they're starting to be able to weigh pros and cons,

294
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:53,320
but still relying on authority professors on there just sort of guide them to be able to understand how to critique and evaluate.

295
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:04,870
And so they can really apply now sort of what they have learned, but still are having a hard time taking that definitive stance.

296
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,569
And so this one, this is actually I couldn't find from that particular reflection, I couldn't find an example.

297
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:16,840
So this is from another lesson or another lecture, but still sort of asking the same thing.

298
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:24,100
What did you learn? So I was interested in learning recommendations on Introduction to Peanuts in relation to allergy development.

299
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,420
It now seems that recommendations lean towards early introduction.

300
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,110
My friend has peanut allergies that would be beneficial for them to know.

301
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:43,020
So I sort of took this one as like the now it now seems sort of not super definitive, but they're also relating it to a real life situation.

302
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:48,340
So they learn this information. They think it might be important for their friend to understand.

303
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,780
Okay. And then commitment, which is the last stage here.

304
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:03,890
An individual is really self aware and has developed their own belief system, their own values, their morals.

305
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,209
Right. They're sort of taking what they've learned over the years from their parents as they moved into

306
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:17,530
emerging adulthood and become more independent and develop social relationships and things like that.

307
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,480
Really understanding what their morals. Okay.

308
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,070
So this one, breast milk is the best option in terms of health for the baby.

309
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:33,000
But there are many factors in maternity leave, mental health that play into supporting whether the mother has the ability or desire to breastfeed.

310
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:40,980
You can sort of see they understand, you know, what the best recommendation in terms for the infant is breastmilk.

311
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,660
But understanding that can't always be done.

312
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,729
Okay. Okay. So now I have another worksheet for you guys.

313
00:50:53,730 --> 00:51:00,450
Sorry, in a lot of worksheets today, but this one is just pretty simple.

314
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:09,750
I think maybe focusing more on number two, which is generating tools and resources you can implement to help all students meet course competencies.

315
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,599
But just the number one is really thinking about the course that you're developing and thinking

316
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,050
about how you could be prepared to deal with students at these different intellectual development.

317
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:44,180
Hey, guys. Well, keep moving forward. Thank you for jotting down your ideas on that.

318
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:49,399
I think it's just sort of a. Nice example,

319
00:57:49,400 --> 00:58:01,400
just the things going back to sort of the equitable classrooms and thinking about resources and tools to really help our students and that we see.

320
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:11,440
And then again, you know, just writing the sort of different opportunities or just thinking about these things here,

321
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,790
you know, letting students know it's okay to to make mistakes.

322
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,550
It's okay to not get it right the first time.

323
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:29,590
Going back to what we talked about on the first day and encouraging students to get help and that help is important and that it can actually,

324
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,770
in the long run, can be beneficial.

325
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:40,090
And, you know, so these are just some things to think about on this slide.

326
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:49,720
That's why. I don't know. Anyone want to add anything here? Yeah.

327
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,210
And. Even when they kind of have been talking about like, okay, but what if this person.

328
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,730
Have to try to link. Force and growth in the context.

329
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:15,310
He's going to prove that, like, purely just. No, I think it's okay.

330
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:22,709
I think it's challenging them. And to understand, again, like depending on where they're sort of at an intellectual development,

331
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:30,330
understanding that there are different viewpoints and that you sort of have to deal with that right in professional life.

332
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:41,880
And so actually, I think. Discern it on conflicting opinions or a different view.

333
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,520
So no, I think that's totally fine. I think that's a good sort of a good exercise for students.

334
00:59:51,010 --> 01:00:02,810
Anything else? Do you think if you're in a class with with a sort of like like my my undergrad class, I teach nutrition the lifecycle.

335
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,260
I have freshmen and I have graduate students in that class.

336
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:12,120
And I actually, you know, when I was creating the course as it should be,

337
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:17,279
separate the grad students from the undergrads and ultimately decided not to

338
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,879
because I also think it's important that the students who might be the freshmen.

339
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,770
Right. Versus the the graduate students, they have a lot to learn from each other.

340
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:36,329
I think, you know, that they especially the if you're acting as a teacher, as a grad student, right.

341
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:45,420
You're you're professionally developing yourself. But then the students who may just be a freshman or a sophomore.

342
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,299
Right. Has so much to learn from that graduate student.

343
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:54,600
So I actually think combining them, leaving those together can actually be a good strategy as well.

344
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:03,920
Anything else? Okay.

345
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,889
Sort of. The last thing we want to talk about really briefly is classroom climate.

346
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:13,310
And I just want to, you know, think about what we learn in this class so far.

347
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:19,320
What we've learned today, just in general, what we know from our experience is what plays into classroom.

348
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,770
Sort of a brainstorm, Lindsay. Yep.

349
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:36,249
Interactions between students and peer interactions. Absolutely.

350
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:47,030
The kind of content that's presented across. Professor Cleary So.

351
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:56,550
You actually listen to some students or something and all of a sudden people just learn.

352
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,130
And not to run away and be totally trans at the time.

353
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,900
Somehow the professor, the instructor carries themselves.

354
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:14,220
Or interacts with students. Some say there can be equity.

355
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:24,910
Equity? Louis. Just going by the time.

356
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:33,690
Absolutely. I mean, that's obviously not quite right of the process, right?

357
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,860
Horses like 10 a.m. versus 4:00 at night, right by a pocket knife?

358
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,690
Definitely. I don't think I have that on here. But these are just some examples.

359
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:48,670
Diversity, equity, inclusion. Right. Just what we talked about today, the things we talked about today.

360
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:54,109
You guys brought up the student instructor interactions, peer to peer interactions.

361
01:02:54,110 --> 01:03:00,040
Of course. Contact you. That's actually them. So so these are just some examples.

362
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:10,330
Oftentimes we go in thinking that the climate is either good or bad as a binary structure, but oftentimes that's not the case.

363
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:14,590
And it can even change right from day to day or week to week.

364
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:19,360
And so it's it's better to think of it as alignment being on a continuum.

365
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:29,340
I would say we have all mostly experienced on this end of it, probably even just implicitly in person.

366
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:35,920
Right. Professors are are just in general trying to include everyone and want to hear all voices.

367
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,520
Some are really explicitly inclusive, right?

368
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:51,250
Really planning ways, tools, resources, activities that can really include everyone and make very positive assignments.

369
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,210
Right. And so this is when explicitly marginalizing and implicitly marginalizing.

370
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:08,670
Right. That's where. You know, we have to be careful in terms of, um, interactions that are happening in those types of classrooms.

371
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:12,300
Right. But thinking in classroom of on a continuum.

372
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,410
Is probably the most likely scenario. Okay.

373
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:24,840
Actually, that's all I have. So does anyone want to add anything?

374
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:30,850
I guess it's not all I am, but. Add anything before we jump into sort of the last thing?

375
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:42,100
I had a first. Diversity and inclusion.

376
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:50,690
Diversity. Is there something specificity that there has to be?

377
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,580
Have. Among them.

378
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:07,410
You have to. Pick someone based on that you have to down.

379
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,070
Think again. Yeah, I think I know what you're saying.

380
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,670
And if anyone knows more than I do, please contribute.

381
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:26,610
But I do think it's all about. I'm thinking of, like, the hiring process.

382
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:31,080
I think it's mostly based on the.

383
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:43,000
The call. So the. The call was probably not the right thing, but the description of the job when it's posted, it's all about the language in there.

384
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:54,819
So I think and so I think it's just like the requirements in terms of promoting and retaining diverse faculty,

385
01:05:54,820 --> 01:06:02,440
staff and students, sort of where that comes into play if there are requirements like to either.

386
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:09,420
Bring in? Yeah. Here you go. I think we've done so well.

387
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:32,670
Nothing like that. And then you're trying to make sure that it is like an actual advertising for the post and not just.

388
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,450
I know that sounds like the president. Yeah.

389
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:49,020
Yeah. But in terms of like creating an actual safe environment for.

390
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:57,200
Yeah. That's, that's basically where my knowledge was in terms of like the average.

391
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,630
The description. Does that help?

392
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:14,570
Okay. All right. So the last thing I just want you to do, what part of your thought requirement for your syllabus is to have a DNI statement?

393
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:21,080
And so I just want you to take some time. I know some of you provided those statements already on the draft of your syllabus,

394
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,430
and I didn't I didn't read into them too much because I wanted you to just have more time.

395
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,840
Some of you use the existing statement that's there, but I,

396
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:38,000
I would love if you could create a statement sort of in your own words or even looking at different institutions or faculty.

397
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:43,420
You know, statements and what they heard. But I think a good start is just, you know,

398
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:52,550
going back to some of the stuff we did today and like the first the first worksheet we did and just sort of reading back through and you know,

399
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:59,630
what is significant to you, it was really a value to you and I'm just taking time and highlighting those.

400
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:04,400
I do have an article provided to you. You don't have to read any kind of if you want.

401
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:12,380
And then, you know, just take like let's just take ten, ten more minutes of our time and just do some of this.

402
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:18,650
Maybe go back to what you have on your syllabus already and just, you know, work with.

403
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,180
Okay. Let's give you guys like 10 minutes or so and I'll come back to you.

404
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:37,270
And everyone, it's been about 10 minutes. So one thing I also wanted to leave you with is I just gave you a list of

405
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:42,759
potential course in evaluation items that any time you have a first evaluation,

406
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:50,229
you do have room to edit it and add questions and actually items that are surrounding diversity equity.

407
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:57,950
And so they are becoming more weighted. And like this was a. This professor not even know the questions.

408
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:01,400
Right. The professor did a good job instructing her.

409
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:11,060
I like that. So. So just keep that in mind and then, you know, just sort of bouncing off of some of the things that were shared today is that,

410
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:24,070
of course, evaluations are also sort of this biased thing in higher ed and those those instructors that are people of color or women.

411
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:34,040
It is it has been studied widely that they are evaluated more than the white males.

412
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,800
Right. Same situations.

413
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:45,060
And so that's what's really important to keep in mind is sort of this flood system first evaluations, yet we still do use them.

414
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:56,580
But I did just want you to make you make you aware of certain items that could always be added to an evaluation and whether, you know,

415
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:01,499
whether you're doing like a workshop or a guest lecturer or something and you want to

416
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,650
include an evaluation for students to fill out on you to put in your teaching portfolio.

417
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,670
Right. You can you can utilize some of these.

418
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,230
Okay. All right. That's all I have.

419
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:18,320
What? I. I just want to do a couple announcements here.

420
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:25,180
No class next week. It is called break. The 25th is peer evaluation day.

421
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:30,009
And then I'm also going to introduce you to the next presentation that you guys will have.

422
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:36,250
You're going to think of a certain teaching method and then look up some literature on it and present it.

423
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:40,120
And that presentation is on the eighth. We'll talk about that in a second.

424
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:49,690
And the first is when we have Dr. Paul Fabien and Melissa, Dr. Melissa Cleary coming in to talk about Project Heart.

425
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:56,349
I'm Dr. Whitney Peeples is actually on the syllabus to come in and talk about she she had a conflict

426
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:02,889
that she so we had to switch out people but they're going to come in and talk about Project Heart.

427
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:10,570
They're leading that that initiative and then facilitate a conversation on the anti-racist and equity minded teaching.

428
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:15,730
Do keep in mind that there are several readings for that day and they're kind of longer.

429
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:20,230
So the facilitation conversation will be based off of some of that.

430
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:29,890
So it's really good background just to have. And then on the A, it is Election Day, so I want to be very mindful of that.

431
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,460
And we were supposed to do presentations that day.

432
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:39,430
So what I want to do, which I actually think is very relative in any way in this day and age,

433
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:48,520
is to record your presentation via Zoom and we'll just submit them to canvas that way.

434
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:54,640
So I'm just thinking of like teaching and just practicing effectively teaching.

435
01:21:55,110 --> 01:22:03,550
I present to you on Zoom, even if you don't have an audience, I still think it's important to be able to do that effectively.

436
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:09,489
So that is a change in plans for the eight that we will not come to class that day.

437
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:13,250
It's an election day. So just I just want to be very mindful.

438
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,040
Any questions? Okay.

439
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:25,330
I'll see you guys in two weeks. Yeah.
