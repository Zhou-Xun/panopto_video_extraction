1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,280
We tried to do it.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:20,940
That was part of it.

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:47,860
And sometimes I would say, listen, I know you.

4
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:59,520
I will give people another.

5
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,540
I don't know why you guys.

6
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:16,860
I'm actually glad to be part of it.

7
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,669
And by the way, there the the bills are all over.

8
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,810
And I was like this. This room tends to move. I don't know when or why or how, but sometimes their tables are grouped and sometimes they're in room.

9
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,740
Whatever. I don't care. Just roll with the punches.

10
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,150
This is a chance.

11
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:50,570
Recording is going to be while we wait for other stragglers to come in.

12
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,380
This is a course that has a few different purposes.

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,600
So I will be talking about some basics of communication.

14
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:15,060
I will talk to you, talking about the principles to help you use your messages more understandable or meaningful.

15
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310
But this is also, of course, is going to be a little bit reflective.

16
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,040
So before I get into the course and introduce myself, do all the standard routines we do on the first day.

17
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,120
I do want to start by acknowledging that we're going to talk.

18
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,060
I'm going to bring a lot of myself and stories in this course, and I hope you will, too.

19
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,530
This course isn't about content. This is about skills.

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,589
So this is, by the way, just making sure you're all in the right room.

21
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,399
I hope you're in the right room because 830 in the morning at the beginning of the semester,

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,370
if you're not in the right, we're not going to get any better as a group. I am Brian Zygmunt Fisher.

23
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,880
I am a faculty member right here in Health Behavior and Health Education. I've had some of the courses before.

24
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:15,510
I am not of public health and I want to start by saying that I am trained as a decision psychologist.

25
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:24,330
I am trained as somebody who to medical decision that we should help people get the information they need to navigate their lives,

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,569
to make medical decisions,

27
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:39,520
to understand that health data that we're all surrounded by in today's world, etc., that I'm going to bring up a very sort of micro perspective here.

28
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,069
We're not going to talk about that growth areas of behavior change in this course.

29
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,910
For the most part, not saying that stuff isn't important. It is.

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:58,240
That's not where I come from. This course, long title of which is Designing Sticky Communications for Health Advocacy, Education and Mass Media.

31
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,280
Why did I write such a long title? This course is about.

32
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,560
Do you remember? What we have to say.

33
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,780
How do you communicate the micro stuff, the message design?

34
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,100
It's basically a lot of marketing applied to public health.

35
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:34,180
Really thinking about what is it that distinguishes the messages that you're going to hear and that you're actually going to pay attention to and that

36
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,629
you're actually going to be remembered and that might influence you six months

37
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,380
or a year from now from the stuff that goes in one ear and out the other.

38
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:53,250
And I have to tell you the story of how this course came around when I first came here to public health just 13 years ago or something like that,

39
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,880
this book. But you will all be getting. And if you have not already gotten it,

40
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,990
you need to do so quickly because we're going to start reading from it within about a week and a half on was a bestseller.

41
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,220
Now the story here is lead author Chip Heath.

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,420
I met Chip Heath back in.

43
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,170
And what was it?

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,060
When I was in graduate school and she was a brand new assistant associate assistant professor at the time, and I was a graduate student.

45
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,610
And long story short, we ended up at a same summer institute for a week together.

46
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:37,710
And. He his career has been focused on questions about message memorability.

47
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,500
He's written a series of very popular press books, etc.

48
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:48,390
So when I came here to Public Health and I had to develop a course and they asked me to develop a health communication course, I was intrigued.

49
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:58,920
And so I called Chip up and I asked him, Hey, this is a really interesting book on sort of like what makes messages sticky, etc.

50
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,940
Has anybody ever applied this to health communication? I'll never forget what he said to me.

51
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,540
Well, this is true. He said, Oh, that's a great idea, because public health communication is so damn boring.

52
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,780
Right. It's accurate. It's informative.

53
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:27,490
But for the most part, a lot of what health communication is is not designed to be memorable, and that's unfortunate.

54
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:36,190
So that's what the motivation of this course is. How do we take the ideas of stickiness of memorability,

55
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:46,329
of all the different ways in which we can talk about health information and use those principles in the context of predominantly health,

56
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:53,800
motivation, communication? We'll talk about different types of communication, but this is again, we're not getting into the theory.

57
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,490
This is not about the content for the most part of the process.

58
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,059
So, yes, you need to get this book. It's not hard to find.

59
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,780
It was a bestseller. There are bazillions of use copies out there, etc.

60
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,500
When you start to read it, which we will do in about a week or so, you're going to say, Yeah, this is getting out of date.

61
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,190
You're right. This book has tons of examples.

62
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,020
They're all from like 2007. Some of them are still applicable.

63
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,000
Some of them are like newspapers. Why are you talking about newspapers, etc.?

64
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,470
Don't worry about it. The concepts are just as applicable today as they were there.

65
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:41,510
And in many ways the whole purpose of this course is to have you do the mental work of saying, how do I take this concept?

66
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:50,330
Which I'm reading about in the examples they're giving me are quite applicable to today and figure out how they apply to your work.

67
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,420
The kinds of stuff that we're going to do on a daily basis in our public health careers and our medical careers, etc.

68
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,360
I guarantee you they exist. And in fact, I guarantee you, as we get into this, you're going to find.

69
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,800
You want to share? Examples from your own life are things either that have stuck with you.

70
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,220
But messages are, wow, that was really. I remember this or.

71
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,720
Situations in which the communication failed, not because it wasn't accurate.

72
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,080
Because it wasn't remembered. And that's what we want to get into.

73
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:37,380
So. Let me start doing the usual overview stuff.

74
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,790
No, I don't have paper syllabi, but yes, you really ought to read the syllabus.

75
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,280
I know this is like the thing that everybody begs you on the first day of class.

76
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,300
I want an overview of few things. I'm not going to cover everything, but I really do.

77
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,810
I have a very complete syllabus for a reason.

78
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:07,770
There's a lot of stuff there that I think is important. Let me start, however, by acknowledging where we are.

79
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:23,680
Because we are here at the University of Michigan. We are here on land that was originally part of or lived on by the initial big peoples,

80
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,360
including the Odawa Ojibway and Buda widow and was one of the people.

81
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,380
Our university stands, frankly, like almost all university levels in the United States,

82
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,340
all the lands that weren't obtained generally in unconscionable ways from indigenous peoples.

83
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,760
We need to acknowledge where we stand and that history that doesn't change the past.

84
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,190
But it does allow us to think through the ongoing consequences of that history and

85
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,560
to think through what we can do to empower a future that supports justice for all.

86
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,900
And I want to start there by just. Every class I tried to start with a reminder of that.

87
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,550
And I also want to acknowledge I'm going to ask something of you that I don't think many, many professors ask.

88
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,719
I'm going to ask you to be a little vulnerable in this class to share a little bit from yourself.

89
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,270
And I'm not going to ask you to do anything that I'm not going to do as well. I'm going to share a lot of personal stories in this class.

90
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,000
And those of you who have taken classes from me before seen the kinds of stories that I share.

91
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,120
I do so because I think we can only learn about communication by bringing our full selves to it.

92
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:44,020
This is not an abstract topic. We are all absorbing information on a daily basis being affected by or not.

93
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:53,650
We are all navigating our health care decisions are decisions about whether to exercise or what to eat or.

94
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:02,020
Whether or not to get a COVID vaccine. Through the lens of the messages that we have been giving.

95
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,410
I know. COVID 19 vaccine messages that I remember from two years ago because they stuck with me.

96
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:22,540
And I remember. The fact that I was bombarded by many, many messages that I didn't remember a week after I saw that's what the purpose of this course.

97
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:29,620
And so when you bring that. That helps us all because I am not always in that position.

98
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,640
Stickiness memorability of messages is an individual thing, is a cultural influence.

99
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,140
I can only be myself. I need to know.

100
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,540
We all need to know. What are the messages that are influencing you?

101
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Where are you? How are you reacting to them? Under what circumstances is this image or story or spokesperson,

102
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,500
someone who you want to listen to versus someone who you're like, Yeah, I'm not I'm not actually engaging with.

103
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:09,130
And that sharing of our different perspectives is going to help us think through how do we go through the process of making messages stick?

104
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,610
So that's a big overview of what I want to do in this course.

105
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:27,560
A few general notes about who I am as an instructor. I start by acknowledging that being a student in my class is not the only thing in your life.

106
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,500
And to the extent that things come up, which in a room of 40 odd people,

107
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,989
somebody some time during this semester is going to have something happen that's going to mess up their life.

108
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,420
I guarantee it. Please come talk to me. Please engage with me.

109
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:55,700
Let's have that conversation. I have been there. I went through a major medical issue, which I will talk about more in the middle of graduate school.

110
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,950
So it's not like I can't understand what the issues are.

111
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,120
But the last thing I want is for somebody to say at the end of the semester, hey,

112
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,130
I just I couldn't there was this thing going on in my life and I'm like, Wow, I really wish I could have helped along the way.

113
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,980
Please reach out to me. On that note, this course does not have one giant project.

114
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,250
It has a lot of small assignments as we go along. That's very intentional.

115
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,140
This is a skill, of course. You're not all going to get it right the first time.

116
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,420
That's intentional. This is hard. So.

117
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,450
I give assignments, early assignments, repeated assignments to enable you to get feedback.

118
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:48,190
And if you're getting it, that's great. And if you're struggling as a signal, let's pick up on that together and let's have that conversation.

119
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,300
Let's work together to help you understand. Oh, well, how do I bring in these ideas and build them into the later part?

120
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:07,820
I also have a value. That you pay enough money and you're investing enough time as a student here at the

121
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,760
University of Michigan that you ought to have an instructor who knows your name.

122
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,900
However, this 40 of you in this room, it's going to take me some time.

123
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,300
Please help. I value making sure that I can recognize you and know your name on site.

124
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,100
We're going to keep working on it. So he pulled out her and her name tag.

125
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,260
I will have name tags by. Next week.

126
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,590
I don't have them for today, in part because I'm just doing the first days.

127
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,960
But if I ask you to speak today moving forward, please feel free to introduce yourself.

128
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,190
I am. And he said, I am. Farrell said.

129
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,520
The. Thing I will ask is just keep nudging me like this is valuable.

130
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,330
So if I get it wrong, please correct me if I forget something.

131
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,799
There are some of you. I guarantee I know who you are. I recognize you.

132
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,660
And I'm going to go like this. You know, I don't know. All the names go out my window over the break.

133
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,129
It's like the toilet bowl flushes and it all goes down. And I have to relearn all this stuff.

134
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,120
So it's. I care about this. This is important, so please help me.

135
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:36,980
The arc of this course is that we're going to spend the first half of it or so working our way through the made to book,

136
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,220
thinking about principles of stickiness. I'm going to spend the second half really focusing on.

137
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:51,409
Stories and narratives. There's going to be a component of this course that's going to feel a little bit like an English class,

138
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,590
and you're like, Why are we doing storytelling? How much of public health is storytelling?

139
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,530
Stories of projects, stories of successes, stories of failures.

140
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,770
It's a lot of narrative to pull it off. You can tell that narrative powerfully.

141
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,610
You can accomplish a lot. So going to spend some time in that. That's different.

142
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:25,760
I hope you'll come along for the ride. Because that's part of what I really hope we can do in this crisis.

143
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,230
But the main thing so I'm going to leave forward a little bit.

144
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,300
There is an assignment for next class. It is ungraded.

145
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:50,190
You can look it up on the canvas side. I ask you to prepare a 62nd oral speech?

146
00:16:51,640 --> 00:17:01,150
Designed to persuade someone about whether or not Lyme disease should be a public health priority in the state of Michigan.

147
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,930
I've given you there's a couple resource documents in the can to say you are welcome to look up anything.

148
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,470
You are welcome to use. Any things you know or can't find online.

149
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:20,229
This is not a research study. Because we're all going to the next class.

150
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,720
We're all going to break up into groups and share our persuasive speeches.

151
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,450
Yes, I'm going to be timing you. 60 seconds, not 60 to 60.

152
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,040
This is going to get our creative juices flowing. But like, how would you try to persuade somebody about a public health issue?

153
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,230
And by the way, I'm really clear. I don't care what you argue. You can argue for it being a primary.

154
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,490
You can argue against it being a priority. This is more about how will you make the argument?

155
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,830
What will you choose to do? And no, there's no grading here.

156
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,580
But the incentive. Yes, I like chocolate.

157
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,690
So I am bringing the Tues class. Several bars of my favorite chocolate.

158
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:15,020
And in each group, the person whose speech is rated most persuasive by you is going to get a bar of my favorite.

159
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,080
Just so that's your incentive.

160
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,520
Assuming everybody like chocolate at some point where you can share the chocolate if you don't want.

161
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,470
But this is just to get you started.

162
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:37,220
Like this is not going be a passive class, it's going to be an active class. We're going to be sharing ideas, sharing approaches.

163
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,620
I love it. I want to be really clear. You don't have to use anything I gave you on that assignment.

164
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,690
You can use anything you think is going to make your argument persuasive.

165
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,420
But you only have 60 seconds to do it. And that's going to get us thinking about how do we make ourselves persuasive?

166
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,430
How do we think make ourselves memorable when we're talking about health complex?

167
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,150
But I wanted to get that one out of the way because the other thing I want to talk about right at the start is,

168
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,810
other than for next class, every class, there will be a assignment.

169
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,790
Do they before I ask, obviously there's readings with yourself.

170
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,000
They ask everybody to do the readings ahead of time. And to do what I call music.

171
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:32,850
Musings are stream of consciousness. Reactions to what you have read there do at 4 p.m. the day before class.

172
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:45,100
Why are they do it for Pam the day before class? Because between 4 p.m. and 830 the next morning I will read every one of them and I will come in and

173
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,400
I will call on people and ask you to share a little bit about what you have written in your music.

174
00:19:52,430 --> 00:20:00,430
So I might say, Sydney, you were talking to your mom about about, you know, vaccination and you were talking about this ad you saw.

175
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:10,430
Can you share that? And that's the way I would bring a lot of your experiences and your stories into this course.

176
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,440
So I don't want you to summarize. This is not a take notes kind of exercise.

177
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,110
This is a tell me a story exercise.

178
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:27,260
Find a connection from what you've read into anything that's happened in your life or anything you've read about it, etc.

179
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:35,210
The more of those things that we bring in. The more I can shape them and organize them, the better this class works.

180
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,000
So. Please feel free to bring in anything that seems appropriate.

181
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,250
However, and this is an important caveat.

182
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,530
If as you're doing your reading, something really pops to mind next to what we're reading about or thinking about.

183
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,020
But it's something he would rather not share. That's always fine.

184
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,520
Instead of posting it in canvas, which is the standard assignment.

185
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,419
Email it to me. I will read it myself.

186
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,650
I will give you full credit, but I will not share it. And I will not call on you for that day.

187
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,170
And we will have a general rule here, if ever I ask somebody to share something kind of amusing,

188
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,620
and then they're like, I don't want to talk about that. That's always fine.

189
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:28,890
So I hope you'll share when you can. So we get a lot of this course is going to be about bringing in these kinds of ideas

190
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,290
and connecting the dots to talk to about what's going on in your life in this post.

191
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,150
It that that this is my to do list of.

192
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,370
Oh, that's the other thing I should mention. While I'm talking about the music, I don't take attendance in this class.

193
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,450
I assume we're all adults. We all have our own lives to deal with.

194
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,180
You know, if you have a job. No interview.

195
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,740
In fact, I know there's one person who is not here right now because they've got a job interview that they're doing.

196
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,460
KLEIN That's important. If you get sick, please don't be coming in and coughing on us.

197
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:11,180
I think the timing is whatever. I'm not paying attention to whether you're here on an individual day basis.

198
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,290
I am, however, paying attention to whether you're not participating in this class.

199
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,840
There is a class participation part of the grade.

200
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:27,680
And what I mean by that is anything that means you're here and you're responding when I'm calling on you because you've written interesting musings.

201
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,790
That's great. It means you're raising your hand and participating in other conversations.

202
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,979
That's great. I just want to make sure we hear your voice in this class.

203
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,080
And I know that will be easier for some of you and harder for others of you. But this is a communication class.

204
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,260
Part of our purpose here is to build your communications skills.

205
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,770
In fact,

206
00:22:50,250 --> 00:23:00,870
one of the competencies that I must cover in this class to meet the communications requirements for the company is to have you do oral communication.

207
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,700
So we're going to have to do some of that. And that's part of the competencies that are being addressed.

208
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Beyond that. You know, this is the I go through the syllabus things I turn to all this stuff.

209
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,620
Nobody said a word thus far. It feels really dead in here.

210
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,500
I acknowledge that we're going to try and shift the tone here really soon.

211
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,330
I'm. But I want to acknowledge.

212
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,620
It's hard to get this tone going on the first day, but this is my favorite class to teach.

213
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,160
This is not what I researched for the most part, although I do do some research work in the context of using narratives and how communication.

214
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:54,510
But it is my first favorite class to teach. And the reason is we get into really fun.

215
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,890
So critical analysis of how do we want to be as communicators?

216
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,710
We're going to talk about science communication.

217
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,520
How do we communicate things like scientific abstracts in a way that might actually somebody might listen to?

218
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,250
We're going to talk about really persuasive stuff.

219
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:23,120
In this course you will do, we'll write summaries, really clear, focused summaries of scientific paper.

220
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,510
You will write a story, a first person narrative story as a health communication.

221
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:40,650
You will make posters. Leveraging the principles of stickiness that we're going to talk about to be as maximally memorable as possible.

222
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,900
You will do critical analysis of public service announcements, etc.

223
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,230
We're going to try and apply these things and bring them in.

224
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,579
And the last day, we basically do a poster session where we share the different posters that we've created as part of the assignments.

225
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,350
And it's one of the nice ways to wrap up this course and see what everybody has done over the course of this march.

226
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,590
All right. So I think.

227
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,450
That's it for the main syllabus overview.

228
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,520
The other thing I will ask is this is an annoying Rome teacher.

229
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,500
I like this one in many ways, but it's annoying repetition for one reason. There's no clock in here.

230
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,639
There's no clock back there. There's no clock. There's no clock anywhere in this room.

231
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,460
And in fact, about six or seven years ago, I got so fed up teaching in New York, I went to IKEA and bought a clock and stuck it in the back.

232
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,300
And it lived here for like three years until somebody stole it. I don't know what happened to it.

233
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,179
I like to do it for this class. I like to do something right at the end of class in the last 5 minutes.

234
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:56,800
So all of you are empowered. Watch your clocks when we get to 945.

235
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,419
If I have not noticed that it's 945, you may interrupt me.

236
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,980
You may stick up your hand in like 5 minutes instead of when we hit the five minute mark.

237
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,860
You must make sure that I know that I may sort of say, Yeah, yeah, I get it.

238
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,360
Let me just finish this thought, but let me at the five minute mark,

239
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,100
because we are going to end every single class the same way in the last 5 minutes.

240
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,370
Okay? All right. So.

241
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,920
Let me just start. This.

242
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,940
I wanted to think about goals of health communication. What are we trying to do?

243
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,549
And I want to make an argument in this class that there is a spectrum of goals

244
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,370
that we always need to be thinking about to be about health communications. At one end of the spectrum.

245
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,720
It is the situations in which we are.

246
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:13,940
Just trying to make information available. I call it like you describe at the other end of the spectrum.

247
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:23,670
I want us to think about the situations in which when we're designing a health medicine, we are attempting to coerce.

248
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,500
And do not tell me the public health never tries to coerce people, because we absolutely do.

249
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,330
Think about smoking messages. You can think about certain vaccination,

250
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:49,420
like you cannot be a employee of the University of Michigan Health System and not be coerced towards influenza vaccination.

251
00:27:50,350 --> 00:28:01,640
There are job consequences if you fail to get vaccinated. And then, of course, there's middle ground because.

252
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:10,420
There is a difference between just sort of throwing information, people at people and actually trying to talk.

253
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,690
Inform includes something more like.

254
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,850
Processing engagement.

255
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:27,460
Use of that information, say, and making a decision like I want to be informed about the concept of the possible consequences of my actions.

256
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,420
It may not mean that we're pushing you, but we're certainly engaging with you.

257
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,810
And then in this space, we might call something like Wave.

258
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,910
I'm pushing it. I want you to do this.

259
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,160
Do not force him. You. But I'm definitely intentional. Okay.

260
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:13,969
So let's start. What are some situations in which we are communicating from audience to patient audience,

261
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,150
etc., with the goal of informing them when they need to engage with the information?

262
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,090
But. We're not necessarily pushing people.

263
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,170
Yeah, you're talking like risks and benefits sometimes. I think it could probably be persuade, too, but I think you could also.

264
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,230
So give me a concrete example. Like risk the benefits of breast cancer screening mammography.

265
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,240
We got to. At what age are we talking about?

266
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,340
Uh huh. Great question. Um, I guess 50.

267
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,920
It really depends on your organization, but let's talk 40 because that's more.

268
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:06,299
Okay, so let's talk for you. So. So, by the way, my handwriting sucks.

269
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,070
It's terrible. I know. I'm sorry. Just roll with the punches, please.

270
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,430
If I. If you can't read it, let me know. I will try to explain it.

271
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:22,000
But mammography at age 40. So let me be clear. Breast cancer screening for average risk.

272
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,790
Women without known genetic risk factors at age 40 is not currently recommended by professional societies.

273
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,520
But there may be some. Shared decision making going on?

274
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,710
Is this something that the patient wants, etc.?

275
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,820
So information related to the risks and benefits of mammography at that age, we probably fall into this inform space.

276
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,210
But notice how much I pushed here because if we talk about.

277
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:02,920
I will make it easier at 55, which is squarely within the age ranges of recommended cancer screening tests for women.

278
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,640
Average at risk women. We're not actually neutral on the question as to whether or not somebody is getting a mammogram.

279
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,309
You can disagree with this, but the public health infrastructure,

280
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,980
the medical infrastructure has a belief that most women should be getting regular breast cancer screenings.

281
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,760
And so those breathability related to that are persuasive and encouraging, motivating, etc.

282
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:35,560
Okay, so more examples. When do we when are we providing information?

283
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,930
Giving people access to that. But not trying to persuade.

284
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,060
Yeah. Maybe a food recall challenge.

285
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:54,120
That was if I filed contaminated flour in my kitchen.

286
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,480
Do you care whether or not I use it to cook? Yeah, I guess that would be more towards persuasion.

287
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,290
Recalls are clearly over here in my mind.

288
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,270
In fact, when I've once had a meeting with somebody who does a lot of work in the food recall space,

289
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,570
he basically said, Look, I don't want you thinking about whether it's safe to cook these eggs.

290
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,200
I want you to throw them out. I want this to be an unconscious reaction.

291
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,770
And we might even argue that the recalls move this way to the point in which I'm pushing you.

292
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,670
I don't care if you're thinking. I just care if you're doing it. But let's just run with this for now.

293
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,530
What are other things that are like this where I don't actually care that you think I just care that you do.

294
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,580
Yeah. They're going to be like pressing emergency.

295
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:59,670
Like there's you need to evacuate evacuation, for example, like fire flood, hurricane tornado warnings.

296
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,120
Yeah. Those all fall under the I don't I don't want you to think about this.

297
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,879
I want you to do something terrible at this. The tornado warning comes up and I pull up my computer.

298
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,840
I look to see it, look at the radar instead of going into the basement. One thing about the Flint water crisis, don't you think?

299
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,250
Just do. No. There's many layers here.

300
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,000
So let's be really concrete and specific about what types of messages we're talking about.

301
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,460
What are the more coercive messages in that space?

302
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:39,180
The hybrid concentration in the water is extremely dangerous if you know whether you have a high lead concentration in your water.

303
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:50,080
No, but they knew it was a. So the message to the public at large was this is a crisis, but what is the course of action that we're pushing towards?

304
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,420
You don't drink the water. Okay.

305
00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:04,310
So let's be clear. If you live to the extent that there are moments and communities where the behavior that we want is.

306
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,360
Do not drink the water. Whether that's because of lead in the pipes,

307
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,330
whether that's because of a water main break and there's a boil water order, etc., those clearly fall into this.

308
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:23,790
You know, I'm not asking you to figure out the concentration of lead that is too high for you.

309
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:31,310
I don't want you to be engaging in some questioning about whether all the I don't I'm older and I'm not a kid,

310
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,310
so maybe it's like, no, don't drink the water.

311
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,450
Now notice that if we get into water.

312
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:48,800
And let's say you have a test done on your household water giving you an exact level of lead that is in your water.

313
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,570
Now, where does that type of communication fall in this spectrum?

314
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,320
It's a little bit less clear, isn't it?

315
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:08,930
Like, if it's super bad, we're getting over here to some degree, but for a lot of this, it's going to be about,

316
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:16,309
you know, if your result is over some threshold, then we encourage you to get a water filter.

317
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,710
And like so we might put a variety of.

318
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:31,450
Our test result communications into this persuasive space in which I want you to notice what kind of test result you have.

319
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:40,510
And if you fall into certain categories, be motivated to engage in a particular behavior, whether that's water quality,

320
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:52,660
whether that's your cardiovascular risk score, whether that's, I don't know, some community measurement of the air quality in your neighborhood.

321
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:05,500
We're this we definitely have an answer we want, but it's not necessarily as unconscious as the, you know, leave private message.

322
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,660
What else falls in this set? Really high. And, of course, of space.

323
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:20,009
Yeah. What's your name? I'm scarred by, um, something like wearing a seatbelt, which is enforced by all.

324
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:31,260
We definitely won't be doing without this product. No. If I think about a lot of communications that have legal consequences that fall into this.

325
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:37,080
But traffic was really notice.

326
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,600
Traffic laws and seatbelts all over fear.

327
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:56,420
Be careful when you're driving at it's icy out is easier because you can legally drive 70 miles an hour in the middle of a snowstorm.

328
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,730
It's just not a really good idea. But notice.

329
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,100
Where's this? Like. Like what does this.

330
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,910
I'm telling you information.

331
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,390
And I want you to do something in particular versus when is this?

332
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,980
Yeah, I'll see what you want to do with it. Yeah. What's it about.

333
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,490
Would it depend on the severity of or. Yes, like the the yeah.

334
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,110
The severity of like the incentive behind between inform and persuade.

335
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,889
Let me flip that around. Under what circumstances do we have?

336
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,570
Incentives. I mean, incentive would be something that I desire.

337
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,920
So it depends on my desire to to get selected for me.

338
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:55,750
If you informed me, it's like I could have this, you know, it depends on how bad I want this, this outcome that you're talking.

339
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,760
Yeah, but let's this is a really that also how much you want it so between inform it would be I guess like more for my

340
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:10,770
benefit and it is I guess more so like overall like maybe there's like multiple but so let me rephrase the idea.

341
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:18,910
I think you're trying to get across you. When we're on this board, persuade or further over.

342
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,430
We as communicator are taking a stand and say, I know what the right thing is.

343
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:37,280
You may or may not agree with me, by the way, like I. We can have lots of important ethical conversations about how accurate we are and when we

344
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,360
use our persuasive powers and we will have these conversations throughout this course.

345
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,060
But if you're here and over, we are saying,

346
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:54,240
I know what's right and I'm going to create a message that will push you towards the outcome that I believe is right.

347
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,400
So I, as a public health person, am really comfortable doing that.

348
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,710
If we're say you're talking about, say, smoking cessation or COVID 19 vaccination.

349
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,940
But it's a question how where do we draw that line in terms of saying, I know what's right?

350
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:22,800
The opposite side, which you also allude to, is there. You may have very specific preferences so that when you are informed that will guide you,

351
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,790
enable you to follow your own preferences and make the choice that's best for you.

352
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,080
But I don't know that. I don't know what that choice is.

353
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:40,230
And so we often communicate with our goal of informing when we can't know what the right choice is.

354
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,860
And we need to enable the audience to use the information that's available to them to make that right choice.

355
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:55,440
So a shared decision situation, a situation in which I don't know what you prefer or I don't know what's important to you,

356
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,860
but once you have this information, maybe you can make the better choice.

357
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,800
But notice, this is not just a communication question. It's an ethics question.

358
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,240
How do we put healthy eating?

359
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:19,320
Eating sweets exercise. Where do we put those lines?

360
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:26,370
It's complicated on a few of. Yeah, I was just thinking for, like, actresses in physical activity,

361
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:31,229
I feel like you often will persuade people to engage in in general because it has known health benefits.

362
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,559
But in terms of like you can inform them the different types they could do, the benefits,

363
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,680
those specific types then they choose based on what you inform them, how you want how they want to do that.

364
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,570
So this is a really good and important example because it pops up in many domains.

365
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:57,290
There are lots of things that we as public health and medicine encourage people to be doing.

366
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:05,480
Exercise is one eating healthy. Cancer screening in appropriate age ranges, getting preventive health things, etc.

367
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,100
But if there are different modalities, different processes,

368
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,670
I may not know whether you like to hike or swim or Zumba or just go for a long walks or whatever.

369
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,420
We are often quite neutral about that.

370
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:37,360
I'll give you a different example. I work with a nephrologist whose primary research interest is people with severe alcoholic liver disease.

371
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,430
For those kinds of people. They are often on liver transplant lists, etc.

372
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,980
Whether or not they get a transplant, if they get the transplant or while they're waiting for the transplant, etc.

373
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,520
The single most important thing they can do to improve their health is stop drinking, period.

374
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,670
And a conversation. How?

375
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,970
It doesn't matter. You don't talk about how many different ways there are to support alcohol cessation.

376
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:15,850
12 step programs, intensive program medication, various programs, counseling like huge ranges.

377
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,340
And so she's faced this exact problem in designing the communications of patients.

378
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,260
Does she want to be persuasive about stopping? Absolutely.

379
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,680
And in fact, she pushes as hard as you possibly can on that. But she actually doesn't care what method they use.

380
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:48,800
And so it's a hybrid between this persuasive usually you need to pick something message and the informed choice about which method they then choose.

381
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,710
I see in other interventions, for example, the context of the colorectal cancer screening.

382
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,430
Same issue. You want to use two cards?

383
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,100
Cologuard, get a colonoscopy. All of these are reasonable screening modalities.

384
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,500
But what do we really care about? You do something. So there's this interesting balance.

385
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,170
I mean, we know about. No, I'm not saying you have to get a colonoscopy.

386
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:25,820
I am saying you need to do something. Other examples that fall into more of that informed space.

387
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:31,340
Yeah. So your next decisions about continuation for me,

388
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:38,719
should adoption plans for pregnancy do when the risk to the mother is in a place

389
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,090
where she is looking for the pregnant patient where they can make the decision?

390
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,530
I'm not going to put a lot of different things falling in the pregnancy space,

391
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:53,050
whether we're talking about genetic anomalies, whether we're talking about that.

392
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,370
Let me be clear. I'm not talking about should you get prenatal care like okay.

393
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,620
Yes, we want to encourage people to come in for prenatal care for a variety of reasons.

394
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,360
But the kinds of questions you're talking about when we're talking about family planning decisions,

395
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:13,100
birth control choices, adoption issues, infertility decisions, like all of these things fall into a space in which.

396
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:21,920
The patient, the member of the public's preferences and values are central to figuring out what the right choices,

397
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,940
and all we can and should be doing is providing information in clear ways to enable that.

398
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:32,310
That's kind of where I was going to go. But I was focusing more on the genetic testing side of things,

399
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:39,300
but not going to kind of accept broadly just sometimes getting genetic test results don't really there's not necessarily a right to decision.

400
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,340
By the way, you're going to hear this over and over.

401
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,319
You're going to give me nice, really good examples and then I'm going to push and be annoying in that way.

402
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,290
I'm sorry, but a lot of genetic testing is very much in a uniform space.

403
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,620
What are the exceptions? When are we persuasive about genetic testing?

404
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,640
If you have specific cancer genes, that would make you more likely that.

405
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,889
So we have people who have, for example,

406
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:12,270
family histories of disease where we really we move into the persuasive space of saying we really think this information is valuable to you.

407
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,650
It's important. And in other contexts, I think in at least one other context.

408
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:26,430
I think they need more screening. Situations in which you have markers but then signal risk.

409
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,940
And we say, you know, you're not average. Let's let's take that information and potentially push to get more information.

410
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:41,730
Yeah. Yep. I feel like that's coercion. That's like I don't think that newborn screening falls under because you don't have a choice.

411
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,570
You can you can choose to opt out. But it is an opt out system.

412
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,570
It is an opt out system. So it's definitely not in the informed space we moved out into.

413
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,340
Well, all right. So there's the system and then there's the communications in relationship to the system.

414
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:07,820
The system is set up right now where it's raw infant will be tested unless you specifically opt out for the standard set of things.

415
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:15,280
Then, of course, there are optional newborn screening tests that are at the choice of the parent whether or not to have those done.

416
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:21,920
Those get more complicated in terms of thinking about how much are we persuasive or not about those contexts?

417
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:27,230
Can you give an example of those? Because right now it seems like the difference from I'm not sure what you could add on to that.

418
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,100
So I may be out of date, but about six years,

419
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:39,230
it must be about eight years ago now I worked with a graduate student who is looking at newborn screening for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,

420
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:46,880
which at that time was not part of the standard process but was available at the choice of the parent.

421
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,560
So that was an informed decision because they did not have to do it.

422
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,820
We might get persuasive in a context in which somebody had a family history of disease, but it doesn't.

423
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:07,220
My point here is that and again, we need to be careful and this is going to be a theme throughout this course to separate the structural incentives

424
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:17,870
and systems from the communications so that do you want to have your kid tested for Duchenne muscular dystrophy?

425
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:23,270
Communication is an informed one, but not necessarily a persuasive one.

426
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:29,060
In that context, the is it okay if we do this standardized?

427
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:40,399
Newborn screening panel, I suspect for the most part, is being framed as a persuasive of course you're going to do this with lots of benefits,

428
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:48,050
etc. although even there we could imagine presenting that in a less persuasive versus more persuasive way.

429
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,630
And we need to be conscious about whether or not we're going to be persuasive or not in that context.

430
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,870
And that's really what I'm driving at here is,

431
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:04,160
is us being reflective as communicators on what are we attempting to do at this moment in time with this person?

432
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:10,970
Do we believe we know what the right answer is, what their reaction should be, or not yet?

433
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,980
So I'm confused not just from what we've been discussing so far.

434
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:25,280
I hear a lot of when there's a tension present. Where do things fall back on off of the example of newborn screening?

435
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,100
There are situations where families simply do not know that this is a test that takes place.

436
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,440
You're not informed about what the different types of genetic diseases are that they're tested for.

437
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:44,510
So when there is a lack of intentionality and a lack of effort towards actually informing the patient, where does that fall?

438
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,100
I have a feeling that it may fall on the persuading.

439
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,909
Well, so this is the question. And there are communications.

440
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:59,270
And let's acknowledge that these exist where health information is being communicated.

441
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:09,020
But for the most part, the audience who is receiving it is not going to even notice it or react to it or would be able to respond to it.

442
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:19,549
I'll give you my classic example of this. Every year I get a water quality report from my local water system with detailed

443
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,790
numerical information about the level of all these different potential contaminants,

444
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:28,730
all of which appear to be, as far as I can tell. Really, really small because there's lots of zeros.

445
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,610
But I'm a risk person, like this is what I study.

446
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:45,950
I can't understand that table. I can imagine that pretty much any homeowner who receives it is deriving any actionable meaning from that report.

447
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,570
And yet it is provided to me on an annual basis. Why?

448
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:59,460
Is that really what we have to do? Yes, there is a law, but why is the law in place?

449
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,450
There's a communication purpose here. And that's why I want to I want to bring this to the surface.

450
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,900
It's not that there's no purpose. Is it just so that, you know, they are testing trust?

451
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,810
Trust is important. There are situations in which we are communicating.

452
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,000
So that people know that information exists so that they have trust in the system,

453
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,530
even if on an individual level basis they don't even they're not really informed.

454
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,880
They do not comprehend the details of that message. And they simply know that it exists.

455
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,020
We can think about questions of informed consent.

456
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:49,140
And ask ourselves, how many times do we think that an informed consent process actually rises to the level of full informing of the person?

457
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:57,860
And how often is it a, you know, the the laundry list of things that we check our box off, or even more simply than that,

458
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:05,750
think about how many times you install some software and click the boxes, having read the terms and conditions.

459
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,690
And yet that is its own form of communication.

460
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,340
You know that there was a thing there that you collect the backside.

461
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:24,639
Just like I know there are risks when I go for a procedure where I'm going to be getting anesthesia,

462
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,560
but I may or may not have any quantitative understanding of the magnitudes of those risks.

463
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:38,499
So if you didn't say anything about it, we would be like,

464
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,910
there's a difference between no communication and a communication in which I no information was provided.

465
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,670
But I am not informed in the cognitive emotional sense about that.

466
00:51:52,930 --> 00:52:01,270
And yes, we can argue the ethics of how many times these types of communications are basically legal covering your butt kind of stuff.

467
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:09,610
And that's a fair argument to have. Like, how often are these communications just simply, you know, check the box.

468
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,310
But that's a form of communication, too. And that's why I say this is a spectrum.

469
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:25,960
There are times when we are not satisfied until some measure of comprehension, like we can ask people questions and they would get the answers right.

470
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,970
So we can measure whether or not they were fully informed.

471
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:41,350
And there are times in which the communications like we need to stop. We have absolute proof here that that information was put out there.

472
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,120
And on a related note, using again, using my water quality example.

473
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,740
I can't understand the report. My guess is most homeowners can't.

474
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:01,820
But if I was really honest about my water, I'm sure I could take that report to somebody who would understand,

475
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,270
like the fact that that information exists does create some degree of accountability.

476
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:14,220
And that's important. And what's it about? That same idea through a different lens.

477
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,900
It's one of nutrition labels for allergy labels on food.

478
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:27,250
I may not understand what all those chemicals are that I see on the side of the box of the things that I'm eating.

479
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:37,730
But I know they had to disclose them. I know they have to mark how many grams of saturated fat.

480
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,280
Even though I'm not necessarily really clear on what saturated fat is and why I should care about it.

481
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:56,520
But to push this analogy further, what gets on the front of the package on the grocery store versus on the little side,

482
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:02,280
black and yellow, black and white box? That's mandated marketing messages.

483
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,920
Yeah, like like non-GMO. That's why it's organic or gluten free.

484
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,170
Okay. So we've got characteristics like organic or gluten free.

485
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:23,250
Sometimes I'm thinking like the cereal aisle, you'll see communications that are highlighting a certain attributes.

486
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:28,800
Say grams of sugar, whole grains type stuff, fat free, sugar free, etc.

487
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:36,900
Characteristics which they hope will make you more likely to purchase their product.

488
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:47,750
Great. By the way, let's just think about this. We similarly market our product.

489
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,870
Well, think about the thing about the you walk one or the other on CBS.

490
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:05,600
What's on the front of the packages are the situations in which we leverage the same kinds of marketing tools in the domain of health.

491
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,130
You mean what Claritin could be?

492
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:17,760
I'm throwing this wide open. I do think that there are times when we highlight attributes of medicines.

493
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,450
So I certainly notice the ones that are longer duration versus shorter duration.

494
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:31,099
CVS. I certainly notice the ones in which say may be easier for me to take.

495
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,600
I don't have to take them as often or they're easier to apply things like that. These are the attributes of health.

496
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:44,030
If saturated fat or organic is an attribute of food, then duration of medicine and cost of medicine side effects.

497
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:50,690
Those kinds of things are attributes of health. And we can think about do we market those?

498
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:57,620
When do we use those in persuasive ways and when are they simply presented as information to guide decision making?

499
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:02,690
And when are they actually over here? So think about the.

500
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,050
Package insert in.

501
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:19,819
Any medication. The thing that has a small for, you know, the folds out that has a super really small font that has these tables of side effects,

502
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:28,000
like, again, I do this stuff for a living. I don't read the. I don't think anybody actually expects that the average consumer is reading.

503
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,670
I mean, we talked about it first semester, but like when you see drug ads on TV,

504
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:40,120
it's like bright colors and people running around being happy and then at the end, they raffle off the side effects as quickly as possible.

505
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:47,320
That's true. And drug ads are explicitly persuasive, like they are shaping not just the informational content,

506
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:54,520
but emotional parts of your experience or the way you think about the average drug ad.

507
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,510
There are attributes of that. So there's emotional content.

508
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:04,640
There's some degree of storytelling and certainly a certain degree of characters pulled into the esthetic.

509
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,820
It's not just abstract information.

510
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,470
You see the person getting on the plane and saying, Oh, yes, I'm not going to worry about my Crohn's disease kind of thing.

511
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:21,010
By the way, this is the kind of stuff we've got to bring in this class. Remember, though, when you're watching videos,

512
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:29,530
when you read stuff and you see an ad take a second and look at it through this lens of, am I going to remember it?

513
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,160
Is it persuasive? What about it is catching my eye, etc.

514
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,540
Let's all be consumers of these kinds of things from here on out.

515
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,710
So. Now let's think about this more broadly from like a.

516
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:56,700
News media perspective. What are the kinds of things that the news media talks about a lot in health?

517
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:05,840
Like what kinds of stories? Get press, get talked about outbreaks, outbreaks.

518
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,640
So things like well, certainly beginning of COVID 19 was a huge news story.

519
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:17,390
Other examples I recently there's been a lot about RSV, especially with children,

520
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,730
young children, where that flu generally gets its time of year interested.

521
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:29,780
We can have an interesting conversation about how much flu gets discussed or not discussed in our public conversation.

522
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:40,340
I would make the argument that the only reason that we got as much about flu this year than we did is because of RSV and because of COVID,

523
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,110
and that the interaction of factors ended up being the thing that made us talk about it.

524
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:52,309
Whereas had it just been a flu, I mean, I think back to the pre-COVID years, there were plenty of years in which like yeah,

525
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:55,520
yeah, there was the messages about it's flu season and go get your flu shot.

526
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,950
But it was not part of the, the, the nightly news kind of level of discussion.

527
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:08,990
What else? Yeah, um, anything that relates to something that's kind of a trend right now.

528
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:15,530
So I see a lot of like news coverage about like consequences of social media, right?

529
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:16,879
Like loneliness or mental health.

530
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:25,940
So, so there'll be a lot of stuff that people are interested in, just like you said, like flu came up because it's a big right now,

531
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:35,990
just like I see that mental health comes up more because we're also just like more in this like tech space and it's new and you know,

532
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:41,540
like for the first time, people are introduced to so much more technology and now we're kind of learning about the concepts.

533
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:47,510
I want to unpack a few things here is technology to mental health.

534
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,410
You know, it's not what? I'm not arguing with you.

535
00:59:52,430 --> 01:00:00,260
There is some framing of the way in which we're talking about the effects of technology on our daily lives.

536
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:08,030
That is turning it into a story that we're talking about for years, like a brief break.

537
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,510
It's not that technology and like mental health is new.

538
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:18,340
I think that it's just in a very different light now than it was like in the past years that technology has existed.

539
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:25,160
Like it's something that I think has blown up tremendously in such a short time compared to how long it's taken before for it to evolve.

540
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:33,380
And with that came Consequences. Health was right where, you know, we kind of see that people get addicted to fall.

541
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:40,480
And then, you know, there's talk later about like being lonely or feeling depressed, but it goes back to like just getting wrapped up into,

542
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:48,650
you know, something that was just like one example of like, well, but I think it's an important example of I'm going to make an argument.

543
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,330
I cannot prove it to you, but I'm going to make an argument and we can debate it moving forward in this course.

544
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:59,930
There are many factors that influence where our attention falls in the health space.

545
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,969
Right now there is a confluence of factors, some of which is about storytelling,

546
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:10,040
some of which is about framing certain things as news, some of which is about the.

547
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:18,620
Specific emotions that I've become salient as we've survived the last two or

548
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:26,080
three years of COVID 19 pandemic that has made that kind of issue more salient,

549
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:29,250
more something we talk about more. Okay.

550
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,060
But it's important for us to acknowledge it's not the mental health services before, it's not the technology effects didn't exist before.

551
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:43,780
And there are plenty of other things out there that are also causing major amounts of health consequences that we are not talking about.

552
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:51,900
When's the last time you saw a news story about asthma? Why talk about the cumulative health and asthma of this population?

553
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:08,520
You spend a lot of time talking about breast cancer. Breast cancer is a very high saliency cancer for reasons which we could get into in

554
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:16,500
great detail the proportion in proportion to the amount of mortality for breast cancer.

555
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:23,710
Most other cancers are vastly under-discussed. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be talking about breast cancer.

556
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,610
Quite the contrary. But I want us to be aware that the.

557
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:37,800
Presence of a particular topic is highly distorted from its presence in terms of the disease burden on society.

558
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:43,920
There are certain things we talk a lot about and there are certain things we talk almost nothing about.

559
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:53,030
And one of the questions we have to ask as communicators is why does that happen and what can we do to change it?

560
01:02:53,610 --> 01:03:01,700
Like, if you're trying to talk about a disease or condition that we don't talk much about, and I'll use asthma as an example, but I don't want to.

561
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,960
This is a broad argument, not not one grounded in that particular condition.

562
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:15,500
What would you want to do as a communicator to get people motivated to attend to that?

563
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,770
To get people to pay attention to the information about. So what would you want to do if, say,

564
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:31,280
you need to communicate to residents of a community with substantial air pollution and hence higher than average asthma risks?

565
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:42,280
What would you do if you wanted to communicate to an individual parent whose child is showing asthma symptoms and who you want to be thinking about?

566
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,670
Whether the environment in which that child lives is contributing to their problem.

567
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:55,359
How much would you be? In this space.

568
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,510
How much would you be in this space with every piece of pushing over here that intentionality about purpose.

569
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:11,740
So one of my big themes in this course in general, but certainly in this course, is communication is an intervention.

570
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:20,610
We are when we are communicating, we are changing someone's life, you know,

571
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:25,050
different than if I gave you a drug or put you under anesthesia for surgery.

572
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:31,410
We are intervening and we ought to do so intentionally.

573
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,750
So let's own our purposes.

574
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:48,070
When we are communicating what we are trying to do so that we can think about what are the unintended consequences of our Internet interventions?

575
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:58,440
What how will we define success? If I'm just communicating the water quality stuff, success might be.

576
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,740
Did you receive a water quality report this year?

577
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:11,370
But it would not be measured by could you tell me the specific tests that were being tested or what the levels were, etc.?

578
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:21,210
On the other hand, if I were talking about. Well, let's go down to the house of exercise pathway.

579
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:29,440
You know. I might want you to work colorectal cancer screening, but I want one measure of success.

580
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,170
If you know that there are multiple different methods of colorectal cancer screening, that would be appropriate.

581
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,930
If you understand that, if you choose colonoscopy, you're going to have one every ten years.

582
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:44,790
But if you choose Cologuard, you're going to need to do the test every three years.

583
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:51,070
That would be information we would want somebody to know in order to make a good decision.

584
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:57,160
And we can measure that and assess the success of our communication by whether or not they know that information or not.

585
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,030
If I wanting to be persuasive. What are we measuring?

586
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:08,399
I might be measuring. How motivated are you?

587
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,799
How likely are you to get a colorectal cancer screening test done? And that measure of actual behavior,

588
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:22,810
but certainly behavioral motivation and emotions and perceptions of risk or perceptions of importance or things like that.

589
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,820
If you're into coercion, pretty much only care about behavior.

590
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:32,380
Like did you evacuate or not take statistics.

591
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,210
But notice are now closing the loop into evaluation.

592
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,200
We're thinking about design and communication.

593
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:52,980
The more that we understand our purpose, the more that we're also deciding what is it that we could measure to evaluate whether or not we succeed?

594
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,070
Let me put it this way. All right, that's enough.

595
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:44,850
Yeah. Remember this?

596
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:50,100
What do you want them to do? Think Warfield.

597
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,430
In the 30 seconds after you communicate.

598
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,390
Not quite that. Not five weeks. Not five years.

599
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,410
What do you want the immediate consequence of your communication to be?

600
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:15,110
You know that. Then we can start to design this.

601
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:23,670
If you're still. You know what? I don't want to be. I want them to know about their birth control options.

602
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:29,190
Thank you. What do you mean? Do you want them to know that there are options?

603
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:36,510
Do you want them to know the specific trade offs between those options? Do you want them to be motivated to have some form of birth control?

604
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:42,090
But let's pick. But you can't do everything.

605
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:58,750
All right. This is a little bit of a.

606
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:04,800
Weird time to be talking about health communication. Little bit less weird than it was two years ago.

607
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:11,670
Like doing telecom courses in 2020 with just no other word for it.

608
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:17,450
It's just weird. But now we're in this interim space.

609
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:22,130
We're still many of us wearing masks are changing our behaviors in different ways.

610
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:29,659
Health is certainly something we get bombarded with messages about on an ongoing basis, and yet in many ways,

611
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:38,000
we are trying to shift back to a work life in which not every moment of our life is dictated by health messages.

612
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:51,870
So again, I want you to be. So I don't pay attention to what he attempted to.

613
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:58,920
Pay attention to what you reject. Really pay attention to messages that [INAUDIBLE] you off.

614
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,580
You'll get them. I guarantee you, when you start paying attention to this, you'll start to realize, like, why?

615
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:11,240
Why are they doing that? Please feel free to bring it in to this chorus.

616
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:17,060
Situations in which you think the health messages have gone too far. I have some really good examples.

617
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:29,160
Of of messages where I just. It just pissed me off. There's no other word for really to bring in situations in which you think somebody.

618
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:34,690
That was just not paying attention to who they were trying to speak to.

619
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:38,670
So we don't talk as much today about audience.

620
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,830
Today is about purpose. What are you trying to do?

621
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,680
But of course, purpose is connected to audience.

622
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:57,460
What I might be trying to communicate about a particular topic is different when I'm talking to you than when I am talking to my parents,

623
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:01,240
for example, or someone who is.

624
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,410
I'm just trying to help them make their own personal health decisions.

625
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:16,120
So I haven't even gotten into the questions of demographic characteristics or cultural variations and things where

626
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:22,480
the same message might need to be framed in different ways in order to be resonant with a particular audience.

627
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:31,810
We'll talk about that to some degree in this course, too. But this is this is the kind of discussion we often have in this class.

628
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:38,380
Bring your examples. Challenge yourself to think about where does this fall?

629
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:43,150
Notice that I'm pushing many times to get very concrete.

630
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:51,080
So when we started early on with the whole thing about mammography and how the media reaction was, okay, there is not one mammography communication.

631
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,499
There are many different audiences. There are many different communications.

632
01:11:53,500 --> 01:12:00,760
So we've got to separate them to understand what I would say to a 40 year old woman and what I would say to a 55 year old woman.

633
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:07,830
What do I say to an 80 year old woman? What if my is.

634
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:23,090
You know, stories of stupid health communications was the story of my wife's grandmother at I want to say like 92 in a doctor's appointment,

635
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:29,150
a preoperative doctor's appointment before about getting implanted with a pacemaker.

636
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:37,410
And in fact, after when our last mammogram was, she went, I don't know what we need to know this.

637
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:40,730
No, you don't. She was 92.

638
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,470
There was no context under which she was going to be getting a mammogram. It was a ridiculous conversation.

639
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:52,960
And that to me strikes me as another example of a communication that didn't think about its purpose in lives.

640
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:58,420
It was just, Oh, we always ask this, so I'm going to ask this. No, there was no purpose to that.

641
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:07,440
So the conversation about mammography is legitimately very different messages,

642
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,120
even if it's the same content, very different messages for different people at different stages of life.

643
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,640
All right. I got 7 minutes left, but I'll break it there.

644
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:35,720
What I'm going to do in every class then are pull out one of two things sticking us out of four.

645
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:54,320
I'm going to write what stop today? And then I turn back to you and I'm going to ask you, what do you want to remember today?

646
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,490
You mean short phrases, words, things?

647
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:18,709
What do you want to remember? That communication is an intervention that is good for you, by the way.

648
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,900
You don't get to leave till this is filled. Yeah.

649
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:55,860
This form involves interaction with information. But any intentionality about purpose and crystal specificity about purpose.

650
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:04,830
Sorry. Your name is Crystal? Yes. Thank you. Brand did not process Crystal.

651
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:10,210
My name is Crystal. Yes. Specificity about purpose.

652
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:21,580
Positive about purpose. Good. Yeah.

653
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,250
I'm going to keep up the test result.

654
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,209
One, because I'm in the genetic counseling space.

655
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:33,270
I was trying really hard to think about ways in which it could be and other things, but it really is in the persuade category.

656
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:43,800
First of all, which way I'm going to tend to condense these for the purposes of these notes, etc.?

657
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:49,080
Yeah, think critically as we see these communications in our life.

658
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:59,370
I'm just going to condense this to think critically. That's. For.

659
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:05,690
Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Have measures of success. Measures of success.

660
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:14,160
Good. Yeah.

661
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:19,300
MRSA. And you persuade your coworkers when you know the right thing is.

662
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,680
One more. Yeah. Taking a stance.

663
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:47,860
Take a stance. Very good.

664
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:55,250
All right. So. We're past it for next time.

665
01:16:55,710 --> 01:17:07,430
One, If you have not ordered the book or the book, you will read it quickly to you not have to do music for the next class.

666
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:12,260
You will have to go on for the first week of the next class.

667
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:26,360
Reminder you must prepare a 62nd persuasive speech about whether Lyme disease should be a public health priority in the state of Michigan.

668
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:30,440
You may use the documents I have given you. You may completely ignore the documents.

669
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,360
You may look up whatever you want to call your new constraints.

670
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:40,820
But the only thing that matters to you is persuasiveness.

671
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:47,480
What do you think will be persuasive when you share your speech with in small groups?

672
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,400
On Tuesday's class. The only thing we're looking for. The minder.

673
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,060
Your incentive is really good chocolate. All right.
