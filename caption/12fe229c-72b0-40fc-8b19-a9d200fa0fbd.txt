Hello, this is Peter Jacobson.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,250
We're continuing now with our discussion
of the US healthcare delivery system.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,845
Let's turn to how
the system is structured.

4
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:23,549
Three entities generally are responsible
for delivering healthcare.

5
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:27,270
First, you would go to a physician.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,974
A physician is normally your first
contact for getting healthcare.

7
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:38,890
If needed, you might go to a hospital for
inpatient care.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,620
Another point of entry would be
through a managed care organization.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,830
What distinguishes a managed care
organization is that it's an entity

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:57,170
that combines the insurance and healthcare
delivery functions into one organization.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,120
Some of them are known as health
maintenance organizations.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,780
And health maintenance organizations
can either employ physicians or

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,630
contract with independent physician
practice associations, IPAs.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,743
If we look at the pyramid
from the bottom to the top,

15
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:23,840
it gives you a sense of how
we think about the structure.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,157
Health promotion is generally
a function provided by the public

17
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:33,695
health system that delivers
education to the public.

18
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:39,206
Primary care is general acute
care when if you get sick,

19
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:43,311
if you have the flu, you get coverage from

20
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:48,254
a primary care physician or
other practitioner.

21
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:53,893
Community hospitals are just
hospitals that provide primary and

22
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:57,440
secondary care, inpatient care.

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,753
Tertiary hospitals are defined as
hospitals that have more specialized care,

24
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:07,708
and can provide special services for
cancer, for

25
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:13,480
cardiology, for
other high-technology problems.

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,916
Academic medical centers provide
the most complex care and

27
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,294
tend to be very highly specialized.

28
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:27,304
So if we look at the structure in
a little more detail, we can start

29
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:33,410
with health systems, sometimes known
as integrated delivery systems.

30
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,698
Health systems really tend to be
comprised of multiple hospitals.

31
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:47,720
So for example, the Trinity Healthcare
System has about 100 hospitals.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,290
Catholic Health Initiatives and Catholic
Health West also have about that many.

33
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,492
But you can have smaller
integrated systems, for example,

34
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:02,782
any number of systems from
four to ten hospitals.

35
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:08,660
And these systems can be
integrated in two ways.

36
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Horizontally, so you notice the bar
with the building across here means

37
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,030
that you have multiple hospitals and
outpatient facilities.

38
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,870
So you have not just one hospital,

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,530
not just one outpatient facility,
but a number of them.

40
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,040
You can also be integrated vertically.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
And that would mean that you have,
in addition to the hospital,

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,880
you would have a rehabilitation center.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,862
You could have a post-acute care facility,

44
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:49,063
after a patient is released
from the hospital.

45
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:53,393
And then on the bottom the bed
would be long-term care,

46
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:56,490
a nursing home, for example.

47
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,728
So you have integrated health systems
as one part of the structure.

48
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:05,755
Second part is what I
mentioned before that most

49
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:10,091
healthcare is provided on a fee for
service basis.

50
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:15,416
So you have commercial insurance plans,
Etna, Blue Cross Blue Shield

51
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:21,560
as commercial insurers, and
you have preferred provider organizations.

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,130
And what those do is that they
provide healthcare physician services

53
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,790
to the health system, or as part of
the health system, at a lower cost.

54
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,170
The preferred providers negotiate
a lower rate of reimbursement

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,300
in return for
more patients that they can serve.

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,687
Now one difference between
the fee-for-service system and

57
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,790
managed care is that in
a managed care system,

58
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,910
you pay a monthly premium,
insurance premium for all of your care.

59
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,635
So you don't pay on a fee for
service basis.

60
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:06,680
So managed care systems
are designed to provide the highest

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,650
quality of care at the lowest cost and
at the lowest level needed.

62
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,998
The incentives in managed care are,
therefore,

63
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:22,222
very different from the incentives
in the fee-for-service system.

64
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:27,663
Now one way in which the system
has consolidated is through

65
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:33,270
joint ventures between hospitals and
physicians.

66
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,080
They can be for
specialty care centers such as cardiology,

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,600
nuclear imaging, or cancer.

68
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,719
And you have a joint venture
designed between the hospitals and

69
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:49,062
physicians who provide that care.

70
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:53,833
Another entity for doing that is
an accountable care organization,

71
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,049
which emerged out of
the Affordable Care Act.

72
00:05:57,049 --> 00:06:02,729
In an accountable care organization,
physicians in the hospitals

73
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,222
are given incentives to
provide care at a lower cost.

74
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:12,872
When they do so, they save money,
and they share in the savings.
