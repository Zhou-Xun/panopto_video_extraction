1
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:15,224
on case cohort and density sampling as the two key forms of nested case control study designs.

2
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,224
So in the previous session,

3
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:24,224
we talked about cumulative sampling and case control studies in the lives room session will introduce case cross over designs,

4
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,224
which is a special type of case control study.

5
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:34,224
But right now, I'd like to focus on case cohort sampling and incidence density, otherwise known as risk set sampling.

6
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:43,224
These are really fun and interesting study designs. And together they are both forms of nested case control, study designs.

7
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:47,224
So what do we mean by nested case control study designs?

8
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:58,224
Well, it's simply that a nested case control study is nested within a well enumerated and existing source or base population.

9
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,224
This is often an ongoing epidemiological cohort study.

10
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:09,224
It can also be a population based disease registry with a census enumeration of the population served by the registry,

11
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:16,224
which would allow us to identify the cases that are comparable to the controls arising through the disease registry.

12
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:24,224
Another creative way of doing this would be to use data from a cancer screening program that has a defined source population.

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,224
So, for example, as cases of cancer are detected and diagnosed through the screening program,

14
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:34,224
you could identify controls who are also going through the screening program but

15
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:40,224
who test negative for the screening test and are not diagnosed with the cancer.

16
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:48,224
So let's go through each of these two types of nested case control sampling designs.

17
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:54,224
In case cohort sampling, controls are randomly selected from those who are at risk of the

18
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:01,224
outcome at the beginning of the cohort follow up regardless of their exposure status.

19
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:09,224
And this last part of the definition here, regardless of their exposure status, is key to a valid case control study design,

20
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:17,224
because we never, ever want selection into a case control study to be dependent on exposure status.

21
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:23,224
OK. We are always selecting on the basis of the outcome in a case control study.

22
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:34,224
So in case cohort sampling, each person in this pre-existing, well-defined cohort has an equal chance of becoming a control.

23
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:37,224
Here are the controls are not individually matched to cases.

24
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:47,224
We are randomly sampling these controls from the baseline of the cohort or the beginning of the follow up, regardless of exposure status.

25
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:54,224
And this is a logical way to conduct a case control study when we wish to estimate incidence proportions and risk ratios.

26
00:02:54,224 --> 00:03:02,224
So one thing that you might have intuited here is that because we are selecting the cohorts at the beginning of the study follow up,

27
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:09,224
we are able to follow individuals in the cohort regardless of their case or eventual case status.

28
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:13,224
So regardless of their control status or eventual case status for incidents.

29
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:20,224
So we are going to follow this cohort forward and identify cases as they arise.

30
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:27,224
And this is what this looks like. So on the left hand side of the image, rather than having a hypothetical cohort,

31
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:32,224
which is what we thought about with respect to cumulative sampling in case control studies,

32
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,224
we now have a real well enumerated cohort that we're sampling from.

33
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:42,224
And so ignoring everything on the right hand side of this figure, just looking at the box on the left hand side,

34
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:51,224
which represents this cohort at its baseline, we would randomly sample from this cohort to select our controls.

35
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:56,224
And that's indicated by the dark shaded rectangle that is highlighted within this box.

36
00:03:56,224 --> 00:04:04,224
And then kind of brought forward, indicated by the dashed line to represent our control group.

37
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:11,224
We then follow the cohort forward to see who develops the disease outcome of interest.

38
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:18,224
And these are indicated by the arrows that go along this diagonally decreasing line.

39
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:26,224
So the arrows that the dash lines end in an arrow represent cases who do not make it into our case control study.

40
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,224
Either they die or they refuse to take part.

41
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:39,224
Just as in the previous example, the dashed lines that end in a circle followed by a long, flat, solid line with an arrow

42
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:46,224
are those cases that occur that make it into our study and form the case group.

43
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:56,224
And so this ultimately gives us a set of incident cases to compare with the controls that we sampled from at the start of the study

44
00:04:56,224 --> 00:05:07,224
follow up. So let's run through some of the other aspects of controls or attributes of controls in case cohort designs.

45
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:12,224
One question you might be asking is, can the controls become cases?

46
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:18,224
And the answer is yes. So we will randomly select our controls at the start of the study, follow up.

47
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:24,224
But those individuals who were selected to be controls can also become cases later

48
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:30,224
on if they end up developing the outcome of interest during the follow up period.

49
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:36,224
Another really cool aspect of this study design is that the controls that we randomly select from the

50
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:42,224
cohort at the beginning of follow up can actually serve as control groups for different sets of cases.

51
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:48,224
So we can follow the cohort forward to identify multiple different types of outcomes

52
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:53,224
we're interested in and we can use that same control group for those outcomes.

53
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:58,224
This makes case-cohort designs efficient and multi-purpose.

54
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:05,224
Another nice aspect of this design is that even if we extend the follow up time, we can still use the same set of controls.

55
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:14,224
So the set of controls that we identify at the start of the study will be valid for use regardless of the length of the follow up time.

56
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:21,224
And another great aspect is that we can calculate the prevalence of exposures in the cases or, sorry,

57
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:27,224
in the controls because the controls are representative of the underlying cohort.

58
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,224
And finally, one more aspect,

59
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:37,224
which I didn't actually write out here that is really valuable is that we are assessing the exposure before assessing the outcome.

60
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:46,224
So this reduces any likelihood of recall bias, which is a common problem in cumulative sampling and case control studies.

61
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:56,224
So recall that in cumulative sampling we assess we recruit our cases and then we recruit our controls at the same time as our cases.

62
00:06:56,224 --> 00:07:03,224
And then we ask both the cases and controls to recall the retrospective exposure histories.

63
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:08,224
And as you can imagine, there can be error and bias in people's memory and recall.

64
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:12,224
However, when we do a nested case cohort design,

65
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:19,224
we assess the exposure at the start of the cohort and then we follow the cases and controls forward for their outcomes.

66
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:26,224
So the case cohort design is strong in establishing temporality.

67
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:35,224
The other type of nested case control design uses what's called incidence density or risk set sampling.

68
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,224
In this method,

69
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:47,224
the controls are a sample of individuals who are at risk for the disease outcome at the exact time that each case develops the disease.

70
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:54,224
And this sampling method looks like this. So, again, we are sampling from a real well enumerated cohort.

71
00:07:54,224 --> 00:08:01,224
So not a hypothetical cohort. And we follow that cohort forward as cases arise.

72
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:05,224
And this is indicated using the same arrows as in the previous example.

73
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:11,224
They, of course, form the case group, but at each time point when a case arises,

74
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:19,224
we then immediately select a comparable control from that underlying cohort which serves as the base population.

75
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:28,224
So as you can see, for these four individuals who become cases, we have selected a control at the exact same point in time.

76
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:33,224
So you can see how the controls, in a way, are incident alongside the cases.

77
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:41,224
They just don't have the outcome of interest. We can also do this in a dynamic population.

78
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:48,224
So, so far we have been discussing closed cohorts or closed populations which are followed forward over time.

79
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:51,224
And no new individuals are added to the cohort.

80
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:57,224
And this is clear because the size of the cohort, which is indicated by the white rectangle, becomes smaller over time.

81
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:03,224
But we can also add new population members and sample from them in a dynamic population.

82
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:14,224
So we can do density or risk set sampling in both a closed or a dynamic cohort or population.

83
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:21,224
So a few more details on density sampling cases are compared with a subset of what we call the risk set.

84
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:27,224
That is the cohort members who are at risk at the time when the case occurs.

85
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,224
Of course, these are the controls.

86
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:38,224
But this is why we also refer to this as risk set sampling, because this is another phrase for the controls in this type of method.

87
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:46,224
Another important note here is that density sampling is the equivalent of matching cases and controls on the duration of follow up.

88
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:51,224
And this is because we pull controls from our underlying source population

89
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:59,224
at the same time that a case occurs. This requires analytic methods to account for matching, which is actually very straightforward to do.

90
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:09,224
We will discuss matching in a later class session. And similar to the case cohort design, the controls may later develop the disease outcome.

91
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:14,224
And if this happens, this means they can act as both a control and a case.

92
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:25,224
And we can also select the same control more than once as a control when we are selecting controls on an ongoing basis as the cases develop.

93
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,224
Here's an example of a density case control study in this study.

94
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:36,224
The investigators looked at the relationship between low to moderate alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk by age 50 years

95
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:41,224
among women in Germany. Here's how they sampled their controls.

96
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:48,224
So they used a disease registry for the cases and then they here's how they selected controls.

97
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:53,224
They say, controls are selected from random lists of residents supplied by the population.

98
00:10:53,224 --> 00:11:01,224
Registries for every recruited patient to controls were matched according to exact age and study region were immediately contacted by letter.

99
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:09,224
So they're matching these controls based on time whereby they are recruiting a control at the exact same time that a patient is recruited.

100
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:15,224
And there is an additional layer of matching here where they are matching the controls based on age and steady region.

101
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:25,224
The reason for this is that they may want to reduce or minimize any potential confounding in the relationship based on age and geography.

102
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:30,224
And here's a really nice summary of these three case control sampling methods.

103
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:37,224
Let's go over them very briefly. I would also recommend hanging onto this slide to review after the class session.

104
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:45,224
So in cumulative sampling, the controls are selected at the end of a hypothetical follow up period in which the cases occur.

105
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:50,224
The cases are prevalent at the time at which the case control study is conducted.

106
00:11:50,224 --> 00:12:01,224
And this means that there may be a potential for selection bias because the cases, of course, have survived to the time of the study start.

107
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:07,224
And in the cumulative sampling method, the odds ratio approximates the risk ratio

108
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:11,224
under the rare disease assumption.

109
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:19,224
In the case cohort sampling method, the controls are randomly selected at the start of the follow up of an ongoing cohort.

110
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:24,224
People who are selected to be controls can later on become cases if they develop the outcome.

111
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:31,224
The case cohort sampling method has a lower potential for selection bias than the cumulative sampling method because incident,

112
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:39,224
not prevalent cases are selected. And we know that the controls are coming from the same base population as the cases,

113
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:44,224
which can be a little bit more challenging to do in the cumulative sampling method.

114
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,224
In the case cohort method,

115
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:54,224
we can estimate incidence and risk ratios and the risk ratio approximates the odds ratio without the rare disease assumption being needed.

116
00:12:54,224 --> 00:13:03,224
And finally, in the incidence density or risk set sampling method, the controls are selected at the exact same time at which a case occurs.

117
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:08,224
The cases are matched to the controls on the basis of follow up time and again,

118
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:13,224
controls can later become cases if they develop the outcome of interest.

119
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:21,224
The incidence density sampling method, again, has a lower potential for selection bias compared to the cumulative sampling method,

120
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:28,224
because, again, the we know that the controls do represent the same base population as cases.

121
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:34,224
And because we are collecting incident cases as they occur and not prevalent cases.

122
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:37,224
This method allows us to estimate incidence

123
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:44,224
density and incidence density ratios for the outcome and the incidence density ratio approximates the odds ratio.

124
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:49,224
Without the rare disease assumption being needed. That's it for Part Five.

125
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:57,224
The next is Part Six, in which we will review case control designs. This is happening in the Live Zoom Lecture on Thursday, October 1st,

126
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:00,420
From ten thirty to twelve o'clock Eastern Time.
