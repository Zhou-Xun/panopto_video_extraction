1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,420
It's not like I like where I live.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,930
Yeah. Yeah, to my daughters. Okay. I know, but it's going to be.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,110
Yeah, I think, like, oh, yeah, once she goes to school.

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:43,190
So I just never know which is offering to buy.

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,790
This is like I like there.

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,680
So it's like I would say some of them are.

7
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,670
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

8
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,779
Yeah. Yeah. I really like I like really try to buy now.

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:17,970
Before I was like, I guess like, yeah, I mean because I don't like people that I know those people.

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:33,600
Yeah. So funny. I don't know. Everyone's like you can, you can get access to any kind of a two minute Williamsburg question slides.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,870
And then I realized when I was doing, I was like, really, really going to be like quest for this answer was yes.

12
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,069
And I don't even have any good means to do like fall.

13
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,520
But then it's just it was so played out. So anyway, this exact okay.

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,620
So today we're going to continue our conversation about depression.

15
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:02,340
So the conversation today is going to focus on the idea of culture and how it relates

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,840
to the expression of distress and sort of how that looks in parts of the world.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,430
And also interesting, any particular issues, small talk about culture, substantial risk,

18
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:22,110
what you're just as a reminder on Monday, you do have a reflection piece that is due by Friday.

19
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:30,030
So please make sure you get that in. And as another reminder, your annotated photography is due on the question.

20
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,320
That's coming up. All right.

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,940
So the first thing to say is that. I cannot.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,860
This topic is far beyond the scope of my lecture, far beyond the scope of my class.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,800
People go to school for many years to understand what culture is and sort of how to bless you.

24
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,860
So I'm going to we are going to have like the most primitive, no kind of set version of of this.

25
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,390
But it's important that I at least introduce some of the ideas that we're going to talk about.

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,310
But I just want to say at the very top that I'm not going to be able to do a complete sort of discussion of this this really complex topic.

27
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,270
But in general, there are two ways to kind of think about how culture relates to mental health.

28
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,870
The first is culture or changes in culture as a risk or protective factor for culture as

29
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,560
a lens through which mental distress or emotional distress is expressed and explained.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,690
So not just sort of like the symptoms that people talk about, but sort of the causal models, the beliefs models that they they used to operate.

31
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,980
So there's two different two different ideas. All right. So what is culture again?

32
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,149
This is a very impoverished definition and discussion of it.

33
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,810
But we can we should sort of, I guess, to have a common working definition for the purposes of today's lecture.

34
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,060
It is the transmitted scripts for living and ascribing meaning to experiences.

35
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:13,700
So this is something that we sort of understand much very relatively implicitly.

36
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:22,580
If the way that first culture's scripts get transmitted and get sort of operate in our

37
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,830
daily lives is defined by things like values and attitudes and beliefs and values.

38
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,879
It is conceptually distinct from things like race and ethnicity and social class,

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,590
although oftentimes in our data those are sort of the things that we need to examine culture in relation to.

40
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,319
But as you said, it is distinct from that and it's also important to note that all social groups have culture,

41
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,920
so there is no room for white sort of cultures.

42
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,529
Immigrant groups have cultures, native born have culture.

43
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,530
Like there is no there's no social group that does not have transmitted scripts for meeting every single group.

44
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:13,060
That's and so even though we make culture make a little bit more in discussions of like what they are example is going to be focused on or steamier,

45
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,889
which is where to talk about Southeast Asia.

46
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,510
But that doesn't mean that there is not Western culture and even then the three Western cultures is probably a better way to describe that.

47
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,680
So when if you were if you like me as an epidemiologist,

48
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,530
if you wanted to develop a research program that was around understanding how culture relates to mental health,

49
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,469
unfortunately you would have like relatively impoverished measures to kind of even begin this

50
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,940
exercise because most of our large surveys data that I show you are kind of exceptions to that.

51
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,030
But most of our large surveys don't actually measure the things that I just told you about the beliefs and values, etc.

52
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,829
So instead, what we often have are things like measures of social identity.

53
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,940
But even then they're not like asked in terms of like social identity.

54
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,590
They're just sort of like, which race are you? Check all that apply.

55
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:16,350
But that matters because race in our country and in many other countries both indicates a shared history of a shared kind of moral history,

56
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,130
but is also correlated with availability of resources.

57
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:31,110
Another variable you might have in your data is migration status. So oftentimes that's were you born here or not if you were born here but you're not.

58
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,610
Were your parents born here or not? And then country of origin.

59
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:43,400
If you're really lucky, you pass. Two are things that are often not included, but if you have them there, they're fantastic.

60
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,760
So language spoken and not just language spoken in general, but language spoken in different settings.

61
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:56,900
So you might speak a different language at home than what you do at work or what you do in school and and then experiences of discrimination.

62
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,930
So these are you know, discrimination is a really interesting thing to discuss in relation to culture because

63
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,390
one could argue that discriminating against racial minorities is like part of culture,

64
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,889
right? That's like a thing that like culture is doing in the West, for example.

65
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:21,150
And so but oftentimes the person we're asking about that is the person who's experiencing the discrimination,

66
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,460
not the person, not the groups that are that are perpetrating discrimination.

67
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:34,200
And this may not of course not is not really just race, but also things like gender identity transitions to have a successful.

68
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,430
So. So that's if I'm lucky, I've got these two.

69
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,290
I typically have the first two, but none of those are really these like the elements,

70
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,610
what we think are being sort of most relevant to mental health, certainly not in relation to protective factors.

71
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,829
And so the elements that we do think are related and there's begun with the caveat that there's

72
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,680
limited data on these from kind of like large scale settings or things like familial ism,

73
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,649
which is actually a tendency to be more family oriented.

74
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,690
So people like, well, endorse values of like wanting a large family or having a large family or kin network,

75
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,590
the importance of family, the ideas around loyalty and reciprocity.

76
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,760
You can compare that to actual communalism, which again would be the value of interpersonal relationships or interpersonal dependency.

77
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,270
You can get both of these to, you know,

78
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,770
norms that are a little bit more prominent or that are more prominent in the United States, which would be independence.

79
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,830
Right. That's a that's a value that we have is Americans. Right. The idea that you can you don't rely on others, that you are self-made.

80
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,960
These are these are American. Those are examples of American values.

81
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,209
Now, it doesn't mean that every American shares those values and to the same degree, but that is that's sort of the default experience.

82
00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:01,070
And then you are actions in it. That is, it's not the default, but that that is a more common orientation to the world, to the American.

83
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,870
For an America, fatalism is the belief that one's destiny is beyond his or her control.

84
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:13,159
And so the notion that what what is the value or what is the role of personal control outcomes?

85
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,729
And then you can imagine also and many of you in this class are doing projects

86
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,559
related to religiosity or even spirituality as a component of cultural identity.

87
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:30,860
So, you know, you may be Muslim, you may be white black families from the Middle East or from Southeast Asia, for example.

88
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,320
You know, people who self-identify as Roman Catholic may have a different sort of.

89
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,320
But that's part of the cultural identity of different this distinctive part of cultural identity.

90
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,080
So but oftentimes we don't have these measures, but these are examples of aspects that we can develop.

91
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,720
So now the fact like, why would you why why are we having this conversation?

92
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,290
Well, the reason we're having this conversation is that mood and anxiety disorders vary just like every other health condition,

93
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,059
like vary place to place. And so that this graph has got way too many colors.

94
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,000
But I mean, it shouldn't be too many colors, but it's hard to read.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,829
But the areas that are red have more for depression than areas that are green, kind of more cooler colors.

96
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:26,489
And so you can see in America where we're kind of at the lower end of year level depression relative to some parts of Asia and parts of Africa,

97
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,330
with the caveat that there's actually not a lot of great data in most of the continent of Africa, in the continent of South America.

98
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:41,370
But it kind of, you know, the fact that we see all this variation in and of itself sort of begins to suggest, like, well, why?

99
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:48,719
Why might that be? Another way that we can think about this is in terms that was in the years lived with depression.

100
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,710
This is just that this is another way to think about culture.

101
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,280
The idea that culture might play into what depression looks like across different places.

102
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,849
This is variation in the female to male ratio, the gender ratio in depression.

103
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:07,480
And so what where so United States here the ratio is about two and a half to one, right?

104
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,740
So women are about two and a half times more likely to have depression relative to men.

105
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:20,940
But that's not true everywhere. And, you know, if you look in places like Taiwan or Lebanon, the ratio is is much smaller.

106
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,230
Right. And so the the and it's it's not that this in and of itself provides the explanation, but it suggests that,

107
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,260
like, this could be something to look into that's like, why would why would the gender ratio matter?

108
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,219
What is what is it about gender and how that's expressed or experienced in these different

109
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,760
cultures that are these different places that might have something to do with culture?

110
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,600
And then again without procrastination. So I'm giving you this a little bit more data.

111
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,110
So this is the prevalence of anxiety disorders from the world Mental Health Surveys is a series of surveys that,

112
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,840
despite the name, did not cover the whole world. It covered these parts of the world.

113
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,990
I covered a lot of Europe, it covered a lot of North America or the Americas.

114
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,299
And we had three two sites in the Middle East and Africa and three sites in Asia.

115
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,660
So with the caveat that is not actually the world, what do we see?

116
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:20,120
So we see that in the US here, the lifetime or 12 months prior, prevalence of any anxiety disorder is about 19% or 18% here.

117
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,320
You can compare that to less than half in Mexico.

118
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:32,810
Okay. I should also say that all of these survey instruments were given in the native language or local language,

119
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,689
okay, that they were with, they were translated back, translated.

120
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,489
And so, yes, it is the case that like depression may sort of look different in other places,

121
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,550
but they've tried to control for that by having a standardized instrument that is being asked in culturally relevant terms.

122
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:55,010
So we don't think that's the reason why this these numbers are so different down here in Middle Eastern Africa and Nigeria,

123
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,340
this part of the world, we see that, for example, prevalence of anxiety scores about 11% in Lebanon, only 3% in Nigeria.

124
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,749
And then down here in Asia, for Japan at 5%, Beijing and Shanghai are about 3%.

125
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,889
So again, indicative that there might be again, this type of data says, well, maybe culture is as relevant to why there's so much variation.

126
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,020
How do we have 18% in the United States and 3.2% of Asian?

127
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,330
You see the same variation in mood disorder. So here it's even lower.

128
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:34,770
So in Shanghai, the prevalence of this is depression, and minor depression is only 1.7%.

129
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,850
Right, which is very, very well in the United States, relative to United States, where we have about 9%.

130
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:50,690
So that so again, we we see evidence across different nations, even within nations, that this is now within the United States.

131
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,350
There's there's differences in prevalence. We talked about this a little bit on Monday already.

132
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,280
So again, the across the x axis are non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, the United States.

133
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,879
The Y axis is the lifetime prevalence of any of these conditions.

134
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:13,180
And you can see that what I told you on Monday, that non-Hispanic whites typically have worse or report more conditions or worse,

135
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,660
are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for really anything that's in the DSM,

136
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,700
with the exception being post-traumatic stress disorder, which in this graph would have been represented by the anxiety disorders.

137
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,259
But this is any anxiety disorder, so whites are more likely to experience panic disorder.

138
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:37,640
And so, for example. So I also showed you this though, that we can now look within group.

139
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,750
So looking at and I showed you this graph before showing you the difference

140
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,750
between the prevalence of this is the prevalence of depression as a function now,

141
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,209
not of race, which is what this graph is, but as of ethnicity and shared history.

142
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,770
So African-Americans versus people who are either have migrated to the United States from

143
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,799
the Caribbean or whose families have migrated to the United States from the Caribbean.

144
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,410
So they may be second or third generation. Okay.

145
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:11,270
And so we can see that the prevalence of depression is higher among Caribbean blacks relative to African-Americans, both in lifetime and 12 months.

146
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,500
And we also and I showed you this before, but that is this is the gender difference here.

147
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,089
So for African-Americans, prevalence of depression on men is about 7% and 13% among women.

148
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:30,360
But for people who identify as being from the Caribbean, it's 12.6% for men and 13.1% for women.

149
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,410
So again, we see much higher prevalence of depression among black men relative to African-American men,

150
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,809
which produces a gender ratio that's basically zero or one part of our generation is one a gender

151
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,080
difference at zero relative to the 2 to 2 one ratio that we that we see among African-Americans.

152
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,760
And again, this is not in and of itself telling us what it is that's driving this.

153
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,490
But it's indicative that there you know, this is a group leader, groups of people who are in America.

154
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,489
They are all self-identify as being black and but they are very different ethnicities.

155
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,920
They have very different histories. They may speak different languages, whether at home or, you know, etc.

156
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,120
So it's important to sort of again, in these types of data.

157
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,009
This is from the National Survey of American Life, which was conducted here at the University of Michigan.

158
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,830
Are necessary to even to where to ask these questions. Right. Because without before this study, we really had no idea what was going on here.

159
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,050
So that was my experience out of my sight.

160
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,260
So these are two studies that were both conducted here at the University of Michigan for the National Survey of American Life.

161
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,060
This is a study that James Jackson led. For those of you who watched his lecture, I think it was a couple of weeks ago.

162
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,000
You know, he launched both the National Survey of Black Americans,

163
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,100
which was the first nationally representative survey of black Americans, as the name implies, in the seventies.

164
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:59,660
And then he led the National Survey of American Life, which is the study of African Americans, Caribbean blacks and whites who live in census tracts.

165
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,870
They're at least 10% white, are sorry, 10% African-American.

166
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,910
And then the National Latino and Asian-American survey also conducted here at the University of Michigan.

167
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,290
This, again, as the name implies,

168
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:18,080
is a nationally representative sample of Latinos and Asian-Americans and included people from lots of different nationalities.

169
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:28,280
So for Asian-Americans, that included Filipinos, people from Vietnam, China, Korea, Japan, several different places.

170
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,790
So really being able to look within the purpose of these both of these studies was to

171
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:38,920
look within groups to to understand cultural factors that are publicly available.

172
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,380
So if you ever got excited about this, you can just go to this website and.

173
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,880
So just to summarize, as we have a preamble, there is variation,

174
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,900
and that variation exists across big, big sort of dimensions like geography, like nations.

175
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,610
It exists across racial groups and it exists across ethnic groups, within racial groups.

176
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,750
And I didn't show you this data, but there's also form to understand these there's potential for these variations to change over time.

177
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:15,210
But the reasons for this variation are not well understood. But in general, regardless of sort of what is underneath the height of them,

178
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:21,120
it really does challenge our standard sort of narrative about health disparities,

179
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,779
because there is not evidence from epidemiologic studies that racial ethnic

180
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,060
minorities in the United States have worse mental health than non-Hispanic whites.

181
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:37,350
So this is not an example of where that is in contrast to things like risk of cardiovascular disease or risk of diabetes or risk of most cancers,

182
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,500
which are higher among racial ethnic minorities in the United States. And so it really does sort of ask us to read,

183
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:53,190
understand or understand better or what is how disadvantage status is relating to health as it relates to mental health.

184
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,410
So let me pause there for questions or preamble.

185
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,430
So let's talk about the first way that I mean, I'm going to give an example of the first way that I talk about culture may relate to mental health,

186
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:28,110
and that is culture as a risk or protective factor in the sense that, you know, stress is a risk or protective factor.

187
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,400
So the way that most of these studies have been conducted is they started taking advantage of this.

188
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,540
The problem is, is that you can't, like, randomize people to different cultures.

189
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,730
Right? Like, this is not something like how do we even measure that exposure or how do we index it in?

190
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,060
The way that most of these studies have been done is through migration studies.

191
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,900
Okay. So these are taking people these are looking at people who have migrated from one place to another place, or the culture is very different.

192
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,469
And then the argument is that, well, if the mental health outcomes of the people after they migrate are different,

193
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,710
then the mental health outcomes of the native born population that they've migrated to.

194
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,400
This is indicative something. This tells us something about culture.

195
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,910
Or if the mental health outcomes of the immigrants are different from the mental health outcomes of the culture or the places they came from.

196
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,260
This tells us something about the process of changing culture and it relates to mental health.

197
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,970
So our goal is to again assess the influence of environmental change on health.

198
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,250
We have to make this big assumption that people who migrate are similar to those who don't.

199
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,850
Now, of course, this is not true. I was straight up not true.

200
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,050
So, you know, I haven't done any of your family members or yourselves have immigrated to the United States.

201
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,170
What is that process like? Super easy, right? So what do you know about that process?

202
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,780
If it was. How people get here.

203
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,660
Yeah, but it's like really, really long and complicated and random things can happen.

204
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,479
Like, you know, I know, like my parents, like, oh, yeah, they just told us they like lost the paperwork or anything.

205
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,350
And so it set us back like seven months. They were just like, Sorry, we don't have it.

206
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,140
Even they submitted it. So it's like a really tedious and it's not really meant to be accessible.

207
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,160
So it's.

208
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,880
Would you say that you sort of need to really be persistent and kind of have a lot of, like strong support networks to get through that process?

209
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,760
Right. So it's going to be selecting for people who are better mental health.

210
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,680
What I'm going through that kind of that type of visa process.

211
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,110
What how else do people get to the United States? Oh, it's my. You get here. Yeah.

212
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,360
It's like it's really dependent on, like, your work status and like class status.

213
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,780
So, like, you need to be making a certain income, like show that you are eligible.

214
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,040
Yeah. Yeah. How else do people get here if they're not coming for work?

215
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,530
How do they get here? Yeah, like I came for, like, a student.

216
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,970
Student? Okay. Yeah, but we also. My parents want to come one.

217
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:15,150
That's a 911. It set us back two years and 24 instead of going to New York like that was so kind of so just a lot of navigation pieces.

218
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,270
How else do people get here? Yeah.

219
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,770
My mum had family here. Yeah. When she was in middle school, it was kind of tough for the like, adapt to that environment.

220
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:42,950
Yeah. How people get here. They're fleeing war.

221
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,950
Right. So we've had a huge influx of people coming from Ukraine.

222
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,510
That's a there's a lot more Ukrainians now in the United States than there were six months ago.

223
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,429
So there are there's also the refugee process.

224
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:06,550
Right. And so our asylum seeking process. And so again, so there's both selection on people who are able to navigate this really complex process.

225
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,830
Right, who may have like kind of more resources relative to people who don't migrate.

226
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,800
I don't mean like more resources than the host population, but they need more resources generally.

227
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,670
But there's also people who have very few resources that are coming out of asylum.

228
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,370
Right. You know, and I'm going to I think I'm going to show you some data from Sweden.

229
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:33,440
So I do a lot of work with Sweden. And Sweden is actually the largest exporter of asylum seeking immigrants in the whole world.

230
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,810
And actually a quarter of people who live in Sweden now are not from Sweden. So that's a much higher percentage in the United States.

231
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,450
It's about maybe 13% of people in the United States were not born here. It's a quarter of sweet Swedes were not born there.

232
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:54,180
So that and, you know, there. And so the point is is that so there's there's different ways that people get here.

233
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,200
The point is they're not random. And we could do three types of comparisons.

234
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,649
We can immigrant rating compare migrants to non migrants from the country of origin.

235
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,230
We can see some migrants as native born in the home country and we can compare first generation to second generation migrants.

236
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,199
So all three of those tell us something about the sort of change in culture and here's what that looks like.

237
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,999
So this is among these are among all in the United States.

238
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,150
This is using data from the National Latino and Asian American Survey.

239
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,050
These are people who are native born versus immigrants and within each racial ethnic group.

240
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,330
Okay.

241
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:32,450
So the purple line are non-Latino whites that are born in the United States compared to non-Latino whites who have migrated to the United States.

242
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,809
And these are several different groups.

243
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:45,140
And as you can see, the data is very consistent that immigrants have better mental health than people born here, even within within groups.

244
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,360
So what might what might that be about? We just talked about.

245
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:58,210
Yeah like you kind of mentioned the people that get through the immigration process how.

246
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,170
It's like a strong will and legacy of perseverance and resilience that might correlate to.

247
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,370
Yeah. So there could be this strong selection effect.

248
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,370
But of course, it's also what are the kind of risk factors that this group has that this group doesn't have?

249
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:28,130
That I'm probably going to be more common here. Yeah.

250
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,460
Isolation from people in the community. They may not have as many benefits since they're not citizens.

251
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,780
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. So. So it's not obvious that the graph would necessarily turn out this way.

252
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,460
You know, I guess what I'm trying to say, like.

253
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,380
And oftentimes, maybe I should have asked the beginning, like, whether you have better mental health and us born.

254
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,500
But the data is pretty, pretty clear on this.

255
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:57,650
And so now, of course, we the other sort of idea here, and I'm just showing you this is like one, one point in time.

256
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,210
But there's a couple other facts that I'm going to tell you.

257
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,420
So the first is that what I just showed you, the immigrants to the U.S. generally have better mental health than us born.

258
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,870
But the longer you've been here, the worse your mental health get.

259
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:14,870
So the longer immigrants have been here, the more they start to look like their host nation.

260
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:21,470
And second generation immigrants typically have worse mental health than first generation immigrants.

261
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,209
And so this is the idea that it's not necessarily again, we're trying to this is an example of culture as a risk factor.

262
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,840
And rather than talking about culture as a risk factor, it's acculturation.

263
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,980
Right. The idea of like, what does that say?

264
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:41,269
And I'm going to problematize that because this is a very naive way that we don't really think about this question, this issue in this way now.

265
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,179
But certainly when we saw these three observations, these three data points,

266
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:57,840
people started to think about what is it about the process of becoming an American especially that is so, so difficult for people mental health.

267
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,760
So, so some of these we already talked about. So the selection hypothesis is what we just talked about.

268
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,819
So immigrants to the United States are selected for better mental health and that advantage just wanes over time.

269
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,000
This is just regression to the mean, right? Just math, right? That's how it works.

270
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,340
It's also possible that there's ascertainment bias. So maybe this is not the case.

271
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,590
Immigrants might be more likely to come into contact with clinical care.

272
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:27,110
Maybe they're somehow more likely to get to a mental health professional that they can say this doesn't happen, but you can imagine that might happen.

273
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,700
There could be also diagnostic bias. So like within you.

274
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,729
So you do make it to a mental health professional and whether because there's miscommunication or misunderstanding

275
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,459
or maybe there's culturally specific behaviors or norms that the mental health providers who says,

276
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,320
well, it sounds like you've got depression when like that is like culturally like that's what's

277
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,100
actually happening is that are these misunderstandings or culturally specific behaviors?

278
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,169
And then of course,

279
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,159
there's the causation hypothesis that migrating to the United States is a major stressor that potentially involves the loss of protective resources,

280
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,500
like for millennials and and communalism, which then causes mental health to worsen over time.

281
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,340
And all of these are kind of operating a little bit. And when we talk about it, but it's the point is it's not just this.

282
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,120
Even though we think about like this is being like this is the main one.

283
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,000
We may think this is the main one, but we actually need to understand all four of these are probably operating to some degree.

284
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,879
So. So what is acculturation? It's sort of just in the most kind of dry way.

285
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,110
It's basically just a process by which people adopt a different culture.

286
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,570
So that's adopting these different scripts or values, customs beliefs.

287
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,519
The original notion of this was that it was some sort of like assimilation process, and there certainly is.

288
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,730
That certainly is part of what happened with certain waves of immigrants in the United States.

289
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,830
Certainly people migrating to the United States in the late 1800s, early 1900s from Eastern Europe.

290
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,730
So my family is ethnically from Italy. And so the notion that my mother didn't grow up speaking Italian,

291
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,190
even though her father migrated from Italy and something like this was an intentional

292
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,700
choice to have children and learn how to speak English as quickly as possible,

293
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:19,280
for example. So the notion, again, based on that experience, had been this kind of unidirectional assimilation process.

294
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,460
We now don't don't really think of it that way. We often don't have great indicators of acculturation.

295
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,050
So we have to be born here. How long you've been here? Better would be like what kind of food do you prefer?

296
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,940
What are your musical preferences? How is your ethnic identity?

297
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,210
Do you identify as being part of a group, for example?

298
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:50,750
And so what what studies have done is in terms of this immigration, kind of looking at acculturation as a risk factors.

299
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:59,750
This is a study by Josh Breslow where what he was comparing was U.S. born Mexican-Americans to foreign born Mexican-Americans.

300
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:07,190
So U.S. born versus foreign born. So everybody that's represented in this table self-identifies as being Latino.

301
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,240
And you can see that being born in the United States, all of these order issues are greater than one.

302
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,400
So being born in the United States is associated with higher odds of anything,

303
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:21,760
both mood disorders like depression and anxiety, but also drug and alcohol use disorder.

304
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,830
So all mental health outcomes are worse among U.S. born Mexican-Americans relative to foreign born Mexican-Americans.

305
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:34,790
This was a beautiful part of his study where he compared to try to understand this the question of selection.

306
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:46,400
So now he's comparing people who have migrated to the United States from Mexico to their family members who did not migrate, who are still in Houston.

307
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,290
Okay. So the family those kind of family characteristics that we talked about at the beginning.

308
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,200
Those are controlled for because they're matched. So I'm being compared.

309
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,250
So imagine if you had a sibling in your sibling, you migrated here and your sibling did not.

310
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,960
That's the comparison. Okay.

311
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:08,450
And so what does he see that that the family member who migrated to United States has higher likelihood of depression or anxiety disorders.

312
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,980
This is predominantly driven by generalized anxiety or a generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia.

313
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:22,040
Right. Which is kind of an interesting idea that those would be the conditions that were more common among

314
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:30,080
among the group that immigrated relative to their family members that stayed home and consistent.

315
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,160
But this is a different study.

316
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:40,400
Our studies have shown that higher levels of acculturation, that is, again, to endorse being, you know, using English more often relative to Spanish.

317
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:49,340
So having lower sense of identity with other Mexican-Americans relative to kind of being an American more generally,

318
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,999
we see that there's ways that acculturation with the index,

319
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,300
we see that the more sort of more acculturated who are to dominant U.S. culture, the worst of it all.

320
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,980
Okay. So kind of a stepwise surprise way.

321
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,460
So just to summarize,

322
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:14,480
we see a positive association between the degree of acculturation to the U.S. and higher likelihood of disorder among immigrants.

323
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,649
So I showed you data. Among Latinos, this is one of the largest the largest immigrant groups.

324
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:27,530
The United States is not necessarily the most fastest growing, but in terms of numbers, is the largest.

325
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,310
And again, I've shown this in a couple of different ways,

326
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,820
both comparing U.S. to foreign born and then comparing people who migrated to their family members who did not migrate.

327
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:46,490
So again, this is one example of trying to understand culture as a in this case,

328
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,240
risk factor or the process of acculturation is a risk factor for mental health.

329
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:58,190
But it's important to really to be acknowledge the important limitations of this work more generally.

330
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:05,150
So there's actually relatively little work on bi cultural ism and whether that is a risk or protective factor,

331
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,690
this is something that is actually probably region specific.

332
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:16,669
So I have a former fellow who's Mexican-American and had has moved back to Texas where her family is

333
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:24,530
and talked about the culture of Mexican-American culture on the border region and sort of like that.

334
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:30,230
It's very common for people to go back and forth across the border multiple times a week, whether for work or for health care.

335
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,070
And, you know,

336
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:41,840
the notion that there is a there's not a firm line in the sand between different different kind of cultures in certain regions of the United States.

337
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:51,110
We, of course, have to beg the question of acculturation to what most studies actually never measure what people are acculturated to.

338
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,499
That just sort of is the U. Measure. So again,

339
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,590
asking people about their own identity or their own sort of language they speak but never

340
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,480
actually measure what is what is American culture that people might be adopting to.

341
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,890
So we don't actually know, is it the loss of this culture or is it the gain of American culture?

342
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,160
Okay. Like those aren't the same. Those aren't necessarily the same thing.

343
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,499
We it's possible that acculturation is actually not the thing that matters,

344
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,650
but rather that's a proxy for other things that are known risk factors like,

345
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:28,340
you know, being exposed to stressful experiences, like not being able to like work in a job that is safe,

346
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,399
not having safety, protecting, not having labor protections because maybe, you know, you're on a visa process that are visa,

347
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:42,820
that means that you have to work in a difficult work environment because you're afraid of of retaliation.

348
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:50,209
We haven't talked at all about people who are here dealing with legal issues or being undocumented, which is a whole nother level of things.

349
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,280
Right. So just in general, like we actually don't know,

350
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,600
is it acculturation or is it all these other things that just come along with being an immigrant United States?

351
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,700
And generally, there's relatively little research on other racial, ethnic or religious minority groups in the United States.

352
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,790
So most of the work that has been done on this is focused on Latinos.

353
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,430
And how many of you in this class are interested in, for example,

354
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,499
they are doing projects related to people who are from Southeast Asia or other cultures.

355
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,120
Like there's just there's not nearly as much data on those groups as there is within Latinos.

356
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,470
And so, like,

357
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:27,350
that is something where like we're looking for that is the parable of like why is it kind of looking under the lamp post for the car keys?

358
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,209
And it's because that's where the light is. Right?

359
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,910
So like when people kind of talk about how do we understand culture as a risk, are protective factors like what we're doing?

360
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:40,310
We're doing studies because that's what we have measures of. We have measures of those because that's where education has stopped.

361
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,450
And so we need more sort of ideas of like what people what actually would be relevant,

362
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,480
like what are the actual constructs that might be might be operating here?

363
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,970
Okay. So a pause there for questions. So I'm going to do a part are left turn.

364
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:59,810
Yeah. Why is it unique to immigrate to the U.S. or do you see the same trends and experience?

365
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,300
That's a great question. It is not unique to the United States. It's we have much worse mental health than we do.

366
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:14,330
And we've done we did a study. And looking at what's interesting about immigrants in Sweden is that most of them are asylum seekers.

367
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:22,490
So if any of the selection processes would be operating, it should be selecting for people who have worse mental health because they're there,

368
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,770
because they're fleeing war or persecution, and yet they actually don't have worse mental health.

369
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:38,120
We did a study, Sweden had a policy in the nineties where they intentionally screwed up immigration,

370
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,150
asylum seeking immigration to Sweden during this time.

371
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,409
So this is basically whenever something bad happens in the world, Sweden gets an influx of immigrants.

372
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,830
So I think this was a time of there was there was had been some sort of revolution in Brazil.

373
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,850
And first Gulf War is happening. The, you know, a lot of things happened.

374
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:03,860
And so people are coming in to Sweden and they had a policy where they intentionally tried to prevent.

375
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,940
Immigrant almost reminds. So they intentionally dispersed immigrants over the whole country.

376
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:19,930
So with the notion that I think twofold, one is that to appease the native sweep population,

377
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,819
to say like, look, we're going to allow all these immigrants in, but they're not all going to move to your town because we're going to have to prevent

378
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,150
them from moving to one place and instead we're going to spread them all out.

379
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,640
And second, with the notion that this would help supports assimilation, right?

380
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:40,240
You're going to get better integrated into Swedish culture. You're going to have an incentive to kind of like foreign language, etc.

381
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:48,310
So we did a study where we but it turns out some of these immigrants were actually assigned to live in an area where there were a lot of immigrants.

382
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:54,370
And so what we showed was that if you happen to migrate to Sweden during this time and you happen to be

383
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:59,620
assigned to an area where there were a lot of immigrants which were much poorer than the majority of Sweden,

384
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,900
you had better mental health. You were less likely to use drugs, you were more likely to get a job.

385
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,540
And, you know, you might say, like, well, why would that be the case?

386
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,159
Why would living in a poor immigrant neighborhood help me out in terms of those things?

387
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,560
And we don't have data on the specific like cities using big administrative datasets as we don't have these measures.

388
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,669
But our hypothesis is that this has to do with can networks of actually getting getting people access to jobs,

389
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:33,490
that you are less isolated because there are other people there who speak your language or at least sort of are also an outsider in this place.

390
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:42,430
And, you know, this kind of those elements of cultural resource that that sort of came with being in that area,

391
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,780
despite the fact that it's so comically worse off than the rest of Sweden.

392
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:54,599
So. Yeah. I mean, and I should also I showed you this during the lecture on schizophrenia,

393
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:02,100
but to particularly people who are just migrated from North Africa and the Caribbean to Europe.

394
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:09,280
So people who like race who migrated to these have a much higher risk of psychosis relative to.

395
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,190
So that's the one kind of being like, why would that that's sort of a better mental health.

396
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:19,950
But this question of worse mental health is really it's this kind of unique experience that we don't quite

397
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:27,330
understand that seems to be concentrated among immigrants from specific parts of the world to the UK.

398
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,860
So it's not as present among people who migrate to the UK from India and Pakistan and other kind of former colonies, for example.

399
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,740
So it's a it's an exception to the general rule that immigrants have better mental health.

400
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:52,800
We don't really understand that. It's a. All right.

401
00:39:53,130 --> 00:40:00,000
So the last thing we're going to talk about is culture as a lens of expression and explanation of distress.

402
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,639
So so the way we can think about culture as a lens.

403
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,200
And so again, when you think about what does a lens do? So it bends light, right?

404
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,040
So it comes in one direction. It comes from this lens and it comes out a different direction.

405
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,180
And so rather than thinking about culture as a risk or protective factor, like something happens to you,

406
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:30,160
this is a way of thinking about culture as a way of shaping what the human experience.

407
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,409
So there's kind of two broad ways of thinking about this.

408
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:42,610
So one is the idea of what we call this image approach, which is the idea that distress is kind of specific to a particular culture or place or time,

409
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,340
and it might seek to identify what we might call culturally specific idioms of distress.

410
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,579
So we're going to talk about an example of nursing here in China, but there are others.

411
00:40:51,580 --> 00:41:00,850
So there are examples of of the nervous system in Latin America, which are examples of which look a lot like panic disorder in our own culture,

412
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:10,149
but have some unique elements in particular, like with anger attacks and things like that.

413
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:18,010
It's kind of an interesting expression. And then there is this idea of idea, which is that the expression of distress is really universal.

414
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:24,040
And yes, there are like kind of specific, idiosyncratic elements, but like that's not actually what matters.

415
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,659
What matters is like the core parts of distress that are not dependent on culture.

416
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,120
And yes, there's little different flavors, but generally we all feel pain in the same way.

417
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,980
Okay. So this is we feel pain in different ways, emotional pain in different ways.

418
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,000
This is we feel pain in the same way in like, yes, you might say it's your knee versus your hip, but like generally like that, it's it pains me.

419
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:56,020
So the reason that we're going to talk about nursing here today is because and I show you data that look like this a little while ago,

420
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:04,570
is that in Southeast Asia, the rates of depression are much, much, much lower than really any other part of the world.

421
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,690
So so this is showing you this is old data, but if you did this study today, it would look very similar.

422
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:17,470
So this is the prevalence of major depression in Taiwan and Korea.

423
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,460
You can see just orders of magnitude much lower than this.

424
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,590
So the question is like, well, is this real?

425
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:37,839
Like, is it that there there just is not depression in line or Korea or China, or is it that now is depression,

426
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,990
but it is being understood through a lens that is different and they're not calling it depression.

427
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,480
And I don't mean like you say tomato, I say tomato.

428
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:53,049
But like there's there's sort of the way that that pain is getting under is understood in that culture is different.

429
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,560
And so I can ask you questions about feeling sad and feeling tired and having concentration problems.

430
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,130
And like you hear those words, but like, none of that is like landing.

431
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,010
Like, it's not there's not there's not a translation here.

432
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:15,249
Or is it possible that this is a reflection of positive cultural things like female realism and communalism that are protective for

433
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:20,770
mental health and like maybe that's why these so that actually there is no group like depression is honestly lower in these places.

434
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:26,800
Right. No matter whether we say you say tomato, I say tomato. But just there are cultural resources that are protecting depression.

435
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,900
So the question is that so do you understand?

436
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:35,500
So that's that it's either that there's just as much depression here as there is as there is in the rest of the world.

437
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,830
But they're calling it something different or it's being expressed differently,

438
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:46,180
or depression actually doesn't exist here very much because there's all these other positive things happening, but protecting people's mental health.

439
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,569
So those are the two sort of arguments that we're trying to tease apart.

440
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:53,500
Which of these is more likely to explain why this graph looks the way that it does?

441
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,990
So I need to tell you about nursing. So in our seniors, that literally translates as lack of nerve strength or kind of weak nerves.

442
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,370
And it is understood as a condition of exhaustion of the nervous system.

443
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:17,759
So the symptoms of nursing are things like fatigue, weakness, pain, having sleeping problems,

444
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,350
feeling dizzy, having difficulty concentrating, not being able to relax.

445
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:34,050
It did not originate in Southeast Asia, it originated in Britain, and missionaries brought it to Southeast Asia as it was sort of understood.

446
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:41,189
It used to be part of the DSM and it was in the DSM one and two, and it left in DSM three.

447
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:53,820
It's still in the international classification of diseases, though it is the the original the origination of it in Britain in the late 19th century.

448
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:02,050
Was that an approach for U.S.? The origination of it was that this was sort of brought on by like modernity.

449
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,950
Like, oh, life is so easy now in the 1800s that like people are developing this condition of mercy.

450
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:18,280
So anyway, so it gets brought there and it is among the most common psychiatric, quote unquote diagnoses in China and other parts of Southeast Asia.

451
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,020
But you would never get that diagnosis in America. It would be malpractise for somebody to give you that diagnosis in America.

452
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,670
So let me show you how common it is. So this is in 100 patients for all seen at a psychiatric clinic in China.

453
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,739
So now remember how people get to care. Okay.

454
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,960
So first of all, like, we're in a very select group of people.

455
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,720
They have decided that the thing that they need to see help with is from this mental health psychiatric care.

456
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:48,070
What is their diagnosis? If we look in their charts, what is the diagnosis?

457
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,940
So 31% of those people have a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

458
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:57,910
So that's that's not so convincing in the sense of like there would be a high proportion of that in a psychiatric clinic.

459
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,040
You've got 1% have a diagnosis of depression.

460
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,620
And pretty much the third of these people are here because of experience.

461
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:15,639
So this is our first year and you can see these other neurosis specific, which I don't recognize.

462
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,380
This is the way that's defined, but this is what's in their in their chart.

463
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:27,640
So the question is, okay, what is is there a severe depression by another name?

464
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:39,820
That's the question that we're trying to answer. Or is it a distinct kind of culturally specific form of expression that is distinct from depression?

465
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:47,110
So when we look at those nursing cases, so this is 100 nursing cases,

466
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:55,659
almost all of them had some sort of stressor that occurred in the months just before they showed up in that clinic,

467
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,870
which is just like what you would see in depression in the United States.

468
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:11,790
Okay. So 75% of the cases in our seniors, we're coming on the heels of a major life event at work or a social relationship, those two.

469
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,399
So then what klineman does land climb and do is they take these hundred cases of North

470
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,460
Korea in the psychiatric clinic and they reassess them using DSM diagnostic criteria.

471
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:29,600
So they're going to the question isn't. You said you had this symptom.

472
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,170
Did you really mean you felt sad? But rather assessing them using the diagnostic criteria.

473
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,960
And what what they found was that 93 out of those hundred cases of nursing,

474
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:48,560
had they shown up in a clinic in the United States and been asked using asked questions, using our nomenclature?

475
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:56,210
93% of them would have been diagnosed with major depression. So almost all of them met criteria for major depression.

476
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,630
Some of them also met criteria for anxiety disorders. Right.

477
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,460
Not surprising, but I told you on Mondays that these often belong together.

478
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,540
A few had some other health conditions, but this is very,

479
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:15,439
very strong evidence that this is a situation where you're saying tomato and I'm saying tomato.

480
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:26,309
But fundamentally, we're talking about the same things. However, that is that is that nursing is not a culturally specific condition,

481
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:34,170
but it's a specific way of expressing what is a shared, fundamental human.

482
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:42,370
And now there is about 14% of these people had what he calls cultural brown disorders,

483
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,870
that is things that have no meaning in our Western nomenclature.

484
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,850
So this is the idea of kidney weakness or fear of cold, which are these two examples?

485
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:01,720
So there is no there's no because we you speak another language like this is a situation where there's no translation.

486
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:09,490
There's just there's no translation that actually means the same thing in Western nomenclature as what these things mean,

487
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:15,280
because there are many words that we can translate and these are things that cannot be translated,

488
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,380
that is that their meaning can only be understood within the specific cultural context.

489
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,770
So the other thing that's interesting you say why.

490
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:32,999
So, I mean, obviously she's out, but these psychiatrist at this at this clinic, they knew about depression.

491
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,030
1% of the people in that clinic had depression. So it's not like they didn't know what the word was or that it existed.

492
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,210
So what is it about these nasty cases?

493
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,070
Like, what were they what were they actually complaining about when they went? I don't mean complaining as in like whining.

494
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,940
I mean, like, what was their chief complaint? Why did they show up at the psychiatric hospital?

495
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:01,410
And the chief complaint in 90% of these cases was was paying.

496
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,520
Is pain, is headache a symptom of depression? Finding the best.

497
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,330
No. Right. So the next most common symptom is insomnia.

498
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,020
Right. Which is a symptom of depression. Next is dizziness.

499
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:24,360
Not a symptom. Next is more pain or memory.

500
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,050
That's cognition. That's. That's part of it. Anxiety, you know, weakness can be a fat loss when there's fatigue.

501
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:38,130
Okay. And you've got this symptom that doesn't quite make sense to us as Americans start feeling, like, forward in the head.

502
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:46,759
Or maybe if you've got, like, a sinus infection. The point is, is that where is the symptom of depression?

503
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,600
Where is this symptom of sadness? It's down here, so it exists.

504
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,340
But this is not why people went to the doctors, right? 8% of these people said they felt sad.

505
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,970
But the main thing that they are at the psychiatric clinic for is for headache.

506
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,050
Okay. Now in the United States.

507
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,510
So. So let me let me make this very clear. So in this.

508
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,670
So these are all people these are all the people who have a diagnosis of nursing.

509
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,980
But also, what have they showed up in America would have been diagnosed with depression.

510
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,470
Okay. So these are that these are just the 93 people for whom, like we we feel pretty confident this is about.

511
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:36,350
You say tomato. I say tomato. So headaches and pain are not part of the diagnosis of depression in the United States.

512
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,610
But it is not the case that pain has no relationship to depression.

513
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,420
And in fact,

514
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:49,850
there's lots of studies showing that people with migraine are far more likely to develop depression for depression are far more likely to develop.

515
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,650
There's a bi directional relationship. But in our nomenclature.

516
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:06,040
Headache and depression are two different things that sometimes come together and in Eastern nomenclature.

517
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:12,130
Headache and depression are not two different things. They are the same things, and they call it nastiness.

518
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:20,440
Okay. So this is we aren't this is evidence that we aren't actually talking about two fundamentally different things,

519
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,010
but we are talking about the same thing in two fundamentally different ways.

520
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,300
One is a much more holistic. All these symptoms are related to each other.

521
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,820
Right. Which is kind of the idea under a stigma.

522
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:37,720
And one is these are two different these are two separate health conditions that sometimes come together.

523
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,330
I would go see a psychiatrist for my depression and I micro control it just for my headache, for my pain.

524
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:52,990
Okay. Those are two different ways of thinking about it. This is and this is, again, data from the U.S., this Naomi Breslow,

525
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,870
his work showing that people with migraine, about half of them have an anxiety disorder.

526
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,510
40% of them have a phobia. A third of them have depression.

527
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:07,420
So, again, completely consistent with what I just showed you with in our studio, that the people with pain,

528
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:13,450
particularly migraine pain, the United States are also also reporting these symptoms of depression and anxiety.

529
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:19,660
But we are we've carved up those experiences into distinct conditions in a way that

530
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,190
is not that nomenclature is not how these these relationships are understood.

531
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:35,500
In the example of nursing in China. So so again, this is so is everything just you say tomato, I say tomato.

532
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,819
And the answer is no. There are still examples of these kind of culture bound syndromes.

533
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,799
That is, things that do not have a translation into our nomenclature.

534
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,760
So this is examples of examples of these.

535
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,000
So the idea of feeling like very pressure on your chest, feeling there's a lot of hot energy,

536
00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:00,040
like feeling you get fear of cold, feeling sour like these are these are not and this isn't just like that.

537
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:07,000
There's not a translation. It's like, see these types of experience that the argument would be that these types of

538
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:12,640
syndromes are not experienced in the United States because of our culture.

539
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,810
So the way to think about this is the following.

540
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:24,760
So we now know that all human beings, when you're born, can make every sound, every sound in any language.

541
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:32,220
All human beings can make 20 or more. But within about the first 6 to 9 months of life,

542
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:39,120
people who happened to be born in Japan lose the ability to distinguish between the R and the L sound.

543
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:45,910
That we see in English as those two sounds sound the same two babies starting about nine months.

544
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:51,440
It's like if you kind of like ask like they don't they cannot hear the difference between R and L.

545
00:54:52,670 --> 00:55:00,140
Now, there are lots of sounds that as people who least somebody who grew up speaking English, I can't tell the difference in other languages.

546
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:08,900
But the reality is that those sounds are different. But like literally the way that gets experienced in my brain is that they are not okay.

547
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,799
In this example of a first native Japanese speaker, they are.

548
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,830
They all sound sound the same. And so it is this would be an example where.

549
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:24,640
It's not just that there's not a direct translation, but it's that the experience of this thing.

550
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,930
That's not is is culture specific.

551
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:38,120
The sounds are l are specific in our culture that are not understood by all cultures because of just the way that the you know,

552
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:43,920
decades and decades of I translate like as an example, like the transmission of language as a way to understand what.

553
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:56,020
So this is from David Mechanic, which again, he's the person that we read or we heard from when he was talking about Soprole.

554
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:01,660
That is the idea that you decide that you are sick and therefore you go to seek health care.

555
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,600
Not that you go and doctor and doctor tells you you're sick.

556
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,810
So what he argues here is that culture in our city is an example of culture influencing distress.

557
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:18,850
So there's the actual experiences, and then there is the cultural influences on the definition of what you are experiencing.

558
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,379
And the argument here that is not just made by him, by others,

559
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:29,350
but also in the Kleinman article that the reporting of physical symptoms is culturally more neutral.

560
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,550
It's still not positive.

561
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:40,420
Nobody thinks this is like a positive thing, but it's more neutral then reporting those same symptoms as being related to mental health or psychology,

562
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,560
and that that this is very dependent on kind of what is socially acceptable.

563
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,340
So just to summarize the case of North Korea and China and depression,

564
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:57,130
the United States is an example of an Iraq phenomenon where that is we're talking about distress.

565
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,910
But the majority of that we talk about you say tomato, I say tomato.

566
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,660
But fundamentally, we're talking about the same thing and it just matters.

567
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,730
Are we using your nomenclature? Am I not the creator? But they are describing the same phenomenon.

568
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,260
This is an example here.

569
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:19,180
Yes. You might say, well, I was claiming article items from 1982.

570
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:26,410
Probably most of you weren't born then. The onset, of course, was two years old. So the notion like, yes, China has changed a lot since the 1980s.

571
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:31,989
Right. But this is the prevalence of China in 20 2019 is 4%.

572
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,620
So it's up from 2%. And here's what it is was in the United States in 2018.

573
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:43,629
So it is still the case that there is despite the fact that we've had it is more depression.

574
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:47,950
The diagnosis of depression is more common in China than it was in the past.

575
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,419
It is still the case that there is more depression even.

576
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,710
We're using the same nomenclature here as there is there,

577
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:02,290
which so that what I told you about earlier is culture is a protective factor is probably also still operating.

578
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:09,550
Right. But now at least we can sort of know we have we have to hold something constant in this case the definition of misery.

579
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:15,880
And then we can go and start to investigate the reasons why the misery varies by place.

580
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:25,610
And then the last thing I'll leave you with before I take questions is the idea that, you know, populations change.

581
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:29,359
So it's not we're here. We're kind of looking at specific individuals or specific groups.

582
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:37,010
But, you know, the United States is projected to become a majority minority country,

583
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,600
I think by now about 2040, I think is the latest estimate this week.

584
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:45,410
There was an estimate that this was going to happen in 2050. But now I think we're we're going to happen before that.

585
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:53,450
What does that mean? So that means that the majority of babies born in the United States happening around 19 or 2040.

586
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:00,320
Collectively, you will be born to people who are not white relative to people who are white.

587
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:09,140
Okay. So all all other racial ethnic groups combined. So that is to say that one more time circa around night by about 2040.

588
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:20,810
All, if you combine all other all racial ethnic groups, the United States, except for whites, will be having more children than whites.

589
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:27,230
Whites in the United States. And this that's what this majority minority population shift is going to mean.

590
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:33,790
So that's because of there's there's a lot of like.

591
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,109
Anyway, the point is, is that now. But of course,

592
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:44,520
the United States has changed many times or the composition of this country like was there were no white people when it started right here.

593
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:51,499
Like certainly they call it America. Right. So the point is that the the as the population changes,

594
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:57,170
whether this work is going to like whether what I showed you with acculturation among Latinos

595
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:04,100
in the United States whether that holds true constant will be we'll wait and see as the.

596
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,080
Sorry. Just some minor words. But just the notion that.

597
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:16,930
It's the place. The America that people are migrating to today is very different than the American people migrated to 50 years ago,

598
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:20,130
which is going to be different from the America people migrate to experience.

599
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,420
Okay. So with that, I will pause for some questions.

600
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:38,820
Excellent question. I thought it was interesting that Korea had a really low rate is what I know.

601
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,700
I think Korea is one of the highest suicide. That is correct.

602
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:51,510
They you just I was thinking like maybe they just have a higher standard of what they define as being depressed just

603
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:59,430
because like it's kind of it's normalized and just work really hard to sell your soul to the corporate world instead of,

604
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:03,710
like, terrorizing, like, the work life balance. So.

605
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,460
So you raise a great issue and we're going to talk about this when we talk about suicide.

606
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:10,740
So as Japan and South Korea have some of the highest rates of suicide.

607
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:16,130
And Japan is not on this list. But if it was, it would also be very lucky.

608
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:23,880
And so that, again, kind of should indicate to us, is it really that there's no depression and everything is is rainbows and unicorns there?

609
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:31,889
Or is it there's something about the definitions and sort of more potentially stigma towards endorsing symptoms.

610
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:39,750
Right. So that's part of the argument that David Mechanic makes around like what is it safe to admit to?

611
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:51,120
Is it safe to admit to a headache? Is it you know, is it safer to admit to a headache then that you're you don't want to get on a bed of democracy?

612
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:57,330
Right. Is it safer to admit to feeling really tired from overwork for feeling tired and you don't know why?

613
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:03,270
Right. So the and I think, you know, when we talk about stigma in the United States,

614
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:09,620
the way that that that that in and of itself is also an end is an expression of culture like stigma.

615
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,810
Attitudes are an expression of culture attitudes.

616
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:21,450
So what stigma looks like and how it operates in other countries is also an important question considering this.

617
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:29,890
Yes. So in Taiwan, they have they have diagnoses of nurse.

618
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,440
Yes, they do. Yes, they do. And is that linked to suicide?

619
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:40,130
Do they think that to suicide exists? So, yeah, I mean, that's a great question.

620
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:47,310
Song hesitating because I think it's actually hard to know the answer to that.

621
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,820
Here's my story. So slide aside.

622
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:57,450
So a couple of years ago, I was working with a group that had collected data on about a half million people from China.

623
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:04,040
And we were looking to see the relationship between depression and nursing and with diabetes.

624
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:12,420
So I've done a lot of work on how depression relates to diabetes and what we and so we were looking at both depression,

625
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:16,200
anxiety and nursing and how those three conditions related to diabetes onset.

626
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:22,679
And what we found is that if you hadn't seen it, you were less likely to develop diabetes.

627
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,380
And so it was kind of interesting. Like it was like, why? Why would that be? And it was resubmit for publication.

628
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:37,080
And the editor told us that he would not publish the paper unless we took out all the data on nursing because he said it was not a real condition.

629
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:42,270
I have no place and I'm not kidding. I get it. No place in the scientific literature.

630
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,760
And so, like, the editor is like inserting himself, like he's and I'm like, what are you talking about?

631
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,520
Like, this is like these are people like the people who tried to these data are Chinese

632
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,209
from like through like obviously they felt it was relevant to their research.

633
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:02,900
Question Right. I'm coming in. It's just somebody helping them analyze it. But we ended up taking it out.

634
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:13,580
And so what I what I'm going with this is like the that there may actually be dramatic bias against English language studies on nursing.

635
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:20,480
That would make it difficult to answer that question. But I'll look into it and we'll talk about it when we talk about suicide in a few weeks.

636
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,940
That's a great question. There was another comment. You have to go ahead.

637
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:32,630
I was wondering and I was like, American culture has been spreading more recently and also our problems have spread with it.

638
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:41,360
Explain this from Puerto Rico's not that high, but it'd be interesting to see if they've increased since they've become more Americanized.

639
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,760
Well, I mean, there are more there are more people from Puerto Rican descent in the United States than there are in Puerto Rico.

640
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,980
So actually, like the population of Puerto Rico is has had a dramatic explode.

641
01:04:53,840 --> 01:05:01,640
Yeah. This and this data is is old. Right. So and actually in some other data, don't don't necessarily show the rate is lower.

642
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:07,040
So sorry, Terry, but to your and to your question.

643
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:15,729
I mean, it's interesting because I'm trying I'm trying to think of like what would be the study design?

644
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,360
And so, like, would we what do we want to be looking at?

645
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,270
Next. We don't know if there are many states that have done this, like look at this and that.

646
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:33,190
We were thinking like Americans who have moved abroad. They caused little depressions here and there's their new social network.

647
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:41,410
Because I thought of that, because I remember seeing a study about an island that didn't have cable before.

648
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,850
And then when they got cable and they gave them eating disorders.

649
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:51,430
Exactly. Got something like that. Well, and I mean, I think the challenge with this is like, you know,

650
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:59,860
unless you are in a country that has like massive censorship, like, you know, you do have access to a lot of different.

651
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,620
So, I mean, we'd we'd want to be looking at places that should have really controlled access to and for some impact.

652
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:11,980
Right. And like, that's that in of itself, maybe making it not safe for people to report depression.

653
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:16,180
Right. Because like, if the government is so strong that it can control them like you see on YouTube.

654
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,630
Then, you know. So it's a it's it's an interesting question.

655
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:33,350
I mean, I think it's also like what what part are what part of it is America and what part?

656
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:40,070
Because, I mean, we we actually relative to other parts of the world, I mentioned Sweden has a lot worse mental health than we do.

657
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:43,940
Like, we're we we are the worst.

658
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:47,870
You know, I mean, we're not not great. I mean, with anxiety disorders, we're kind of the worst.

659
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:56,180
But when it comes to depression, you know, there are you know, this is Ukraine here.

660
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,350
France is not that far behind us. Right.

661
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:06,470
So there are other cultures that we don't necessarily think of that we think of as like being pretty distinct from American culture.

662
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:11,780
France is like a whole panic attack. Every time I've been there, it's made me feel nervous.

663
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:20,720
So but you know, and I'll say, like, when I go to Sweden, like it's very like I feel very well.

664
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:28,160
I feel like very, very obnoxious. I'm not trying to be I feel like I can't I can't be not obnoxious enough.

665
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:36,050
So. And you can see I mean, you can also look at like the substance use disorders here where, you know,

666
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:42,499
these countries have very different ideas about the acceptability of drinking or how people engage with substances, etc.

667
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:51,410
So it's it I think it's interesting to look at, but whether we're the cause of it or whether it's it's kind of.

668
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:57,590
Lester, how much of it is us? How much of it is all of all of the English speaking world?

669
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,920
I think it's a good question. Other questions?

670
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,140
Yeah, I guess sort of related to that. I don't know if it's logistically very feasible.

671
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:15,960
Have you seen any studies that analyze like mental health over longer periods of time, especially with respect to like colonization?

672
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:22,200
Yeah, that's a great question. I just feel like that's what I think of when I think of like American influence.

673
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:31,679
I think of like. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So there have been studies that specifically try to look at how not necessarily following people over time,

674
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,840
but asking people like look and comparing people who have been here longer than not as long.

675
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,870
So I worked with a student on a study where we were looking at suicidal ideation among immigrants,

676
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:48,959
using one of the data sources that I showed you and the argument that she's she was from Jamaica.

677
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:56,160
She moved here from Jamaica. So we're part of her first positioning of the paper was the idea of a broken cross,

678
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:59,760
like, you come here to America, this is you're moving here, the better yourself.

679
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:07,410
And not only does that not always happen, but you've in the process, you've also become a racial minority.

680
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:13,559
So she was moving from Jamaica, where she's black. And so she's she's part of a majority group there.

681
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:21,120
And she becomes a racial unit. She's going to move to a town where there are not very many people around.

682
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:29,040
And so that the the process of both becoming a minority and how that relates to this is another element of it.

683
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,080
But I'll have to see if there's that.

684
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:38,080
The only one I would think of and again, this isn't it's unfortunate that this is not more widely examined with across different groups.

685
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:44,339
There's a new study called The Study of Latinos that has, I think, sort of been following people over time.

686
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:51,480
But like both of both of these studies are cross-sectional and they never they did not do follow.

687
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:03,910
The questions. Yeah. This is like super rich, but you're talking about like a study it.

688
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,660
Sorry. I just have an example of, like, how?

689
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:16,530
Oh, like, you know how we talked about like symptoms showing up differently for different populations,

690
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:24,209
but basically saying caused us to mature about like the health impacts of law enforcement.

691
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:32,880
And the book we read talks about like a lot of like next mothers in the Washtenaw County area, like after the ICE raids,

692
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:40,960
they had a lot of issues like with their breast milk and like they were convinced that it was spoiled and like they just had so many like.

693
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:50,030
Like physical manifestations of like the trauma that their family faced and like the trauma of like the separation from their husband.

694
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:55,740
You know, that was this with full openness.

695
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:01,980
Yeah. Yeah. So, um, and so I'm not as familiar with that specific example, but there.

696
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:06,040
So the story or not the story, but the understanding of societal as.

697
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:10,800
So this is an example of a cultural Down syndrome that's really stress and actually diabetes risk.

698
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:14,910
And so, um, so at the work that I've done on this is with, again,

699
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:22,200
with a few new contractors now at UTEP and she felt cheated when we started doing this project, she told me when she was a child,

700
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:28,390
she, her, um, she was outside when a, somebody happened to hit their dog like, you know,

701
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:34,070
so she sees this traumatic event and her mother immediately brought her some warm sugar.

702
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:39,180
And this was sort of a part of like a cultural sort of coping mechanism of like, oh, this is unique.

703
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,930
Your body needs this right now. And, you know,

704
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:48,989
part of the work that we've been doing on the Stress and Sugar study is to try to understand how stress and stress reactivity relate to diabetes risk.

705
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:56,790
But there's actually like a very old like that. There's a there's an existing cultural idea of how stress related diabetes already,

706
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:01,290
which is not part of Western culture, but it does exist in other cultures.

707
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:14,280
And so, you know, but the notion of it, maybe this is this is kind of a little bit of an aside, but we don't we actually don't have very good data on.

708
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:27,480
Somatoform. So somatic possession, so somatoform disorders are conditions where typically people have a they need to know.

709
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:36,480
Oftentimes, people have this very traumatic thing happen to them and then they start experiencing all these very strange, like somatic symptoms.

710
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:42,420
So you may not be able to lose your voice search, not be able to make a sound.

711
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:48,630
You may have GI issues. She might have neurological like fainting.

712
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,570
So, I mean, we have so little good data on this.

713
01:12:54,570 --> 01:13:00,930
It's kind of shocking how little information we have in the United States about these types of disorders, like what causes them.

714
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:09,299
It's and and it's a shame. I mean, I don't I don't even know, like, what the treatments would be for any of these.

715
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,960
I mean, I when I was in the hospital, there was a woman, the woman who spent time was next to me,

716
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,950
had literally, like lost the ability to walk like something had happened to her.

717
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:22,260
They didn't know what, like she could not use her legs, like they had done all these tests and they couldn't find anything wrong with her.

718
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,950
And then like literally, I mean, I overheard the doctor saying, like, she's got a conversion disorder, we're sending her to a nursing home.

719
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:33,030
And I'm like, What's happening? Like, because it wasn't she couldn't go home because she couldn't.

720
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:40,170
So it was a it was it's kind of to your point of like, you know, the ways that, you know,

721
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:47,130
we don't just experience a stressful event in our mind for rather like our nervous system is connected the rest of our body with good reason.

722
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:53,100
And so like the idea that like we experience it in other parts of our body, I think it's starting to learn.

723
01:13:53,100 --> 01:14:00,510
But this, this still this specific kind of world visitations are like still feels like it's on like an island in an archipelago,

724
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,770
like on the other side of the world in terms of like where a lot of these conversations are happening.

725
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:09,690
Like, it's it's a very it's just feel so divorced from most of what the conversation about public health is happening.

726
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:16,570
Right. Not. All right, everybody.

727
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,730
Well, I will see you next week. Don't forget, your time is due on Friday.
