1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,900
At least I know they know. They yell at me if I forget because they told me to on the first day.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,600
It's like, if you want recordings, you're going to have to, like, not be shy about just yelling at me if I don't do it.

3
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,209
Netflix the final season. I think it's in my other bag.

4
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,850
I switched bags and I think that was my big mistake. So it's somewhere, right?

5
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,060
For now, we're going to just put our names on the page.

6
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:25,490
From the lectures that are already given. I think that we heard from last year as well between all that.

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:02:14,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not we don't want to reinvent the wheel. Oh.

8
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,260
Um, I have a whole video to figure out with audio, unfortunately.

9
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,670
Oh, okay. We'll see. I'm going to send you a slide show for whatever reason at work.

10
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,980
Okay. I like to watch it at work. I think I've done it before and it works, but I haven't really done it this year.

11
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,760
Okay. So some of them are worth.

12
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,080
Far right. Good morning, everybody. Back from fall break.

13
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:50,660
That's the blacks ready to go. All right. So today we have our first guest lecture.

14
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,479
Very excited to have Michelle Jacobs with us.

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,270
She's a certified genetic counselor and as it says, an assistant professor at professor at Michigan Medicine.

16
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,479
So this is a really good lecture to kind of follow up on our cancer biology and our hereditary cancers lecture,

17
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,110
because this is kind of the process she's going to tell us all about how genetic

18
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,530
counseling and works when people have a suspected familial cancer syndrome.

19
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:21,979
And so, you know, if you're interested in we have a wonderful mass program here in genetic counseling.

20
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,520
So if this is something that's your interest, definitely get in touch with her afterwards or afterwards.

21
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,629
Okay, great. And you can learn more about it. But thank you so much for being here.

22
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:39,030
We really appreciate it for. So like Alison said, I'm Michel Jacobs, energetic counselor here,

23
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,049
and I work specifically in the cancer genetics clinic and happy to have the opportunity

24
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,850
today to share a little bit about genetic counseling for cancer with you guys.

25
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,150
I don't have any conflicts of interest related to this lecture,

26
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,000
so I'm hoping to just give an overview today of genetic counseling and cancer genetic counseling,

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,280
specifically genetic testing for cancer, and then focus in on a few topics,

28
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,940
cascade screening or testing in particular relevant to public health cover, like some miscellaneous topics.

29
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,330
And then talk a little bit about where things are going in the field.

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,129
So I'm going to give you kind of like the facts and textbook definition of genetic

31
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,970
counselors first and then share a little bit about how I usually explain it.

32
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,459
So genetic counselors are allied health professionals. That is a similar category to nurses and social workers.

33
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,020
In terms of the role in the health care system. The education to become a genetic counselor is a master's degree,

34
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,250
and most programs include coursework, clinical rotations and some sort of research component.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,520
After graduation, there is an exam that everyone has to take to get certified.

36
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,860
And then in addition to that, certain states, including Michigan, have genetic counselor licensure.

37
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,690
Genetic counselors can work in a lot of different clinical areas.

38
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:12,640
So probably the three main ones that everyone gets training in and have the highest volumes of patients are prenatal, pediatric and cancer.

39
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,850
At U of M, we have a bunch of other clinics and there's a lot of other specialties genetic counselors can work in,

40
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,020
like cardiology, ophthalmology, general adult.

41
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,459
There's a hearing loss clinic here at the university that has genetic counselors involved.

42
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:37,390
So a lot of different areas in addition to clinical roles like large university academic medical centers or smaller community hospitals.

43
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,740
But genetic counselors can also work in labs, which most of the time would be like a lab that offers genetic testing,

44
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,149
sort of advising on what products to offer and making sure that the correct

45
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,709
tests are ordered and then can also work in nonprofit or government settings.

46
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,850
And public health is a common place for that to happen. Genetic counseling is a relatively small field.

47
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,129
It is growing very quickly, as is for genetic testing and genetic technologies.

48
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:16,480
So there's a lot of opportunities for involvement. But between 2021 and 2031, the professions estimated to grow by 18%,

49
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:24,670
which is faster than that second bar other health care occupations and quite a bit faster than the total job growth expected for all occupations.

50
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:33,940
Even though that is an 18% growth that only represents about 500 jobs because it is a pretty small field.

51
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:44,970
So the official definition put out by the National Society of Genetic Counselors, which is our professional society, about what genetic counseling is,

52
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,890
is the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical,

53
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,370
psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease very broadly.

54
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,030
That includes interpreting family and medical histories to assess the chance of disease, occurrence or recurrence.

55
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,370
Educating people about inheritance testing, management prevention, resources, and research about those genetic diseases.

56
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,260
And then also helping people make informed choices about genetic testing,

57
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,450
about their medical care, and adapting to any risk of genetic conditions that may have.

58
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,990
When people ask me, well, when people ask me what I do for work and I say, I'm genetic counselor, no one really knows what that is a lot of the time.

59
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,489
So how I explain my job as a cancer genetic counselor specifically is that I meet with people who have

60
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,910
personal and or family histories of cancer where it looks like there could be cancer running in the family.

61
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,989
During those appointments, I'll get into a lot more detail,

62
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:55,360
but very broadly go over different genetic testing options that can help figure out if there's cancer running in the family with a genetic cause,

63
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,200
and then help patients figure out how those genetic test results fit into their health care and their medical management.

64
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,790
Of everyone diagnosed with cancer. This pie chart includes all different cancer types.

65
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,010
About 5 to 10% of people have some sort of genetic or inherited cause that can be identified through genetic testing.

66
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:27,560
What that means is a specific genetic condition or hereditary cancer syndrome that is predisposing them to develop cancer.

67
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,220
In about another 10 to 20% of cases.

68
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:39,260
There seems to be cancer clustering in the family, but there's not anything genetic that we can find that explains that.

69
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,649
Sometimes there are kind of obvious other explanations,

70
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:49,160
like a family where a lot of individuals have a history of smoking and several of them have lung cancer.

71
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,370
It's a known lifestyle exposure, and sometimes we don't really know what the cause is.

72
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,150
It's just not something that we can pick up right now most of the time.

73
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,320
So that biggest chunk on the pie chart, there is not anything genetic that can explain why that person developed cancer.

74
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:16,760
And it's not something that seems to be tracking in the family. So in those cases, which is most common, the biggest risk factor for cancer is age.

75
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,989
But there are also a bunch of other sort of lifestyle environmental factors or a lot

76
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,310
of the time we don't really have a clear answer for why that person developed cancer.

77
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:34,880
In terms of who sees a cancer genetic counselor, we see people who have both personal and family histories of cancer.

78
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,250
Probably about half of our patients have a personal history of cancer.

79
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,320
And for those people, I would say most of them are diagnosed within the past year or so.

80
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,780
But we do have people who, let's say, were diagnosed at 25 with a colon cancer.

81
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,390
They're now 65. And genetic testing wasn't really available when they were diagnosed.

82
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,530
And someone has just talked to them about it now. So we do get some of those,

83
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,979
but most people are pretty recently diagnosed and then about half of our patients don't have any history of cancer themselves,

84
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,380
but have cancer in their family history.

85
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:18,500
So reasons that someone might be referred over to us, this is not an all encompassing list, but covers, I think, all of the most common things.

86
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,180
Anyone diagnosed with cancer at a younger than usual age.

87
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,720
So what younger than usual means depends a little bit on the cancer type, but generally under 45 ish for many cancers is considered young.

88
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,420
Someone who has had more than one type of cancer themselves. That makes us think maybe there's something that this person was born with,

89
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,740
something genetic that made them more likely or is making them more likely to get cancer.

90
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,799
If we have families where there are people with the same or related types of cancers,

91
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,750
by related, I mean things that can be grouped together under a hereditary cancer syndrome.

92
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,889
And again, without that shared risk factor, if you take a family history,

93
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:10,100
which we do during sessions and see that there are more people in the family with cancer than we would expect just by chance,

94
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,410
that's, again, suspicious that maybe something is making people in this family more likely to get cancer.

95
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,970
Sometimes we see people where a family member has had genetic testing and has a hereditary cancer syndrome.

96
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,450
And because of that, that person's coming in to learn about their own risk, to learn if they have that condition or not.

97
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,250
Other kind of common reasons. Reasons, sorry, for referral.

98
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,610
Certain types of tumors or cancers are more likely to have a hereditary cause.

99
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,060
So a good example of that is ovarian cancer.

100
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,330
I showed that overall, for all cancer types, about 5 to 10% are hereditary.

101
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,100
But for ovarian cancer specifically, it's closer to about 15 to 20%.

102
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:04,130
So it's recommended anyone diagnosed with that type of cancer have genetic testing, even if they don't have anything else in this list going on.

103
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:13,670
Similarly, there are certain findings that are not cancerous themselves but might be suggestive of someone having a hereditary cancer syndrome.

104
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,260
Examples of that.

105
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:24,410
There are a couple of conditions where people can have, you know, benign skin findings that a dermatologist might find just on a skin exam.

106
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:34,850
And those skin findings themselves are not cancerous, but they're very unique and might be suggestive that a person has a hereditary cancer syndrome,

107
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,060
which as part of that, they may have higher risk for cancer.

108
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:46,160
And then finally, people who have been diagnosed with cancer tend to have certain types of testing on their tumors,

109
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,960
which some of which I'll mention today. And sometimes we see people for follow up on those.

110
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:00,020
In terms of what it looks like when there's cancer running in the family. This is a pretty striking example of what it can look like.

111
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:07,820
This presumably represents a family where there is a genetic change in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene,

112
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,300
which are primarily associated with breast and ovarian cancer risk, but can cause other cancers as well.

113
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:21,980
So what would be suspicious about this family history would be that there are multiple generations affected.

114
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,050
So quite a few people in the family. The ages of diagnosis are pretty young.

115
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,069
So several of these are under 45. And for breast cancer, kind of premenopausal is considered young.

116
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,540
Generally someone has both breast and ovarian cancer,

117
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,380
which can be linked through the bracket genes and just the types of cancers that are in the family.

118
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,130
Usually if cancer's sporadic, you kind of see different types.

119
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:56,240
Like one person has breast cancer, one person has colon cancer. In this family, it's the same cancer types being seen over and over.

120
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,490
When someone comes in for a cancer genetics appointment,

121
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:11,840
I usually start out by checking in with them about their understanding of why they have been referred and what their major questions or concerns are.

122
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,480
I would say it is pretty common for people coming in to not know exactly why they were

123
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,740
referred and not have a great sense of what's going to happen during the appointment.

124
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:31,190
So a lot of appointments. I start out with that same brief explanation of what a genetic counselor does and kind of personalize why I

125
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,890
personalize my explanation to what's going on with them or their family that made their physician refer them.

126
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:47,590
Once we're on the same page about that, I will get medical and family history information from the patient, which typically is cancer focused.

127
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:57,860
So asking questions about cancer diagnoses, certain tumors, precancerous diagnoses and cancer screenings for them and their family members.

128
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,959
Once I have all of that information that's used to do a risk assessment,

129
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,360
which essentially is when I look at a full picture of the person and their family and

130
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,340
think about how likely it is that there's a hereditary cancer syndrome in the family,

131
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,620
and if so, what syndrome or syndromes I might be suspicious of.

132
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,999
Once I have that in my head, I talk to them about generally what patterns I'm seeing or not seeing in their family that are

133
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,850
suspicious and genetic testing options going over those different genetic testing options.

134
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,420
I'll get into this in a few slides, but the options have definitely expanded a lot over recent years.

135
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,510
So talking about sort of benefits, limitations,

136
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:52,640
risks of different options as well as how those things can affect their cancer screening or management once they have all the all of that information.

137
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,340
We usually have a discussion about what option they're leaning towards if they need more guidance.

138
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,929
I try to ask questions that kind of help clarify what their priorities are

139
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,490
with getting that information and then figure out a plan for genetic testing.

140
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:15,800
Or in some cases the person is sitting in front of me is not the best person to get genetic testing or there are other barriers preventing that.

141
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,860
So if they're not getting testing themselves,

142
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,889
talking about what next steps are for maybe a family member coming in or that person maybe not having testing,

143
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:34,650
but still qualifying for some extra screenings. Then throughout the session, thinking about any barriers that might be present to this person,

144
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,030
having genetic testing, so that can include financial barriers.

145
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,880
So we always talk about like how much genetic testing will cost during a session.

146
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,900
Sometimes issues come up around family dynamics,

147
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,420
so people not necessarily knowing their family history or for people with a hereditary cancer syndrome,

148
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,650
not necessarily being in contact with their relatives to share that information.

149
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,300
And then other more like logistical concerns. So we do a lot of appointments now by virtual or telemedicine.

150
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,090
So just making sure there's a plan for the patient to actually submit a sample if they are going to do testing,

151
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,250
but they don't live locally in or close by.

152
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,660
Probably most common questions that come up during an appointment for patients who have been diagnosed with cancer.

153
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,620
Asking about how these results might affect their treatment.

154
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:32,140
And I have a few case examples that sort of talk about this. For people with past histories of cancer or no history of cancer,

155
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,040
thinking about how knowing they're at high risk for cancer can affect their screenings or management.

156
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:46,360
Very, very common concern is sort of how can my cancer history or these results affect my family?

157
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,140
People are usually particularly concerned about children and thinking about like I went through this experience or,

158
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:59,530
you know, I saw my close relative go through this experience. How can I hopefully prevent my child from having the same thing?

159
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,450
For some families that have a lot of cancer going on.

160
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:12,970
This can provide an answer potentially if there is a hereditary cancer syndrome identified for kind of why that's going on.

161
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:20,010
I think with certain diseases, some people may have a tendency to think like, you know, what did I do to cause this?

162
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,270
And for some people, this provides a kind of relief knowing like it's not anything that they did.

163
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,880
They were born at high risk for cancer.

164
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,969
Thinking about how much testing costs the insurance coverage has gotten a lot better for testing, as have the labs.

165
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,820
Policy is about billing, making it a lot easier and a lot more accessible to a lot of people.

166
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:52,030
And they do now offer self-pay prices the major labs of $250 for like a pretty broad test.

167
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,070
So becoming more and more affordable and insurance coverage is also becoming better.

168
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,000
And then finally thinking about how genetic testing can affect someone's ability to get insurance.

169
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,710
So there is a federal law that protects against discrimination by health insurance companies and employers,

170
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,120
meaning they can't ask a person about whether they have a genetic condition when they are deciding to cover them or hire them.

171
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,600
There are a handful of exceptions to that law, but things like life insurance, disability, long term care,

172
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,099
if they send someone an application for that service and they are allowed to ask a whole bunch of medical questions,

173
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,010
including whether a person has a genetic disease.

174
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:43,600
So this is something particularly younger individuals who don't have preexisting conditions and don't have those insurances.

175
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Some people choose to get that in place before they do genetic testing in case that affects their ability down the line.

176
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:59,840
Then I want to share a video that we developed along with HHS, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

177
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,350
They have a dedicated cancer genomics branch.

178
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:15,799
And this video was created with the intention of if someone is basically having testing outside of a genetic setting to

179
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:24,530
provide sort of a basic overview of why someone and in this case specifically someone with cancer might get genetic testing,

180
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:34,670
the kind of information that can come out of it. And it is also available on the MDH website, which is a great resource for people with.

181
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,510
So that is a very high level overview of information that I usually share with

182
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,129
patients before they get genetic testing and kind of a very brief overview.

183
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,140
So usually we talk for a lot longer than that. So I have a few case examples throughout,

184
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,240
but I want to share what is that potentially just like a typical case that might come to us in cancer genetics.

185
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:12,700
A 31 year old diagnosed with gastric cancer doesn't have a family history of cancer, but based on her young age of diagnosis,

186
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,310
get sent over to us to see if there is some sort of predisposition that could explain that diagnosis.

187
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:28,540
In her case, the role for genetic testing includes sorry, in management of her current cancer.

188
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,769
Depending on whether someone has a hereditary cancer syndrome or not,

189
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,310
might affect the type of surgery they have in this case can affect screening for other cancers.

190
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,940
If she has a hereditary cancer syndrome, there are other things we potentially want to have her start screening for and can

191
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,620
affect whether her family members are at risk of having a hereditary cancer syndrome.

192
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:59,950
In this case, the patient chose to have genetic testing and had a mutation, also called a pathogenic variant in a gene called H one.

193
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,390
And for all these case examples, kind of the conditions I mentioned in gene names are not really important, just thinking about the overall message.

194
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,170
So in this case, she had a condition called hereditary, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

195
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:23,530
That condition, people who have it have up to a 70% risk of developing a specific type of gastric cancer.

196
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,620
And then individuals assigned female at birth also have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.

197
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:36,579
So in her case, once it was known that she had that condition, it changed her medical management plan.

198
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,209
So in that case, the surgery is a total gastrectomy,

199
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:46,660
meaning removal of the stomach because of the high risk of potentially cancer coming up in a different area,

200
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,100
even for very localized cancers and screening for breast cancer.

201
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,110
So as a 31 year old, she wouldn't have been having mammograms or other screenings yet.

202
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,270
But as a person at higher risk, where that cancer can occur at a younger age,

203
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,919
she would start having mammograms and also breast MRI's that give a slightly different

204
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,709
picture of the breast at an age where she typically wouldn't for her family members that

205
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,510
that allows them to have their own genetic testing with this condition because of that

206
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,969
very high risk of stomach cancer and because of the specific type of stomach cancer,

207
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,120
it's extremely hard to detect using screening methods.

208
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,600
The recommendation is that people who have this condition have prophylactic surgery,

209
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,560
meaning having the stomach removed before it can potentially develop a cancer,

210
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,850
and then for any relatives who would qualify for breast screening, that as well.

211
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,050
Okay. Then I want to talk a little bit more specifically about genetic testing for cancer.

212
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:54,830
What that actually looks at when we talk about genetic testing, it is usually a blood or a saliva sample.

213
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,110
There are a couple of other sample types we might use in certain situations, but those are the most common.

214
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,879
They are equally accurate. We mostly use saliva for like patients who don't live locally.

215
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,290
You can't come to a blood draw, but equally accurate results.

216
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:17,210
The purpose of a genetic test is to look for any harmful genetic changes.

217
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:25,490
So called mutations are also called pathogenic variants that affect how the gene works or cause it to not work properly.

218
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,430
So very broadly, if cancer develops with the atypical and uncontrolled division of cells,

219
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:39,919
the genes that are related to hereditary cancer syndromes very broadly,

220
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,160
their job is to try and prevent that from happening, to try and prevent tumors and cancers from forming.

221
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,719
So everyone has the genes linked to these hereditary cancer syndrome.

222
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,920
So everyone has like a bracket has the BRCA1 gene, for example, but it's people where that gene is not working properly,

223
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,590
where it has a pathogenic variant or mutation that actually have a hereditary cancer syndrome.

224
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,700
So that's what the lab is looking for in someone's sample. One of the main purposes of genetic testing.

225
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,020
So, you know, sometimes we have people who are like, well, why would I want to know if I'm at higher risk?

226
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,799
And the reason is that in cancer, it can be really,

227
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,370
really helpful because it can help someone get screenings that they probably wouldn't be having otherwise.

228
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,420
And that could be starting at a younger age. It could be more frequent screenings.

229
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,500
It could be, you know, like a body system or organ that is not included in general population screening.

230
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,840
But with all of that,

231
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:47,959
having them get pretty much personalized or more tailored screenings can be really helpful in either the early detection or prevention of cancer,

232
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:55,670
depending on what organ we're talking about. It can also, for some people like you saw in that video, be used to guide cancer treatment.

233
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,809
So it might affect the type of surgery they have if they're at high risk for a second,

234
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,000
cancer in the same area or might affect the choice of chemotherapy if people

235
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,270
with a certain condition are known to respond better to certain treatments.

236
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,020
In terms of the types of genetic changes that testing is looking for.

237
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,710
What this figure is showing is different genetic variants that can contribute to cancer risk.

238
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:29,200
So on the left side, common variants have what's called low penetrance.

239
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:38,780
So essentially that peak represents things that are pretty common in the population, but probably have a very small effect on cancer risk.

240
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:49,580
So if the average person's risk for ovarian cancer is like 2 to 4% and you have a common variant that changes that to like 2.2 to 4.2%,

241
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:59,510
that is such a small effect size that it is considered low penetrance, meaning that even if it's present,

242
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,350
there's still a low chance that that person is going to get ovarian cancer.

243
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:12,290
What the testing that we typically order in the cancer genetics clinic is looking at is what's called moderate and high penetrance variants.

244
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,750
These are a lot more rare in the population, and the cancer risks are higher.

245
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,969
So examples of that include like a moderate penetrance gene.

246
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:31,549
For example, if someone has a pathogenic variant in an ATM gene, their risk of breast cancer is about twice as high,

247
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,200
about 25% compared to general populations, about 12 and a half percent.

248
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,020
So that's considered moderate penetrance.

249
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,860
That person is still at higher risk than average and high enough that it's worth doing extra screening for them.

250
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:54,650
But overall, most of those people, like if you flip that number around, if the risk is 25%, 75% are not getting that cancer.

251
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,690
And then at the tail end, genes that have what's called high penetrance,

252
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:05,150
meaning a high chance that a person will develop cancer if they have that particular genetic change.

253
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,470
That can include something like the BRCA1 gene I mentioned earlier.

254
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,750
Again, with a general risk for ovarian cancer of 2 to 4% of people with that condition are more in the 20 to 40% range.

255
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,970
So a relative risk that's high enough that it falls under that high penetrance example.

256
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,740
Then I just want to provide this for some context. But mechanics are not super important to remember.

257
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:39,810
But just as a reminder. Overview. Our body is made up of whole bunch of cells and you saw this in the video as well.

258
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:49,530
Those cells have chromosomes inside them and that's where our DNA is housed, which has all of our genes and the role of genes in the body.

259
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,430
They are made up of different letters, A, G and C,

260
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,620
and those letters kind of act as something that can be read through providing instructions to make a protein product.

261
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,290
Proteins have different roles in the body,

262
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:13,800
so the proteins related to genes linked to hereditary cancer syndromes generally their role is to try and prevent tumors from developing.

263
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:24,840
When there is a typo or a change in one of the letters in those genes, it can be something that causes the gene to not work properly.

264
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:32,310
So very broadly, two different kinds of mutations or pathogenic variants shown here.

265
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,360
So if you're starting with a sentence the car was read,

266
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,050
you can have like a single letter that's different where red becomes r, d, d, so no longer makes sense.

267
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,000
And then you can also have changes where part of the gene is missing or duplicated.

268
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,510
So in this example, the car was red. If you take out the word car that represents part of the gene being missing,

269
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,280
if the change in the gene is harmful or pathogenic, that will affect how the protein product is made.

270
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,670
And if it's not made properly, it can't do its usual role in the body or in some cases can't do it as effectively.

271
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:18,260
This is just a simplified example of how genetic testing or timeline of how genetic testing has changed over time.

272
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,030
So genetic testing has been around for a while, but not to the same degree it is now.

273
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:35,320
The BRCA1 and two genes were among the first to have genetic testing available and even the technology associated with testing has changed.

274
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:45,010
So the example in 1996, sequencing would be a test that could look for any letters that have been changed, like any single letters in a gene sequence.

275
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:55,390
The update in 2006 for large rearrangement analysis would be able to look for any pieces of the gene that were deleted or duplicated.

276
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:02,270
That is the norm for every gene. Now, when you send genetic testing, that would include both of those analyzes.

277
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,050
But I'm going to provide an example of why that is really important.

278
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:16,240
One other piece is that historically it was very, very common to test for a single hereditary cancer syndrome or a single gene at one time.

279
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,270
And then if that was negative, move on to the next one, etc.

280
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,649
There used to be a lab that had a patent on the BRCA genes, meaning no other labs could test for them.

281
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:34,120
And that patent was overturned in 2013, which really paved the way for labs to start offering multi gene panels,

282
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,870
meaning able to test multiple genes all at the same time.

283
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:45,100
All in one test. So first example of why updated genetic testing can be useful.

284
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,540
This is what's called a pedigree. It's basically a family history.

285
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,310
And circles represent females. Squares represent males.

286
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,299
Individuals who are linked by a straight line are married.

287
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,890
And then individuals who are coming down off of different lines are siblings.

288
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,670
So the individual with the blue arrow was seen at our clinic.

289
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,230
And just to give an overview of what's happening in the families, I know it's pretty small.

290
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,190
She had a sibling who had a brain tumor at age 12.

291
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:20,410
She had two aunts who each had breast and ovarian cancer.

292
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:27,280
She had a cousin all through her dad's side who had breast and pancreatic cancer and then had more distant relatives.

293
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,500
There's also an individual with pancreatic cancer, as well as several cousins who had melanomas in their late teens and twenties.

294
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:43,780
So she first came to our clinic at age 35. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer and because of the young age was sent over to us.

295
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:53,290
This was in 2005. So testing was pretty limited and she had just the BRCA one and two sequencing, which was negative, no genetic cause.

296
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,490
She then developed a second cancer about five years later,

297
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:06,310
a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and ended up coming back to our clinic where we were able to do updated BRCA testing,

298
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:15,190
which actually showed that she was positive or had a pathogenic variant in the BRCA one gene piece of the gene was missing,

299
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,520
so it couldn't have been picked up by the technology in 2005.

300
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:27,070
And she actually had a second genetic change in a gene called CDK and to a which is linked to higher risks of pancreatic cancer,

301
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:35,270
melanoma and certain head and neck cancers. In this case, this made a pretty big difference in her medical care.

302
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,739
So screening for breast cancer and any remaining breast tissue and then screening for pancreatic cancer,

303
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,389
which is not done in the general population at all. So wouldn't have happened otherwise.

304
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:54,170
And regular skin checks to look for any signs of melanoma because of the high risk of ovarian cancer.

305
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,260
She had surgery to remove her fallopian tubes and ovaries and then a bunch of her family members have

306
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,930
had genetic testing and have implemented their own cancer screenings for those who are positive.

307
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:18,010
So examples of why multi gene panels are so useful for someone who is diagnosed with breast cancer like the patient who I just showed.

308
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:25,150
There are a lot of different genes that can cause higher risk for breast cancer if there is a pathogenic mutation.

309
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:32,740
And this is true. Most cancer types tend to have multiple genes that can cause higher risk if they're affected.

310
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:41,950
So when someone comes in to see us with breast cancer, some of these genetic changes or changes in these genes might be more common or we

311
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,960
might be more suspicious of them based on specific features of the patient's cancer.

312
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:52,150
But it is extremely, extremely useful to be able to test all of them at once,

313
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,830
basically, so that if you've ruled out the things you're most suspicious of,

314
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,089
you can also rule out the things that are still kind of on your list,

315
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:08,290
but not necessarily things that you would test for if you were limited in your options, like if you could only look at one or two or three genes.

316
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:18,370
Similarly, genetic changes in genes that are harmful can be linked to risks for multiple cancer types.

317
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,399
So the Tp53 gene is linked to a condition called Leif Romney syndrome when it has a

318
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,170
pathogenic variant and that can cause a higher risk of a lot of different cancer types,

319
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:37,629
probably for most hereditary cancer syndromes. We monitor people for between like 2 to 5 different cancer risks,

320
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:44,560
meaning that cancer risks are considered high enough that it's worth doing screening for Leif Romine that's a lot higher.

321
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:52,360
So people will have like whole body MRI's in addition to some dedicated organ specific screening like freedom fries or colonoscopy,

322
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:59,860
but very, very useful because, you know, we can have situations where, for example,

323
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:08,860
someone is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which can be caused by pathogenic variants and the BRCA one and two genes,

324
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,780
but could also be caused by pathogenic variants related to Lynch syndrome or other conditions.

325
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,410
And it is really useful to be able to look at all of those at once.

326
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,960
There are a ton of options for cancer genetic testing.

327
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:35,380
What the table on the right shows is just a list of, I think, about 60 genes and whether there are guidelines available for medical management or not.

328
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:45,660
So the first column sorry, the first column after the gene list goes over recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

329
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,500
They have a list of genes where it is recommended that, you know,

330
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:55,989
labs or research studies or whoever is doing testing always report out pathogenic variants because

331
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,980
they can make a really big difference in someone's health care and potentially be life saving.

332
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,830
The next column is a list of genes that have National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

333
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,929
That is one of the main organizations that people in genetic counseling will reference,

334
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,710
particularly if you don't work with physicians, which we do in our clinic.

335
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:26,320
But they have very good guidelines for how to manage people with certain genetic conditions and when to consider genetic testing.

336
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:34,220
Then the last column is which genes have guidelines for medical management in other places.

337
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:40,990
So for example, genetic conditions in general are considered rare, but there are some that are like super, super rare.

338
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,089
And in that case, it may be that there's not a national guideline that has recommendations,

339
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,680
but there is like an organization that focuses on this condition that has recommendations.

340
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,790
So really difficult to know how to manage people with some of these conditions.

341
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,129
Labs that offer multi gene panel testing, a lot of them kind of group genes together by cancer risk.

342
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:08,770
So genes that cause higher risk of colon cancer, genes that cause higher risk of kidney cancer, etc.

343
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:17,629
What is sometimes tricky is that different labs might have different genes, even related to the same cancer types.

344
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:23,520
So one lab might have a colon cancer panel with 19 genes, another one might have one with 21 genes.

345
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:31,930
So it is sometimes challenging to pass through all those tests and figure out which one is the best one for your patient.

346
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:39,030
Labs also differ in their flexibility, I would say, to mix and match things.

347
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,999
So for people who have maybe a personal history of colon cancer at 25, but their mother had breast cancer at 35,

348
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,080
you would want to do like a colon panel and a breast panel to sort of cover everything.

349
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,590
And what is becoming a lot more common is doing more broad panels that also look

350
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,840
for cancer risks that aren't necessarily present in a person or their family,

351
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,230
but can technically be tested for, and if they were found, would have a change in that person's medical management.

352
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:18,100
Labs also sometimes offer genes where there's limited evidence about what their cancer risks are.

353
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:23,230
So it could be that it's like a newly discovered gene. And there's not just a there's not a ton of data.

354
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,180
It could be that there are conflicting studies about whether it causes higher cancer risk or not.

355
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,319
So things like that, where even if it's found now,

356
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,750
there's probably not guidelines available for how it would change your patient's medical care, but might in the future.

357
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:50,350
And then lastly, this is less of an issue now, but before it was common to do sequencing and rearrangement analysis for all genes,

358
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:57,880
it was really particularly important to make sure that the lab offered ideally the most up to date way to analyze those genes.

359
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,760
This just kind of illustrates some of the complexities about what different genetic testing options are.

360
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:14,820
So genes that have the highest risks for cancers generally, there is extremely good evidence for changing someone's medical care,

361
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,140
and it's been shown that that can really prevent cancers or detect them early and save lives.

362
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,960
For genes that have that moderate risk. So I mentioned that one earlier that has about two fold increase in breast cancer risk.

363
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:37,589
There's enough evidence to do extra screening, but sometimes there are questions about like the vast majority of these people are going to

364
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:43,530
have kind of like lifelong extra screenings but not actually develop a cancer so slightly,

365
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:52,049
I guess less evidence than the genes that have the highest risk. And then the low risk kind of covers things where the cancer risks are elevated

366
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,460
but not much higher than general population or the cancer risks are uncertain.

367
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:05,550
It is a lot more difficult to know what to do in those situations, especially if there aren't great like national guidelines to follow.

368
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,980
So I want to provide an example of why Multi-Hued panels are extremely helpful.

369
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:21,770
That's another family history up here. The patient with the Green Arrow is a 63 year old who had prostate cancer at 51.

370
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,320
Some non-melanoma skin cancers at 58 and pancreatic cancer at 63.

371
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:35,629
Also had a sister with pancreatic cancer at 58. Another sister with kidney cancer at 58 who also had colon polyps.

372
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:43,760
And then his father had colon cancer at 61, an unknown cancer in his grandmother when he passed at 60 sorry, 57.

373
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,120
And his mother had uterine cancer at 80. So a lot of different conditions on that.

374
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:57,520
We would consider. Those include Lynch syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, hereditary melanoma,

375
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,540
pancreatic cancer syndrome, and then other causes of pancreatic cancers that might run in families.

376
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:09,049
So all of these cancer syndromes to some extent include higher risk of pancreatic cancer,

377
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:14,660
and some of them include higher risk of some of the cancers seen in the family as well, like prostate or colon cancer.

378
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:23,800
So this patient had a ton of different genetic testing done that covers most of the genes I listed on the last slide.

379
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:32,470
He saw our clinic several times and overall had a nine month process with testing sent to five different labs,

380
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,440
required him to get five different blood draws.

381
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:42,970
It required us to put in four different pre-authorization requests and overall cost over $10,000 in testing,

382
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,740
which obviously multi gene panels were not available at the time that he was seen,

383
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:54,129
but would have been extremely helpful for a case like this one where you're suspicious of

384
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,660
multiple conditions and suspicious enough to keep doing more and more and more testing.

385
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,180
But doing it all at once is a lot, a lot more efficient.

386
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,870
I mentioned earlier that sometimes people opt to do more broad panels that

387
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,730
also include genes that may not be directly related to cancers in the family.

388
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,750
For example, if they come in for a personal and family history of colon cancer,

389
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,849
but do a more broad panel that includes not only genes linked to that cancer,

390
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:31,030
but also to something like kidney cancer, breast cancers, prostate, kind of covering it all in general.

391
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:39,010
Whenever people do have mutations or pathogenic variants, it tends to match up with what's going on in their personal or family history.

392
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,590
So even people who opt for more extensive testing, we don't tend to get a lot of surprises.

393
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:51,970
While it does match up with their personal or family history, sometimes it is discordant from why they were sent over.

394
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:59,440
So I mentioned ovarian cancer can be linked to, for example, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome.

395
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,380
So someone might be sent over for a personal history of breast cancer, a family history of ovarian cancer.

396
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:12,969
So the suspicion may be for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, but they may actually have Lynch syndrome.

397
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,220
So it kind of makes sense based on what's in the family,

398
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,379
but isn't necessarily like the first condition we think of or the first condition they're referring.

399
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:28,480
Dr. Thought of. One paper I just pulled information from looked at patients who met criteria for

400
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,130
genetic testing for Lynch syndrome and a pretty big sample like over 1000 patients.

401
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:42,250
And 9% of those patients actually had Lynch syndrome, whereas five and a half percent had totally different hereditary cancer syndromes.

402
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:52,300
And looking at this paper, I think about half of those had met criteria for the syndrome, which they had positive testing for, and about half didn't.

403
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:57,549
So a good chunk of these would have been missed if testing only included the genes

404
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,330
related to Lynch syndrome because they actually had a totally different condition.

405
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:11,350
Then I want to briefly touch on informed consent. This is a pretty important part of what we do in a genetic counseling session.

406
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,320
The laws on whether this is required differ by state.

407
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,770
It is required to get informed consent in Michigan for a predictive genetic test.

408
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,780
And the language I have up here is pulled from the specific bill that goes over this.

409
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,430
But for anyone essentially that has not developed cancer,

410
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,979
any genetic testing about cancer risk is predictive because it is information about the

411
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,530
probability that they will develop a genetic cancer or genetics related cancer in the future.

412
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,740
So we need to get signed informed consent from all of those individuals before they have testing.

413
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,890
And there is some guidance in the bill as well as from the National Society of Genetic Counselors about what all that entails.

414
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:04,200
Once someone has genetic testing, I mentioned it is looking for any genetic changes that basically cause the gene to not work properly.

415
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:10,800
So this is just an example of what potential genetic test results can look like.

416
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:19,350
What the lab is doing with a patient's sample is comparing it to what is called a reference or a normal sample,

417
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:26,520
which is supposed to represent basically a large chunk of people who don't have hereditary cancer syndromes.

418
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,150
So all the genes related to cancer risk are working as they should.

419
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:38,610
So no hereditary risk for cancer? When patients have testing done, different variants or changes can come up.

420
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,320
A variant is just something that is different from the reference sample.

421
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,749
Variants can be benign or likely benign, meaning that there may be a difference in a letter in the gene,

422
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:55,850
but it doesn't actually affect the protein product that's produced and doesn't affect how the gene works.

423
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,040
Like someone has green eyes, someone has blue eyes.

424
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,430
Those are genetic differences, but they're not they're not going to affect a person's cancer risk or health.

425
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:12,950
At the other end of the spectrum, a pathogenic genetic change is one that causes the gene to not work properly and

426
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,690
likely pathogenic is falls under the same umbrella and then right in the middle.

427
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:25,640
It is not uncommon to get what is called a variant of uncertain significance, which is essentially an inconclusive result.

428
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:33,530
That means that a person has a genetic change that is different than the reference sample,

429
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:40,910
but it is not clear if it causes the gene to not work properly or if it does absolutely nothing.

430
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,819
I will say labs continue to look at these over time and as they continue to look at them,

431
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,200
they do get more information and are sometimes able to issue new reports.

432
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,380
And most often when they issue new reports, they find that these uncertain findings are truly benign.

433
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:05,479
But it definitely represents an issue because they are pretty common and can be worrisome for some patients

434
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:11,030
knowing that they have like this inconclusive finding that even if it is kind of looking like it's benign,

435
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,140
it's still something that is sort of not resolved with their testing.

436
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,040
And the reason these come up is typically that there just isn't information on that specific

437
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,570
genetic change or there's conflicting information about whether it is harmful or not.

438
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:35,150
What I want to show with these charts here is basically that more genetic testing means lower variant of uncertain significance rates.

439
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,300
So this shows that over time,

440
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:46,640
the rate of variance of uncertain significance found declined quite significantly because as more and more testing is done,

441
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,160
they kind of have more and more normal variation that they know doesn't cause higher cancer risk.

442
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:57,770
But what these figures also show is that the lowest rates of uncertain significance

443
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:03,380
tend to be in European individuals and as well as ethnic Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

444
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,960
But that is generally because these populations have had the most testing done.

445
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:15,350
So there is a better sense of what is considered normal or benign in those populations,

446
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,760
whereas for other groups there hasn't been as much genetic testing done.

447
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,410
So there's really not as good representation of the spectrum of what is normal.

448
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:35,240
This finding has been repeated by many other labs. So this is something that was presented by one of the major cancer genetic testing labs in 2015.

449
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:45,470
Two points from this slide. What is listed on the left is just the name of different genetic testing panels, kind of based on the organ system.

450
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:54,110
They focus on the numbers next to the panel show how many genes are on each panel and they're like loosely organized from smallest to largest.

451
00:52:54,110 --> 00:53:03,079
Not exactly. And then the one thing I want to point out is that in general, the more genes that are included on a panel,

452
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:11,030
the more likely it is to get a variant of uncertain significance, and that is represented in the overall percentage on the right side.

453
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:19,850
A couple of reasons for that. So one is just the more you look at it, the more likely it is that one of these findings is going to come up.

454
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:27,770
But also, these larger tests tend to have more genes that have been studied for fewer years.

455
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,050
So again, there's just less idea or less known about what is considered normal.

456
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,149
And this study also, or this lab also found that, again,

457
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:43,760
the variant of uncertain significance rates were lower for white individuals for all of their tests.

458
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,090
Once someone has genetic testing, it usually takes about three weeks to get results.

459
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:58,670
And then I, as the genetic counselor with the provider, will communicate the results as well as any medical management recommendations to patients.

460
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,850
Our clinic works with physicians, so they tend to make the medical management recommendations that I pass on.

461
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,749
I'll talk more specifically about hereditary cancer syndromes, but very briefly, if someone has one,

462
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,650
we talk to them about what their increased screening is tailored to that condition,

463
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,490
and talk to them about sharing this information with their family members.

464
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,100
If someone has something going on in their personal or family history,

465
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,800
but there's no genetic cause identified, they may still be eligible for increased screening.

466
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:37,760
So examples include if someone has a history of a precancerous colon polyp,

467
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,490
they may get colonoscopies more often than the average person, even if they don't have a genetic cause for that.

468
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,150
Or if someone has a first degree relative with colon cancer, they may also get colonoscopies more frequently than the average person,

469
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:54,620
even if there's no genetic testing that identified something going on there.

470
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,280
And then if the genetic test is completely negative, so no risk identified.

471
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,400
And also, there's nothing in the family or personal history that warrants any other recommendations.

472
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:14,840
Those individuals typically are getting general population cancer screening because nothing that is indicating to us that they're at higher risk.

473
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,310
For people who get a positive result. And this is a sample report from the lab website, not a real patients report,

474
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:31,830
but this is what it would look like for a patient who's been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome related to one of the genes linked to that condition.

475
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,290
In this case, it could change a patient's current medical care.

476
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,140
So if they've been diagnosed with cancer,

477
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,350
it's no wonder that people with Lynch syndrome may respond better to certain types of chemotherapies or drugs.

478
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:52,589
And then if they have not been diagnosed with cancer or in remission or past cancer,

479
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:58,560
then talking about screenings or prophylactic surgery is for cancer prevention or early detection.

480
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,890
So that's an example of where people benefit a lot from starting colonoscopies earlier and more frequently,

481
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,420
and for the risk of gynecological cancers like uterine or ovarian cancer.

482
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,330
There's not great screening for that. So that falls under the prophylactic surgery category.

483
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,580
What's also extremely important is talking about genetic testing and relatives.

484
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:28,980
So broadly, if only one person in the family has had genetic testing that showed a hereditary condition,

485
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:38,760
the more closely related a person is to that first person, the higher risk they have of sharing that same hereditary cancer syndrome.

486
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:46,950
So for most hereditary cancer syndromes, first degree relatives have a 50% chance of having that same condition.

487
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:55,520
So parents, siblings, kids. And then once they have testing, it tells us a lot more about whether other relatives are at risk.

488
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,120
So if it's found to be maternally inherited, so inherited from the father, then, you know,

489
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,160
like none of the maternal relatives need genetic testing, but the paternal relatives do.

490
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:09,690
And then for family members, their medical recommendations would depend on their results.

491
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:15,900
If they don't have the hereditary cancer syndrome. Most commonly, they're getting general population screening.

492
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,620
And if they do have it, they're getting that increased and earlier screening.

493
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:30,300
So cascade screening or cascade testing is what happens or what we hope happens once someone is found to have a hereditary cancer syndrome.

494
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:39,420
This represents an extremely important population, particularly thinking about public health goals of reducing disease.

495
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:46,560
So cascade screening or cascade testing is when once a hereditary cancer syndrome is identified,

496
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,150
we want the testing to cascade out and we want the rest of that person's family to get their own genetic testing as well.

497
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:01,130
This is extremely important for potentially the early detection or prevention of cancers.

498
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,140
So in families where cascade testing has been done really successfully,

499
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:12,610
you can see families where like older generations have quite a bit of cancer and the younger generations who found out about the

500
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:20,380
hereditary cancer syndrome may have less cancer because they've been taking advantage of anything for early detection or prevention.

501
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:28,330
It is also super useful in terms of thinking about kind of making sure the right person is getting the right test.

502
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:37,060
So in this example, if the individual with the blue arrow was found to have Lynch syndrome, you can see that two of his kids have been tested.

503
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:43,030
One was positive. So knowing that her son should also get testing was positive as well.

504
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,510
But one of the original people's children was negative, meaning he does not have Lynch syndrome.

505
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,790
And then we know that any kids he has, he has don't need genetic testing.

506
00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:00,790
So don't need that medical test done because he doesn't have Lynch syndrome and can't pass down what you do not have.

507
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,440
But overall, this is really, really, really useful.

508
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,500
And one of the main benefits of genetic testing is once a hereditary cancer syndrome is found,

509
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:19,979
that passing that knowledge on to the rest of the family. Even though this is really useful.

510
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:28,200
Tool studies that have been done in the US have shown that about 70 to 90% of first degree relatives,

511
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:37,260
so those highest risk individuals are actually informed about the condition and then only about 30 to 60% end up getting their own genetic testing.

512
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,119
There are certain things that have been found that are predictors of who gets testing.

513
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:49,080
So our clinic at least gives out like educational resources to patients when a condition is diagnosed.

514
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:54,450
So passing those on to family members, if a family member receives some kind of resource,

515
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,969
a female gender, having loving children and having a family history of cancer,

516
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:05,670
those people are more likely to get cascade testing once they're informed about a genetic condition in the family.

517
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:12,430
Then I have one more video I want to show, which is about 4 minutes, which talks about cascade testing.

518
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,080
And I think. This features some people from Michigan.

519
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:24,080
And this also talks to the stats about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome,

520
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,450
but also talks about a non-cancer condition called familial hypercholesterolemia.

521
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:36,229
What all three of these conditions have in common is they are public health priorities because they are relatively common and

522
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:43,820
have pretty effective screenings that can help produce much better health outcomes if people know about these conditions early.

523
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:12,920
Just on the topic of Cascade screening, what most often happens is once someone is diagnosed with a hereditary cancer syndrome,

524
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:21,020
they're provided some sort of notification, particularly if they're seen at a genetics clinic or what to share with their close relatives.

525
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,239
We hope that they talk to their relatives about it and encourage their family members to come in.

526
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:33,020
And then their family members obviously can make their own decision about what they do this because this is such a priority.

527
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:39,830
There have been a bunch of studies about different interventions that might help increase the number of people getting cascade testing.

528
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:48,260
These include sending a pretest video directly to relatives alongside low cost testing.

529
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,849
It includes direct contact from genetics teams.

530
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:58,459
So basically the original person provides their family members contact genetics, contacts them,

531
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:07,010
does phone counseling and sense of why the kit so everything done from their home and offering free genetic testing for these first two interventions.

532
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:17,090
They led to uptakes kind of at the high end of that 30 to 60% range for the free genetic testing program that was measured in a different way,

533
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:26,540
which they found that 16 to 18% of people with a hereditary cancer syndrome had at least one relative pursue free testing,

534
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:30,290
which obviously is a lot lower than we'd like to see it gotten.

535
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:36,320
Part of the benefit of doing this testing is knowing that it can go through families and help prevent cancers.

536
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,760
One example of this and these case examples are all people that we've seen in our clinic, real people.

537
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:49,450
But one example of this is we originally saw the individual with the black arrow in our clinic

538
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:55,630
for genetic testing based on a family history of her mother having two different colon cancers,

539
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:04,030
colon polyps and a skin finding that can be related to Lynch syndrome, as well as a cousin with stomach cancer at a young age.

540
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:10,299
So that first person was found to have Lynch syndrome, and all three of her kids ended up coming in for testing.

541
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,590
But the one I now focus on is the 37 year old male with the blue arrow.

542
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,690
He did end up having testing for Lynch syndrome, was found to have that condition.

543
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:27,040
And because of the higher risk of colon and stomach cancers at the age of 37 had a colonoscopy.

544
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,160
Looking at the colon and an upper endoscopy which looks at the stomach.

545
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:37,870
He had four colon polyps removed, including a precancerous polyp that was fairly large.

546
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:41,440
Anything over ten mm is considered big. So this was 17.

547
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:49,530
This is pretty significant because we know that people with Lynch syndrome, colon polyps can grow more quickly compared to the average person.

548
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,940
That's why they go for colonoscopy so frequently.

549
01:07:52,630 --> 01:08:00,340
And without a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, this patient wouldn't have been recommended to have colonoscopy until the general population age.

550
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,320
So this polyp very likely would have developed into a colon cancer before then.

551
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,280
So a great example of how this can actually be lifesaving.

552
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:17,239
Then I have a few other kind of miscellaneous topics and I just had like two or three slides on talking a

553
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:23,330
little bit about how our clinic works with the state public health department and initiatives that they have.

554
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:33,140
So one of their initiatives is a statewide basically registry that looks at how cancer genetics counseling and genetic testing services are used.

555
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:38,390
So genetics clinics, cancer genetics clinics from around the state all submit data to this.

556
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:44,870
So a couple examples of how this has been used is one of these older studies looked at

557
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:49,340
why patients are declining genetic testing if they choose not to move forward with it.

558
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:58,670
And then a more recent study we did, one of the genetic counselors in my clinic worked with DHHS to get information about,

559
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,950
based on the breakdown of races and ethnicities in the state of Michigan,

560
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:10,040
how does that compare to people who are actually getting genetic counseling and to genetic testing services?

561
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:16,360
So obviously, the information collected statewide is a lot more powerful than information we have just from our clinic.

562
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,780
So this is a really good resource.

563
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:27,630
Other things that we work with them on or things that they do through their cancer genomics arm, different patient and provider educational programs.

564
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:32,660
So for example, people with hereditary cancer syndromes that predispose them to colon cancer.

565
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:37,270
We've had a couple of family day conferences where patients sign up.

566
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:45,140
We have someone from the genetics team talk. We have like a nutritionist, surgeon, gastroenterologist.

567
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,690
So a lot of different people talk all at once,

568
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:53,960
all at this conference geared towards families with increased risk, hereditary increased risk for cancer.

569
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,060
And those are done in conjunction with DHHS.

570
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:04,970
We have similar educational programs for providers. They have a ton of resources online for patients and providers.

571
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:12,980
They help with public awareness. So there are certain weeks of the year that are designated like Lynch Syndrome Awareness Week, for example,

572
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,920
and they'll have like a governor's proclamation trying to spread awareness about those weeks.

573
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,999
They also have a hereditary cancer hotline because they do have a genetic

574
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,500
counselor whose job it is specifically to work with the public health department

575
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:32,690
on the Cancer Genomics side to help keep all of these things updated and answer

576
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:37,190
any questions from a hereditary cancer hotline which actually comes up.

577
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:41,750
If you Google certain pretty generic words and just put in Michigan, it's like the first result.

578
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,130
So that is really useful.

579
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:56,000
One program that we have going on now or one study is family history is a pretty important tool in some cancer types in deciding to refer or not.

580
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:05,600
But for people diagnosed with cancer, less than 30% of oncology practices are documenting an appropriate family history.

581
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,280
So our clinics working with MDA,

582
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:15,920
HHS and clinics across the state oncology clinics to try and help that happen more often and help get more comprehensive

583
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,490
family histories since it can really affect whether someone gets referred for genetics or not having that extra information.

584
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:32,620
Totally different topic. I want to touch on everything that I talked about today in terms of genetic testing falls into the top row.

585
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:39,290
The type of genetic counseling, genetic testing that genetic counselors order is considered inherited or germline testing.

586
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:47,450
So again, looks at blood or saliva, is looking for any genetic changes a person was born with that could increase the risk for cancer.

587
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:54,620
There is a totally, totally separate type of genetic testing that is performed on a person's tumor.

588
01:11:54,770 --> 01:12:00,110
So it can only be done in someone who's been diagnosed with cancer and is usually ordered by their oncologist.

589
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:11,170
What that is looking for the tumor genetic testing is any changes in a person's tumor that basically led to them developing cancer.

590
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,140
So genetic changes that were acquired over the course of their lifetime,

591
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:20,360
not things that they were born with and not things that can be passed on to family members.

592
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:24,800
This is not new technology, but new.

593
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:29,540
So definitely something to be aware of when at least when I'm looking at patients records and they're like,

594
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,960
Oh, they had genetic testing, I'm like, okay, but what kind of they had already?

595
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:42,240
The purpose of that genetic testing ordered by oncologists on tumors is to help potentially personalize treatment.

596
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:51,090
So we know that everyone, not everyone who has the same type of cancer responds to the same treatment, even if they look the same on the surface.

597
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:58,649
So in this example, an individual has known to have ovarian cancer based on studies that have been done in mice models, for example,

598
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:06,930
trying different drugs to see what that specific tumor might respond to based on DNA sequencing in that patient's tumor,

599
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:11,099
they are predicted to respond the best to that one drug.

600
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,740
So they'd be given that drug as opposed to just giving everyone with the same diagnosis the same care.

601
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,190
This has also provided an opportunity for genetic counselors to get involved.

602
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:27,040
This is a really commonly ordered test for patients at the cancer center here.

603
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:35,950
And although the purpose is to look for changes that are only present in the tumor and not in other places in the body,

604
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:43,540
about 20% of patients who have this testing have some sort of finding in the tumor where there's some

605
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:49,779
suspicion that it might actually be a hereditary cancer syndrome related finding that has basically come up,

606
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:55,540
incidentally. So this is when I was mentioning, like patients who come for follow up for certain results.

607
01:13:55,540 --> 01:14:02,770
Sometimes we see people who've had this testing that has incidentally identified someone who may have a hereditary cancer syndrome.

608
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:11,849
Other things thinking about. So genetic testing a lot of times is accessed by genetics providers.

609
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:17,220
If someone sees a genetics clinic which might be staffed by genetic counselors, geneticists,

610
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:24,630
other specialty physicians like our clinic has a few gastroenterologists and an endocrinologist we work with,

611
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:32,760
or sometimes advanced practice providers like there are genetics nurses that work at some smaller hospitals that don't have genetic counselors.

612
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:40,000
So that's a really common way to have genetic testing ordered. It can also be ordered by a non genetics provider.

613
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:50,520
And in cancer cancer related testing specifically, that's probably most common through oncologists and then also OBGYNs.

614
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,290
Like if people report family histories of breast or ovarian cancer, that's another really common place.

615
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,410
They might have genetic testing done related to cancer risk.

616
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:06,180
Within the past few years. Companies have also launched where you can order like clinical grade genetic testing yourself.

617
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,640
Some of these companies will require your primary care doctor to sign off on that order.

618
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:16,170
Some of them provide their own physicians, but it is possible.

619
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,140
Then there's kind of direct to consumer genetic testing.

620
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,940
23 and me specifically provides information about things like five or six different genetic variants,

621
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,930
not different genes, but very specific variants in those genes.

622
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,660
And then certain research studies.

623
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:44,460
I know the all of us is a pretty recent one may return information about cancer risk when you give them a sample and when they perform testing on it.

624
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:50,280
These should always be confirmed with clinical testing, recreational or research results.

625
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:57,599
These samples are typically not held to the same standard as labs in terms of making sure there's no sample mix ups,

626
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,989
making sure the samples are handled appropriately and things like that.

627
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:04,290
So these labs themselves typically will be like, yes, you should confirm this.

628
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:12,670
One example of this is a 35 year old patient who had done 23 of me and then basically taken

629
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:18,100
the genetic data that they returned to him and put it through a third party software.

630
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:26,770
And that third party software appeared to show a pathogenic variant in a gene called MLH one linked to Lynch Syndrome.

631
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:30,489
He also had a family history that looked like it could match up.

632
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:40,630
So a paternal aunt who had ovarian cancer, 58 in paternal uncle with colon cancer at 38 and a paternal man with uterine cancer at 55.

633
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:48,040
Because this testing basically needed to be confirmed, we ended up ordering genetic testing for him,

634
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,060
which included not only this gene, but also a few others based on the family history.

635
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,379
And it was completely negative. So had he not had this follow up testing and not been seen by a genetics clinic,

636
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:06,550
it is possible that some of his providers may have ordered incorrect screening for him and something like colonoscopy.

637
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:12,910
There definitely risks with it, but overall, fairly benign for individuals with ovaries.

638
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:17,710
Uterus who have Lynch syndrome could potentially have led to an unnecessary preventative surgery.

639
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:24,270
And then I'm going to close out, talking a little bit about future directions in the field.

640
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:35,910
One thing that I think I may have alluded to is the criteria for who should have genetic testing change quite a lot over time.

641
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,340
They tend to get broader and broader, which is really good in terms of thinking about access and coverage,

642
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:46,110
but makes it difficult to narrow down who should see genetics.

643
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:51,570
So the most commonly followed guidelines are through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

644
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:58,290
But then a bunch of disease specific or specialty specific organizations have their own guidelines as well.

645
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:04,470
Then on top of that, insurance companies may have separate criteria for what they will cover or not cover,

646
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:10,560
but those criteria do continue to expand all the time.

647
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:19,770
An example of why this can be a little bit tricky is a particular type of tumor called a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

648
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:28,470
They very recently released new guidelines stating that everyone that has this type of tumor should have genetic testing.

649
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,850
Based on a couple of studies where 60 to 70% of people had a hereditary cancer syndrome who had this tumor type.

650
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:45,630
Before that recommendation came out. Really, we were most suspicious about a hereditary cause if a person had a syndromic presentation.

651
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:55,050
So maybe a pancreatic tumor and kidney cancer or that tumor and other findings, but by itself, not usually suspicious.

652
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:05,310
These studies did basically larger tests that looked at a whole lot of genes that weren't necessarily known to be linked to this cancer type,

653
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:11,640
and found that almost a fifth of patients had a hereditary cancer syndrome.

654
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:19,349
What is interesting about these studies is less than 20% of people with genetic pathogenic variants

655
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:25,629
were actually in genes that were linked to or known to be linked to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,

656
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:34,560
a hereditary risk. Most of them were linked to kind of those like low to moderate risk, more still rare, but more common genetic risk findings.

657
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:38,620
So there's a question of like, is this a coincidence?

658
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:44,340
Is this an example of early kind of population screening that maybe these lower risk are

659
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:48,600
low to moderate risk findings are more common than we thought for some of those genes,

660
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,259
is it possible they actually do cause a predisposition to this disease?

661
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:56,160
And we don't know about it and it is appropriate to do a genetic testing for all of them.

662
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:01,410
So that is definitely a challenge along those same lines.

663
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:11,550
Population screening of healthy people has been suggested, particularly for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch Syndrome.

664
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:18,270
Those conditions of the hereditary cancer syndromes have among some of the highest risks.

665
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,590
And as far as hereditary cancer syndromes go are pretty common.

666
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:26,940
And they all have really good or they both have really good guidelines about

667
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:32,010
really effective medical procedures and screenings that can reduce cancer risk,

668
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:39,000
not population screening per se. But people can now provide samples to a ton of different research studies,

669
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,990
many of which will offer to return your genetic data, which you can plug into a software or some research results.

670
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:53,970
This has become another way that people are kind of finding out about hereditary cancer risk they didn't know was there,

671
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,990
although these results should always be confirmed. Clinical testing.

672
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:05,250
And then finally, what is a little bit newer in the field is looking at something called polygenic risk scores.

673
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:09,060
So this focuses on common low penetrance variants.

674
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:16,380
I mentioned earlier, you know, one of these variants by itself really doesn't affect a person's cancer risk much.

675
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:23,190
But let's say a person has several low penetrance variants that all increase the risk for breast cancer.

676
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:30,720
That person cumulatively may end up having a risk of breast cancer that is high enough to warrant increased screening.

677
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:40,530
This testing is, I guess, has been considered for quite a while, but in terms of being available clinically is kind of an infancy stage.

678
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,360
It also has a lot of issues.

679
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:50,280
Most of the studies that have led to conclusions about these low penetrance variants are in people who are of European descent.

680
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:55,200
But that doesn't really the makeup of those studies doesn't really represent the population.

681
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:02,880
So there are issues with interpreting those studies for people who are not of European descent.

682
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:07,770
So that is an issue that is with this polygenic risk scores.

683
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:17,009
There are not really good guidelines for how to manage someone if they do have a polygenic risk score that is high enough to warrant screening.

684
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:22,650
In most situations, it's unclear that that would be like coverage covered or recommended.

685
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:30,729
And also it is currently only available generally only available as part of if you're already ordering a multi gene panel test.

686
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:33,810
And so more difficult to order as a stand alone test.

687
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,920
And the insurance coverage for that is pretty unclear.

688
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:44,519
But that definitely presents a challenge because again, enough of these low penetrance variants affected,

689
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:53,430
they can have a high enough risk to consider screenings, but not anything that we have any guidelines or guidance on at this moment.

690
01:22:55,090 --> 01:23:01,840
And I'm happy to take any questions. I also went through the graduate program here at U of M, so happy to answer questions about that as well.

691
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,380
Yeah. I love the idea of.

692
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:30,790
We don't really like it. Sometimes we see, for example, the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

693
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,480
The highest cancer risks are for people assigned at birth.

694
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:38,080
So there's a family that just happens to have like a lot of males.

695
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:43,509
Then we may not see as much cancer, but they can still have that higher cancer risk.

696
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,660
And there are some risks for men like prostate cancer and others.

697
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:53,800
Yeah, we really got false positives, but because not everyone with a hereditary cancer syndrome will get cancer.

698
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:59,500
Someone may have like an increased risk finding but never develop cancer in their lifetime.

699
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:02,590
So, like, have those extra screenings or just not do anything.

700
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:18,440
Question. Thank you so much for coming.

701
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:29,069
All right, guys, I guess we're doing everything.

702
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:29,851
We shouldn't have it all back to class. Yes.
