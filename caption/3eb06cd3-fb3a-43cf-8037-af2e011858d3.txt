1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,730
Okay. Welcome back. So today we have the second day of the total energy intake topic.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,400
And then remember that was the outline last week and we covered the first part.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,329
Now today we're going to talk about the Decss article and I hope that at least

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,280
you brought up so that it actually proposes to not just for energy intake,

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,439
but instead of reducing energy intake from the sun.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
The question is see physical activity and weight.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,920
And then I'll give you like an example of when not to adjust for total intake, because I told you that even though we do that most of the time,

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:56,010
because we really want to assess that recomposition, there are some situations in which you then have to adjust for the calorie intake.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,889
One is when you have things like eight or nothing say that that happened specifically to me,

10
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,300
then you want adjust for that and this will be another example.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,510
And then we'll work on on the part two of the plan. Okay.

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:23,100
Okay. Any questions so far? Before I move on, as I'm driving your assignments, if you have any questions or there's something that is not clear,

13
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,920
please let me know because I have already graded to right on.

14
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,200
And you probably you haven't told me anything, so I'm assuming that everything is clear.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,260
I write specific comments for you, so if there is anything that is not clear, please let me know also.

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,950
Even if you get like 100%, sometimes I add comments to right here because sometimes that is something they just say.

17
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,249
They say, yeah, that's fine or or that should be better this way.

18
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,450
And that is necessarily not nothing that is wrong. But there is something that I'm adding.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,910
Okay. So, okay, so let's go into the Jake's article.

20
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:08,100
So basically the conclusion of the Jake's article is that physical activity and weight are better

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,180
than energy intake from the food frequency questionnaire when adjusting for that that we can take.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,309
Right. So that was their conclusion. And they have a point, right.

23
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:26,910
So because remember when we were looking at the kind of like contributors, I mean, what is kind of like what total energy intake means?

24
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:37,320
A lot of can remember we cannot really look at this in proportion to studies where we can measure the physical activity and body size.

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,600
Right. So basically they're saying why should we adjust for total energy intake from

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,190
the food frequency questionnaire when we know that it has a lot of error rate?

27
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,469
Because we know that from the first class, right?

28
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,810
That phosphoric acid questionnaires are great at ranking people, but they are terrible at measuring accurately intake.

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,050
Right. So we are measuring the calorie intake also with a lot of error.

30
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:10,860
So why, why why do we have to do that when we have some of the main components of that entity, which is physical activity and weight, right?

31
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,420
So, so let's go over that.

32
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,149
So I have a few questions for you and you have the answer after that.

33
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,320
So you feel free to kind of let me answer it. It's okay. I mean, I just want you to kind of like, you know,

34
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:36,330
discuss and if there's anything that you don't understand or whatever argue is not clear, just let me know.

35
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,690
I mean, this is a safe environment. So you are not I mean, no one is embarrassing yourself, so don't worry.

36
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,420
So I'm assuming that you don't know these things. So then it's okay to say I don't know that.

37
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:48,840
Okay.

38
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:58,260
So, so the question, number one, it's assumed that the errors in measurement of energy expenditure associated with heart rate monitoring, remember,

39
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,930
they are using have a monitoring as the gold standard here they are independent from the errors in

40
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,120
measurement of energy associated with their review and they report the physical activity and wait,

41
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,660
wait, why is this important that the errors are independent and they are not correlated?

42
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,560
And we have seen that before. Yes.

43
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,430
It changed the association value.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,990
It will inflate, right. I mean, when they're correlated, it can inflate the correlation.

45
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:39,649
So then that's why kind of like remember what happened when we were discussing

46
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,709
the paper of the Food Legacy questionnaire that we were comparing the three

47
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,570
full frequency questionnaires and one of the kind of lie things about the

48
00:04:52,790 --> 00:05:01,219
correlations between the blocks of a few and then see a few with the 24 hour course.

49
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:09,320
They were higher than than with Willett and Willett were saying, well, it may be because they are asking for portion size in both.

50
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,120
And portion size has a lot of animals and they are slightly correlated.

51
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
So then maybe because of that correlation, the correlations had actually inflated.

52
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,560
So it's not like the collisions are better. It just the collisions had inflated because of the errors.

53
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,240
Right. So it's kind of like an a brutally inflated.

54
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,330
Right. So that's why that's why this is important.

55
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,590
Okay. So now what you said, because this paper talks about something that you may have not heard before.

56
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,390
So what is that, the attenuated partial correlation coefficient?

57
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,510
Because that's what they are using in their analysis. Right.

58
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,489
Okay. So what is, what is the correlation coefficient that you know?

59
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:08,319
Right. Ah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,730
That's the ecological vision. Yeah, this is so it's a statistic that kind of like looks at the situation between two continues what it was like.

61
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,710
So kind of. So what is a partial correlation coefficient.

62
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,450
Motorola covariance when you adjust for other covariance,

63
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:38,529
so the same as you do in linear regression that you have simple linear regression and then you adjust for comparison.

64
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,310
You have multiple in a region, you can do that with a correlation coefficient,

65
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,260
you can have a simple correlation coefficient and you can have a partial collision coefficient.

66
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,970
And remember that the better for linear regression and degradation coefficient are like causes rise of more or less the same.

67
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,870
So yeah. So now the last one. What is the attenuated?

68
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:20,600
So if now you get rid of with impersonal radiation that that that is what is the detonation of remember the first

69
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,220
glass we were talking a lot about the radiation there with impersonal radiation and the between person radiation.

70
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,510
How they with impersonal radiation is kind of like sort of error.

71
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,350
Right. And we want to remove that because that's another one we are interested in.

72
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,290
I mean, that's it can relate it to the radiation. We want to remove that because we're we're interested in in the between person radiation.

73
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,650
Right. So what they are doing here is that they are doing correlation coefficients between the measures of interest.

74
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,520
They are adjusting for certain things. That's why it's called partial.

75
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:59,239
And also on top of that, because these are kind of like measures that are repeated measures.

76
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,430
So we have kind of like within person error, they are removing that.

77
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:16,759
Okay. So now that we know well, we are talking about now if you look at table two and we have to go to,

78
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,960
you know, do you have the paper in front of you here?

79
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,780
So in table two, why the correlation coefficient said consistently higher in the the attenuated column

80
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,640
now that we know what they the attenuated the attenuated correlation coefficient so.

81
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,050
No, I know it's in the next day, but I'm okay. You just read it.

82
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:16,360
I just want to hear your voice. Okay.

83
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,770
You remember that, right? Because this is what I found entertaining.

84
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:28,360
You will see that I'm insisting on the same message over and over because those are the things that you have to kind of remember for the future.

85
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,020
We think there's some variation at the noise, the strength of the association.

86
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,240
Right. You get rid of that, the associations will be stronger.

87
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,530
That's why the coalition coefficients are higher when you do that.

88
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,770
Deloitte the correlation coefficient. Okay.

89
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
And now how do you interpret the results for a day or three?

90
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,460
Because I know they'll have to go through here because this is the main table for that paper.

91
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:01,680
Right. So so not that now we are not using correlation coefficients where you see that a square, which is kind of like now we're similar.

92
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,149
But again, partiality square is also adjusted for four, four, eight and six.

93
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:17,219
Right. And then we are looking at that for total daily energy spend this year from

94
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,730
for this of how we monitoring adjusted for 18 six with the difference things.

95
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:28,440
So the idea is that that daily energy expenditure from four days of high rate is supposed to be the gold standard of that.

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,630
That's kind of like the best way you have to is not a total gold standard, by which I mean that's the gold standard.

97
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,470
So we are comparing the other things that we have to see how well they do, right?

98
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,879
So the higher they are square, the the better that scene is.

99
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,070
Do any measuring where we are supposed to be measuring? Right. So this is this is kind of like a validity study, right?

100
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:57,360
So we are trying to validate those things against a supposedly gold standard like the heart rate.

101
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:09,070
Okay. So then you see that. And then the idea is that we we have two columns here because one is the yeah, you're right, are in the loop weight.

102
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,629
You can see that they these ones are higher right than this, but they represent the same.

103
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:26,940
So we let's look at this one because this is the most the better the best one because it has I mean, we had gotten rid of with inversion, right?

104
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:36,150
So then you look at weight and then we see that the end squeeze point 31.

105
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:44,730
So basically with with the way you are adjusting for 86, you are kind of like spending 71% of the variation in heart rate, right?

106
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:55,260
So which is kind of like, okay, so that, that right now you are physical activity and then you go up to 57, which is pretty good, right?

107
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,080
I mean, remember that these are not really the real parameters we're measuring.

108
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,340
These are just components, right? And the way we measure those things also are not kind of like a sack.

109
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,229
I mean, they have a role to play. So this is pretty good, right? So now let's go back and to this.

110
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:19,350
Add the energy from day. That is right. And then we see that we go only 2.39.

111
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:26,280
So for from 31, we go a little higher, but just 39, which is not a huge increase.

112
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,550
Right. And the same if we use data feel the energy from this a few I mean we go to 38, right.

113
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:41,940
Oh if we take this one, which is the best one so far and we add either energy, we'll go a little higher.

114
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,469
Right point, 64.64. But I mean, not terribly high.

115
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,130
So that mean basically this is saying this is telling you that the energy from there that is so the of the 50,

116
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,010
you are not predicting that much, right. They are not doing that that great.

117
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:07,319
So then basically the point here is that a point is that that's with weight and physical activity probably would be enough would be okay.

118
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,120
So I tell you that the energy from the five Q is not really predicting that we're have monitoring.

119
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:23,819
Right. So so they do have a point this kind of like I mean, why should we kind of like do that?

120
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:34,799
But what is kind of like and I know this is I know it's in the next slide, but there are some limitations of the of the paper.

121
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,980
And then you can tell me some of them. I mean, one of them is that I mean, I remember I don't remember exactly the details,

122
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,820
but did anyone read about the time in between of them within the next three years and now you have two years?

123
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,940
Yeah. So the timing is not perfect and they are not I mean they are very good at acknowledging limitations.

124
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,570
So it's not like what are the limitations do you think this paper has?

125
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,489
I mean, four days of monitoring maybe may not be enough to make sure really.

126
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,620
I mean, the gold standard of expenditure. I mean, this is better than nothing.

127
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,930
It's kind of like subjective. But is is it may not be enough so that there may be a few limitations.

128
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,059
But actually, to me, I mean, when I saw this paper, the meter limitation is I mean,

129
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,690
who said that physical activity is measured with less error than in think?

130
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,760
Because that was kind of like something that I mean weight is okay because I mean you can use escape right.

131
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,230
And this goes if they are standardized they are pretty good and of weight.

132
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,320
I mean there would be some error by video later by physical activity as a measure with a lot of error.

133
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,860
So I was actually surprised when I saw this paper and I felt like, wow, I mean, they think they were lucky, right?

134
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,710
Because I mean, maybe if you repeat the same study in another population, maybe you won't find that necessarily.

135
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:09,160
I was a little surprised. So these are kind of like we know that this is actually this is interesting because this is

136
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,540
a paper evaluation paper from the same group that wrote the from the Greeks to the expert.

137
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:27,380
So so when you compare physical activity measure with questionnaires, which is what they did, right.

138
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,330
I mean, they measure physical activity with questionnaires with with accelerometer, which is supposed to be more or less a gold standard.

139
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,920
So the reliability of the questionnaire is relatively good because, I mean, people usually report over the same.

140
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,420
So that doesn't mean that is necessarily valid, is reliable, because when you ask people,

141
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,930
do you do moderate physical activity, they will tell you consistently yes or no, right?

142
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,790
But that doesn't mean that they are really doing that. Right.

143
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:02,290
But when you look at the the validity and mean, you can see that the validity versus the accelerometer,

144
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,579
which is supposed to be a better standard, is relatively low point 26.

145
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,940
I mean, there's a correlation coefficient. So that means that physical activity, this was a measure with a lot of error.

146
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:21,070
So in other ways, kind of like how is ever higher in the diet or in the physical activity?

147
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,540
I don't know, maybe, maybe it's lower or maybe they're comparable. Or maybe it depends on the population.

148
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,890
Maybe some populations had better are reporting that physical activity more accurate and their diet less accurate or the other way around.

149
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,280
So in any case, I mean,

150
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:53,890
even one thing that also I want to emphasize is that associations in European immunology are usually kind of like in this kind of like.

151
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:04,200
I mean, you can see that even though we know that in theory anything close to the so it it is

152
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,200
actually a minus one and only is because this guy like so anything close to the last one on

153
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,209
minus one in the correlation coefficient that's a strong correlation and you will be told

154
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:24,280
that probably that over point 80 is a strong correlation in nutritional epidemiology.

155
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,329
We always find things below 4.5.

156
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,160
Actually, you find satellite by five is like, wow, this is amazing, right?

157
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,810
So this is super associated because we know we are working with a lot of error, right, all the time.

158
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,670
So so that's why you will see kind of like this this correlation is that not no data over and over and that's okay.

159
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:53,110
That's probably okay. And the other message of this paper, which is very interesting and I like that a lot,

160
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,889
is that sometimes when you are working with dietary data, with data from a food frequency question,

161
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,900
actually in a large population, you know that I mean, you want to work with nutrients,

162
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,780
you will need someone to analyze the nutrients from their food because what people are reporting effort.

163
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:21,000
Right. Remember that your reporting just delayed also but it also or reduce right you not I mean people don't know the nutrients they are consuming.

164
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:28,120
Right. And then you take those foods and based on the food composition tables, you kind of like translate that into nutrients, right?

165
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:34,340
That you can kind of like analyze, including total energy intake, right?

166
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,589
So you you will have a whole list of macronutrients,

167
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:51,280
micronutrients and total energy intake right now that usually involves some resources and some funding and money to do that analysis.

168
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,800
Right, because that's not necessarily straightforward. It's even worse if you are working with 24 hour diaries.

169
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,690
They have records because they they require even more kind of like work details.

170
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:18,520
You, if any of you did. They added analysis of 24 hour records, kind of like given the frequencies and having to go through there through the program.

171
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:31,239
So you have no idea, you know, but they may have, you know, anyone who has had any that has complained over and over, is this the materials?

172
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:40,520
So it takes a lot of a lot of time. So so sometimes what happened is that you find that you have the wrong frequency data.

173
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,770
Right. You have the frequencies of the food, but you don't have the nutrients.

174
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,960
So. But with the frequencies of foods, you can still do many things.

175
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,490
You can actually do something that we will see in this course at the end of the semester,

176
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,830
which is dietary butter analysis, which is very interesting, is probably more interesting than nutrient analysis.

177
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:08,970
So you can take the frequencies of the foods and then you can do some sort of analysis to see what are the dietary patterns of that population.

178
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,700
Right. But you still need to adjust for the calorie intake, right?

179
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,070
Because you want to look at that kind of like a separate position.

180
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,420
Right. You don't want to kind of like have any type of bias.

181
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,750
Right. So what happen if you don't have the calorie intake?

182
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:33,100
Well, you can adjust for physical activity and weight because most likely those variables are in the study already collected.

183
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,390
Right. So then you don't need to wait for someone to analyze the intake for you.

184
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,989
So remember that for the future, if sometimes you want to do that rebuttal analysis and you do have to tolerate intake,

185
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,480
but you want to adjust for that, you can always suggest for physical activity and weight because those are good properties.

186
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,610
Okay. And then for that, you probably will use just a standard multivariate model just using those, adding them to the model.

187
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,370
Okay. Okay. So that was kind of like what we already talked about.

188
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:13,540
So now I'm moving to kind of like the the example where you are not supposed to adjust for the training.

189
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:21,820
And this is the sugar sweetened beverages on obesity. And this is this is something that is super interesting because if I ask you,

190
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,830
do you think that sugar sweetened beverages are related to gaining weight?

191
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,830
What will you tell me? Yes.

192
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,149
Right. I mean, it's I mean, here is like a no brainer that it was like I mean, of course.

193
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,590
I mean, you're so I mean, sagot for some reason it just gives you that, right?

194
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,370
So kind of like a your increase, your intake of that. I mean, eventually is I mean, you you don't change anything.

195
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:57,659
You may gain weight particularly also because, um, you remember that liquid calories are not that well handled by your brain, right?

196
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,760
Remember that when you have solid calories, your brain tends to kind of like compensating that way.

197
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,280
Like I said, I mean, you look at your satiety and then you feel like, oh, I got this, I'm not going to eat that thing.

198
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,149
But but when you are drinking, you do some partial compensation.

199
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:21,440
And I really thought that. So then and remember that we live in a society that we have the pent up.

200
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,980
So I mean, it's not that the quote right sizes right so we have really big sizes.

201
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,580
And so I mean, the the beverage industry has been increasing the portion size over the years like crazy.

202
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,239
And drinking is something that you don't realize.

203
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,809
Right. So, so basically this is kind of like one of those things that you ask about people who are interested in nutrition.

204
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,130
They will tell you, Oh, yeah, of course.

205
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:56,310
But interestingly, it's kind of like controversial in the literature because there are many papers showing that actually is not associated.

206
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Right. So so they and these were like two examples of that.

207
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:13,080
This is what at one level there was a a paper by for ten years showing that there were clear associations of children with increased body weight.

208
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,330
But there was this other paper where the association between sugary beverages,

209
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:26,040
consumption and BMI was near zero, was practically no, which is kind of like really striking.

210
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,550
Right. And this was this wasn't it.

211
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,759
And this is this is then this is the meta analysis that I told you that showed that there was actually a sufficient this is the Vartanian Association.

212
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,610
They did omit analyzes of 88 studies and they said that decision between soft drink consumption and nutritional

213
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,470
health outcomes and they found clear association of drink with increased energy intake and body weight.

214
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,579
But they found kind of like that.

215
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,880
The study recession typically influences that are somewhat like of course, as you say,

216
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,520
you see larger effect sizes were observed in a study through stronger methods.

217
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:08,970
Like when you have a little imbalance between mental versus professional, you see larger, larger effects which make sense.

218
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,700
And look at that.

219
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,360
I mean, if you say, well that factor for some moderate moderated if it sizes and again that age I mean of course that changes but look at this.

220
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:27,150
Finally, a study funded by the food industry reported significantly smaller effects than non industry funded studies.

221
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,120
So that was a pretty thought body analysis.

222
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,490
So the study was funded by the industry and interestingly the effects were smaller than if it was not funded by the industry.

223
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:49,889
So so this is the first paper and this is this is a small kind of like this was, I thought, a long time ago,

224
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:55,680
but it was kind of like a the striking and this is kind of like they're the they they they they kind

225
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,560
of like seemingly children and adolescents in mechanics and basically it's almost like a load of it.

226
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:12,450
So when they found that kind of like the people who did the previous study were kind of like we're kind of like, you know, what is this?

227
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,100
So then kind of like the reply to the analysis and the reply to the, to the office.

228
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,600
But first, if you look at that because I mean, it's true that.

229
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:30,860
But whatever they do here is so much more. But if you look at the studies, they are not particularly positive.

230
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,979
So you can see that this one is is positive and positive.

231
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:46,020
And all of this also kind of like I said, you have to possibly, like most of them, have no right or at least confidence intervals, including the one.

232
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,730
So so this is in children and adolescents.

233
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:58,580
So thinking about potential, this is one of those times in which your common sense that you're.

234
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,819
Well, yeah, the results are no, but I think sugar sweetened beverages should be associated with BMI.

235
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,250
So maybe there are some types of potential bias here or some other things going on.

236
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,690
Right. So one of the things that I was thinking is like, what do you think about the quality of self-reported intake of sugar sweetened beverages?

237
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:31,480
It might be, you know, great. Especially considering that, like, people think that, like, I always just get rebuilt.

238
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,870
You don't even know and think about the age group.

239
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:44,630
But. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, this is interesting because usually they're very cautious in theory are usually better reported than other things.

240
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:51,350
Like, for example, coffee, remember I told you coffee's pretty well reported because it's a very happy right or whatever it is.

241
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,180
Maybe not that much, but still kind of like it's more clear because I mean, you drink like a model or whatever, right?

242
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,790
And theory shouldn't be that terrible. Although you're right that maybe.

243
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,820
Well, I mean, you go out and they you share or whatever, you don't know what you you're thinking.

244
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,100
But thinking about the age group here, these are kids in adolescence.

245
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,670
I have another lesson. So. So I can tell you that he has no clue about what he's eating or drinking.

246
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,320
So then don't come and do any study with him because it's hopeless.

247
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,940
Completely. So. So, yeah. So, so.

248
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,280
Thinking about like, I mean, we already know that self-reported information is bad in adults in adolescence is probably even worse.

249
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:39,280
Right. So that may be one potential factor to attenuate the results because we know that error will attenuate the results.

250
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,760
Okay. And then this is the critical thing.

251
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:51,830
So when you are studying the effect of sugar sweetened beverages with BMI, do you think you should adjust for total energy intake?

252
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,240
And I know this is I mean to you or you have to adjust to any intake almost always.

253
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:09,440
This is an example that don't but then me why you think you should hurting.

254
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:25,399
I mean, generally we're like associating for total energy and things because of people's different energy needs or exercise levels or whatever.

255
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,800
And that's not necessarily like people aren't like consuming more sugar sweetened beverages because they're so popular.

256
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,600
Well, actually, that's a good point. Yeah. But there's also it's true.

257
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,510
There is one more thing and think about kind of like the causal pathway.

258
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:58,740
What is the reason why you think sugar sweetened beverages are associated with weight?

259
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,290
If you're not feeling well, consuming sugars might be consuming more.

260
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,389
Yeah. So basically it's in it's calories here.

261
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,459
It's in the causal public is not being it's not acting as a confounder here.

262
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:23,320
It's actually like a mediator. So the reason why the sugar sweetened beverages are associated with weight is because first they are high in sugar.

263
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,220
They are really high in totality. But also on top of that, it was what, zero.

264
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,160
Yeah. So you are probably also overconsuming.

265
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,540
So so as a them approaches that associated with a higher consumption of calories and that how

266
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:44,589
you concession calories is what leads to kind of like with increased weight right so what

267
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,659
happened remember that in a bigger meal you cannot digest what I think I'm guilty of the fact

268
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:58,570
that right because otherwise we'll happen you have just about to convert and this is just one.

269
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:17,710
So what happened? If you're a study this and this and you adjust for that will happen out of the relationship between this and this.

270
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,230
It disappears. I mean, you get something like. Right.

271
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:31,279
Because these ideas, they are all they're kind of like indirect pathways that are stronger than this one,

272
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,450
but we know that are not and they will persist.

273
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,430
They. Man one Right. So then woman digests for this, then she can be good.

274
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,040
This, this kind of like to be acting like.

275
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,410
And that's actually what happened here.

276
00:30:50,010 --> 00:31:00,660
So what happened is that the people who did the first meta analysis, they redo the meta analysis without adjusting for total net intake.

277
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:13,190
And when will you when you do that, then you actually get a significant association, not terribly high, but you get some significant results.

278
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,920
Right. The others didn't like it.

279
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:28,760
I mean, the response saying that well, I mean, we were following will it advised that we have to control for energy and that.

280
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,200
That's right. You have to control for energy many times, but not always.

281
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,870
Right. So it's kind of like there are certain situations that are not correct to control for energy.

282
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:42,989
And this is one of those. Right. So this is like kind of like a no.

283
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:49,350
So you didn't see the paper, but this was one of those articles that were funded by the mobility industry.

284
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:55,980
So I don't know. I mean, I don't want to I want to give the author the benefit of the doubt,

285
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,950
but kind of like sometimes that's why it's important in in nutrition not to receive

286
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,420
funding from the food industry because then no one is going to believe your results.

287
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:14,160
So if we go back to their to the results, we see that.

288
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,300
Okay. Positively analysis could be the difference actually is not that high.

289
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,850
Why do you think that this is the case? One is that there is several.

290
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,829
We are really sure that everybody is going to be there no matter what, even if you don't.

291
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,730
I'm just for the calorie intake. But what are the things you can figure?

292
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,970
I remember your age. The bulk of your population.

293
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,290
Why their results in others will be more evident than in kids because.

294
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:03,300
And they won't give you a spelling bee more accurate and yeah also that on top of their what else.

295
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:13,030
Choose what they don't. Choose what they use the word every time I consider them taking it like parents control it.

296
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,220
Well, yeah, but something else.

297
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,079
Yeah. And they are going they are going to lie, they are growing.

298
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,400
They're probably being more physically active. It takes time to gain weight.

299
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:38,440
Right. So it's not like I mean, there's no like you said, probably when we see things in what we see in adults is not Santa.

300
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,720
Sometimes it's kind of like the effect of cumulative intake over the years, right?

301
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,639
Because sentence I mean, it's true that some people drink a lot of us and people not necessarily drink a lot.

302
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,170
But over the years, I mean, we may see like that association, right?

303
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:58,070
So it's kind of like expected to see this. And and again, I mean,

304
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:04,930
it's it's a really it's a very difficult stage to study this type of things because

305
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,790
they suddenly lose weight and then they kind of like increase height and then,

306
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,070
you know, I mean, how it is. Right. So. So, yeah.

307
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:19,660
So so it makes sense that the the Fed will now wait to see them in ten years.

308
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,320
So maybe in ten years you will see like a much higher of it, right?

309
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,799
Okay. So any questions? Okay.

310
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,790
So now we are going to do part two of the homework and you can still finish by watching today.

311
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:45,130
We have plenty of time to work on the homework because I want to make sure that you do have problems with with the methods and with us.

312
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:59,800
So by one, remember last week we were we were validating a food frequency questionnaire with their records,

313
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,240
but we were adjusting for totality intake using the retrieval method because that way we will get our correlations will be

314
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,690
higher because we are kind of like getting rid of the strenuous radiation and in a way we are also compensating for whatever.

315
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:23,880
Right. So that that's what you should see. Now in part two, what we are going to do is that now we are going to look at this nutrition.

316
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,859
This is an additional outcome associations. Right?

317
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:34,030
So we are going to look at that one nutrition in relation to one outcome and we want to adjust for total

318
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:41,230
energy intake in this context because we want to make sure that first we are studying diet composition.

319
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:48,010
Second, that totality intake is not kind of like work in a second from that here.

320
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,270
And so also because we want to remove a strange variation in distribution, right?

321
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:59,440
So, so now what you are going to do that we are going to use a new that I said is cool.

322
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,400
We haven't used this one yet. Right this year that I said.

323
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:11,110
So you haven't been in the right. So you're learning Spanish, too.

324
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,430
So in this recipe, you have information on 1000 subjects.

325
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,230
Half are cases of first myocardial infarction and half are controls.

326
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,470
And this is from a case control study conducted in Costa Rica.

327
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,460
So this is a typical case control study that we recruited cases into the basis of my current function.

328
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,910
And this is actually a match case control study.

329
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,680
We match them with controls by age, sex and area aggressiveness.

330
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,630
And I'll explain about the matching because that makes it a little different.

331
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,000
So you're going to find variables for the three different macronutrients and total

332
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,560
energy intake collecting with the help of a validated frequency questionnaire.

333
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:01,980
So because this somatic is controlled study, you need to conduct conditional logistic regression, controlling for matching factors,

334
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:10,420
the variable of them 1944 Now I'm assuming that all of you are familiar with logistic regression, right?

335
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,009
Yes. Now, maybe not all of you.

336
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:22,299
Is that for Nicky, for me, who were with the Costa Rican, the resident of this, or do they are familiar with conditional logistic regression?

337
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:29,050
Right. This is new to you. Okay. So no problem because I have said this likes to explain that is the worry is the same.

338
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:38,709
So it's just one more thing. And then for the sake of simplicity, we are going to adjust for any other potential confinement.

339
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,420
Of course there are many potential confounders, right? There is income that is difficult.

340
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,630
I think there are many things. We are not going to put them all.

341
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,530
We are only going to look at the nutrient adjusted for total energy intake and the outcome.

342
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:57,310
And of course the matching factor will take into account because we have to, otherwise it will be biased.

343
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,870
Okay, the first thing you have to we are going to run only two models.

344
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,989
Remember all the models I told you last week, some of them were not as good, but others the ones that were good,

345
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:14,290
what they received on the multivariate nutrient density, the multivariate,

346
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,980
the one that you put also to the intake and the standard multivariate, right.

347
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,209
So today we are going to forget about the multivariate intensity.

348
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,480
We're going to run only the standard and the received one. Okay.

349
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,850
So those two so the first one,

350
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:34,690
I'm asking you to run a standard multivariate model to check that association between total fat and myocardial infarction.

351
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,469
Right. Okay. And before we move into other things.

352
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,090
So, yes, this is the this is the standard multivariate.

353
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,260
So basically, you put your hand if you put your calories here, okay.

354
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:53,589
So that the standard because that's the standard thing you do in multivariate analysis, you just add variables to them.

355
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,370
What they do, don't do anything. Right. Okay.

356
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:04,340
So this is the code to run conditional logistic regression and you can see that you

357
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,069
are using the same logistic that you have used before for any logistic regression.

358
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:20,530
Right. And you have to use your descending keyword in order to model the probability of being a case,

359
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,830
because otherwise SAS will model the product, you'll be in a control.

360
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,750
Just, I don't know why, but basically this is the model.

361
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,680
So B three favorable for the case control established in my yes or not, this is logistic regression.

362
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,110
So you have a binary outcome. You are either a case or you are a control, right?

363
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,920
And this is that this would be the standard model to perform, right? So you have to perform this model.

364
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:56,950
And because your colleagues right now note that and the new thing here is that I'm adding

365
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:04,089
this three to the four and this is the way that you control for matching factors.

366
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,530
The four is the variable that tells you the matching.

367
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:16,359
Then the matching basically should be four is like another daily variable that basically will be like if I'm one four,

368
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,989
I guess I will have happened already. Social one if I'm two, I will have two.

369
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,370
If I have three, I will see if I'm 143, I will have my control.

370
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:32,829
That is 143. Right? So this is a pair variable and they put in that you control for the matching factor because everyone every case is

371
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:41,320
matched to a person that is the same sex more or less the same age within five years and the same area of residence.

372
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:56,560
So before I continue with the with the with the exercise with Olaf, let's review quickly why we do conditional logistic regression.

373
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:04,209
Okay. So I'm going to change kind of language to pull like another example and I want to change completely.

374
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,060
This is not the lap. This is another thing. I mean, they'll come still my.

375
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,900
But now our exposure to the adipose tissue at nicotine that may be symptomatic to.

376
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:20,770
Right. So you have to use that matching variable in this statement because you are conditioning stratified.

377
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:26,050
And then my two variables. Okay. So that's that's why you have to do that and you have to do that.

378
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,310
Don't include the matching factors in the model statement or just use the state testing.

379
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:36,520
And you are doing that because of case control studies when you match.

380
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:47,320
And I, I know this is maybe you've never thought about that, but when you match people seeing that when you are matching,

381
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,530
you are controlling for confounding, but you are not actually when you're matching that, when you have matching cohort studies,

382
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:59,770
yes, you are controlling for confounding, although it's kind of I'd like to see matching cohort studies,

383
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,800
but in case control studies, when you match actually what you are doing, you're superimposing a selection bias.

384
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,520
And now think about what you are doing. And I'm going to give you like an example.

385
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,480
In this particular dataset, there was myocardial infarction in Costa Rica.

386
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:27,410
What happened is that men have myocardial infarction earlier than women.

387
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:35,090
Right. So then when you recruit incident cases of medical information, you end up recruiting.

388
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:41,480
I mean, when you look at your cases, what happened is 75% were males and 25% were females.

389
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,100
It is consistent what we know about the epidemiology of of cardiovascular disease.

390
00:42:46,100 --> 00:43:03,420
Right. So if my cases are 25% women and 75% men, and now I match them with controls by sex, what happened to my controls like would be 5050?

391
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,810
You know, my controls would be 25 and 75 because I imagine.

392
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,299
Right. Yeah. As opposed to in the general. Exactly. Exactly that.

393
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,080
No, no, you're right. Exactly. So you are still I mean, in theory, your controls represent your study population.

394
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,950
They have to be representative of the study population where their cases were coming from.

395
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,220
Right. And your study in your state, obviously, you have 5050, right.

396
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,660
So then can you see that now your controls? Actually, there is a selection bias.

397
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,860
Right. Because your controls don't represent the study population as a whole.

398
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:42,050
Right. But the moment that you control or kind like is stratify by those matching factors.

399
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:49,020
Your study population is still represents this type of your controls still represent this type of.

400
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,080
We've seen much, in fact. So you look at the women, your women are representative of the women and you look at the men.

401
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,720
Your men are representative of the men. But you have to condition and stratify on those.

402
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:08,840
And once you do that, you not only remove that kind of selection bias, but you also control for the confounding.

403
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,440
Okay. So that's why you have to kind of like controlling the analysis.

404
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,530
So bottom line, when you have a much case control study, you have to condition on the on the match your.

405
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,930
You cannot ignore the matching factor because you can know the match effect of you will have selection bias.

406
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,480
Yes. So like under the strata option, you would put gender.

407
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,960
No. You put the four because that's the because you have.

408
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,710
Yeah.

409
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:43,390
And you only have matching by sex you will use gender by we have matching by three things and those three things are kind of like captured by the,

410
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,810
the for whatever. Okay. So then you put the four variable, which is the matching bar.

411
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:58,370
Okay. So the idea is that, for example, for the first pair, maybe they were they were both women, 50 years old from a rural area of whatever.

412
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,730
Right. So then they come from the same place. Right? So that's that's how it works.

413
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,940
Okay. So then when you run that, you when you run your kind of logistic regression,

414
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,799
you're going to see that SAS is going to give you kind of like you can see

415
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,010
that you have heart cases and have control because that's how we match them.

416
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,730
Right. And then that is going to give you kind of legislative assembly.

417
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:25,780
So numbers there next four or five, because what happened is that says is going to conduct the analysis within this thread.

418
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,110
Okay. That's the way of kind of like conditioning and adjusting for that.

419
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,800
So because of that, when you look at the results, this is the analysis.

420
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:42,740
This is the parameter estimate. Right. And then you get and this is the ratio.

421
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,349
Right. And then in the parameter estimate you get, this is the data and this is the ratio.

422
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:53,720
Right? Same as before. But are you missing anything in those parameter estimates?

423
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,190
There is no intercept. Usually we have an intercept always.

424
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,559
But even in logistic regression, I mean in linear regression,

425
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,780
the intercept is a very important because it means something, no interaction and nothing that is not important.

426
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:28,000
Usually we ignore it, right? Because it's not kind of like given the type of I mean, we go straight to the data because that's really video, actually.

427
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,030
But there's no intercept. Now, it doesn't mean that that intercept is that is one intercept restrict.

428
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:42,340
Right. So then that's why SAS is not calculated then. Because the time for the statistician to call nuisance parameters because they are not useful.

429
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,830
Right. I mean, who cares about one intercept, right?

430
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:52,750
So just that's the only thing that you're going to see different, which again, usually in registration you don't get a lot of investors.

431
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,340
The rest is exactly the same. Right.

432
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:04,040
So kind of like you're going to get your ratios, you are going to interpret the ratio the same as usual and please use that in place that I write.

433
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:12,219
So that's going to be exactly the same. So when you do this homework, please, please,

434
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:18,430
please interpret the of ratio appropriately according to standard it be the Maria lexicon of ratios are not raised issues.

435
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,060
You have to use the remember use the template. Please use the table. You've been doing great.

436
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:30,100
Plus last week I mean I've seen that people have been using the damper so good and now there

437
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:40,060
is one more thing we are using total fat that is in grams and totally and that is in calories.

438
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:51,010
So these are continuous variables, right? So when you interpret the of ratios for those variables, how are you interpreting them?

439
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,750
I mean, what are the units per ten?

440
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,969
Well, that's what I want you to do.

441
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:06,250
But if I if you can do anything, how will be the interpretation in the original scale, the one gram of the one calorie, the one kilocalories.

442
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:12,040
Yeah. So does it make sense? So by what I mean, yeah.

443
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,109
But what happened is that your operations are going to be very, very low or very high and then on the scale.

444
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:23,499
Right. So it depends on sometimes when you are in a different scale, I can see that the one then you have the opposite thing.

445
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,700
You have like a huge of ratio because the scale is very low in the situation.

446
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,650
They are going to be very low because they all change.

447
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,910
But one gram, one gram is not then one kilocalories even less, right?

448
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:46,479
So then they they may be significant, but you won't even see I mean, you will see like 1.00 and then 1.001.00 confidence interval.

449
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,129
You won't see kind of like the decimal places in which things change and so significant.

450
00:48:51,130 --> 00:49:00,250
And then you may think like, oh, it's no, no, it's not not is significantly associated but those ratios that small that that you can really interpret.

451
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:07,360
So that's why I'm asking you to use that context, the statement that you already learned in the previous homework, right?

452
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:16,540
So now what we are going to do is that we are going to remember now for the top of my head that I think it's ten grams of fat.

453
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:24,120
You are reading it over 100 calories. Okay. So then when you interpret this ratios use the context statement and I'm actually giving you there.

454
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:33,460
Yeah, I'm giving you this 100 like contrast one your child color, not 100 grams of calories.

455
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,240
Oh yeah. Sorry, that's I said yeah, yeah. I said yes.

456
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,600
Copy and paste. That should be 100 calories.

457
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,290
Nine grams. So this is ten grams of fat. That is. Thank you.

458
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:53,260
So, so use those. So then you can do the proper interpretations instead of interpreting by one colonial by one gram.

459
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,120
Okay. And then now I give you all that information.

460
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:06,070
In the second one, you will have to run a receiver model, the one where you include also calories in the model to your dataset.

461
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,150
So then for that one, I mean, see, we will see that you can see the homework.

462
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:15,549
I mean, this is the simplify question in the whole, I'm giving you many more details.

463
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,240
Please read them very carefully with the sentence details.

464
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:31,000
Remember that for the receiver model, first you have to get the results and for that you have to run a linear relation with the nutrient and calories.

465
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,360
Remember that, right? And once you get the receivers, you can use that variable in your logistic regression model.

466
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,509
So don't get confused because you in this situation,

467
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:46,450
you have to run two different models because first you have to get the receiver the same as you did last week.

468
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:54,220
Okay. So and those you need to do a linear regression and you need to follow the same steps as you follow in the first part.

469
00:50:54,580 --> 00:51:00,610
So first get you receive those and once you get your received, once you put them in your logistic regression, okay.

470
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,330
And then you have two extra questions. To be gone on your own.

471
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,680
I'm asking you, are those two mothers so caloric mothers? Why or why not?

472
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,180
And the answer is, I'm giving you the answer. Are they so caloric?

473
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,560
I told you. I told you last week. Yes, they are both caloric.

474
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,990
Okay. Because those are the good ones. Remember, the ones that are not good ones are the ones that are not.

475
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:40,929
And then summarize briefly the advantages of calorie of calorie adjusting when using the food group question as an epidemiological to do a first diet.

476
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:46,940
This is relationships. Not that you have this question twice in a way, but it's not the same question.

477
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,320
Okay. In the first part, it was about validation.

478
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
In the second part, it's about assessing value.

479
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:01,960
This is association and there are to a specific slice in the presentation what I see the advantages of one and the advantages of the other.

480
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,500
Okay. So then don't mix them. Don't put them in the wrong place.

481
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,690
Okay. Okay.

482
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:14,180
Any questions? And then I have a joke.

483
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:28,320
Okay. Okay, so let's work in post for part two, and I'll be here to help you.

484
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:38,700
Okay. Now, actually, maybe let's take a break.

485
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,280
So then you can kind of like go to the bathroom and breathe.

486
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:49,370
And then then when we go back, we have like 50 minutes to work on the left.

487
00:54:30,480 --> 00:55:23,650
You can see. Each.

488
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:40,340
He's not coming out of the hospital and not coming home.

489
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:51,040
What? Let's do it.

490
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:33,970
Prevention panel to. I told him that because you fly over your car, you take off your.

491
00:56:47,420 --> 00:57:07,080
Every time you go forward, that's a problem because you can't seem to be surprised.

492
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:24,370
Down to the chip in the. Oh.

493
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:32,750
I was going to add one unit and just.
