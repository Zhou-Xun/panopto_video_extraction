1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,250
Or have you watched?

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,560
No, I think we'll go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,849
So we'll talk about kind of new technology and pharmaceuticals,

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:22,200
biologics and devices and talk about a little bit about regulation and then how those those products go to market.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,309
And then hopefully in the end, really talk about how cost effectiveness ties into all of this.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,280
And, you know, part of this is, I think, cost of sales as often is used for pharmaceuticals.

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,950
I mean, I've I've communicated effectively to you that that it can be used to do a lot of different interventions.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,029
But, you know, over half, I would say, of cost of sales is that you look at our we'll be done looking at pharmaceuticals.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,520
And so I think that's important kind of area to talk about.

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,040
And I don't know, you know, I mean, we have a few classes that are focused on pharmaceuticals,

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,520
but I thought, I want to give you some exposure to this as well, if you have already been exposed some.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,820
So it's kind of a big picture.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,270
I mean, this is a few years old, but, you know, this is a big a big industry here when you think about pharmaceuticals and biotech with,

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,160
you know, if this is revenue in billions, this means trillions then.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,620
So this is these are big numbers here. We're talking about farmers buy biotech, also other medical technologies, medical imaging.

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,670
You know, these are big, big industries like health guaranteed.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,640
And, you know, of course, North America is a big a big, big part of health care industry revenues.

18
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,299
With that said, there are some hurdles that these companies have to go through to get their products to the market.

19
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,940
Here in the United States, one of which a really important one is regulation.

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,550
So this is the FDA allowing market access and they're looking are these products safe and effective?

21
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,340
And then another hurdle for these companies is reimbursement.

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,430
So even if FDA approves it and allows them to be marketed, that they have to be paid for, presumably.

23
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,930
And so we've got this, you know, patchwork system in the United States of a lot of different payers.

24
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,570
And typically they're making decisions based on something, whether is something is reasonable and necessary.

25
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,360
But also they might be interested in if something cost effective and different payers will have different goals there in mind.

26
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,460
So I want to talk about just kind of today, talk about FDA regulation in general, talk about the drug development process, what goes on there.

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,830
I'll talk about biologic drugs or biologics on economics of drug development,

28
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,180
talk about medical devices and what they process that they go through, too.

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,620
And then a little bit about price regulation and how cost analysis is used then for pharmaceuticals and just

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,290
some basics of an overview of kind of what's been going on in the pharmaceutical cost markets research.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,460
So this is a picture of the the FDA's kind of work structure.

32
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,920
There's a lot here. But as you can see here, there are a lot of different.

33
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,360
Answer this here.

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:17,660
So they break up their regulation in terms of, you know, biologics devices and radiological health, drug evaluation and small molecule.

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,910
And then they do a bunch of other things tobacco, food safety, veterinary medicine, etc., etc.

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,459
So a lot of different things in the in the FDA organizations.

37
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,860
But I guess particle we'll talk about here today, we'll be kind of focused on this FDA regulation here.

38
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:42,950
We'll talk about it a little bit about biologics devices and then drug regulation, which will be, again, a more traditional small molecule regulation.

39
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,340
If we think about a technology development at really high level,

40
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:57,730
we have some sort of critical need available technology and you're developing companies are developing some sort of drug or a device.

41
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,100
And this is presumably a continuous design and development phase.

42
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:12,879
Then it has to be investigated to see by, you know, the regulators here with FDA approval mechanisms and then payers being became decisions.

43
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,330
And then finally, you know, you have patient access here.

44
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:23,650
Well, I have a few things here. You know, we just talk about FDA approval and payment decisions as as kind of hurdles to get to patient access.

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,570
Also, something to think about here, too, is there's a kind of continuum in the early stages of development.

46
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,640
You have a lot of uncertainty about how well these things will work.

47
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,779
And then, you know, presumably later on, once something gets through FDA approval,

48
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,170
you have much more certainty about how effective these products are.

49
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,740
So a little bit about drug development. This is just the big picture.

50
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,930
One way to think about drug development is a funnel.

51
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,900
So you start off with some basic research to understand the basic biology, basic biology of the human body.

52
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,890
We have neurons, we have kidneys. And, you know, so you understand how the basic research about the human body and mechanisms and things like that.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,490
And the next part here is drug discovery. So let's try a bunch of molecules and maybe we'll try them in rats and things like that in mice.

54
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,320
And but then eventually you get to preclinical studies.

55
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,540
And then the big thing that we often talk about here are clinical trials.

56
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,330
These are the trials that are that are done to get FDA approval.

57
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:37,370
What you see here is something in this submitted investigational new drug and that

58
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,410
you have to submit something to the FDA even before you start these clinical trials.

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,520
And typically, they're in phase one, phase two, phase three.

60
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,290
Actually, anyone here know what the distinctions are between phase 1 to 3?

61
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,760
The number of, like, people like the trial. Yeah.

62
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,410
And of phase one is the first trial to the second and the third.

63
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,940
And typically, again, down here at the bottom, we have a phase one trial.

64
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,500
Is basically is this drug super dangerous or not?

65
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,430
So typically, though, they'll get healthy volunteers off and you walk around campus, you'll see a little flier o participate in research study.

66
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,339
You pick out, you know, something called a number. And typically they're looking for healthy college students and they're going to say,

67
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,550
we're going to give you this drug and then watch you for 24 hours, 48 hours, and make sure there's no some.

68
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,380
There's not some there's not some sort of kind of crazy allergic reaction that's really dangerous.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,959
So it's phase one trials again. And they're probably giving you a very low dose just to see are there any strong,

70
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,500
really strong kind of safety signals that we need to be worried about?

71
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,980
And then phase two is often given to people with that condition.

72
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,890
They might be hundreds of people, and that is trying to figure out dosing and what is an appropriate dose maybe for this.

73
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,170
And then phase three is really typically the the large scale clinical trial.

74
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,240
So I mean, these numbers of volunteers, they're just meant to indicate scale.

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:18,800
But oftentimes the thousands of volunteers who, you know, maybe is the cancer drug given given thousands of people with this condition.

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,669
And this is really proving, does this drug work versus it doesn't?

77
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:30,290
And this is typically the randomized controlled trial where you randomize people to a placebo or some other intervention versus your new new drug.

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,149
And this is what FDA is looking forward to, to finally approve it.

79
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:41,299
So then here we see a new drug application or biologic application submitted and we

80
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,520
have FDA approved approve and then we have the FDA approved medicine get FDA approval.

81
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,659
And what's sometimes we forget about, too, is oftentimes not always,

82
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,610
but oftentimes it's kind of a phase four, which is post-approval research or monitoring.

83
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,800
So, for example, with the coronavirus vaccines,

84
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,340
they were new and there was a lot of post-approval monitoring to monitor for safety signals and things like that.

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,720
And sometimes not always, but sometimes you do find something that passes the FDA approval.

86
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,160
But then once it's in the market on these things, if we see bad safety signals, the drugs are approved.

87
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,640
You might have heard of Vioxx, for example. That's that's an example of that.

88
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah. And you can imagine, though, if, like thousands of people are given drugs in a phase three trial,

89
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:37,490
that might not be enough of the sample size to detect a rare adverse but maybe serious adverse event in one in 10,000 people or something like that.

90
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,220
Right. And so those are the kinds of things you might observe in post-approval monitoring.

91
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,730
Another key thing here on this diagram here is we're starting with many, you know, thousands or maybe tens of thousands of potential new drugs.

92
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,080
Some scientists who I think this molecule might be great for curing cancer.

93
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,510
And then with all of that, you might end up with one FDA approved medication.

94
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,000
So this really is kind of a funnel. You start off with maybe tens of thousands of potential drugs and maybe you have 100 drugs that

95
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,589
maybe you start clinical trials on and then you end up with maybe one FDA approved medication.

96
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:22,820
So there really are a lot of things that we're trying here to get to that one medication that might actually be safe that gets FDA approval.

97
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,850
So in step one is discovery development. You're testing thousands of compounds, understanding how that drug might work in a biological system.

98
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,909
You do pre-clinical research on maybe studying dosing and toxicity levels,

99
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,739
trying things in mice and so forth, and then and then eventually of humans in clinical research.

100
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,760
These are state that that phase 1 to 3,

101
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:53,620
the research manufacturers have to submit that investigational new drug application to the FDA prior to doing that.

102
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:03,250
And then again, we have, you know, phase one, phase two and phase three, and then also potentially phase four.

103
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,520
FDA is going to assess then the safety and efficacy of the medications.

104
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,220
There are some special cases that they look at. One is accelerated review.

105
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,620
So this is a well, let me step back just, you know, at a high level again, it.

106
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,820
Maybe I'll ask you guys. So why is it why do we have an FDA?

107
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,040
I mean, the Unites States actually didn't have a Food and Drug Administration for many years and, you know, over 100 years in its history.

108
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:48,210
Why do we have an FDA body and standard of products, but also just making sure that efficacy and efficiency for products are streamlined?

109
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,170
So I mean, they're they're a gatekeeper that that that presumably ensures that the drugs out in the

110
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:03,320
market have some sort of efficacy and they don't have very big safety issues with them.

111
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,530
What was the second part, though, again, like quality as well, making sure that like the products are like good and are like safe as well.

112
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,219
Yeah, well, actually that's a that's important thing that I haven't mentioned that there's quality.

113
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,280
And so part of that goes through in the approval process.

114
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:23,960
But actually FDA does monitor and inspect and or ensure that facilities have high quality in them.

115
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,309
And actually, I think one of our HP students husband works for, I think Pfizer,

116
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:38,570
and he works in and and and in quality for them and making sure that their facilities are producing,

117
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,120
you know, vaccines and so forth that are high quality and don't have contaminants in them and things like that.

118
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,180
And so that is that is another thing that FDA does to it's true that now.

119
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,480
So so those are really the kind of the good things about FDA.

120
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,810
What are some of the downsides of of having an approval process like that and having and having just an FDA agent?

121
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,480
Yeah. Well, I mean, first, it can be very slow.

122
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,899
It's like takes often takes years to like get through the FDA review process.

123
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:17,490
And then like a weird thing about like the U.S. FDA as compared to other like drug approval agencies is

124
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,460
that like the pharmaceutical company is like basically paid for the privilege to be regulated by FDA.

125
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:33,090
So there's like a lot they pay a lot of fees to like get these kinds of like accelerated authorizations to go through and like there's problems there.

126
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,770
So that is always a waste.

127
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:47,040
So the pharmaceutical companies are paying money to the FDA. One, one way to view that is, hey, that adds costs to the drug development process.

128
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,300
And then, you know, maybe our drugs can be cheaper if we if that if those companies didn't have to pay the FDA or any other.

129
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:01,409
Another view, I think that you're suggesting here is that because the pharmaceutical companies are are

130
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,550
paying they're kind of paying the FDA to get accelerated approval and things like that.

131
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,919
And maybe they've kind of captured that agency and the agency is kind of doing their bidding versus presumably being an independent,

132
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,300
impartial investigator is that would work well.

133
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,850
And I think it's pretty clear that like the head of every one of these major offices like this rotates through to the private sector.

134
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,880
I mean, that is that is not like controversial.

135
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,889
I was like an for that,

136
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:36,240
like who goes where in terms of like the pipeline from like working out so like an Eli Lilly or like a Pfizer or going to FDA or like back and forth.

137
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:43,499
Yeah. I think just a few days ago I thought I saw like a pie chart of, you know, where FDA people working in the FDA, where are they now?

138
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,810
And it's like five years later, okay, you know, 50% still at the FDA and then like 25% five years later in pharma.

139
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,000
And I think it was specifically in like hematology oncology or something part of the FDA product.

140
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,770
But um, yeah, so there, there certainly are,

141
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:09,960
there certainly are people who move back and forth between the regulator and those being regulated by pharmaceutical industry.

142
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,110
But kind of a big, big, big picture. Also, you mentioned, though, this does delay the process, right?

143
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,310
Actually, if we go back here.

144
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:29,220
Oh, you know, this is there's if you think about this as kind of time, this process would be shorter if we didn't have FDA review.

145
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,820
Right. And in fact, we could probably reduce a lot of the clinical trials if we didn't have FDA approval.

146
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,250
Maybe we have shorter clinical trials, too.

147
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:48,900
So this having an FDA, you know, introduces a delay in the process of getting, you know, getting medications out to people who need them.

148
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,280
And so that is I think we're kind of, you know, type one and type two era or whatever, if you want to think about it that way,

149
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:05,910
is having a involved, onerous process not only adds costs to the development process, but also may add a delay.

150
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:13,950
And if you have something that's delayed a really long time, there are people, you know, in this case, people's lives depend on this.

151
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:22,590
I mean, people will die if they don't have access to lifesaving medications or people have experienced a lot of loss of quality of life if,

152
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,620
you know, medications are delayed by months and years.

153
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Um, I can remember I mentioned this before, but there's a saying this concept ever mentioned the concept of the invisible graveyard, this class.

154
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:40,530
So, okay, so, so let's say, let's say you work at the FDA and you're thinking, do I approve this drug or not?

155
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,270
And you think, hey, there might be some safety signals. There are some safety issues with this drug.

156
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,740
And if I approve the drug and and and it gets out into the world and there actually are big safety problems,

157
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,390
there would be this sizable graveyard of people who died from the safety issues, from this drug.

158
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:03,040
So as someone over at the FDA that's very visible and I get blamed for that, right.

159
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,159
If I approve a drug and then all of a sudden it causes some harm, that's the kind of visible graveyard.

160
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,250
But there's kind of an invisible graveyard if I don't approve the drug.

161
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:17,760
And it actually is really good, there's the invisible graveyard of all the people who die because they didn't have access to the medication.

162
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,489
Now, that would be kind of invisible because that drug would never have been approved.

163
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,930
And so, no, we won't know that there are people who could have benefited from that drug.

164
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:36,450
So I would argue, you know, we have to balance the the kind of the delays to the process to make sure that things are safe that are getting out there.

165
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:44,489
But if if we delay, I mean, we could we could require a million person clinical trial and require the drug companies study this drug for 37 years.

166
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,110
And and, you know, that would really delay things. Then we wouldn't get as many kind of medical innovations out there.

167
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,399
And I you know, one of the thing I'll say is, you know, sometimes if there's a drug, let's say,

168
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,440
approved in the U.S. and so people in the U.S. have access to it and maybe it's not available in the UK.

169
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,640
You know, they're they can visibly look across the ocean and say, hey, look, people in the U.S. have.

170
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,910
Access medication. I don't have access to it. And then that becomes kind of a a visible issue.

171
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,180
Yeah. Sorry. I thought you had a question or comment. Well, I. So you're saying, like, the drug is really good.

172
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,200
It doesn't get approved, is it, that it doesn't get approved? It's just like the wait time is like to me.

173
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:26,299
Is that right. So the really edge cases. Right. Like maybe they're better, a little better than the existing option, which might be nothing.

174
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,830
There might be no treatment. But it's not like this isn't going to solve all our problems and be a cure.

175
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,979
It's just like slightly better than the status quo.

176
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,180
So you're really passing like very, very fine grades of differentiation.

177
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,690
So there could be yeah, I mean, there are are a hypothetical where there's a life saving drug versus nothing at all.

178
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,880
But oftentimes, yeah, the question is, you know, is it drug versus drug B and drug B is slightly better.

179
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,030
And and maybe it's not a question of will that drug ever be approved, but will it be approved next week or next year?

180
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:06,800
And those are all interesting questions. I think, you know, let's say the coronavirus vaccines that were approved in November of 2020.

181
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,610
Right. But, you know, hey, what if the FDA said we're sorry, we'd like to see a bigger trial or, you know,

182
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,240
the p value was less in point of five, but we want to see a less than 0.01 or something.

183
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,469
So you need to run a bigger trial or we're concerned about some sort of safety signals.

184
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,040
And, you know, and actually there were more deaths. Yeah.

185
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,000
I can't recall which vaccine was there were more deaths in the vaccine arm than the controller.

186
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,490
Right. It wasn't wasn't statistically significant, but there were more deaths. And so I said, ooh, I'm really worried about that.

187
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,170
Let's run a bigger, bigger trial.

188
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,370
If they require that, you know, maybe that would have delayed the rollout of vaccines by another six months or a year.

189
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:50,389
And think about how many people would have died had that been delayed even more so there is there is this tradeoff,

190
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,850
I guess, between, you know, fast approval and then, you know, the risk of approving something that might have harms.

191
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,190
You know, it's kind of thinking about that when we're talking about, um, you know, weaknesses of the FDA.

192
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:09,320
And I think probably the system is kind of the slow review system is probably okay for, you know, drugs that are not.

193
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:17,450
You know, non-pandemic type situations. But I think the COVID situation really did kind of point out a potential issue where,

194
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,349
you know, every day that the vaccines were getting out, more people were dying.

195
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,780
And like I said, there's kind of a middle ground they have to take in terms of how long to do the trials for.

196
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,850
But I think kind of my take away from that was that it was almost like viewed from the FDA perspective,

197
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,700
the inaction was just like, Oh, we can't act until we have all the data.

198
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,950
And that wasn't a choice. It was out of their hands when, you know, it's like it's always kind of your choice to not take action.

199
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,879
And not taking action is a choice that yeah, and it wasn't always framed that way.

200
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,250
I thought, you know, that was when things are really fast moving and it's like, Oh, well, we have to have this yearlong review process.

201
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,129
Like the Moderna vaccine, I think was pretty much made and not altered in like January of 2020.

202
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,150
And then it took what you know. Yeah. So that yeah. Yeah.

203
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:13,700
The vaccine, both Brendan and Pfizer, I think they you know, they were they had a vaccine kind of ready in January, February, maybe March 2020.

204
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:22,250
But, you know, they they went through all the clinical trials and then and so forth and, you know, which they were valuable.

205
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,410
But, you know, that takes time and can cancel the process.

206
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,400
Yeah. So.

207
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,160
Yeah, those are. Yeah, things do thing.

208
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,380
Now again, there's this again.

209
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:47,450
I would argue that there is this tradeoff, though, between out of speed and getting things out and cost of the process and then the value of having,

210
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:48,930
you know,

211
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,850
something that's been been vetted and and and has some sort of level of evidence behind what we know about the safety and efficacy of the products.

212
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,549
And that's why I guess I'd bring up some of these these special cases here, because I think you have to realizes,

213
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:07,790
hey, we maybe we want to be careful of this and make sure that we can try to get drugs out as fast as possible here.

214
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,250
So there's this accelerated review process which evaluates surrogate end points.

215
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,620
So one thing to think about are what are the endpoints we really care about?

216
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,910
Oftentimes, we really, really care about things like death, right?

217
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
We we don't want people to die. We ourselves want to die.

218
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,850
We also maybe care. What's other things like does this person get cancer?

219
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:37,580
Does this person have a heart attack, a stroke? Oh, but sometimes it might be surrogate endpoints like your cholesterol level.

220
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:44,900
And if we really think cholesterol is highly correlated and maybe causal in terms of causing heart attacks and strokes,

221
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:53,750
maybe FDA will approve something based on a surrogate endpoint like cholesterol levels instead of like a harder endpoint,

222
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:02,750
like heart attacks, strokes or death. Because of the I believe the coronavirus booster vaccines have been evaluated on surrogate endpoints.

223
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:12,200
So the trials showed, hey, those vaccines increase antibodies and we think the antibodies are related to better protection.

224
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,070
And so they were approved based on that, not based on, you know,

225
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:24,230
tens of thousands of person trials that actually showed reductions in hospitalizations or things like that that we we really care about.

226
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,090
Then there are there's there are fast track, which are, again, for, you know,

227
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:39,920
and oftentimes these are designed for cases where there are kind of urgent needs or in this case, an unmet medical need.

228
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:51,049
And there is this idea of this breakthrough therapy where and there's a priority view review some of these things.

229
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:58,879
Also, the FDA, like you said earlier, where we're all over this, if you pay extra, know they'll review these things faster,

230
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:07,460
which which introduces some, you know, questions there about is who's who's regulating who or who's driving the process.

231
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,510
But anyway, some of these special cases were designed, again, to address some of the concerns that this process is very slow.

232
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,370
I'm not sure these are the best ways to deal with that, but that's what they are.

233
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:30,680
Yeah. So just to recap of the COVID 19 vaccine in November 9th, 2020, you know,

234
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:39,700
they announced their interim results of their phase three trials and they, you know, they submitted this emergency use authorization.

235
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:50,570
And the U.S. government agreed to purchase 100 million doses of those drugs.

236
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:59,090
Now, this was just just as a recap, though, this was a vote I asked of students in November 2020.

237
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,050
And I asked if Pfizer's COVID 19 vaccine gets FDA emergency use authorization and became available to you.

238
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:17,390
Would you take it now? Know over half the students said yes, but actually a fair number of students said I would need additional information.

239
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,700
They were in in November 2020.

240
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:26,480
Students in a class like this, they were still a little bit hesitant about, you know, this process that moves quite quickly.

241
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:36,750
Right. So just keep in mind that the faster something goes through the process, there might be less kind of confidence in that process as well.

242
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:46,620
Any questions about? Yeah. I wonder how often those surrogate end points used in the vaccine vaccine evaluation,

243
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:57,680
because it's really hard to evaluate the overall to the that mortality mortality rate, etc. for the vaccine to see the effects.

244
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,290
So that's a really good question. And part of it is, is it depends.

245
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:10,769
So, you know, like the the coronavirus vaccines, I think the first ones they required are kind of harder endpoints about,

246
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:18,510
you know, infections, hospitalizations, deaths. Actually, they don't really show a reductions in deaths because that's kind of a rare outcome.

247
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,490
But, you know, like infections or sometimes they look at hospitalizations.

248
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,419
I'm working looking at some of the new RSV vaccines that are coming through the

249
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,930
pipeline and the kinds of outcomes that they're looking at for those new vaccines are,

250
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,980
you know, lab confirmed infections. But they're also looking at things like hospitalizations and outpatient visits.

251
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:46,110
So I think oftentimes for the first vaccine, the first version of it, they will require those kind of harder endpoints.

252
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,880
But then for subsequent kind of booster vaccines,

253
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,600
they kind of they lower the bar a little bit in terms of looking at just for those subsequent or surrogate endpoints about antibody levels.

254
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,260
And I mean, that's kind of what happens with the annual flu vaccine as well.

255
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,210
They want to see, you know,

256
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:09,180
they give the flu vaccine to some people and make sure there isn't a big safety signal like one in ten people drop dead or something.

257
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:18,120
But then they look for antibody response. But because they're developing it every year, I think the the they don't look for, you know,

258
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:26,370
efficacy in reducing infections partially because it's so quick and seasonal that I think if they if they took enough time to do that trial,

259
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,700
that the season of procedure may be over and you wouldn't be able to give the vaccine to people.

260
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,430
Do you have another comment? Yeah. So I'm curious.

261
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:41,100
Like, to me, it feels like it should be the opposite way around that like that when there's like no vaccine for a disease like the first vaccine,

262
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,040
if it has like some indication that it might be pretty good,

263
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,150
like we should go ahead and approve it, because otherwise, like, you know, the option is nothing.

264
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,459
Mm hmm. Versus, like, the second, you know, like, for example, like the Bivalent boosters,

265
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,770
it's like it feels like those should go to more tests because, like, we have a good one.

266
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,170
Like, we know it's good, we have evidence, it's safe. So, like, why is the bar higher for the second one?

267
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,910
I mean, I understand the same technology. They're not really that different. Like I do get up like just like in a theoretical situation.

268
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,850
It's like when the options, nothing, the standards can be a lot lower.

269
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,540
But when you have something, should the standards be higher? Yeah.

270
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,590
And part of this, too, is, is, is, you know, what do you compare it to?

271
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,690
And and I think this in a cost to you when you're comparing, you know, when you think about is something new,

272
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,899
cost effective, you should be comparing it to the next best alternative.

273
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,830
And so for booster vaccines, I mean, you could I think you we should be saying, okay, what does it how does the booster look compared to no booster,

274
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,810
but maybe how does the new booster compared to just boosting again with the old vaccines as well?

275
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,499
And and that might be a, you know, higher bar to reach.

276
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,569
And I think and from my understanding, there have been some studies that say,

277
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,690
hey, if you give someone the original vaccine versus the new Bivalent booster,

278
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,730
it gives you a pretty similar booster, your antibodies to the overall strain, you know.

279
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:17,250
So, yeah, it's it's some you know, I think you're raising some good questions about how we should be evaluating this.

280
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:25,380
And part of it is, you know, yeah, what is the marginal benefit of that booster dose is much smaller than going from nothing to your first,

281
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,850
you know, COVID 19 vaccine, for example. Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,389
But I think part of it I think part of is probably based on kind of a biological understanding of of the risk of some sort of new technology.

283
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,980
And so they say, oh, well, we already we are we approved the many vaccines.

284
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,780
We think they're probably pretty safe. And so over the bar for the boosters.

285
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:53,130
But but you're right, the the marginal benefit of those might be much lower than, again, the marginal benefit of that first cold vaccine, for example.

286
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:02,170
Other questions or comments. Yeah.

287
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,270
So that's kind of, you know, a high level kind of what drug drug element works.

288
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,460
Biologics are also really in. Oh, actually, one other thing to do anyway.

289
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,000
You ask about, you know, surrogate endpoints.

290
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,080
And I think that's really an issue not only for vaccines but really anything.

291
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,750
And I know there's concern in the world of cancer.

292
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:33,430
So typically what what they look at in cancer trials are and may have mentioned this in a class earlier,

293
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,570
but something called progression free survival. So everyone starts off and they have not progressed.

294
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:51,160
But over time, if your cancer kind of grows, it has progressed and then we'd consider you to not be in progression free anymore.

295
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,399
So progression free survival might look like something like this. So over time, more and more people progress.

296
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,809
So fewer and fewer people are progression free. And typically, that's what you might look like looking at in a in a trial.

297
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:12,090
And then you look at, you know, maybe the placebo. And then you might look at.

298
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,000
That's right. Which covers your health. And then you say, well, I got my new drug and.

299
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,920
Well, actually, that would be bad. If you're drug drivers, this green line, they'd be bad, right?

300
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,770
They're progressing faster. But anyway, if you that's how you do the trial and you look at progression free survival.

301
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:41,580
Now, if you have some sort of cancer, do you really know if your cancer tumor is one centimeter or 1.6 centimeters large?

302
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,270
No, you probably don't know that it the tumor really grew.

303
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:54,510
So progression free survival, although it's something that doctors can see by doing X-rays and MRI's and CT scans and stuff or ultrasound.

304
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:06,180
It might not be something the patient really cares about. And what we actually, you know, presumably really care about is is overall survival.

305
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,280
Are you alive or dead? And if any, everyone starts off alive and then eventually people are dead.

306
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,769
And, you know, presumably if this is placebo and the drug, you know,

307
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,640
which one would you prefer to have, the placebo or the drug, if this is the overall survival curve?

308
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:36,090
The drug rate, the drug, the overall survival. If it's higher, that means these people are longer, have a higher chance of being alive over time.

309
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,720
So but overall, overall survival, probably a better outcome to look at in the trials.

310
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:47,310
But oftentimes, cancer drugs will get approved based on progression free survival.

311
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,220
And sometimes, actually, when you look in the in oncology literature,

312
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,930
even though progression free survival looks better, overall survival is just the same.

313
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,780
It actually doesn't improve overall survival sometimes. And so, you know, there's there's some debate in the cancer world.

314
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:08,400
You know, what is inappropriate endpoint to look at is progression free survival, good overall survival.

315
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,650
I mean, I think most you would say overall survival is better.

316
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,880
But oftentimes, if you want to study overall survival, you have to study a longer period of time.

317
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,220
It's people make progress progression their cancer pretty quickly, but it might take longer for them to die.

318
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,560
And so if you're a drug manufacturer creating a new cancer drug, you probably don't want to run a trial for three years.

319
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,620
You prefer to join a trial for one year and just look at overall or progression

320
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,800
free survival instead of run a trial for three years and study overall survival.

321
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,200
So there's some interesting questions there about, you know, what are the appropriate endpoints.

322
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,480
Sometimes, again, if you're looking at those harder endpoints, oftentimes they're less frequent.

323
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,900
So you have a bigger sample sizes or they take longer to observe.

324
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,140
So you have to run a longer clinical trial and all those things sample size, length of trial, add cost.

325
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,140
They add delays to the process of getting, you know,

326
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,610
if there are valuable medications that at least are getting products out to the outside the population.

327
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:06,450
But so those are some of the concerns or some of the debates that people have about these certain endpoints.

328
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:17,460
So I want to talk briefly about biologics, too. You know, biologics are a little bit different from conventional drugs here.

329
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,980
And the typical they the the tricky thing.

330
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,480
One of the way to think about it is they're much more. They're kind of bigger molecules are more complex.

331
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,300
And oftentimes they're manufactured in some sort of living systems.

332
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,679
So you might have some sort of specialized bacteria or something like that that

333
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,180
will be creating these molecules internally to their systems versus just like,

334
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,559
hey, let me take some sodium and potassium chloride, mix the mix them together, take that.

335
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,660
And I guess sodium chloride, which is all salt or something, it's it's a much more involved manufacturing process.

336
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,170
It's not just A and B together. Mix it up and you've got your drug.

337
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:10,680
Again, this is, you know, things being manufactured in, you know, in in living systems or specialized micro, for example.

338
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,090
And I guess also an interesting thing here, too, is drugs generally have such a well-defined chemical structure.

339
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:26,910
And so you can say, okay, here is my, you know, my age and oh, my oxygen.

340
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,450
I have H2O. That's a very well defined chemical structure.

341
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:38,370
These biologics are so complex that they're actually difficult to difficult to characterize precisely in terms of their precise chemical structure.

342
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,979
And also, as is sometimes they say the product is there is the process because that finished

343
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,970
product can't be just described as one hydrogen and two oxygens bonded in this way.

344
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,860
They're kind of bigger, more complex molecules. It's hard to say that, you know, this molecule, you know, if I have this hard to say,

345
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,150
if know someone outside tried to replicate that molecule, it's hard for them to kind of do that.

346
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,040
So, you know, if you're Genentech, you know, creating a new biologic drug,

347
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,620
you've got your specialized process with your bacteria that are generated, you know, creating this this new compound.

348
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,880
And if someone else doesn't have that bacteria, it's hard for them to replicate that process of of these complex molecules.

349
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,080
So, again, it's actually really difficult to say something is the same.

350
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,830
And this goes for later about kind of generics.

351
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,470
It's much more difficult to say, I've got this generic biologic drug.

352
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:45,010
It's exactly the same. It's much easier to say I have for a small molecule drug to say, okay, you know, Pfizer created this new I'm sorry.

353
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,570
It's the other way around. Right? It's oh, sorry.

354
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:56,220
It's H2O. So two inches and one oxygen. So someone has said, I find when I've got this molecule, it's called water.

355
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,380
It's pretty easy for me to replicate that and say, okay, I can also create an oxygen with two hydrogens, right?

356
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,190
And say, that is exactly the same. My generic water is the same as Pfizer's water.

357
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,720
But again, if it's for these biologics, it's much more difficult.

358
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,770
If I'm trying to create a generic to say this is exactly the same as the just a reference product.

359
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,410
So another another kind of way of thinking about this here is you get your small molecule drug.

360
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,830
Aspirin is 21 atoms, a large molecule drug.

361
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:33,840
Human growth hormone, HGH, 3000 atoms. And then a large biologic, you know, like this antibody might be 25,000.

362
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,850
So this is kind of the scale of this. So this is, again, kind of like bike to car to to a jet.

363
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,460
So the level of complexity is much, much greater with these biologics.

364
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,980
And then again, this these biosimilars, you know, small molecule drugs can be chemically tested and to show that they're identical.

365
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,250
But these biosimilars are are not always exactly the same.

366
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:07,770
And by the way, the they might not be exact and they might not actually the biosimilar is the kind of generic biologic might not be exactly the same.

367
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,010
So this example here, your reference products might look like this.

368
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Your biosimilar product might not be exactly the same.

369
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,920
There might be a minor variation here, but it's possible that my minor variation really has no difference on its efficacy.

370
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,830
Of course, it's difficult for us to know, of course.

371
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,890
And so oftentimes there are different types of clinical studies that have to be done to show that this biosimilar is exactly the same.

372
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:41,040
Now, if I want to if I want to sell a cell, a generic aspirin, all I have to do is show FDA, hey,

373
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:47,370
this roughly speaking, this aspirin is the same chemical structure as what Bayer is selling.

374
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:57,390
Is there branded aspirin? Right. But for a biologic here, I can't just say I can't say my biologic is exactly the same as someone else's biologic.

375
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:05,370
Again, so it involves more, more, more FDA, a more rigorous FDA approval process to get a generic biologic approved.

376
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,140
And so these things are, you know, so anyway, there's a lot of debate, too,

377
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:18,480
about precisely how should FDA regulate biologics and how should we approve generic biologics or biosimilars, what they're called.

378
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:29,120
So this is you know, it's challenging. But the interesting part of this above the approval process, and I will say so typically, you know,

379
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:35,190
when a generic small molecule drug comes to the market, it's, you know, like ten times cheaper than the original product.

380
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,160
So so that, you know, dramatic oftentimes dramatically dramatically drops prices when generics get in the market.

381
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:50,700
Now for biologics, because the the new drug has to be so rigorously tested and because it's so complex and has to be dropped in such a way,

382
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:59,130
oftentimes a generic bio herb biosimilar when it comes on the market, it you don't see as drastic a reduction in price.

383
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,940
You know, maybe it'll drop the price in half instead of by a factor of ten.

384
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,660
So that's something to be aware of as well.

385
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:13,799
You know, oftentimes, again, you know, I've done work in hepatitis B and, you know, those drugs have dropped,

386
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,790
you know, on the order of, you know, order and order of magnitude cheaper in order to be cheaper.

387
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,890
And that has dramatically affected the, you know, the cost of these therapies.

388
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,490
But those were kind of, you know, not these are not biologics. And so they're much easier to produce.

389
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,870
And that's had a dramatic kind of policy impact with these things are, you know, ten times cheaper in price.

390
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:43,830
But when you have biologic, biologics, biosimilars, you know, those things might not drop as dramatically in price when you get generic the market.

391
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:54,850
Yes, I do have a do you know how long it takes time for biosimilars to come to the market regardless of the pattern issues.

392
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:04,450
So it cost them to develop. So that is that is also something that that's being worked through and changing is,

393
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,650
you know, how long is the is the patent protection for for biologics?

394
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:19,360
And in five weeks, if that's a complex question, I guess, because there there's like patent protection of the of the product itself.

395
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,959
But there might be process patents about how and how it's actually produced.

396
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,360
And because the process is so more complex for biologics, that also can be a hurdle, I think.

397
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,850
But, you know, oftentimes, yeah, I think we'll get to that in a few slides here.

398
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,890
And I think we've got a few slides on patent protection as well.

399
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:46,320
So one of the things to think about here is that kind of economics of drug development, too, to understand why some of these costs might be so high.

400
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:52,320
So again, maybe one in 5000 compounds administered going through the preclinical process actually becomes an approved drug.

401
00:40:52,650 --> 00:41:03,240
But one in ten drugs that start clinical trials get FDA approval. But the and actually, you have to be a little bit careful.

402
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:12,419
So, again, if you think about that funnel, if you take the drug, it comes out the end and say, well, what did it costs to get that?

403
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:21,390
And you just look at that pathway for that particular drug. It might not look that expensive and say, look, you know, that drug we spent, you know,

404
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:30,930
$50 million in clinical trials and then we pay Dr. Jones and and her lab $3 million to develop it.

405
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,840
And we paid Dr. Smith $2 million to do preclinical work and so forth.

406
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,850
It doesn't look that expensive.

407
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,780
But what you have to think about is in order to get that drug at the end, you actually have to pay for Dr. Robertson's work.

408
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:57,509
That was there wasn't a successful and and, you know, all the all the other 5000 compounds that started at the beginning that weren't successful.

409
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:04,290
If you're if you're a Pfizer, if you are Merck, whoever developing these things, you don't know it at the outset.

410
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,790
Which of those 5000 compounds is actually going to be successful?

411
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:11,670
So you have to develop all of them and you don't even know of those ten that are getting FDA approval,

412
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,060
which one will actually be successful at the end. So you have to fund all of them.

413
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,860
And even if you said abolish all pharmaceutical companies, let's have the federal government do this,

414
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,659
the federal government would have to invest in 5000 compounds to get to ten drugs,

415
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,490
to research clinical trials, to get one approved the drug, because those costs wouldn't disappear.

416
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:35,760
And so there are, you know, again again, this is highly debated about precisely what these costs are.

417
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,290
But I think, you know, one study here found that if you include those costs of the drugs,

418
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,710
which I would argue are real costs of developing the drugs, the average cost involving approved drug is about $3 billion.

419
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,140
Now, someone else might say it's it's 2.1.

420
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:57,630
Someone might say seven, say is 1.2. But, you know, on the orders of, you know, a billion or more dollars.

421
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,540
And so that's expensive. And how many of you have heard about orphan drugs?

422
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,750
So I don't want to say it. Tell us what orphan drug is is for real diseases.

423
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,219
It's for a rare disease. And as you can imagine, if it if I'm Merck, if I'm at work and I know it kind of cost me 3 million,

424
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:25,860
$3.3 billion to develop a drug, I need to know that I can get $3 billion in profit from this drug to pay for all the development.

425
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:32,759
And so I'm less incentivized to develop a drug for a rare disease because there might

426
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,360
not be just a big enough market size to give me over $3 billion in revenue from that.

427
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,200
So either.

428
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:47,970
Well, a few things either I want to, you know, develop a drug for a large market, or if I develop for a smaller market or an orphan disease,

429
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,920
I need to charge a really big price for it to cover my capital for my costs of developing.

430
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:00,420
Now, in some ways, though, maybe we should incentivize drug makers to make drugs for, you know, really common diseases, right?

431
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,310
Wouldn't it be great if they could cure heart disease and cancer and some really big problem diseases?

432
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:13,650
But the FDA does have some processes that make it easier to approve with kind of smaller

433
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,810
trials or maybe surrogate endpoints as opposed to approved drugs for orphan diseases.

434
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,860
So the process is a little bit easier, less burdensome. And the idea was to reduce this cost of developing drugs for orphan diseases.

435
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,590
So we would have more drugs out there for for liver diseases, although some people would argue that.

436
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:41,399
And now we're incentivizing manufacturers to develop cures for orphan diseases and neglecting the more

437
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:49,860
problems like drug makers without using extended patent protection ought to be used to incentivize them.

438
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,540
Yeah. And so, yeah, there are several types of incentives here to incentivize drug manufacturers to to develop orphan drug for orphanages.

439
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,830
And actually, sometimes my understanding is sometimes manufacturers will create a drug for and to try to solve an orphan disease.

440
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,170
They get this real production and they realize, oh, actually, this drug cannot be used.

441
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:16,650
It's probably useful for a thousand other conditions which aren't orphan diseases, but then they still have this long patent protection.

442
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,139
So that sometimes is a strategy that they sort of think they used is they'll look at their foot in the door, if you will, with an orphan and then say,

443
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:34,200
oh, by the way, this compound and then try and, you know, expand the indication to a bunch of other things, you know, with clinical trials and stuff.

444
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,090
So again, here's a kind of sense of the timeline for for development stages of the pharmaceutical research.

445
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:49,290
So again, you're starting with thousands of compounds. It might be 3 to 6 years to this kind of preclinical work.

446
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,580
And then clinical trials oftentimes might be, you know, five or ten years or so.

447
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,600
And then this regulatory approval process can be, you know, half a year to two years.

448
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,790
Now, we did see with the coronavirus vaccines, though, this process can be highly accelerated.

449
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,340
But this is kind of the traditional, traditional timeline for these kinds of things.

450
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,729
But as you can imagine, though, here, I mean,

451
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,860
it's more than a decade or so to get from how I think about this compound that will cure cancer or whatever,

452
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,900
to get something that's that's actually on the market. So it can take a very long time.

453
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,300
And that patterns, exclusivity are important for drug developers.

454
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,520
The idea here is that the drug manufacturers make back those those costs by

455
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:39,580
charging high prices and they're legally protected by patents and exclusivity.

456
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,230
So they get patents from the Patent Trademark Trademark Office and FDA gives them exclusivity.

457
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:52,300
Those things might be concurrent with each other. And so here's a rough kind of timeline of what patent protection might look like.

458
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:59,169
So you've got some sort of drug being discovered, and then they're doing, you know,

459
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,990
the investible national drug device and then the FDA approval, so forth.

460
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:11,350
And then there might be patent protection here for, you know, 20 years.

461
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:18,130
But it depends on when the patent is filed. Oftentimes, the panel we file as the compound is being developed.

462
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:28,540
So it's not kind of 20 years since FDA approval. It's 20 years since the patent was filed, which is often, you know, many years before FDA approval.

463
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,950
And then, of course, there are extensions that the Congress gives and so forth.

464
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:46,230
And then and then there might be in this example, this is, you know, the generic companies, you know, might be developing testing things.

465
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:54,610
But again, it might be, you know, from FDA approval here, it might be another decade or more before a generic comes out.

466
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:02,640
And again, this stuff can can vary based on whether it's an orphan, drug or biologic and so forth.

467
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,480
So, you know, this exclusivity period lasts different periods of time.

468
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,309
So again, orphan drugs, it might be seven years. New chemical entities like five years.

469
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:20,540
So there are a bunch of different I mean, you have to be like a lawyer who studied for a decade or so.

470
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:27,450
They don't understand all the legal details about precisely what the length of these patent protections and exclusivity protections are.

471
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,470
And it is it is complicated. And some of it you can get bonuses again if you're an orphan, drug and so forth.

472
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:41,980
But typically, this is something on the order of 5 to 10. Okay.

473
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,620
So just to kind of go through the economics of this,

474
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:53,610
I want to walk through an example of how how much it might cost to conduct trials on FDA approved drugs and FDA approved drugs.

475
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:00,070
So I think here under modules.

476
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,670
There is a file here called Distribution of Drugs.

477
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,280
Drug and trial, drug trial success here.

478
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,370
And, you know, I love spreadsheets. So to create a spreadsheet to go through an example here and.

479
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:43,520
Here. I have a very crude example of drugs starting to make me go back here, which is this year.

480
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:50,030
Let's go through this example first. So this is these are some.

481
00:49:52,340 --> 00:50:01,020
This is from an article that is walking through costs of trials for novel therapeutic agents.

482
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,950
And so here we have this is one of the tables and their results here.

483
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,460
And they have different costs of different types of trials.

484
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:20,990
So, for example, cardiovascular trials, the average cost of a cardiovascular trial was $157 million.

485
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,570
And then we talk about surrogate endpoints.

486
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:33,950
And so if you had a surrogate endpoint or some sort of clinical scale, the cost of the trial is like, let me zoom in here.

487
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:41,600
Let me see maybe. The cost was maybe in the $20 million range.

488
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,530
But if you actually had a global outcome, like I'm looking for heart attacks and strokes and deaths,

489
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,360
things like that, the cost of the trial was about triple that, $64 million.

490
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:59,360
Okay. So, again, looking for the heart outcomes that we really care about, that's going to make the trials more expensive.

491
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:06,140
Also, if you look at the trial design, if you have no control group, if you just say, hey,

492
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,750
let's study Lipitor or let's just give people Lipitor and not compare it to a placebo or something else,

493
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,620
that's going to be a relatively inexpensive trial. That's $30 million here.

494
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:23,090
But if you compare it to a placebo analysis that doubles the cost of your trial, said about $29 million.

495
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,510
And then if you want to compare it to another active drug,

496
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,440
which I would argue if there is another active drug in the market, is what you should be doing.

497
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,920
Right. If you're going to compare and let's look at Lipitor for cholesterol reduction,

498
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,980
where you should compare it to another cholesterol reducing medication.

499
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:44,360
So if you compare it to another drug, that, again, almost kind of doubles the double dose, the cost of your trial, it's more expensive.

500
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,010
Typically, you'll need a bigger sample size. You actually have to pay for that other drug and so forth.

501
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,149
Your clinical trials, more expensive numbers of patients enrolled.

502
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,330
Also, that's a huge driver of the cost. If you have a trial under 100 patients, maybe on average, it's about $6 million.

503
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,320
But of these trials, if they're, you know, thousands of patients.

504
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,520
NELSON It's 30 million, seven, $70 million to to do your trial.

505
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,420
So the bigger the trial, maybe not surprisingly, is going to be more expensive.

506
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:16,160
And also the duration of the trial, if it's less than half a year or 26 weeks or less.

507
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:22,250
It's about 29 hours. If you're more than half a year. In this example, what they found is that, you know, $50 million.

508
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,309
So these trials definitely scale in terms of cost.

509
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,370
And sure enough, when you have larger trials with more people.

510
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,460
And when you look over a longer period of time and when you look at those kind of harder income comes here,

511
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:40,580
comes out of, you know, hospitalizations, strokes, deaths, heart attacks, things.

512
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,200
What kind of, you know, big picture here, you're not doing a trial for kind of the most case.

513
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,610
You're for less than $5 million.

514
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:59,570
And, you know, if you're doing your pivotal remember the the initial trials are probably on the order of you know, less than 100 patients is.

515
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,180
That's where you're probably going to have those inexpensive trials.

516
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:09,020
But when you're doing your phase two, phase three trials now, all of a sudden you're in the tens of millions of dollars to run those trials.

517
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,260
So again, if we recall that about one in ten drugs,

518
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,050
the drugs that start the clinical trial process to get FDA approval, we have three phases of the trials.

519
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:27,670
Let's look at this spreadsheet now. So this spreadsheet here, I have an example here of.

520
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,480
Of what your total cost might be to get an FDA approved drug here.

521
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:46,370
So. Let's say we have ten drugs starting the process in phase one and maybe 50% chance of being successful in phase one.

522
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,410
So that means five drugs will complete phase one successfully.

523
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:58,640
And we'll say the cost in this example is $1 million, which is kind of line.

524
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,730
So our total costs would be $10 million. We had ten drug, ten clinical trial, phase one trials.

525
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:12,380
Million bucks. At least $10 million. So if five drugs completed, then we have five drugs start phase two trials.

526
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:17,090
Okay, let's say it is a 30% chance. And, you know, these numbers are made up.

527
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,620
You can change them if you double the spreadsheet. But I think roughly they're about right, 30%.

528
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:27,410
So we have about one and a half drugs successful at the end of the phase two trials.

529
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,180
So we start with five. We end up with one and a half kind of finishing phase two.

530
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,260
But let's say phase two is a bigger trial, right? It's bigger sample size, better looking at more important outcomes.

531
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:45,820
It is $5 million to do that trial. So we spent five we did five of these $5 million trials.

532
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:54,710
We spent $25 million. And then phase three, we had about one and a half drugs that passed phase two and go into phase three.

533
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,460
Let's say once it gets to phase three, we're pretty sure it's going to work.

534
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:04,010
So let's say it's maybe. Two thirds chance it's actually going to be successful out of phase three.

535
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,030
So we end up this is giving up going from ten down to about one drug, it being successful out of phase three.

536
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:16,070
And but let's say that costs $10 million to run that phase three trial.

537
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,360
So one and a half phase three trials, 10 million bucks apiece.

538
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,020
Now, that's $15 million we spent on phase three trials.

539
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:34,760
And so in the end, we get about, you know, one, one, if we start with ten drugs, we get one out and about in the pipeline that's approved.

540
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:42,080
And we spent $50 million, $10 million in phase one, $25 million in phase two, $50 million of phase three trials.

541
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:48,440
Now, these are just numbers I kind of made up here. You can change these probabilities if you want, or you can say,

542
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,350
what if we start with 100 drugs and we get ten at the end of the end of the hour to the end of the pipeline here?

543
00:55:54,650 --> 00:56:02,170
And you can say, well, what if this is a $3 million to do these trials and this is $10 million and this is $30 million to run my phase,

544
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,760
phase three trial if I'm doing something in a different disease.

545
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:13,880
Now, I spent, you know, $1.2 billion to get ten, ten drugs out of this.

546
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:19,280
So you can kind of play around with this to get a rough sense of things here.

547
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:24,910
Made changes back to ten though to to show kind of once.

548
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:35,350
So this is this in a simple example this is, you know the cost to go through the FDA approval process and get one drug out of the end.

549
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:43,630
Now, this isn't the total cost of drug development. This is just this is just the kind of running the clinical trials part of it.

550
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:46,359
There's all that pre-clinical work, too, that's expensive.

551
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:53,110
And then actually submitting the FDA approval process documents said not too expensive, I suppose, compared to bidding.

552
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:59,319
So this is giving us a sense of some of these a sense of kind of how you might think

553
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,990
about the total costs of kind of getting through FDA approval for one approved drug.

554
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:12,219
Now, one of the thing I want to highlight here is what I've done here, too.

555
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:19,960
Another thing I want to highlight is this is not just saying if you're Merck or Pfizer or whoever Roche,

556
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,410
that if you put in $125 million, you're guaranteed to have one drug out at the end of the pipeline.

557
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,100
So right down here, about at lower in these rows here, I have this kind of same kind of thing.

558
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,430
We start with ten. Ten drugs at the start.

559
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:44,930
But then and we still have, you know, 50% chance of success, 36% chance of sex at 66% chance of success.

560
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:56,630
But now the drugs completing here I set that up is is a formula that actually randomly randomly tells us how many drugs would come at the other end.

561
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,770
So in this example here we start with ten 50% chance of success.

562
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:05,509
We flip the coin ten times. We got three heads in this example.

563
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,710
So we have three sorry. We have we have three successes.

564
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,909
We started three drugs in phase two. 33% chance of success.

565
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,840
So think about the flipping coin. It's 30% chance of heads and no one came out successful.

566
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:22,460
So it's possible if you start with ten drugs, yet no successes out the other end.

567
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,057
Now, if I hit nine on my keyboard here, I should.

568
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:37,123
I'm a screw up. But I think if I click on this and enter it again now it reroll the dice.

569
00:58:37,393 --> 00:58:42,793
And I got three successes out of phase one one success a phase two and none out of phase three.

570
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:47,083
So grand total of zero approved drugs. I spent $90 million, got no approved drugs.

571
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:51,523
We try this again. Oh, this time I had ten start.

572
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:59,023
Five completed. Phase one, five started. Phase two, one completed that phase two one drug started phase three.

573
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:05,682
And it was successful. So I got my winner, my, my, my drug through approval this time.

574
00:59:05,683 --> 00:59:10,573
Oh, now I rolled the dice again. This time I got really lucky. I had five get into phase one.

575
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:14,983
We started phase two with five we got three. We were lucky we had three.

576
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:21,343
The past phase two and then phase three we started three and all three made it through and became FDA approved drug.

577
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:24,373
So this is this is what the pharmacy companies are hoping for.

578
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:29,363
They put in ten drugs in them and in the beginning of the funnel and they get three at the other end.

579
00:59:29,383 --> 00:59:30,823
Now they've now they're big winners.

580
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:40,003
So I guess what I want to highlight here is there is a lot of there is risk that is faced by the pharmaceutical companies.

581
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:45,943
If they could invest a lot of money and get nothing out the other end or they can invest a lot of money in and get a big payday.

582
00:59:46,213 --> 00:59:49,242
So there's there's a high variance in terms of what their outcomes might be.

583
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:53,982
They could be it's kind of feast or famine, right? They could have famine and no drugs affects it as well.

584
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:59,533
They're going to feast and they can have a bunch of drugs that are really successful and and and make a ton of profits.

585
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:12,403
And in fact, one might argue that that's kind of why these large pharmaceutical companies exist, is to is to take that risk.

586
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:18,732
So instead of if you're if you're just a a mom and pop pharmaceutical company

587
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:21,853
and you have one drug going in the in the beginning of the approval process,

588
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:28,633
you face a lot of risk. There's a good chance there's only a 90% chance that will fail and you'll lose all your money.

589
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:34,903
Or you could have a big payday. You put your one in and you have a 10% chance of going to be successful.

590
01:00:35,953 --> 01:00:41,172
But with the drug companies, one of their functions, I think what they do is they aggregate this all together.

591
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:48,763
So they have a lot of drugs in our pipeline. They know on average, again, 10% would be coming out the other end.

592
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:56,143
So they can better manage that uncertainty. But if we think about this over here, here is a histogram of drugs completing the Phase three trials.

593
01:00:56,443 --> 01:01:02,863
If we start with ten drugs at the beginning and again, on average, that means they'll have one successful product,

594
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:08,533
but there's a 35% chance they'll have zero successful products out the other end.

595
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:13,933
Okay. There's also a 35% chance they'll have one successful product out the other end,

596
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:23,713
but there's also a 20% chance they'll have two successful products out the other end and a ten 5% chance they'll have three and so forth.

597
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:27,703
And so there is there's a chance they'll have a big a really big payday, if you will.

598
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:31,093
And there's also a pretty good chance, 30% chance, 35% chance, whatever.

599
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:37,963
It'll have no pain. So there's a lot of it's a high risk business compared to a lot of other businesses you could be in.

600
01:01:39,013 --> 01:01:41,893
So long as you're thinking about going into pharmaceuticals,

601
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:46,543
it is a higher risk industry than going into a hospital or being a hospital administrator or anything.

602
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:51,102
It's pretty hard that there's very little variance in working at a hospital

603
01:01:51,103 --> 01:01:55,873
and your profits and loss and so forth compared to being in pharmaceuticals. Whereas it could be again, feast or famine.

604
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:59,203
You could get laid off next year or you could get a huge bonus next year kind of thing.

605
01:02:03,073 --> 01:02:10,543
Any questions? Okay.

606
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:17,853
So just another. And so that was just kind of a simple example. And you can walk through that if you want to download the file and play with it.

607
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:28,533
This is just another example here about about kind of those costs and they estimate the cost to of a launch drag here is $1.7 billion.

608
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:32,943
And what I just showed you was really kind of a phase one, phase two, phase three.

609
01:02:34,323 --> 01:02:38,943
These guys looked at it, you know, from the very beginning targetted.

610
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:44,012
I should highlight here, all the authors are employees and shareholders of Eli Lilly and Company.

611
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:49,383
So they have a sort of perspective to how they take this. They might also have some good insider information, though, about the costs.

612
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:52,293
But anyway. Yeah, so they're looking here, you know,

613
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:59,622
if you start with some sort of target and then you create something hit and hit to lead a lead to up and lead to optimization.

614
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:03,753
And then you do preventive work and then based one face to face three, then you submit it to FDA.

615
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:08,973
So they have, you know, probability of success here and each phase here.

616
01:03:09,393 --> 01:03:16,593
So this is kind of where I get that 50, 30, 70% risks and in itself out there, you know.

617
01:03:18,853 --> 01:03:22,663
And so forth. So. And. And here. Yeah.

618
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:29,322
So, again, what they figure here is that, you know, the cost per launch, again,

619
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:36,463
you're spending over $100 million in these early phases or $400 million to to do all the work in lead optimization,

620
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:41,113
$150 million in preclinical work, and then, you know, another billion dollars or so.

621
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:48,793
And in that FDA approval process to get this $1.7 billion number out the other end.

622
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:56,433
Okay. So we talked a lot about drugs. Let's talk briefly about devices.

623
01:03:58,393 --> 01:04:01,633
So the U.S. is a big part of this device.

624
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:06,943
Regulations is slightly different. We have a class one cost to class three devices.

625
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:11,472
Class one is like band aids and class three is like heart valves.

626
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,563
Remains implanted in your body. Low risk versus high risk.

627
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:21,793
And there are more intense regulation here of these high risk devices versus the low risk devices.

628
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:31,703
Again. And one of the things that you look at was an article, you know, highlighting some of these risks, though,

629
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:44,593
of jobs or trade offs between higher and lower classes of regulation that that looked at lowering the risk.

630
01:04:44,603 --> 01:04:50,663
So reclassifying something that was of high risk down to lower risk class levels.

631
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:53,543
I'll skip this one here.

632
01:04:53,843 --> 01:05:05,743
One thing they found is if something is is bogged down to a lower risk, class utilization increased, which is maybe not surprising on the first day,

633
01:05:05,753 --> 01:05:12,623
prices maybe showed a lower and declining trend, which makes more sense if something is involves less regulation.

634
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:21,412
Now, if these things are down regulated in terms of put in the lower classes of regulation, we might be concerned about adverse events.

635
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:27,503
And there is some suggestion that maybe adverse events did increase a little bit of a mortality.

636
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:33,053
It looks like it didn't change much in life. Threatening adverse events did change much. This is going from class 3 to 2.

637
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,533
This is going interestingly, going from class two to class one.

638
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:42,803
It looks like all these adverse event rates really dropped. Interestingly, there are some.

639
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:51,083
Apparently as you go from here, if you're in class to if you go through the FDA process,

640
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:57,923
FDA provides some legal protection for you in terms of getting sued if you get sued for things versus if you're a class one.

641
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:06,982
You don't have those legal protections. And so the authors of this study argue that if you damage something from class 2 to 1 now,

642
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:11,153
all of a sudden these companies are on the hook for four adverse events.

643
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:16,853
They could legally be sued for that. And so that actually improve safety that you see mortality in all these other things decline.

644
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:24,032
And of course, the usage really shows up here.

645
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:29,973
And here's an example from the 1990s of different types of contact lenses.

646
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:40,233
So there are the extended wear which are highly regulated, and then the daily wear which were downgraded and kind of deregulated and the,

647
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:48,033
you know, the usage of the daily wear, you know, lenses really dramatically jumped up after they were down regulated.

648
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:55,563
So these are things that, you know, that might be one way to kind of expand access without especially with going from class 2 to 1,

649
01:06:56,703 --> 01:07:03,513
without harming the population in terms of adverse events.

650
01:07:04,383 --> 01:07:10,803
So anyway, I think it's interesting, too, that this study, you know, does again, look at some of those trade offs between, you know,

651
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:19,653
FDA protecting people from harm, but then also giving people more access to, you know, less expensive medical devices in this case.

652
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:29,073
Another kind of interesting thing about insurance payment for devices is that, you know,

653
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:35,833
there are oftentimes these are the costs for devices are are embedded or bundled into other services.

654
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:40,453
So when your doctor does a knee replacement, they don't charge you for the actual device.

655
01:07:40,453 --> 01:07:43,153
They'll just charge you $50,000 for the surgery, for example.

656
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:49,983
And so often as the hospital is eating the cost of that device, that's kind of just part of their bundled payment.

657
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:53,653
So they think about things differently in terms of the cost of those things.

658
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,463
And sometimes there are some new technology payments.

659
01:07:58,363 --> 01:08:03,853
What I want to get the last few minutes here is how do we think of cost effectiveness analysis for new drugs and devices?

660
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:11,383
Well, U.S. payers, you know, private payers, sometimes they do use cost effectiveness,

661
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:14,743
analyzes CVS is talking about using cost effective sources for drugs.

662
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:18,593
Medicare Part D potentially can do that.

663
01:08:18,613 --> 01:08:27,073
VA certainly does with formulary from pharmacy management and more often used in the international settings here.

664
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:33,943
But what I want to highlight here and actually many of you might have heard of this Institute for Clinical Economic Review.

665
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:40,273
I showed you some of their articles I think earlier or some of their discussed and briefly in some other earlier classes.

666
01:08:40,873 --> 01:08:49,393
They're also trying to it's an independent organization, trying to use comparative effectiveness, cost effectiveness to give guidance to payers.

667
01:08:51,913 --> 01:08:55,633
You may have also heard of Pharma, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.

668
01:08:56,983 --> 01:09:04,723
They are, you know, advocating for the needs and wants of the pharmaceutical industry.

669
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:08,863
And we'll say they do this kind of support cost for this,

670
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:15,852
but they're not excited about ICER organization and they certainly have concerns that this is

671
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:19,693
just kind of a long list of some of their concerns about the use of cost effective policies.

672
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:30,853
Yeah, but let me finally kind of briefly review this paper here on again, this is from over ten years ago,

673
01:09:31,093 --> 01:09:36,823
but does, I think highlight some interesting things about the use of cost effective analysis for pharmaceuticals?

674
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:47,153
Again, mostly about half of costs are based on the pharmaceuticals, and about 12% or so of spending is on drugs.

675
01:09:49,543 --> 01:09:53,563
You just skip through some things here on Wall Street, some graphs here.

676
01:09:55,573 --> 01:10:02,892
So this is kind of a growth. And these so certainly there's a lot of growth in in these studies.

677
01:10:02,893 --> 01:10:05,953
And again, about half or so are pharmaceutical ones.

678
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:13,363
And a lot of these are in the U.S. The U.S. is this top line, I mean, slightly declining.

679
01:10:13,633 --> 01:10:20,563
The percentage of our cost effectiveness analysis maybe is dropping with the U.S. but still a large number of these are in the U.S.

680
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:28,823
And. I think this is an interesting one here.

681
01:10:29,843 --> 01:10:38,213
So this is the cost effectiveness ratio in terms of dollars per calling, and this is a logarithmic scale on the Y axis here.

682
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:45,083
And so I think it's interesting to look at, you know, differences in.

683
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:57,193
In the end the analysis by the different types of interventions that are looking at.

684
01:10:57,193 --> 01:10:59,053
So for example, you know,

685
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:06,583
you could do a cost of dialysis on care delivery or devices or diagnostics or some sort of health education and behavior intervention.

686
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:17,923
So here we can see we've been talking a lot about pharmaceuticals as this bar here, you know,

687
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:23,593
they're kind of kind of in the middle of the pack, maybe a little bit higher, though.

688
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:27,103
Some of these are like health, behavior and education. One is interventions.

689
01:11:27,373 --> 01:11:31,723
Oftentimes those are, you know, pretty cheap interventions and seem to get good value for money.

690
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:42,713
Again, it's where you have a lower cost ratio that's better. And so this is by that this is the type of study B here.

691
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:50,703
This is who funded the study? Do you see anything interesting here in terms of the cost of air fresheners and who funded the study?

692
01:11:53,983 --> 01:11:58,963
Yes, ma'am. I think that's super. Like they think they are super cost effective.

693
01:11:59,443 --> 01:12:06,583
Yeah. If the pharmaceutical device manufacturer funded the study, we we do see I mean, the media maybe isn't too far off.

694
01:12:06,763 --> 01:12:12,133
But yeah, there are a lot of them that say, hey, we're cost saving. And very few are going to say it's really, really expensive.

695
01:12:13,153 --> 01:12:24,013
Yeah, I guess my question is, for a lot of drugs, the fundamental research and drug discovery are funded by the NIH or from the government.

696
01:12:24,463 --> 01:12:31,183
And how they distinguish the money or the sources of the money.

697
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:38,743
Because here is this. Oh, this. So this, this, this is the, um, the sponsorship of this study.

698
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:46,423
So this would be, and when I say the study, the cost effectiveness study, so typically after some sort of new medication is developed,

699
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:52,843
someone will like myself or maybe someone in pharmaceutical industry might create a cost effective results.

700
01:12:53,563 --> 01:12:57,943
And so this is who paid for that final analysis.

701
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:06,503
Now, you're right, that new drug maybe 20 years before was there was some basic science done funded by NIH.

702
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:11,183
But what we're talking about here is that is the founder of the cost effectiveness study, you know.

703
01:13:13,163 --> 01:13:20,123
Now with that said, look, you know, I do these types of analyzes and I'm probably biased and some of the analyzes I do.

704
01:13:21,203 --> 01:13:25,732
And in some ways I am a competitor to people in the pharmaceutical industry doing these analyzes.

705
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:29,963
So take everything I'm saying here with a grain of salt. But, you know, this study is is interesting.

706
01:13:32,423 --> 01:13:41,233
Yeah. And again, the sponsorship here. The odds ratio that the cost ratio is is more favorable.

707
01:13:41,653 --> 01:13:44,973
Here we have the pharmaceutical device manufacturer and, you know,

708
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:51,763
it's it's higher odds are more likely because they're going to find a drug to be favorable or considered cost efficient.

709
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:58,153
Or if you're a pharmaceutical company and you're developing evaluating a pharmaceutical device or a medical device.

710
01:14:03,553 --> 01:14:10,183
Actually, there's less work. But if it's sponsored by the pharmacy, what device manufacturers are more likely to be fearful?

711
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:18,203
Yes. Or if the sponsorship and sponsorship and a phone call, they don't like it.

712
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,313
They don't publish any negative. Why?

713
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:28,453
So there could be an issue. I mean, you could think about it as as the analysts are biased or if the analysts find something is not favorable,

714
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:31,883
it may be just don't even publish it. So that there could be publication bias there as well.

715
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:39,883
Or maybe the pharmaceutical companies never release any drugs that are not cost effective.

716
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:46,213
They just like the bus.

717
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:55,603
So just kind of as our eyes, our conclusion for today here, there are really high costs and risks associated with drug and device development.

718
01:14:56,483 --> 01:15:00,283
You know, there are these new innovations. There is a lot of interest in evaluating the value of them.

719
01:15:00,973 --> 01:15:05,683
You know, we're we're really excited about these new innovations, drugs, devices, vaccines, anything like that.

720
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:09,653
But we're also very interested in are they valuable?

721
01:15:09,693 --> 01:15:16,603
You know, what is the value that they provide? And there's kind of growing use of cost of our facilities, both by payers and manufacturers.

722
01:15:18,993 --> 01:15:25,023
There are certainly payers who are interested in reading these. They're academics like myself in publishing this type of thing.

723
01:15:25,323 --> 01:15:30,633
And there are manufacturers also who are interested and in developing this analysis as well.

724
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:42,263
And the final graph here is just showing our kind of crazy U.S. health care system with all the different parties involved here,

725
01:15:42,863 --> 01:15:49,103
the manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacy, wholesaler, provider, insurance provider.

726
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:56,173
And then you hear the consumer are, you know, several layers deep forever in this kind of web of things.

727
01:15:59,553 --> 01:16:04,593
With that, I will stop here. Any questions?

728
01:16:04,623 --> 01:16:08,123
Yes. So what do you work in the space like?

729
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:15,003
You know how, like these prospect segments analysis work and obviously how the FDA works in approving these sorts of things.

730
01:16:15,213 --> 01:16:21,152
Like if you were to, like go to Congress and make a recommendation about like what they should do to make the system,

731
01:16:21,153 --> 01:16:26,073
like, just, like, less screwed up. Like what? What's your, like, top two recommendations?

732
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:34,742
So then there are there are a few things. I mean,

733
01:16:34,743 --> 01:16:42,482
I actually do like the the distinction between like the FDA which approves something and is kind of allowing

734
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:50,763
it to be marketed and then having a different organized or set of organizations that actually say,

735
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,413
will we actually pay for this?

736
01:16:52,443 --> 01:17:00,153
So I think I think it is it is I think it's okay to separate kind of cost effectiveness from kind of the clinical effectiveness of of something,

737
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:01,953
you know, should something be paid for?

738
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:11,222
I mean, the first thing is, you know, but I will say that kind of this mess, I mean, this is a complicated mess, really.

739
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,983
Everything is probably ten times more complicated than it needs to be.

740
01:17:15,373 --> 01:17:22,683
There's yeah, that's kind of a bigger health care system issue of, you know, your insurance being tied to the employer, etc., etc.

741
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:37,502
Yeah, but FDA approval, you know, I think yeah, I think it could be kind of simplified and streamlined and and maybe yeah.

742
01:17:37,503 --> 01:17:45,303
I mean, I think there is a I think we should have, you know, kind of strong evidence for for safety and efficacy.

743
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:53,693
But I think, you know, the process could be a lot a lot faster as well.

744
01:17:54,083 --> 01:18:00,423
And. You know, there are there are kind of a bunch of little things to the you know,

745
01:18:00,423 --> 01:18:06,723
my understanding is the European Medicines Agency as your if you're a manufacturer submitting something for approval,

746
01:18:07,143 --> 01:18:11,613
you can submit information all along the process.

747
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:14,793
And then when you reach your final results, submit your final results.

748
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:23,163
The FDA apparently, allegedly requires you won't let you turn on anything until you have everything.

749
01:18:23,493 --> 01:18:26,943
So then they send this, you know, giant set of stuff to the FDA.

750
01:18:27,213 --> 01:18:34,413
And then the FDA has to scramble to kind of consume and understand all that information all at once.

751
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:45,543
So that kind of delays the process. So some things are there in that process as well that are, you know, that are slow things down.

752
01:18:45,843 --> 01:18:53,763
So, you know, I don't know. But there are. But for some things, too, I mean, it might be nice to have some some more thresholds,

753
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:58,953
like if something is it, we think it's it's effective, but we're certainly sure it's safe.

754
01:18:59,253 --> 01:19:02,373
You know, maybe let people try it and see how well that that works.

755
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:06,063
But maybe you don't pay for it. Maybe as a payer, you're not obligated to pay for it.

756
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:12,752
I think the the thing that we sometimes get confused about is we think, oh, is this FDA approved?

757
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:16,293
Everyone should pay for it. Well, that might not be might not be the case.

758
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:22,353
Even if something looks like it's safe and effective. I don't think I don't think people should be forbidden from accessing that.

759
01:19:22,563 --> 01:19:27,243
You know, hey, if you want to pull money out of your pocket to pay for something, so that probably should be okay.

760
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:37,053
But the but maybe, you know, Blue Cross or Medicare or Medicaid should be forced to to pay for that FDA approval.

761
01:19:40,163 --> 01:19:45,663
I know. But there is there is an unfortunately, there isn't really necessarily a good kind of silver bullet for this.

762
01:19:45,753 --> 01:19:50,483
It is much more complicated than it probably probably needs to be.

763
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:56,550
Yeah. For some of these things, it might be nice to just say, okay, let's start.
