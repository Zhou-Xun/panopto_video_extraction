1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,409
People are slowly trickling in, but we'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,120
And Dr. Herz, dining of the hour and 20 minutes.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:18,180
So hello, everyone. This morning we have Dr. Jonathan Burstein joining us from Switzerland.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,800
She is an assistant professor in the College of Public Health at the University of

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,950
Nebraska Medical Center and a scholar of the UMC Global Center for Health Security.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,000
She also serves as a director of International Partnerships and programs for

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,650
the U.S. National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,880
Her research is in high consequence infectious disease preparedness and management, with a focus on training.

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:55,350
And these two people okay with a focus on training and education, infection prevention and control and occupational health.

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,420
Drosten also serves as a U.A.E. focal point for their partnership with the World Health

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,960
Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and serves on the go and research team.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,770
So today she's here to talk to us about her experiences working on interprofessional teams.

13
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,419
So, Dr. Hassan, I'll let you take it away. Thank you so much.

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,899
I'm going to go ahead and share my screen and everyone see it.

15
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,810
Okay. And to put it into. That working fine.

16
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,650
Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. Well, thank you, Dr. Lee.

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm excited to be here talking about interprofessional teams.

18
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,500
Dr. Lee and I go back to a very interprofessional team where we first met about seven, eight years ago now.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,949
And I think for me and professional teams have really been the foundation of my career.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,009
And I think, safe to say, a foundation of a lot of the successes that I've had so far is working with these very multi-disciplinary,

21
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,909
interprofessional teams.

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,780
So I'm really excited to be able to speak about some of my experience with my core team from the Global Center for Health Security at UT,

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,960
M.S. and with some of my more recent experience with some international teams through the World Health Organization.

24
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:23,530
So. And I think you all, from my understanding, have had a little bit on interprofessional teams,

25
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,780
but I just wanted to just start off by framing kind of how I like to think about them and how I like to

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,510
think about interdisciplinary work and particularly related to kind of outbreak response and public health.

27
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:43,660
And then I'll talk about my experience of interprofessional teams at the Global Center and kind of do a case study on the global centers response

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:51,670
to COVID 19 and the meat processing industry in Nebraska and how it was sort of a real world example of interprofessional team collaboration.

29
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,620
And then I'll end with, like I said, some of my more recent experience with interprofessional teams and international outbreak response.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,360
And then feel free to hop in and and stop me at any time.

31
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,270
I have a couple of things to engage you all, but I don't want to just talk your ears.

32
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,750
Also, please feel free to use chatter or jump in at any point.

33
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,860
But I guess one of the things I really like to hear from people is how they got into the field of public health,

34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,230
because I feel like it's never just a straight line.

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,100
I think people sort of often stumble into it, and this image really speaks to to me and my experience.

36
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,470
I always knew I wanted to do infectious diseases. I wanted to do global health, but I didn't know that public health was the term for it.

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,389
I always thought public health was kind of what local public health departments did, and I didn't really envision myself doing that.

38
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,130
So I can tell you.

39
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:55,689
My first semester of undergrad, I think I probably set a record at my school for the number of major like changes to my major in the first semester.

40
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,240
And I can tell you that I had no less than four of these disciplines as my major at one point that first semester.

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,320
And I it actually wasn't until after college where I ended up majoring in international studies.

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,790
So also a very broad topic that I learned about public health was and realized that a career in public health allows

43
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,699
me to to kind of put my hands into each of these disciplines and then work with people under these disciplines.

44
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,179
So public health is kind of this umbrella of all these scientific disciplines that should

45
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,540
be relevant knowledge and the relevant methodologies into this broader discipline.

46
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,990
So when we think about public health, it's very transdisciplinary.

47
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,010
And as an interdisciplinary transdisciplinary foundation, you know,

48
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,070
you need to have a professional team to push public health forward and to work together.

49
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:52,940
And we have to have collaboration between all of these disciplines. So I think an interdisciplinary work.

50
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:00,349
A lot of times that you kind of think about it as like pieces of a puzzle forming a puzzle, right, and a complete picture.

51
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:09,410
But I think one of the things that misses the mark in that metaphor is each of these disciplines have their own unique viewpoints,

52
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,620
their own unique way of looking at problems. And so when we just put them together, it doesn't really give us the whole complete picture.

53
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:24,080
So I like this article that kind of talks about COVID 19 from various disciplines and what COVID 19 was from virologists standpoint,

54
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:31,940
at the standpoint, economics, anthropology. And if we put all this together, it doesn't really give us the full picture of what COVID 19 is.

55
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,910
So we really need to think about interdisciplinary work as not just pieces to a puzzle,

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,360
but kind of have to incorporate the tensions that arise between these disciplines that sometimes

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,990
contrasting viewpoints and the need for collaboration and compromises to get that comprehensive,

58
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:58,550
coherent picture. So this article takes that metaphor from puzzle pieces to something that's much more collaborative,

59
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,680
and we have to have insight into how different disciplines operationalize.

60
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,790
And that requires. Different viewpoints. It requires collaboration.

61
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,819
It requires a shared goal and mutual understanding.

62
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:20,210
And so. That's kind of the basis for for how I how I'll start off, I'm talking about kind of real world experiences with interprofessional teams.

63
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,510
But maybe before we go into that,

64
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:32,920
I'd like to start off and just hear from you on kind of what you think are some of the core principles of an interprofessional team.

65
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,790
So what are that those elements that are foundational to success of interprofessional teams?

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,000
And I'm going to try to engineer and I hope this works.

67
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:48,049
I have not used it before in a PowerPoint, but on your phone or on your computer, if you don't mind going to Mint.com.

68
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,160
And then there's an eight digit code there, 87821195.

69
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,930
And I think there is opportunity that put a couple of different thoughts from you all.

70
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,710
And, well, we'll create a word cloud to see what what you think are some of those core elements.

71
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:12,570
Josh So currently it's on the question what stakeholders, faculty and expertise areas would be involved?

72
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,020
You want to is there a way to switch it back to this question first from Monday?

73
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,540
Good question. I knew it wasn't going to work.

74
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,010
I knew it. I had tried something new. That's okay.

75
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,799
Or we can just like you can have that whole got them needed for that.

76
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,560
And then people can, like, unmute themselves and like put in a chance death.

77
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,800
If you guys don't mind. Yeah, go ahead and jump in or put it in the chat and then we'll save it for the the next question, you get a teaser.

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,190
Okay. Let's see. Communication. Do that a couple of times.

79
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,250
Respect also a couple of times. Great relationship building trust.

80
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,730
Regular touch points. Perfect.

81
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,090
Okay. Well, as I go through today on some of my experiences with these interprofessional teams,

82
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:21,260
if you see these themes or ideas and then at the end I have kind of what I have in my experience, but some of those and those success markers are.

83
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:30,130
So. They can move forward.

84
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,030
When you move forward. There we go. Okay.

85
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,490
So let's talk about.

86
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:49,950
Interprofessional teams in the context of some of the work that I done with Global Center for Health Security and Global Health Security.

87
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,780
Health. Global Center for Health Security. Before I kind of talk about that,

88
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,409
I need to talk about the biocontainment unit and the experience that Nebraska had with Ebola in 2014 as a global center.

89
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:10,649
It was really born out of that experience. So University Nebraska Medical Center had one of only three existing preexisting biocontainment

90
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,410
units in the country in 2014 when the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak was occurring.

91
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,230
And the others being NIH and Emory.

92
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,099
So the former medical director, Dr. Phil Smith, who you can see in the photo of the team at the bottom in the middle,

93
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,930
there he is that he had the foresight in mid 2000 to take funding that each state received for bio preparedness

94
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,460
and create an established clinical facility for managing and caring for patients with Ebola virus disease.

95
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:49,079
So this came out of the anthrax attack in 2009, 11 monkeypox in the Midwest in 2003.

96
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,250
And just all of these things,

97
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,750
all of these sort of little triggers that he recognizes the need to have a dedicated space for caring for these types of patients.

98
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:06,900
So the new team that the biocontainment unit team trained for ten years without receiving a single patient, but they maintained that readiness.

99
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:15,120
So in 2014, when Americans were caring for patients with Ebola in West Africa and a couple of them got infected,

100
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:25,740
and the State Department and the Health and Human Services wanted those Americans repatriated to the U.S. for higher quality medical care.

101
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,550
Nebraska was ready for those patients. So Nebraska cared for patients for three patients in 2014.

102
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,840
And we also took in, I think, 6 to 8 or nine patients, individuals,

103
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:43,770
to where you had high risk exposure to Ebola in West Africa and needed quarantine somewhere to quarantine safely.

104
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,970
And we didn't really have a place at the time. We didn't want to activate our biocontainment unit for people who are completely healthy.

105
00:10:51,210 --> 00:11:00,780
So that actually kind of was the seed that led to Nebraska opening up the only federal quarantine unit, a 20 med unit in December of 2019.

106
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:13,170
So when we're talking about interprofessional teams. One of the success markers, I think, is ensuring an interprofessional leadership.

107
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,420
So this is a highlight of the leadership team in 2014 during activations of the biocontainment unit for Ebola.

108
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,519
And so these leaders had met, you know, as a site in a cycle for for ten years before they were patient.

109
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,340
But they really guided readiness activities and research in that time period.

110
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,540
And so you can see here there are two infectious disease physicians and nurse

111
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,250
leaders with experience in emergency management and expertise in infection control.

112
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,419
We have two public health practitioners, including an industrial hygienist who guided transport,

113
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,230
logistics and disinfection and sterilization and occupational health protocols.

114
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,799
And then we had a Ph.D. in nursing who specialized in PPE and then be Associate Vice-Chancellor

115
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,890
research for the university and who had extensive experience in experimental pathogen therapies.

116
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,230
So during activation they met daily.

117
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,920
And so those daily touchpoints to ensure that everyone was on the same page with all the things that were happening.

118
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,890
And then, as you can imagine, being one of the first places I'm really globally to care for these types of patients

119
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:30,120
and in these higher resource settings and they problem solving was constant.

120
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:40,320
And so having different perspectives and being able to share different viewpoints really helped in the success of the entire activation.

121
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:49,320
So the leadership team has changed only slightly in the last eight years, but they still meet weekly and it's still a very interprofessional.

122
00:12:52,100 --> 00:13:00,649
So then the experience of the biocontainment unit in 2014 meant that Nebraska was really sort of propelled forward as

123
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:07,190
being a national and international leader in bio preparedness and response to high consequence infectious diseases.

124
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,299
And so a number of national programs came out of that,

125
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,900
including the National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center

126
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,520
and national training programs for federal first responders on bio preparedness.

127
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:26,780
And so the Global Center was established in 2017 as sort of the umbrella organization for all these bio preparedness activities.

128
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,169
And there are three other, I believe,

129
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:39,800
Centers for Health Security in the US and the Global Center and Nebraska is pretty unique in that it is very it is primarily operationally focused,

130
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,070
whereas the three other centers are kind of more policy based.

131
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,900
But the core global center is really on the front line, clinical care and operational response experience,

132
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,060
and then using that to drive innovations and training and education and research and

133
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,880
development that continue to strengthen our own clinical care and operational response.

134
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:13,460
So then, like the biocontainment unit leadership team, the Global Center for Health Security Team, and leadership is also very interprofessional.

135
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,550
So all four leaders come from different colleges in different disciplines across campus.

136
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,200
We have a virologist and public health practitioner and we have an infectious disease physician, clinical research,

137
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:34,870
research specialist, and then a nurse leader who's also the emergency manager for the hospital on campus.

138
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,829
And so the global center has grown significantly in the last few years.

139
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:49,070
And so this year to kind of build up their research portfolio, they inaugurated 16 Global Global Center for Security Scholars.

140
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,830
And I had the opportunity to be one of those and we are a very multidisciplinary bunch.

141
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:06,260
So we have been scientists. So a microbiologist, an aerosol scientist and one of I think one of the global leads in next generation genome sequencing.

142
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,340
We have two emergency physicians, a critical care physician, an ID and an ophthalmologist.

143
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:21,139
And we have nurse leaders, an ethicist and a public health practitioner and emergency management and epidemiologist.

144
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,400
And then me, which I sort of bucket is occupational health and infection control.

145
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,409
So, you know,

146
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:34,760
I think it's it's cool that we're a very multidisciplinary work that and the global center kind of brings these different experts together.

147
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,830
But know, what does that actually mean? How does that actually translate to real world projects or real world response?

148
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:49,610
And so I wanted to share an example of how the Global Center and some of its faculty responded to the

149
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,080
COVID 19 pandemic in the early months and early months of the pandemic to that meat processing industry.

150
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,560
So just a little background before we get there.

151
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:11,170
So I think everyone can remember back two and a half years ago, I am in late March, April, May and to early June 2020,

152
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:19,690
and the meat processing industry was one of the biggest sectors in the US that was probably most severely hit by COVID 19.

153
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,830
Meatpacking plants were considered as sort of vectors of community transmission of COVID 19.

154
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,770
And a study in in early 2021 estimated that in the first few months of the pandemic,

155
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:41,930
meatpacking plants were the source of over 330,000 cases in the U.S. That translated to $11.2 billion in economic costs.

156
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,690
So a massive hit to the industry and the worker population.

157
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,930
Like other states in in the Midwest, especially, meat processing is a big industry in Nebraska.

158
00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:00,170
So cases in these facilities had really far reaching impacts in our state and within the worker community itself.

159
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:07,809
We did a we worked with the Nebraska Department of Health Human Services to to pull the data from worker cases.

160
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:15,340
And in the first well, in the four months between April and July 2020, 20, 25,000 inches Nebraska,

161
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,590
meat processing workers were diagnosed with COVID 19, which is an attack rate of 19%.

162
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,280
And it was also very likely an underrepresentation of cases.

163
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:32,110
We didn't have mass testing during those early period, so much likely, much higher.

164
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,610
And in Nebraska, those numbers represented almost one in five cases in Nebraska during those first four months.

165
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,460
And that doesn't include their families,

166
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,730
their friends or the communities that ended up getting infected because of cases that were happening within the facilities.

167
00:17:49,540 --> 00:18:00,880
So the worker meat processing workers, we attended, 25 hospitalized in those first four months, 83 required ICU and 21 died of COVID 19 in Nebraska.

168
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,770
And then just a kind of a side note, something that we saw across the U.S. and every other industry,

169
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,030
any geographical region, but minority populations had poorer outcomes.

170
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:20,680
And so Hispanic workers who reported and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity represented 67% of cases.

171
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:31,210
And within those meat processing workers, but they constituted 73% of hospitalized cases, 78% of ICU admissions and 86% of deaths.

172
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,770
And then I think the other piece and yeah, I'll pods here.

173
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:45,729
I see a hand raised. Go ahead. Yeah. Do you know what the proportion of meatpacking workers are, Hispanic or Latino?

174
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,100
Because I imagine it's a higher proportion than the just general U.S. population.

175
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:58,659
Yes, that's a great question. So there are, I would say, the majority I don't know the exact numbers.

176
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,530
I'm sure we could find them that might actually even be written in this paper.

177
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:15,530
But. Most of in Nebraska, at least a majority of the workers are probably Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and or refugees.

178
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:25,220
So there's I would say there's a relatively small portion and sort of native English speakers among this worker population.

179
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,530
Mm hmm. Yes, please. Sorry, I have another question.

180
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,520
Because it's not that, like, I just disagree with what you're saying, but.

181
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:44,530
In terms of like the way the data is presented, right? Like, if there are a high proportion and then you see a higher proportion of cases in IQ,

182
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:53,170
like is that just related to the like how, like, how, how would this translate to like a disparity, I guess.

183
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,059
It's not that I disagree with what you're saying. It's 100% and I'm on board with that.

184
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,060
But that's curious how that looks.

185
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,930
If, like they are the higher proportion of like employees and then they're making up a higher percentage of like cases and whatnot.

186
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:13,060
Like logically it's like, yes. So how do you tease out like where the disparity happens?

187
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah, so that's a great question. And maybe I didn't wear that well here, so I completely agree right there, 67% of confirmed cases.

188
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,970
So yes, they represent a higher population. So we probably expect that.

189
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,709
But in terms of poor outcomes,

190
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:36,220
those 67% of cases represented a much higher percent of hospitalizations and ICU admissions and deaths among those worker populations.

191
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,240
Does that help? A little bit. Yeah. Thank you. I don't think I presented it well enough yet.

192
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,920
Like Dr. Hurst, I remember when when I was living in Nebraska,

193
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:58,650
that the meatpacking was like the job for like resettled refugees from Somalia and Bhutan.

194
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,360
Is that still very much the case? It is, yes.

195
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,639
So some of these some of these plants that we went to and I'll get to like what our response was,

196
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,230
but they have upwards of 30 to 40 languages in one facility.

197
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:19,040
So it's a massively diverse population with a number of different refugee populations that also work there as well.

198
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,510
And like no health care benefits or anything like that, right?

199
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:30,990
No. And just for, you know, context to this is like a really difficult industry to get into.

200
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,610
There's a lot of tension between workers and industry leaders.

201
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,950
And part of it is because of that diverse population and them probably not

202
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,110
necessarily knowing their rights because a lot of information is just English.

203
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,780
So that's part of it. And then there's a lot of community organizations that we did work with,

204
00:21:50,780 --> 00:22:00,109
and we'll talk a little bit about who their entire focus is on meat processing workers because and just of that, the history behind the industry.

205
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:09,709
But then also pandemics aside, meat processing industry is and there's there's an immense occupational the numbers

206
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,850
of occupational industries in the meat processing industry is really high.

207
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,530
So it's a really dangerous industry to work in and outside of.

208
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,370
Infectious diseases. Thank you.

209
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah, thank you. I'm. So I think just outside of those worker populations and to, you know, like I said,

210
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,850
the cases at these facilities had really far reaching impacts to communities.

211
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,300
And in Nebraska, like in other states,

212
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,909
most of these facilities are located in relatively rural areas with with the meat processing facility really at the center of those communities.

213
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:54,540
And so cases that would happen would have far reaching impacts to these rural communities,

214
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,650
which don't necessarily have the infrastructure or the resources to respond adequately to an infectious disease outbreak.

215
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,660
And so you might recognize the image on the lower right hand corner there from The New York Times.

216
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:15,569
So the first part, I think a screenshot from maybe early June 2020 and it shows the the sun shows the number of cases per capita,

217
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,080
the top ten at the time in Nebraska.

218
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,180
And all of these except Douglas County, which has Omaha, are rural communities.

219
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,550
And they were all home to one or more processing facilities.

220
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:41,970
Those are that an immense. These communities, these communities that surrounded these meat processing facilities were, I mean,

221
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,210
truly the epicenters of most of the outbreaks in Nebraska in the first probably five months of the pandemic.

222
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:59,730
So. And so just quickly, why the industry was particularly vulnerable.

223
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,450
So on the one hand, you know, a lot of us were able to work from home for the first several months of the pandemic,

224
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,950
and that was not an option for workers in the meat processing industry.

225
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,679
Those facilities remained fully operational and as an essential industry after an executive

226
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,810
order by President Trump declaring the meat supply as critical to national infrastructure.

227
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,579
So you had hundreds, sometimes thousands of workers working long shifts in close quarters and very diverse

228
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,520
communities and workers and in buildings that were not designed for social distancing,

229
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,840
that were not designed for respiratory pathogens. So it was a there are a number of factors that kind of created this.

230
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,200
This breeding grounds, I guess, of of COVID 19.

231
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,870
Okay. So I think that should be asked now. So we should be able to get this working.

232
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,640
But just want to hear from you. And before we get into our approach and what you think,

233
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:10,390
some of the key stakeholders or areas of expertise or faculty would be involved in in efforts to to mitigate a novel pathogen in this industry.

234
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:46,320
Give everyone a couple of minutes. Okay.

235
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,680
So I'm saying industrial high genius worker advocates.

236
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,590
It's great. Local health departments. Okay.

237
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,760
We'll get to that to supervisors or industry leaders as well.

238
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,680
Awesome. Okay. Well, let's get to.

239
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,600
Who we worked with and what our response looked like. Pharmaceutical industry.

240
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,999
Okay, great. So most I'll say most of these were involved.

241
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,450
There were a couple that were not directly in our response,

242
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:28,729
but I think have been key key leaders or key players in sort of a more national response to and to the COVID 19 in the industry.

243
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,260
And we can talk a little bit more about that, too. So.

244
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:43,130
We kind of joke with our core team that our response kind of starts out like a bad joke.

245
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,390
So we have an aerosol scientist and ethicist, an infection prevention nurse and a community development leader.

246
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:55,050
That's kind of our core, core academic group, I guess, that responded from the global center.

247
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:03,900
And then we worked with a number of stakeholders and outside of that, so other academic faculty and infectious diseases and infection prevention,

248
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,819
as well as academic faculty with longstanding expertise in agriculture and occupational health,

249
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,750
who had long relationship, good understanding of this industry.

250
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,160
And we local public health departments were our core partners in all of this.

251
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,690
And I'll talk a little bit about that.

252
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:28,170
And then community organizations and advocates were extremely integral, particularly of those focused on, like I said,

253
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,739
immigrant and refugee populations, local health care,

254
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:38,219
community leaders to get education and messaging out to workers and industry partners, of course.

255
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,990
And then this is this was a political issue.

256
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:51,180
And so I'll talk a little bit about it, but we had a really good ally actually in the first maybe two months of the pandemic with our our.

257
00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:00,819
Our state. Politician. And and that changed a little bit as the pandemic became politicized.

258
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:12,550
But there was a really key role there for widespread education and advocacy for and for COVID 19 mitigation in this industry.

259
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:22,830
So our initial response in the first 2 to 3 months, the pandemic was kind of three pronged.

260
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:32,130
So this all started actually with a request from one of our university regents who co owned a meat processing facility

261
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:39,750
and who asked that a team from the Global Center for Health Security to come in and just see what they could do,

262
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,649
but what else they could do to mitigate transmission within the facility.

263
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,360
And this was in I think was like April 15th, April 17th of 2020.

264
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,670
And that was just as we were starting to realize that this was going to be an industry that was going to be, you know, hard hit by COVID 19.

265
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:05,100
And once we did that, the word got out and we ended up doing 14 on site visit and seven virtual

266
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,320
consultations with an additional seven facilities across the state of Nebraska.

267
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,300
And so what we would do is that we were completely non regulatory, which is,

268
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,420
I think one of the reasons that we were able to actually go into these facilities

269
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,950
that historically have been kind of shy to let any external groups in.

270
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,809
And but we did have a team of 2 to 5 from the global center.

271
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,510
So infectious disease specialist, infection control experts go in,

272
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:40,020
walk through the facility with plant leadership and from how the workers were entering the facility,

273
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,790
how they were being screened, and to what the locker rooms look like, what the cafeteria looked like.

274
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,620
And then the production line and as we were going through with the gaps and infection

275
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:57,210
control and provide very facility specific recommendations and and being on we're

276
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,190
non regulatory and the only people outside of the plant leadership that heard those

277
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,690
facility specific gaps and recommendations where the local public health department.

278
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,740
And so as we were doing these visits we we realized that the best practices and

279
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,160
recommendations that we were giving kind of naturally went into a playbook for the industry.

280
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,610
And so we published a meat processing facility playbook in late April and just a

281
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:31,650
couple of days before OSHA and CDC then released their industry specific guidance.

282
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:39,759
And we had the opportunity to share best practices via webinars across the state by state coordination

283
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,220
calls that the global center facilitated with health care and local health department leaders,

284
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,560
and then through the governor's office. So like I said, there was a lot of political pressure to keep these facilities open.

285
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:57,400
And we saw a number of reprocessing facilities in late April have to close because of the number of cases that were occurring.

286
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,320
And so I think that was a political piece to keep them open.

287
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,610
And everyone sort of had different reasons for wanting to mitigate transmission, but we all had the shared goal of doing so.

288
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:21,130
And so we would have weekly calls where we had the opportunity to get on the phone with the governor and corporate leadership from the big plants

289
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:30,190
across the state to provide what we were seeing and what the gaps were and what the plans needed to do to reduce transmission in those facilities.

290
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,670
So that was kind of the technical assistance side, which was what I was a part of.

291
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,379
Then we had an ethics advisory committee through the Global Center that was

292
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,330
established in February 2020 to help guide decision making among clinicians.

293
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:57,860
When we were had, you know, low resources and gaps in PPE, like how how the clinicians were making clinical decisions for this novel pathogen.

294
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:05,510
And the Ethics Advisory Committee help support our technical assistant team and with ethical consultation completely new to me.

295
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:14,090
And so it was a really interesting way of, of merging kind of ethical frameworks for this is an industry that,

296
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,480
you know, historically has not been has not treated their workers well.

297
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:27,379
And how do we. Continue to ensure the viability of plans and national in our nation's food supply supply,

298
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,210
while also being doing everything we can to effectively reduce transmission risks for workers.

299
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,150
And then extremely importantly, the community engagement group.

300
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:45,910
So we had a professor in our College of Public Health who had been working with meat processing workers for the last ten years.

301
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,410
And so she was working directly with workers and community organizations.

302
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:57,070
But the workers were hearing what the what the workers said about what was happening in the plants.

303
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,090
And that really fed into our technical assistance team.

304
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,170
So, for example, you know, we we met with plant leadership.

305
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,299
And so we would hear one of the things that. In this industry.

306
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,240
They do. A lot of them do point a point system.

307
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:20,630
So if you miss a day of work, you lose a point and you have 20 points and after 20 points, then you're fired.

308
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:29,030
And so there's like a very there's these systems to ensure that people come to work and don't lose their job.

309
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:34,250
And so that's obviously not a good system when you're sick and we're when we're in the middle of a pandemic.

310
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:43,370
And so we hear from plant leaders that, yeah, they temporarily suspended the the point system workers get paid leave to stay home from work.

311
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,330
And then what we're hearing on the ground from workers through our our colleagues who are working with those organizations and those workers,

312
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:56,210
is that know they're still doing points and there's no paid leave, like nothing's changed.

313
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,220
And so it really helped inform our discussions with plant leadership.

314
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,750
And okay, you're saying one thing, but workers are hearing something else.

315
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,579
And so is there a disconnect?

316
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,070
Is that that those policies are in place, but they're not actually getting down to the workers so the workers aren't aware of them?

317
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:21,710
Or is it, you know, easy to tell the unnamed team who showing up that, yeah, we're we're good on the side of these, you know, much.

318
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,589
Much bigger policies. So we all sort of fed into each other.

319
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:33,460
We all did our own work. But that work was really informed by and by each other.

320
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,010
Yes. Doctor like you. Yeah.

321
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,819
So, like, you know, when you how how did you have those conversations without them getting, like, defensive and contentious?

322
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:50,920
Right. Because obviously, we know that they're going to say what what's best for them, but they want to keep operations up, you know, per usual.

323
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,020
So how how would you broach those conversations?

324
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,009
Yeah. So it really was it's it's really interesting.

325
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:09,520
It really was plan by plan specific. So some people very much like you could tell when you got on site what the leadership structure was like.

326
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,549
Like we would walk through the plans and some managers would know everybody's name, like some of the smaller plans.

327
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,340
They know everybody's name. There'd be, you know, some really good, like, conversation between workers and leadership.

328
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:27,850
And sometimes we go to the some of the larger plans and nobody, you know, made eye contact with with anybody.

329
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,770
And so there was just, like, a feeling to have just the broad and.

330
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,560
I don't know how to describe it. Just the feeling, I guess, of the plant.

331
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,509
So I think that was part of it. And you could tell who there was.

332
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:51,079
Like this political pressure on these governor calls. He would say, okay, Smithfield hasn't been they haven't had a site visit yet.

333
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,780
So you need to call Jocelyn and Charlie and these people and get get that team in there.

334
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,100
And so I think there were some teams who just like let us in because the governor was hearing if they were or weren't letting us in.

335
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,400
And so, I mean, I think that was part of it.

336
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,780
Some people were much more open to actual changes, and then some it felt like we're just there to sort of get it, like say that we were there.

337
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,790
But I think it evolved a little bit. So we had.

338
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,660
It's kind of one of those things where.

339
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:32,210
We had to sort of know our place, like, you know, what we could do to the best of our ability and being able to have those conversations.

340
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,370
And, you know, that's not what we're hearing from the passing workers.

341
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,320
Are there other things that, you know, where this could be getting caught up in?

342
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,040
Is that like the supervisors aren't aware of these policies and they're not passing them down?

343
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,080
So just kind of I think it was sort of facility specific.

344
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:59,659
And it's also one of the things that we talked with the Ethical Advisory Committee about is that it's hard sometimes,

345
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:06,410
I think, and we're still doing this. I'll talk about it a little bit. We're still supporting meat processing industry and but it's a little hard.

346
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,850
We have a lot of conversations about are they just using as a rubber stamp?

347
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,950
You know, just like stamp we got, you know, the okay.

348
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:24,150
Or the the walkthrough by the U.N. M.S. team. But at least someone's trying, right?

349
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,360
At least we're having those conversations. So it's a little.

350
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:37,160
Facility by facility. But I will say. Most I mean, we all had a shared goal and they wanted to maintain operations.

351
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,810
But they also knew that if there were massive outbreaks in their facilities, they'd have to close.

352
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,940
And so I do think people were really open to doing what they could.

353
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,740
Thank you. All right.

354
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:03,409
So this is just to show our different teams and then push out different resources that we're all informed by each other,

355
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,480
but to a different sort of target. So we had the playbook and that was for the industry.

356
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,960
The Ethical Team Ethical Advisory Committee pushed out something like an ethical framework,

357
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:21,260
and then our community engagement group pushed out educational materials and I think seven different languages.

358
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:29,360
And based on some of the work that the Playbook team put together, so all different,

359
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,100
all different target audiences, but all again informed by the work that each of us were doing.

360
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,450
And then. And so that was early days of the pandemic.

361
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,600
We're continuing to support and do work with the meatpacking industry.

362
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:55,579
So in early 2021, we started new project with an aerosol scientist to look at an exposure assessment in meatpacking facilities and where the highest

363
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:04,310
risks of exposure were and what those infection prevention measures were actually doing and where they appropriately placed.

364
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:13,459
And then one of the other studies that's going on to two years now is looking at kind of case studies of six different counties in Nebraska.

365
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:24,890
All again, with besides the exception of Omaha, all rural counties with a center centered around a meat processing facility.

366
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,560
And so working with the health promotion expert, me and ethicists,

367
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:39,049
and then a program director for a nonprofit public interest law advocacy organization to to get more

368
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,200
of the kind of the worker voices and doing worker surveys and interviews to hear from workers,

369
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:52,670
doing community stakeholder interviews of local public health departments, local health care, industry leaders to get that perspective.

370
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,379
And then a document analysis of just guidance and social media reports to kind of do

371
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,990
a case study of how the community responded to it in the the meatpacking plants.

372
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:12,860
Okay. So just a couple of lessons I think that I learned this was probably my biggest,

373
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,360
but this is the biggest response I've ever done with an interprofessional team.

374
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,599
And so I think one of the biggest things is having a shared goal with our team members and then with all the stakeholders.

375
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:31,670
So again, everyone had a different reason for wanting to mitigate transmission of COVID in these facilities, but we all had the same goal.

376
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,600
So that was pretty core to an effective response.

377
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,990
And then I cannot be overstated, I don't think, on how.

378
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,440
How incredible and interdisciplinary teams are for a holistic understanding.

379
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,920
I learned a lot of things that I. Would have had no idea had I not had the other team members a part of it.

380
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:03,590
So one of the things even I'm still learning things. So we had a a data synthesis meeting on Monday with the team that's working on those and

381
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:11,410
the community case studies to pull together all the data from those different methods and.

382
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,350
We? Found out that workers from those six communities, the vaccination rates are incredibly high.

383
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:30,780
Between about 86 to 92% of workers from those six counties are vaccinated, which is amazing and much, much higher than rates across Nebraska.

384
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:39,750
And I think part of that is because vaccination testing, what vaccination was offered on site at these facilities,

385
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:48,180
the local departments went to them and workers could get vaccinated and during their lunch or after work,

386
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,590
but they didn't realize that it actually felt like coercion to a lot of workers to have it on site.

387
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:03,440
They felt that if they didn't get vaccinated, then the supervisor would know and could cause problems for them.

388
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:11,370
And so, yes, it's a high vaccination. Yes. I think as someone in infectious diseases, as a local public health department and we all thought,

389
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,870
you know, we look at the statistics and think, that's amazing. It's great. We offered you the access for it and.

390
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:27,540
But without our community engagement groups when understand that kind of the tension that arose because of that access on site.

391
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,540
And then I think like I said what we heard from industry with that from different than what we heard from workers.

392
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,570
And so it was really incredibly helpful to have regular touchpoints with that whole group to say, okay,

393
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,700
here's what we're hearing from the facilities and then, okay, here's what we're hearing from workers.

394
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,180
And I think another example is. We see a lot of educational materials being pushed out by the industry.

395
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:58,270
So. There'd be videos that they produced that they would show up at, at lunch on TVs,

396
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:05,140
or there would be fliers in a bunch of different languages posted across or throughout the facility.

397
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:14,380
But then we're hearing from workers that they weren't getting educated because they didn't a lot of them didn't see, like, fliers as education.

398
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,790
And so just having that balance of understanding, you know.

399
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:29,530
What is what extra things are needed for education or interactive education to then be able to feed that back to industry as well.

400
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:38,080
And then I think last lesson learned is just the need to integrate new learnings too and each discipline so.

401
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,860
I think one of the biggest things is with the add of our aerosol scientists.

402
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:50,650
You know, one of the core recommendations that we had early in the response was physical barriers.

403
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,849
At the time, we thought, you know, COVID 19 was spread by respiratory droplets,

404
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,090
and so physical barriers would be the most effective engineering control.

405
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:10,270
And then with our aerosol scientists kind of finding out what the ventilation looks like and that those barriers can actually disrupt ventilation.

406
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:17,140
And so just being able to feed kind of evidence and data into each other's work as well.

407
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,860
Okay. So I wanted to hear from you all, too.

408
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,840
I'm just kind of. And we can just do this in chat or feel free to come off mute.

409
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:40,650
And one of the other things I learned from this is some of the the different perspectives of offering mass testing to meat processing workers.

410
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:49,920
And so I'm in Nebraska. I think elsewhere in the US, the National Guard was often deployed to provide mass testing.

411
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,110
And in Nebraska, it was deployed.

412
00:44:52,590 --> 00:45:01,590
National Guard was deployed several different times to onsite meat processing facilities for workers to get and to do mass,

413
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,950
you know, mass testing and and understand. Potential.

414
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:14,210
Well, understand. And. Rates of infection and then also get those workers isolated.

415
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,790
But I want to hear from you all just based on some of the what I am, the anecdotes I added,

416
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,240
especially about the vaccinations, I am kind of what you all think.

417
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,390
The perspectives might be of these different stakeholders. And so maybe we'll start off with local public health.

418
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,870
So what do you think? You know, local public health,

419
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:44,730
what would their perspective be of being able to offer mass testing to a population that likely has asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections?

420
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,860
I think they definitely would be positive towards it. And the more testing you do, you realize, yeah, who has it, who can isolate?

421
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,390
You're minimizing transmission. I feel like they'd be very supportive of it.

422
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:10,790
Perfect. Yeah, I completely agree, I think. From the local public health department side from.

423
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,290
And mitigating broader community transmission, health care or local health departments likely see that as an advantage,

424
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:26,410
and that's why it was deployed to mitigate any further transmission slightly.

425
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:34,870
How about a meat processing plant manager? Someone from industry.

426
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,030
Yep. And feel free to use. Try to. Yeah.

427
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,610
So I think I completely agree. I think their perspective might be two fold.

428
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:53,930
One is, okay, we're going to find a lot of workers that might be positive and might have implications for production.

429
00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:06,140
But at the same time, I think we did see that they recognized the need to and to isolate workers before broader transmission.

430
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,769
And so I think probably a good thing, although there's clear disadvantages and it might depend,

431
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,879
you know, what the staffing model is at the time, right?

432
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
If they have enough people to pull people out. Okay.

433
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:33,899
How about a worker? I think for the worker it might it it's probably a little subjective to each worker and that some of

434
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:43,590
them might definitely be okay with getting tested and just to make sure that they don't have anything.

435
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:51,270
But some workers might be a little hesitant, even even if they they even if they are asymptomatic,

436
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,770
they wouldn't want to get tested because that again,

437
00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:05,040
that a, it comes down to like what if they're asked to isolate or quarantine and they can go to work and some people can't afford to do that.

438
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:15,790
So again, I feel like it's it's a very it's very situational and subjective to what each worker thinks and feels about this.

439
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:22,710
Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for that. I 100% agree, I think and you know,

440
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:30,210
we the like the community study that we're working on is looking specifically at various facilitators to testing and vaccination.

441
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:40,450
And I think there's. What we found from that is from the standpoint workers wanted more than anything to protect their families and their coworkers.

442
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,120
And so I think from the standpoint of, okay,

443
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:49,550
if I don't know that I'm infected and it's good to know so that I can isolate myself or my family members or my friends or community members.

444
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,030
And I think it's a great point here about in the chat on.

445
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,360
And that hesitancy of a theme like the one in the picture.

446
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,820
And that's exactly actually what I was going for.

447
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:09,700
This is something that I learned that I didn't realize until I started working with some of our other partners,

448
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,220
is that there were a lot of fears from the standpoint exactly of immigration concerns.

449
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,000
So these are uniformed people, right? They might not have any.

450
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,329
They're the National Guard. So right there they're not ice.

451
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:30,840
But workers see them in uniforms and have fears of potential deportation if they don't have legal status.

452
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:41,580
And so it can be really intimidating. And that's what we heard from the community at the organizations that mass testing like this.

453
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,360
And for many of those workers, was was not a good thing.

454
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:54,360
So I think just having these different perspectives that we are able to inform each other is really critical and something

455
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,500
that I'm hoping we learn from the pandemic and this greater collaboration between all of these different groups.

456
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,440
So we learn from, you know, like Commander Garza. Yes.

457
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:13,040
Public Health Service. And they have like a couple of different uniforms or ensembles that they wear.

458
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,600
But like I know the National Guard has where they're uniform, but can they, like, not?

459
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:25,060
Do they have anything that's, like not as militaristic looking like just t shirts or like, you know, something?

460
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:30,740
Because I yeah, I can definitely see this looks very intimidating and.

461
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,640
Yeah, yeah. Do you know, do you happen to know Doctor her style? I do not.

462
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:42,440
Okay. Okay, that's a good. And I, I think it's interesting about the public health service and doctor, like,

463
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,909
I think I mean, they work really closely with with immigrant populations as well.

464
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:55,670
So to know that they. Yeah. They have different outfits kind of like the Navy does where they have like the very nice suits.

465
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,309
Right. Or like commuter guards or even over Zoom.

466
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:05,840
She wore her like I think it was her can't know she wore her jacket with all her, you know, stuff on it.

467
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,180
But then she also sometimes just wears her t shirt.

468
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:19,240
So probably they don't think about that, you know, like public perception when they're being deployed or they're told like what they have to wear.

469
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,390
But that's a that's a good perspective to keep in mind.

470
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,130
Yeah, I think it's it's it's like I said, I've learned like that wouldn't have crossed my mind,

471
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,299
right, without having engagement with these other groups.

472
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,940
And that's why it's, I can't say enough about the need for like different perspectives,

473
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,389
different disciplines to come together to tackle these problems. We all can.

474
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:48,410
I know this is overstated, probably, but we really can't work in silos like we have to all come together to to find the best solutions.

475
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:59,270
Dr. Harrison I had another question. So in terms of, uh, considering and, and doing the community assessment of what the workers feel,

476
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,520
feeling coerced or feeling threatened by the testing and all that.

477
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:13,020
Was that taken for these like concerns implemented into a change in how we did testing or they were just mean,

478
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,219
they were recorded, reported hopefully going to change the future.

479
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,620
But in terms of COVID, did that change any type of process?

480
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,320
I don't think so, no. So that's I mean, that's.

481
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:32,800
What we're hoping to do with the smaller of these community studies is to pull all this because I think there isn't good.

482
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,670
There's incredible organizations like Nebraska Appleseed, who we work with who really try to.

483
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,870
Rise up the perspectives and up the workers.

484
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:50,199
But I don't think there's. It hasn't gotten to who it needs to get to.

485
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,550
And so and that project is really hoping to build out like community wide.

486
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,230
How do we respond? What are the lessons that we learned and particularly to this industry where there are,

487
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:08,710
you know, these workers with very from very diverse communities to say, okay.

488
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,780
How do we better prepare for the next go around?

489
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:22,440
And so I maybe and other like localize or localize areas and maybe they were implemented, but I know in Nebraska they were not.

490
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,360
And just a follow up.

491
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:32,450
Do you from your perspective, would that be the the public health department that's implementing it like these perspectives are recorded?

492
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,940
Is that who is actually the person implementing them?

493
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,840
Is it the governor? Is the. Yeah. So that's a great question.

494
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:45,990
And if it's the National Guard being deployed, then it's at the state level.

495
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:52,560
I don't know if it's directly the governor's office, if it's in coordination with the state health department,

496
00:53:53,370 --> 00:54:00,150
but that's the local health department would request the state for the National Guard assets to be deployed.

497
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:07,770
So I think it's probably several different levels that have to be brought together and for that.

498
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,540
And I think that's another lesson I'm learning is just all the coordination that occurs

499
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:17,400
and all the different players that have to be on the same page about because we've.

500
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,810
Again. It's like it's great that the guard helped to staff mass testing, you know,

501
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:30,570
from the perspectives of probably 80% of responders, but not for for those who they're actually trying.

502
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,640
To help. Thank you.

503
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,040
Great questions. Okay.

504
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,160
So I'm going to shift gears a little bit to some of the work with the W.H.O.

505
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,120
But before I do, are there any other questions or comments related to.

506
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:55,640
This sort of case study. I was actually curious for the Ethics Committee.

507
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:03,380
You forgot the title of them. But were there other people on that team that were not ethicists that made the team up?

508
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,410
Great question. I am so. I think.

509
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,640
So they're all. Well, that's a good question. I.

510
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:21,520
They all probably call themselves ethicists, but there's lawyers, physicians, public health practitioners.

511
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:29,260
And so they all have like an ethical interest, ethical standpoint, but they're all like they're an itself pretty in a professional as well.

512
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,150
And I'm happy to put a link to the global center and to the Ethics Committee, just if you're interested.

513
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:40,560
And I think it names the members there as well. Yeah.

514
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,220
Thank you. Okay.

515
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,180
Well, then I'll go ahead and move forward.

516
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:57,919
So the last kind of segment I wanted to talk about was some of my recent experience with World

517
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:07,190
Health Organization and Gorn and kind of what I learned from the international perspective.

518
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:15,139
So who is born? And so the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is a global technical partnership.

519
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:25,010
It's coordinated by the World Health Organization, but it's actually a network of 270 technical partners in networks.

520
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,770
So they often describe themselves as sort of a network of networks.

521
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:34,490
They have a small but mighty operational support team that's based at the headquarters in Geneva.

522
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:44,089
And then that leadership structure is a steering committee of 21 institutions, and individuals are elected onto it.

523
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,930
But it's actually the the institution that is the steering committee member.

524
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,100
So going is extremely multi-disciplinary.

525
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:01,250
As you can see, they provide rapid, multi-disciplinary, technical support for outbreak response.

526
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:10,190
These are all the different disciplines that they deployed in the 2014 2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.

527
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:16,250
So laboratory clinical management and epidemiology were the most commonly deployed.

528
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:22,280
They also had infection prevention and control experts and logistics coordination,

529
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:28,820
public health data management, mental health and veterinary anthropology communications.

530
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,690
So they that kind of their tagline is at their most appropriate.

531
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:39,080
They deploy the most appropriate technical experts to reach the field in the least possible time.

532
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,570
So they help to coordinate outbreak control activities.

533
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:56,909
So just to put this into the broader W.H.O. strategy, the W.H.O. has eight pillars of public health,

534
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:04,380
emergency preparedness and response that they used during COVID and are using this same for the the current outbreak in Uganda.

535
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,310
And so, again, multidisciplinary.

536
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,650
They do coordination. And one of the core pillars of risk communication and community engagement.

537
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:21,010
And then there's more of the epi side of surveillance and case investigation,

538
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,890
laboratory infection prevention and control and the clinical side of clinical management.

539
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,210
And then operational support. So very multidisciplinary.

540
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:41,120
Kind of. Initially, it was sort of this old school model, I guess you could say,

541
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:48,200
of when Ghan was established 20 years ago of having kind of those international experts.

542
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:56,410
From the global north. I sort of parachute in to an outbreak that's occurring in the global south.

543
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:03,580
They sort of have their little adventure, maybe write a book and then that would sort of they'd leave, right?

544
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,070
And there'd be no capacity building locally. And so the same areas would have.

545
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,760
Same outbreaks and months or years later. And so that's that's an old model that has to be retired.

546
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:25,460
And I think there's immense efforts at the global level to ensure that we're getting the expertise needed to outbreaks that are occurring.

547
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,380
And but we're also leaving things behind.

548
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:37,910
There's capacity building and untargeted preparedness activities in those areas that have historically had a number of these responses.

549
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:48,600
So the Gorn. So Gorn, every four years, does that kind of develops their strategy for the next four years?

550
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,600
And usually it's like a survey to partners on what should we focus on.

551
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:59,790
But this go around, they had a really comprehensive process that included interviews, surveys,

552
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:08,190
regional consultations and a number of workshops to really guide what what should be done and how.

553
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,830
What role Goran can play in an ever evolving international outbreak arena.

554
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:24,510
And so that's how I got involved. Initially was last October, I was added to the Guam strategy team for what was supposed to be three months,

555
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,700
and we're on month 13 and I'm still working with them.

556
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,880
So it's been a long process. But I think it's.

557
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:41,300
I. It's for the good of the global community for going to actually have a a good place and an outbreak response.

558
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,559
So personally, then as part of the strategy development,

559
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:51,980
I interviewed 28 global stakeholders and thought leaders on what should international

560
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,810
outbreak and preparedness to infectious diseases look like in the next four years?

561
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:03,200
How do we how do we better our responses post COVID?

562
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:14,690
And so this was my first thought of putting the door for global outbreak response in the world of W.H.O. and again, incredibly interprofessional.

563
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:22,159
So the people who I interviewed, it included academics, scientists, researchers, public health officers, responders.

564
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,330
So those who do the response are on the front lines.

565
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,570
And it also included policymakers who have to be involved in these discussions.

566
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:34,160
Right. They're the ones who make decisions that can make or break an outbreak response.

567
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:42,500
And so it's important to know how decisions are informed and what they need to make the right decisions.

568
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:50,030
We also interviewed donors and a financial minister on how do we fund international outbreak response.

569
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:58,130
Right. Who's interested in funding something? How do we make outbreak response a viable investment?

570
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:10,940
And then when we have these international outbreak responses and most of the UN partners, UNICEF and Food Program,

571
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:17,149
ICRC, the Red Cross, the International Red Cross, they're all responding in different capacities.

572
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:24,470
And so how do we coordinate everybody's existing work? And then outbreaks happen at a community level.

573
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:28,580
So how do we build trust with that local community? How do we work with those communities?

574
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:36,320
And then another thing that I think is just important in any infectious disease future is kind of using.

575
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,729
Is better coordination with animal disease experts and using the one health

576
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:44,740
model as a framework for how we think of outbreak preparedness and response.

577
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:51,280
Yes, please. Yeah. So I'm just curious about, like, how do you even.

578
01:02:52,630 --> 01:03:01,450
Identify community advocates because the World Health Organization is much larger than like rural areas of Nebraska.

579
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:07,929
Right. So like at what level are community like advocates considered?

580
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,930
Right. Like regionally, how do you address those?

581
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:15,639
Because I doubt it's even past. Like it's not feasible to like have representatives from every country.

582
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:21,370
Right. So how how how do you even, like, identify who community advocates are?

583
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:28,330
Yes. So that is an amazing question that we probably spent two months trying to answer as part of the strategy.

584
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,810
And because, like I said, I think the whole outbreak,

585
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:37,959
like W.H.O. coordinated outbreak response historically has been like bringing all these other

586
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,460
people to the ground to like take their expertise to stop the outbreak and then leaving.

587
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,420
And it hasn't historically been working with who's already on the ground.

588
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:54,579
So one of the things that Gore and I think can actually play a key part in is they have these 270 partners all around the world.

589
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,500
And so when an outbreak happens, those should be the people responding.

590
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:05,469
They should be the one at least coordinating other people who come to help because they're the ones

591
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:11,650
who are local and they have those those partnerships and and relationships already established.

592
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:17,410
So I think that's one thing it's a lot easier to say than actually do.

593
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:22,820
And also it means buy in from all those partners to play that role.

594
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:30,970
And the other big conversation that's happening globally is I don't know if anyone's

595
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:37,480
seen Bill Gates did a TED Talk a couple of months ago on this idea of germ teams,

596
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:46,030
which is not a good term, I think, for an outbreak response group who want to build community trust.

597
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:56,320
But it's the idea of having people who are part of these germ response teams embedded in each National Public Health Institute,

598
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:03,520
so that if a response happens and you already have people at every country level who are local,

599
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:08,770
who've made those connections to community level and you can assist, responds.

600
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:15,219
I think one of the other things and I'll go back here is this this risk communication

601
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,210
and community engagement is one of the core pillars of outbreak response,

602
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:23,859
and I think this is a relatively new thing.

603
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:27,760
They have something called the collective service that.

604
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,760
Includes Goran, UNICEF, a number of other partners that are global but have more.

605
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,760
More personnel, more connections, I guess, at some of the key.

606
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,920
And some of these countries that were seeing a lot of outbreaks happening.

607
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:55,890
So like, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo has had a number of Ebola outbreaks in the last three or four years.

608
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:06,090
So there's been a number of an effort to build community advocates and organizations and to bring the community into preparedness and response.

609
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:11,970
But then that means that there's a lot of attention not paid right to other places that.

610
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:19,250
Well at some point have an outbreak. So I think it's a it's a great question that I don't think the global community is really answered.

611
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,550
I think there's a lot of efforts to try to get there.

612
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:28,600
But I think I think there is an awareness of the need for it.

613
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:36,770
I think the logistics of actually including them and how to get them quickly involved in an outbreak response is still lacking.

614
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,380
Yes, please. So I have another question.

615
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:46,510
I know you have like more slides to get through, but if you can go back to the that one, you were just one of the eight pillars.

616
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:51,660
So I'm like that one in the bottom, right, about operational support and logistics.

617
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:58,329
I feel like this is often like not considered in global health delivery because like supply chain,

618
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:03,040
global supply chain is like not what it is like in the U.S. at all.

619
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:08,980
And so I'm wondering how that information is collected and gathered for this report,

620
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:13,060
because what you have on the site there could be more like you can only put so much on the

621
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:18,549
slides like is how to get like funding and then like how to build trust in communities.

622
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:26,830
But there also has to be like how to build logistics with funding in order to like get vaccines to people, you know what I mean?

623
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:37,540
So how a how are you all thinking about like the logistics piece or is that something that because it is so particular to each country,

624
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:46,150
even at some points or like each location within a country that you leave that for how teams would deploy emergency response.

625
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,040
Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, I think and I think it.

626
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:58,940
That's a great question. I'm not a I'm not a big part of that.

627
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:02,950
So I can't probably accurately speak to it.

628
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,700
I will say I don't think we do it well. So I think what a great example is, Debbie.

629
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:21,320
So the vaccine like this idea of this massive international buy in from every country to have vaccinations for COVID 19 passed to all countries.

630
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:26,450
And I think we saw that the vaccines would get to a country, they'd get to a port.

631
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:31,610
And then what was completely lacking was the was recognizing that a lot of those

632
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,260
countries don't have the local infrastructure to push those into their countries.

633
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:43,630
And so it's great that we. We sent it to a port riot, but it doesn't get to the people.

634
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,040
And so I think there's.

635
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:54,990
It's one of the biggest issues I think an outbreak response is the logistics of are getting vaccines are getting testing of getting PPE.

636
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,790
And so I think there's a lot of other people working on it. But I don't know.

637
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,500
I don't know what we learned, I guess, from COVID.

638
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:10,820
I think it still showed a lot of gaps, even with these big ideas and a lot of buy in that it's still not being successful.

639
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:21,830
Yeah, I took a class and I learned how big supply chain is in health delivery and I was this is not what I want to do,

640
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:25,010
but they really need more people to global supply chain.

641
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:29,590
So you. Absolutely. Absolutely.

642
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:37,600
Great question. Okay. So I'm just going to go really quickly through my final slides and just.

643
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:46,250
To kind of show. One of the other things I've been involved in, and this gets a little bit too,

644
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:52,270
like how we think about local response and the thing called Integrated Outbreak Analytics.

645
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:56,630
So it's a it's part of the operational research infrastructure for Gorn.

646
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:05,780
I'm a coordinator through UNICEF, and it's a multidisciplinary multisectoral approach to collaborating collaboratively,

647
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:12,820
perform real time systematic operational research and understand outbreak dynamics in an outbreak.

648
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:18,680
And it was sort of borne out of the 2018 Ebola virus disease outbreak in DRC.

649
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:27,680
And but the realization has been is we have this classic epidemiology approach of looking at who's affected,

650
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:34,639
when's it occurring, where is it spreading and what pathogen or are we talking about and what's the clinical impact?

651
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,540
But it doesn't tell us why some communities are more effective than others,

652
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:45,380
or how communities and families are reacting to the disease and to response interventions.

653
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:56,450
And so IOA is trying to to create sort of local cells in the midst of these broader outbreaks to answer some of these questions.

654
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:05,950
And so it looks at, you know. For example, perceptions and behavior of communities may tell us why certain communities are more at risk.

655
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:11,650
And so it takes data from things like surveys and interviews to inform what that looks like.

656
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:17,380
And preexisting health risks or vulnerabilities can explain peaks in certain communities.

657
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:24,820
And so we can pull that information from national health system data, health care worker knowledge and capacity can differ.

658
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:30,370
And we have to look at is it sufficient enough to diagnose and treat the targeted disease?

659
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:38,770
And so we can do that through surveys and through to health care workers, through health program reports, events in local contexts.

660
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:45,639
And need to be considered. So new policies that have been put in place, rupturing vaccine supply.

661
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:52,360
Right. Can affect what's happening on the ground. And so we have and we have different sources where we can pull that information.

662
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:57,370
And then social and gender norms differ between communities.

663
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:04,480
And so looking at, for example, who is responsible for treating the sick at home and through health care reports or anthropology studies.

664
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:12,350
And so these all are different sources from different disciplines, but they're all interconnected to tell a more targeted story.

665
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,730
And so these factors also differ from place to place.

666
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,340
So they have to be done at a very local level.

667
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:29,620
And so, for example, IOA data in 2018, they, the Ministry of Health in Democratic Republic of Congo, set up an integrated outbreak analytic cell.

668
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:36,960
And they were seeing that there was a higher than expected number of children with Ebola under the age of five.

669
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:44,140
And so the cell tried to answer the question of why this was happening and then what targeted interventions could be done to address that.

670
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:53,170
So the health care worker data show that children were being brought to help facilities quickly when they were being symptomatic,

671
01:12:53,170 --> 01:13:01,450
but they were not quickly diagnosed. And interviews of parents recognize that most of the parents didn't recognize the signs of Ebola.

672
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:09,670
And then surveys with health care workers found that many of them found it difficult to diagnose or detect symptoms of Ebola in children.

673
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,820
So there was prior recognition of Ebola virus disease by both parents and by both health care workers.

674
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:25,410
Then health care data indicated that recently there was a large increase in health services use by children, meaning patients were sharing beds.

675
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:31,740
And then the IPC infection prevention and Control Program reports and.

676
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:42,250
We're polled and found that over 50% of health care facilities don't have resources to prevent Ebola transmission.

677
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,920
So Iowa and which were at the ministry level holding people from UNICEF and other places,

678
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:57,190
and then worked with local data and local health care workers and local health systems and pulled that data together and attributed

679
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:05,890
them higher than expected cases of children under five and to child to child transmission of Ebola in health care facilities.

680
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:14,510
So. And using that information, then they were able to to have targeted intervention.

681
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:20,820
So they trained and increased training and health promotion for recognizing Ebola symptoms in healthcare workers.

682
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:28,740
They increased resources for prevention transmission, which included decontamination,

683
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:33,330
promotion at child children, vaccinations and reduced bed sharing.

684
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,570
So just an example really quickly of kind of how.

685
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:48,310
Sales can really focus on very localized problems, pulling from local data to help inform why we're seeing different trends in different populations.

686
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:54,880
All right. So I'm just.

687
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:02,330
And then I started this at the very beginning, a sort of this collaborative approach or metaphor for for interdisciplinary work.

688
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:05,740
And I think. It probably implies.

689
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:10,459
But I think a better visual is that all of these disciplines also speak to all these other disciplines.

690
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:16,970
And so we're really pulling together just this massive interdisciplinary work when we're responding.

691
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:26,780
And it's really important to have. Go to my next line and really important to have these regular touchpoints and with these different

692
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,850
groups who are also having regular touchpoints with other groups to inform a really cohesive,

693
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:38,360
comprehensive, holistic view of the response or the the issue at hand.

694
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:45,450
And so for me, I think and my biggest. Success elements that I've seen are very collaborative partners.

695
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:51,570
So people are willing to collaborate, willing to share, willing to and to work as a team.

696
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:57,990
Leadership matters. I interprofessional leadership I think is huge.

697
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:05,100
And then team building and having a common goal in common language and then a couple other things.

698
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:12,150
So I think I actually captured pretty much everything that you all included in the chat and some of the successful elements.

699
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:19,000
And, but I. I think the biggest thing for me has just been having people who who are super

700
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:27,040
collaborative to work with and to push forward and on on response or solutions.

701
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:32,659
So I think I'm. I'll leave it there and see.

702
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:39,170
I know I've just have one or 2 minutes and let's give you a virtual clap.

703
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:43,100
Yeah. Could you go back to the previous slide?

704
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:46,940
Back to your song? I have a question for you.

705
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:56,750
So I know you didn't, like, decide I want to move just to, like, you know, work with a W that just happens to be where they're based.

706
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,650
So how did you get involved with them? Did they like.

707
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:05,229
Fine you or you were like, okay, I live in Switzerland now,

708
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:13,720
so like let me reach out to them just because I know like every first year student when you ask them who they want to work where they're like crazy,

709
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,350
maybe not anymore with like, you know, the W.H.O.

710
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:24,159
So how, how did you get involved in that? Yeah. So I and so University Nebraska Medical Center is a going partner.

711
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:29,830
It's one of the 270 institutions. And so and I worked with a couple.

712
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:34,180
So as a as a grant institution, there are opportunities that come with that.

713
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:42,100
And one of them was to apply to be part of the strategy team. And so I sent an application and became part of the strategy team.

714
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,100
And then the strategy is just really embedded in all of this work. And so that facilitated a lot of opportunities there.

715
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:58,840
And but I will say, I think W.H.O. is doing more and more like internships and opportunities, but I think they're also hiring a lot more people.

716
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:06,450
So I think I think it's. I don't know if Michigan is a grand partner,

717
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,150
but that could be something to look into because there could be opportunities for more students that way as well.

718
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,010
Okay. Thank you. We have time for one more question.

719
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:24,630
Does anybody have one for Dr. Stein? I was just.

720
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:31,070
This might be a question that takes longer than a minute, but like we all touched on clear communication.

721
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:35,840
And so I was curious, were there moments of like, we cannot communicate?

722
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,970
It is it's a roadblock. We are not.

723
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:46,520
Yeah. We can't get our message across between two groups. Maybe that's the industry and the public health department or whoever that was.

724
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:53,480
I just I was curious. We talk about it so much. Do those moments come up where we have to just go to another topic?

725
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,600
Because. Yeah, that's a great question. So I think.

726
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:04,270
I think for us we were almost mediators between a lot of these different groups that have to sort of have.

727
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,550
Be sensitive, I think, for some of those relationships, though, something that I didn't mention is.

728
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:12,950
It varied.

729
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:18,940
Like, I don't want to paint the industry as a horrible picture because there were some really amazing facilities who really cared about their workers.

730
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:26,920
And but there was a local public health department at one point who one didn't feel comfortable talking to us.

731
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,430
If it felt too much like they were helping workers,

732
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:38,110
they had to very much have this fine line of of maintaining a relationship with the industry so

733
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:44,890
that they could get in as needed and not sort of overstep and do too much on the worker side.

734
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,690
And so I think there's definite communication issues between a lot of these stakeholders.

735
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:56,260
But I think having a group that can sort of mediate that was extremely helpful for us with with the COVID response.

736
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,470
Great question. Thank you again, Dr. Hurst.

737
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:07,440
Time I hear your outlook chiming. So undoubtedly you have another meeting about after this.

738
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,300
But then some of our students have to go to their next class as well.

739
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:18,080
So thank you again. And as we move on, if y'all have questions, you can reach out to her.

740
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:22,919
You can reach out to me and I can reach out to her. So thank you again for your time.

741
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,760
And I'm glad the time difference didn't make you give us that like three or something like that.

742
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,419
That's perfect. Thank you, everyone. Thanks, everybody.

743
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,560
Thank you.
