1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:07,489
so I just reminder this is relatively complicated and challenging side

2
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:13,249
we ended on last time. uh I'm not go gonna over the side again just remind you what I was doing

3
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:18,809
was trying to walk you through an argument saying that you're talking about

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,109
when people do randomized controlled clinical trials. the hopper

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,269
way they analyze out kind of data that is what's called an intention to treat analysis

6
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:35,489
needing to do it decide which treatment

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,689
people. each person was assigned to not. bye. how many of the pills they were supposed

8
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:46,311
to take the further treatment. they actually and I said and

9
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:51,491
and my argument here that when you're when you're doing observational studies which is we said

10
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:56,651
many times is usually the only choice you have when you're doing occupational and environmental studies.

11
00:00:56,651 --> 00:01:01,811
you can't do a randomized controlled clinical trials doing occupational studies you have

12
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,871
the testing the exact same problems that you have with Missus

13
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:12,271
analyzing a randomized control trial. Ms. analyzing meaning saying

14
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,391
I'm going analyze to it based on how much how many pills people really didn't take not

15
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:22,671
on which just what they were assigned to and so what this page says it makes the argument

16
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:27,871
that that's a mistake that you can. I it has an example of where you can come to the wrong conclusion

17
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:33,251
if you do that. if it turns out the state to make sure that you don't know just certain way

18
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:38,331
and the argument is that exactly matched for an observational study.

19
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,417
so that I can actually every traditional way people are

20
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:49,077
analyzing I don't I could I'm sorry observational study

21
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:54,097
was equivalent to saying well it's like a randomized control trial

22
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:59,137
but I'm not going to do. bye I'm not gonna do it by what people are signs on the

23
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:04,517
look at what the actual exposure to human exposure was and there's a really good reason

24
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:09,697
people did that because there was no assignment group so they didn't have anything to look at

25
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:14,837
that was repairable. so that's that's what this is about as bad to be trying to set out the arguments

26
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:20,977
that the next they were tired about is Rio and actually is important and actually you.

27
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:26,597
I'm gonna give you an example where you're gonna come to the wrong conclusion. I'm gonna argue to the wrong conclusion.

28
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:33,037
if you use any of the more traditional ways and you know.

29
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:38,037
okay so that's that's why that's I was out here what we're getting ready for so we're gonna

30
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:43,147
spend a bit of time on this next bye. alright. so this

31
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:48,187
side both be representing a study that was done and here's the question I

32
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:55,067
watched to keep in mind as we discussed this but say

33
00:02:55,067 --> 00:03:00,367
your child is thinking is thinking of taking a job at

34
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:06,627
just just plants this facility where there is

35
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:12,147
some agent some accounts on the plant that there's questions about that it might not

36
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:17,287
make ten to make people ill and there's two departments you're either working

37
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:22,587
in the department where you have relatively high exposure doesn't suspect a chance no sure and whether it actually

38
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:27,907
does that or not. suspicious or if you're in the department has only

39
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:33,027
medium exposure to the agent and your cousin says to

40
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:38,067
you. hey they're offering me a job. giving me a choice about

41
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:44,813
which department I wanna be in the high exposure the media exposure and

42
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:49,913
just seeing is the high exposure actually paid for ten percent or maybe

43
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:55,513
fifteen percent more the salary for doing essentially the same thing in different departments.

44
00:03:55,513 --> 00:04:00,913
so if it doesn't really matter as far as my health I was like that's like to use extra money

45
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:06,273
making the highest movie department. but if it if it's gonna put me at risk for

46
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:11,533
becoming ill and maybe even dying from what I'm exposed to I'd rather live

47
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:16,793
with a somewhat lower salary. so I notice you like a scientist and you seem to

48
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:22,033
know about these kinds of things. what do you advise me to do. alright so that's

49
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:28,453
that's the question to keep it not like what should you advise this cousin actually

50
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:34,313
as we go through this and think about your answer that question. okay. so

51
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:39,353
here's what set up this time zero is when holidays people hire in

52
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:44,449
on the same day. you know this is which I think there and points about how

53
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,629
the analysis has to be done for simplifying things you know in real life everybody went hiring

54
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:55,989
on the same day just but I'm trying to keep it straight for you because a lot of fact what we're talking about. so

55
00:04:55,989 --> 00:05:01,069
four hundred people hired to the department with the high exposure that's with ages

56
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:06,429
four and four hundred people hired to the department the medium exposure. that's what the damages

57
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:11,469
for and then you follow these people forward in time

58
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:16,649
and in time T one. what you find out is among

59
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,389
those four hundred people that hired into the high exposure department.

60
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,095
half of them are still there two hundred of them but half of them

61
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:33,415
are off work. I've left work for some reason I was off off

62
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:38,455
work. okay so two hundred still there are two hundred have left at

63
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:46,315
that same time to you one. if you look at the people that originally hired into the medium department.

64
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:51,735
three hundred of down are still working in the medium department and one hundred and down

65
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:57,515
are off work. so lower percentage off work. okay this

66
00:05:57,515 --> 00:06:02,835
this all sounds like very simple and that all the arithmetic simple

67
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:07,895
conclusion is a little startling that's. where sort of hockey if you're carefully. okay.

68
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:12,975
so what happens next we got a time T to time which is the end

69
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:18,435
of the study and basically what you're doing in time for to mortality study you looking to see

70
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:23,934
who's alive time to to say from iPod. okay

71
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:29,394
and so it time to to mine those two hundred people been hired into the high exposure

72
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:34,814
department and we're still there time to watch for any of them dad. hundred sixty

73
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:40,154
of them are still alive. so the mortality rate is four hundred divided by the two.

74
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:45,494
I'm sorry is the forty who died divided by the two hundred total. so that's about forty

75
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:50,674
over two hundred is zero point two zero. that's the fraction of them died.

76
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:56,974
okay. on Wednesday so far. just pretty straightforward right

77
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:02,994
I'm wrong that two hundred who we are off working time T one.

78
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:08,154
you have sixty of those have died time to set time

79
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:13,194
to two hundred forty or alive sixty over two hundred. if the mortality rate is

80
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:19,328
zero point three zero. so notice the mortality rates higher

81
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:24,808
in the group of people that among all the people hired into the high exposure department the mortality

82
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:30,348
rate is higher among those who for some reason left work by Time T one.

83
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:35,648
we're not longer working there. so you know if that's gonna fit in with some argument about healthy worker

84
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:40,688
effect right. like people you know what the health healthy worker

85
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:46,448
survivors and people who leave work early are more likely to die shortly after. okay.

86
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:51,588
now if you go down and people hired into the middle. exposure department of the three hundred bits day stay

87
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:56,808
there time T one at a time T to sticks to your dad. so that's

88
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:02,028
sixty out of three hundred which is zero point two zero for the fraction of those

89
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:07,668
that hired under the medium exposure department can see it and change it it

90
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:12,848
fractions down that are dead time to two and forty

91
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:18,482
one hundred. we're off work time to you one last early. among those

92
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:24,262
thirty of them have died today or thirty over one zero point three zero. so

93
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:29,522
the first thing I watch it and notice is the following one way to analyze

94
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:35,102
this data is this day. well you should you try to be sophisticated.

95
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:40,242
I doctor out of sort of orange either to be some issues here so let me think quickly what can I do to sort of

96
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:45,482
maybe protect myself and this healthy worker survivor. that's what I did in Dallas. so.

97
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:51,622
so a lot I didn't think about this is say you well. I'm only gonna compare

98
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:56,802
the people they continued to work at Time T one other people to continue to work

99
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:01,922
in time to watch and I'm only going come here. the people are off work times

100
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:06,982
you want other people that are off work time. do you want to maybe help or protect me

101
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:12,322
from talking some bye. so if you do that.

102
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:17,644
what's the answer answered it makes absolutely no difference based on how you just analyze

103
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:22,684
the data whether you hired to the high exposure department of media exposure department right. you are

104
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:27,824
still the Internet department at two one and you hired in the high. you had a twenty percent chance

105
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:32,904
of being dead T two. if you hired in the medium one and you were still

106
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:38,104
they're still working their time to one. you had the same twenty percent chance of being dead

107
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:43,104
in time to to. okay. similarly for the people are off work those two

108
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:48,504
hundred people. it didn't matter whether they originally were in the high exposure department of media exposure department.

109
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,504
this is the high exposure department. the probability being data time to two

110
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:58,524
point three zero thirty percent. and if they hired in the medium exposure and we're off work a

111
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:03,524
time to wander probability of being dead time to two thirty percent. so if you

112
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:09,144
analyze the data that way you say and exactly no difference whether you hire in the

113
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:15,184
high exposure for the team exposure. hey pass a call for more money.

114
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:21,398
I and that seem like a perfectly. I mean did that not seem like

115
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:26,458
hazing value before we get into a it perfectly reasonable way to analyze the data there's nothing like shocking about

116
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:31,518
doing it that seems pretty straightforward right. on Wednesday. okay. so

117
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:36,758
the other way of course people often analyze data and trying to be more sophisticated. as they try

118
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:42,978
to analyze it your human exposure to that age. so

119
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:48,138
this equation is here to make the math simpler.

120
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:53,598
had it would not change. anyway what the conclusions we come to.

121
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:59,018
if this wasn't true. but basically this dad 's H is

122
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:04,298
whatever the concentration of that that chemical we're worried about is in the high exposure department

123
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:09,618
and to you one minus Time T zero is a waste of time and it says let's

124
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:15,838
let's assume set it up so that if see

125
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:21,042
if so if we started out the following way I say that the high exposure department.

126
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:26,642
it's twice as high as the medium and we say that distance

127
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:31,882
that amount of time that's elapsed between two zero ti one is equal

128
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:36,902
to the amount of time that's elapsed between T T T one and T two. that would

129
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:41,922
mean that between time T zero in T to do that twice as much

130
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:47,482
time as the last as between two zero one two one. so if you take

131
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:52,542
an exposure this twice as high but only you only spend it passes much time

132
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:58,102
in it two one nineteen zero as compared to two two two minus two zero.

133
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:03,812
that's gonna equal exposure that's half of that

134
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:09,152
but expose for twice as long because the way you do can they do exposures you modify the concentration

135
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:14,152
times like the next motion. tell this is just a convenience that

136
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:19,312
we made made a equation this way. so that we do that human exposure

137
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:24,632
that's gonna make this group the people hired into the high exposure and and

138
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:29,672
last work at time T two. it's gonna make their to move exposure

139
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:34,972
equal to this group which is the people hired in at the medium exposure

140
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:40,192
and we're still working at a time T one. so it's gonna

141
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:45,372
combine these two groups in touch single group because they happen to have the same gym

142
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:50,372
and of exposure that was the reason for doing it. okay. but it definitely wouldn't change anything if they didn't have the

143
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:55,752
same human exposure still be the same argument. how many people that I completely

144
00:12:55,752 --> 00:13:02,011
lost yet okay that's not bad

145
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:08,531
I mean yes I really like completed but yeah. okay

146
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:21,991
yeah

147
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:27,131
no it's not the first tragedy when we went through first was you

148
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:33,051
only compare people that are working to other people that are working at the same time.

149
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:38,211
so we we compared people that were working and started high exposure to work people and started

150
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:43,291
meeting exposure and and similarly going to people

151
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:48,371
that were off work. other people are off work. so we compared to people that started to exposure

152
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:53,631
and we're now off work time he wants people that started in the media exposure

153
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:58,651
and off work at Time T T one and we discovered that made it absolutely terms

154
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:07,831
of what's your probability of dying and they definitely no difference. okay.

155
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:13,451
right exposure to project.

156
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:19,931
if you have hire teams of exposure then you might like

157
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:25,291
not know that I did not say no to strangers or do the same with out there as you'll see an attack and they will give you different

158
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:30,551
results. they were not able each other but they'll both be wrong.

159
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:35,651
we're organic horrific that's what we're trying to get to and if you think about traditional ways

160
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:40,971
life data. when I say they're gonna both be wrong. you gonna say but I got nothing left

161
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:46,251
I don't have some other way to analyze it either I gotta treat this thing like an intervening variable just leaving work business.

162
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:52,051
I have to treated like compound I can't get the first the on street and I guess confound

163
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:57,131
the second one is you were just using human exposure impact that. alright.

164
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:02,571
so so here's the analysis using punitive exposure.

165
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:07,831
so you got a number of people died how many people at risk and the Kimmitt of incidence rate.

166
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:13,171
's in a group so who's the hybrid high groups are the two hundred people

167
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:18,251
hired into the high exposure and we're still there at time he won it in late.

168
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:23,311
okay. so what is. so there's two hundred of them

169
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:28,491
for any of them died. so forty goes in death two hundred at risk

170
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:35,211
and they came with incidence rate is point two zero twenty percent of them died. okay.

171
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:41,751
the low group the people have the lowest exposure to this age and the people that hired into the medium

172
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:48,131
department and last. we're off work by ninety one

173
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:53,271
and and among that group. we've got thirty

174
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:58,751
of those one hundred I'd write thirty died the one hundred. so on the love group the possibility

175
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:03,769
of dying was point three zero and then the medium group are

176
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:08,809
the people that he's hired in high exposure and then went

177
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:14,329
off work we're we're off we're good time to one oh are hired in at the medium exposure

178
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,629
and we're still at work at Time T one. are you making this an equation where the vehicle

179
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:25,449
each other we set it up so those two groups actually have the same human exposure. okay.

180
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:30,509
so there come by. so you're combining these two hundred people would be three hundred people.

181
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:35,749
that's why there's five hundred of them and we look to see how many died. you got sixty died in this group and sixty

182
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:40,909
dining that group you had those two together that's where the one twenty comes from. so in the medium you got

183
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:45,949
one twenty over five hundred which is point two four twenty four percent. so we've

184
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:51,789
just proven you've got human exposure.

185
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:57,829
we should all be exposed much as possible. look what happens

186
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,223
lower the exposure. the more likely I did I right now what you

187
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:08,543
know what data that shows right here. I exposure twenty percent chance of timing

188
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:13,543
exposure twenty four percent chance no exposure thirty percent chance now. I'll

189
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:18,663
say one thing you might say well these are sort of high with

190
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:24,103
the statistically significant letters and easy way to fix that right. I can add two zeros

191
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:29,463
after the number of people every time it's was a very large facility and forty thousand

192
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:34,843
people hired in and into department forty thousand hard in the other. so

193
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:39,903
it will change the math but you can certainly change the confidence interval the very time. I just things more

194
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:45,323
people. okay. so

195
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:50,683
GMAC recommended way to hire this is the following. it's criminal

196
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:56,543
I did too. I intention to treat. if you're doing a randomized controlled

197
00:17:56,543 --> 00:18:01,963
trial. so it's gonna just follow four hundred people hired in the high high department

198
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:06,973
of time two zero. how many of them died well forty of them

199
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:12,093
died there sixty of them died there. one hundred of them died. so if you hired into the high

200
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:17,353
high exposure department. you had eight one hundred out of four hundred

201
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:22,493
point two five twenty five percent chance of dying. if you hired into the medium

202
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:27,493
exposure department. how many that's four hundred people hired and how many those died.

203
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:32,593
sixty days here and thirty of those there at ninety death so

204
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:38,053
you got ninety four hundred which rounded to two dozen appliances. zero point two two.

205
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:43,337
so you don't notice that is the high exposure hi into

206
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:48,477
the high exclusion department that you in to be dressed for being dead time teaching the right point two

207
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:53,617
five 's two two. so we've got three ways of analyzing

208
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:59,377
the data entry contradictory results. very first way we talked about

209
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:05,677
it made no difference. the decor we talked about which is Kim of exposure. it was the detectives

210
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:10,857
have more exposure in the last way we that analyze which was how high was the exposure

211
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:15,977
where you initially we're recruiting into it. we found that it was

212
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:21,157
a problem. okay so now I'm asking on I mean the rest the check closing

213
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:26,277
tricky right. I mean I set it up as the red tape was pretty straight forward.

214
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:31,417
so now you've just gone through all that for some reason

215
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:39,037
oh not identical for

216
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:44,642
owners. I mean I wondered which one which is hard how many people.

217
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:49,842
so again still these small differences like the point two five 's point two two

218
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:54,982
soon they're real. bye. okay. here's a three percent higher

219
00:19:54,982 --> 00:20:00,242
chance you'll be dead to ninety two you by the last analysis if you hired

220
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:05,382
into the high exposure department. okay. so how many people in the room

221
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:11,182
would say to the cousin makes no difference

222
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:23,002
whether you hard to hire medium sure go ahead and go for the better so.

223
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:29,982
well I hadn't thought of that. it's it's a really tight family

224
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:35,582
you grew up in the top like a brother or sister too.

225
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:41,462
okay so yeah I thought one vote over here with that question about

226
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:46,490
that's about. okay and how many people say hey go out and buy discount.

227
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,590
wanna see how you go out and buy more than ten snippet every day. the more you're exposed to it

228
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,830
the last likely I did not I mean wanna. hey. you're gonna get the best both of worlds.

229
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,290
you don't have exposure to the text you have more money. I mean you wanna tell

230
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,010
no one but how many people are kind of close. all

231
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,290
they do is just tell me that your plants says the fine. if you hire the high exposure department

232
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,430
you're more likely to be dead whatever however many years later but if you hire me

233
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:24,990
in the storage department. 's not a huge difference but you know be dead pretty

234
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,030
pretty severe. hope it's really hard maybe is word the I mean

235
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,910
you know quite as much money. I mean people wanna say that

236
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,430
there is a fourth choice like this place looks dangerous to stay out of it which is the one

237
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,756
that's now over doing today I mean you wanna do that

238
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:52,316
how many people are abstaining. okay.

239
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:58,336
so anyway I don't know

240
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:03,476
know you you may be in trouble here. but obviously

241
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:08,656
by the way I described everything when I'm telling you is this is the right way to analyze

242
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:13,676
the data and it's not a traditional method analyze it and it's

243
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:18,956
equivalent to same. I'm gonna do an intention Street. it's like pretending that we assign people

244
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:24,396
high to exposure medium exposure randomly which course didn't really happen.

245
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:30,656
that's an intention to trees now. so what I'm saying is you don't get the right answer.

246
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,936
so when they ask for healthy worker. three healthy work survivor

247
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:42,076
which is the one that passes all these can on drugs you will not get the right answer whether

248
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:47,352
you decide leaving work early is an intervening variables

249
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:52,552
the call the pathway and you will not get the right answer if you decided to confound because

250
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:57,572
it's is and has to be adjusted for because it's associated simultaneously with

251
00:22:57,572 --> 00:23:03,212
the exposure of course because you're only gonna expose if you're at work and with with that. okay.

252
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:08,572
sometimes you can't need those in our favor give you the right answer hey

253
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:26,672
you have to do something like that. yeah.

254
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:31,772
so very short answer that is no it doesn't it's just

255
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:37,072
a really fancy way of doing an adjustment for four

256
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:42,772
and you have and you have a certain model of what how the risk of

257
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:47,780
death in this case she changes in relation to some time variable but

258
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,460
you're still you're still basically putting in all the covariance and adjusting for. so that's

259
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,460
the same page their potential confounding job for you could you could well you

260
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,720
can use like different message you could use that cox proportional had to model but happy

261
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,220
that's really weird complicated one where you when you say I'm only gonna let the people have the same

262
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,300
work for straight up to a certain date and then just see if they

263
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,600
diverge for the next year what happens because I think they'll be enough like each other

264
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,840
and we can just look at that next year so it's sort of like you'd have to put together well it depends how big

265
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,340
how long the study got but maybe a couple of dozen different cox proportional models

266
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,420
and sort of figure out some way to add them together and take to do something equivalent to let it sit there

267
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,369
for the gene off. okay bye
