1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:22,230
Yeah. All right.

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:01:06,630
Yeah. I would like.

3
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:45,020
He. Yeah.

4
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,160
I have. That makes it.

5
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:18,260
I think. Yeah.

6
00:02:19,160 --> 00:03:24,530
Yeah. So.

7
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,600
Good morning, everybody. Oh, sorry I'm late.

8
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,700
I think there's a missing bus. There was a missing bus this morning.

9
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,810
I don't know if I'll share it. I'm sure I have it, but my husband drives busses and I also used to drive busses for the university.

10
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,170
So I know that they are missing busses. Because I hear about it a lot.

11
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,260
We need some students to drive busses. So if you're looking for a job, I'll pull the plug out for my husband for his sanity.

12
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,450
If you want to drive busses, it's fine. But I think there was a missing bus this morning, so please excuse my tardiness.

13
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,830
I waited way too long at the stop, so.

14
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,280
Now that I'm here, though. Welcome back.

15
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:41,270
Today we're talking about well, we'll do an introduction, a sampling, and then we're going to talk a little bit about probability sampling.

16
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:49,670
But I will also talk about the next assignment, as well as a couple questions from the quiz that.

17
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,750
Where? I'll just say that there seemed to be some struggle with.

18
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,520
And please excuse my staff sniffling too. I'm not sick.

19
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,400
It's just allergies. That. Or acting up.

20
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,230
S. I. No, you're not working. Oh, boo.

21
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,010
Batteries must be dead. I'm not winning today.

22
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,900
Okay. So Announcements Quiz is opening up today.

23
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:34,380
Quiz three covers the units from indicators last week, but they will also cover next week.

24
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,350
So given that, well, one. Yeah, the deadline for the last quiz was a.

25
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:49,569
A Sunday so expanded in two that the quiz is technically at first.

26
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,810
The quiz is technically due the day you finished the unit.

27
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:04,060
I extended the deadline for quiz three, so it will be due on the eighth and you'll see that on the campus assignment.

28
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,360
Let me get this out the way to go away, Chair.

29
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:25,590
So just know that you will have about five days in between the last unit that is covered on the quiz and then the due date of the quiz.

30
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,900
So don't panic. If you open it up and you're like, What?

31
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,180
We haven't been covered to see it the day the due date has been changed to reflect that.

32
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,360
So other than that, any questions before I jump in?

33
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,430
All right. So on Tuesday, we covered quantitative research.

34
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:02,960
And you know, this involves numerical data that's analyzed using mathematical methods and particular stats.

35
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,870
And those can be descriptive, those can be inferential.

36
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,440
Um, but typically we're using statistics to analyze that data.

37
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,170
We have assessments or tests and surveys,

38
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:30,770
and the primary difference being that assessments are measuring something objectively so to an acknowledged, recognized standard,

39
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,309
whereas surveys are measuring subjective things like attitudes and opinions

40
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,620
where there isn't a an established standard or a so called the right answer.

41
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,670
We also talked about construct validity. So again, validity being about confidence,

42
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:58,640
construct validity is about the extent to which we can have confidence that what we're measuring is actually being measured.

43
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,690
And it can't be measured directly. So there is no test to measure for construct validity.

44
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:15,540
But you know, for example, at face validity and content validity, it's about running.

45
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,060
Measures by stakeholders with criterion validity is about pilot testing.

46
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:31,659
And then finally, we talked about reliability. And that's the extent to which a measure is consistent, whether it's test retest, validity, I mean,

47
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:42,250
reliability, where you can give a test one day, give a test another day, it will have the same value.

48
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,980
When we talk about reliability, what we're talking about is consistency.

49
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:57,840
So now that we've talked a bit about quantitative methods, what we're going to talk about today is sampling.

50
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:07,830
We'll talk a bit about sampling and then get into probability sampling with non probability sampling approaches coming next week.

51
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:17,790
And remember that even though I divided them, you can use probability and probability sampling and quantitative methods.

52
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,930
So what are we talking about when we talk about sampling? So why do we even sample?

53
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:37,020
Basic definition is that sampling is a process of taking a subset of a particular group of interest.

54
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:48,570
In this case, the sample, the orange in this on this slide to represent all members of that group, in this case the population.

55
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,070
When we talk about all members of the group, what we're talking about is a population.

56
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,950
And in this visual, the population is represented in the blue.

57
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,360
Right. So whenever you see sample in population,

58
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:13,040
we are literally referring to either a subset or in case a population referring

59
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,380
to everybody that would be a member of whatever population we're talking about.

60
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,670
So take, for example, college students.

61
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,009
And obviously with college students, there's variation within that.

62
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,410
Right. So there could be grad students and undergrads or there can be.

63
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,410
You know, students who came straight from high school and those who did not come straight from high school,

64
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,760
though, those who have work experiences, those who don't.

65
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,530
There's a lot of variation in that. And so, as you might imagine,

66
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:04,030
it's important to be thoughtful about those potential differences within a population when you are drawing the orange, drawing the sample.

67
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,100
Why is it important in program evaluation?

68
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,330
Well, in public health, again, public health is about intervening with populations.

69
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:30,020
We might engage our activities with individuals, but ultimately they're designed to make a population level impact.

70
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:41,930
So when we're doing our interventions, it may be and then is likely beyond our resources and our capability to follow

71
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:49,250
up with any everyone who's been exposed to an intervention or in or just,

72
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:57,620
you know, if we're trying to understand, for instance, a health behavior, everyone who will be a member of that population.

73
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:10,639
So we need to sample. And we also sample in public health and program evaluation because we can't always

74
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,570
expose everyone to everyone who's in the population to a give it intervention.

75
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,920
So sampling allows us again, especially when we are thinking about evaluating a program,

76
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:37,190
it allows us to be able to draw a sample of people who will ultimately represent the full group so that we can now is it effective or not?

77
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:48,680
Should we scale it up or not? Should we take our initial investment of, say, you know, 1 million and decide that it's worth investing?

78
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:57,190
Multiple millions to make sure that the population at large has access to that intervention.

79
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,879
And then finally we what when we are sampling and why it's important to be thoughtful about this

80
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:16,000
process is that whatever approach that we use has implications for external validity of our study.

81
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,830
And so remember, external validity is about generalizing.

82
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,900
So we need to make sure that our sample is again representing enough or representing

83
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:34,649
the population well enough that we know that if we if something worked in the sample,

84
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,710
it's going to work in the population more likely than that.

85
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:53,800
So what is our sampling process? Well, I'll start going through this, um, step by step process with a little, you know, detours on the way.

86
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,290
So the first thing you want to do when you are defining a sample is the first actually define the population.

87
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,210
And this is about understanding, well, who do you want to generalize the results of your evaluation to?

88
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:20,980
Again thinking about, say, I designed an intervention to reduce alcohol use among public health grad students.

89
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:27,120
And I decided to use HP. HP as in the as the.

90
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,650
The sample of, you know, the population of public health grad students.

91
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:44,280
So I have to think about, okay, well, so I want ultimately to impact public health grad students,

92
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:52,650
regardless if they're in Michigan or Hopkins or at USC, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

93
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,210
Um, and then I have to think about, okay, well, you know, does that group the are they,

94
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,400
you know, are they representing everyone that I want to generalize to?

95
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,690
So when I'm thinking about the population, I need to think.

96
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Precisely about who fits within that bubble.

97
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,020
So that again I can understand how this the sample.

98
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,920
How does a sample represent that population?

99
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,480
The second thing I need to do is to determine any inclusion or exclusion criteria.

100
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,490
And so of course examples my AQ include included age.

101
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:52,790
It might be an inclusion criteria might be the presence of a specific health condition or it might be an exclusion criteria.

102
00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:02,840
Maybe I decide to exclude in this public health grant school or grad student example.

103
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:14,450
I'm exclude, you know, I decide to exclude students who have a diagnosed alcohol disorder or addiction to alcohol.

104
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:28,180
I might be geographic location. So you want to think about, okay, I have my population and step one and step two.

105
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:37,160
I want to be more precise in defining who's in that population, who's not in that population.

106
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,980
The third thing that you want to do in this process is to identify a sample length frame.

107
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,790
So a sampling frame is the list of assessable population from which you will draw your sample.

108
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:06,430
So I might have a focal population say, well I'll, I'll give the example in a second, I'll have a focal population,

109
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,570
but my sampling frame may but not likely completely overlap with that focal population.

110
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,810
But then once I have a sampling frame defined.

111
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,390
The sample that I have I draw comes from the sampling frame.

112
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,950
And so it's important to just note that. Excuse me.

113
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,730
Sorry, I couldn't help it. That.

114
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:48,290
A sampling frame is literally a list. It's a list of people who are that you can access that you will draw your sample from.

115
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,300
So let's take this example that I have on the slide.

116
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:02,670
So I'm conducting an evaluation with a program focal population of female youth 12 to 17 from Ann Arbor.

117
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:09,270
And these are young women who participated in the Girls Empowerment Program.

118
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:20,310
So I know that there's a past group of people who participated in this program, and they're between the ages of 12 and 17.

119
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,130
So I've got a list, you know, so I've got a potential list.

120
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:36,170
But I decide as part of my exclusion criteria that I don't want to try and sample youth who are who've left Ann Arbor.

121
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,850
You know, for whatever reason, convenience, resources, time.

122
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,800
The important thing to take away is that I've excluded anyone who's moved away.

123
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:57,600
So my SIPP. So when I generate that list of participants, it's only going to include people from Ann Arbor.

124
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,170
And so that means that some people have been left out.

125
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,090
And that means and that's what I'm saying, when I mean that the sampling frame doesn't completely overlap with the population.

126
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:21,240
So now I have a list. Maybe when I started at the blue level, I had there were potentially 120 people.

127
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,760
But I learned that 20 of those young women have moved away.

128
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,340
So now my sampling frame is only 100 people.

129
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,200
So that's that 100. That's who I'm drawing the sample from.

130
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:48,080
And this connects to some of the challenges that we might face and in doing sampling and program evaluation,

131
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,750
because think about it now, if I'm just researching a phenomenon.

132
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,190
One thing I don't have to worry about is have they participated participated in the program.

133
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:12,019
But if I'm sampling and trying to generate a sampling frame and generate a sample for a program evaluation, well,

134
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,710
there are other factors I need to consider and make sure have happened or have been

135
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,880
or considered in order for it to be a high quality sample or representative sample.

136
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:33,380
So one challenge. The number of people who can or did participate in the intervention.

137
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:44,600
So I have to think about if I'm evaluating a program and I'm doing a sample, I have to make sure that there was some contact with the intervention.

138
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,290
If I'm, you know, again, placing them into a treatment group.

139
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:56,220
Another challenge is it's not always clear who was a participant or who wasn't.

140
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,900
Again. If you've ever worked in an organize, a community based organization,

141
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:17,320
you've likely seen issues where maybe there were two or more programs going on at the same time in the same space, at the same moment.

142
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,340
Perhaps some of the participants in one program followed it over to the other one.

143
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,580
Maybe they liked hanging out again with youth programs.

144
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:37,490
I've seen this happen over and over again. Youth is in programing and they're like, okay, program is done for the day.

145
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,580
I'm going to go out here and float over the program. BE So they've been exposed to program B.

146
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,670
So you have to think about that. It's not always clear who ultimately ends up being a participant.

147
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,930
And then the third challenge with sampling and program evaluation is that some people may be participants of one component of an intervention,

148
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,330
but not participants in other components.

149
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:14,030
Again, maybe person floated over from program A to program B after they're there was an introduction and program B session,

150
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:22,790
and then they decide to do program B. So you have to think about that, especially when you're thinking about inclusion, exclusion criteria.

151
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,270
What what qualifies as being part of the intervention.

152
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:35,830
And so that can be a challenge. If you don't think about that, it can compromise the interpretation of your results.

153
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,440
And so when you're general, you know, I put this slide here because ultimately.

154
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,580
You're going to end up seeing this. It's going to first emerge the most in your sampling frame.

155
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:03,580
So once we've determined the sampling frame, the next thing that we're doing is that we're selecting a sampling strategy.

156
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:11,880
You know, as I've said, their probability sampling and non probability sampling strategies.

157
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:22,170
Probability sampling is basically any matter the sampling that uses some form of random selection.

158
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:30,330
And the units of the population of interest they have they have a known probability of being chosen.

159
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,060
This doesn't mean that it has to be an equal 5050 probability of being chosen.

160
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,900
It's simply that there is a known probability.

161
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,160
And then in contrast, ma'am, probability sampling doesn't use random selection.

162
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:56,680
So you really you don't have a sense of what their probability of being chosen is to be in the sample.

163
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,820
You. And as you might imagine, there's advantages and disadvantages for choosing either of these approaches.

164
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:22,980
One advantage of choosing probability sampling is, well, you you can be more confident that your sample represents the population of interest.

165
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:30,360
If you're drawing them out randomly and you've done your due diligence with your sampling frame,

166
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,290
you can feel pretty confident that it's representative.

167
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,690
Obviously, you still want to make sure you do things like, you know, baseline characteristics, you know,

168
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:49,520
identifying baseline characteristics, you know, things of that nature to make sure that it is representative.

169
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:56,350
But you can have, you know. A good deal of confidence that it probably is.

170
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:07,600
Another advantage. It allows you to generalize to the population of interest because the selection is random, the selection is representative.

171
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:14,590
You can feel pretty confident that it's going to allow you to generalize to those who didn't make it into the sample.

172
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:25,060
Probability sampling also. Creates a greater likelihood that you can replicate the study.

173
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,310
Which is helpful again with program evaluation. You're trying to.

174
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,800
Especially if your goal is about replicating the program.

175
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:47,880
It's helpful that you can replicate that. Somebody else can go and replicate the study and support the results or the findings of your evaluation.

176
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,600
Some disadvantages, though, of probability sampling is that it requires a sampling frame.

177
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,660
So you don't always have to do the sampling frame.

178
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:06,700
You don't always have to generate this complete list of people who are qualified, if you will, to be sampled.

179
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,220
But if you if you are doing probability sampling, that is a requirement.

180
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,050
So that means that you also have to have a process for random selection.

181
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,920
We'll talk a bit about how you identify that in the second.

182
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:34,030
And it's also time intensive and costly. You know, again, I just think about the sampling frame.

183
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:45,940
You have to take the time, generate that list, make sure that you also have some form of contact information that can take time and.

184
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,450
It can be costly that staff time that spent doing that kind of work.

185
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,410
An advantage of non probability sampling is that you don't need a sampling frame.

186
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,650
So there's some, you know, time saved.

187
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,890
So it can be time efficient and then they also can be cost effective.

188
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,290
Again, the process of randomizing people is time and money.

189
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:25,330
But the disadvantages of that is that you don't know with confidence that the samples were representative of the population of interest.

190
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:34,830
Of course, you can again look at baseline characteristics to try and see if it's representative, but it is not.

191
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,350
The process is not as rigorous as it would be if you were doing probability sampling.

192
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,890
Even that kind of compromises your ability to generalize findings to the population of interest.

193
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,850
But again, if the purpose of your and this is where it goes back to purpose, what we talked about a few weeks ago,

194
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,710
if your purpose is really about illustrating that this program worked in this context,

195
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,440
in this moment, and the investment was worth it, you know, for example,

196
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,460
either time or money for your stakeholders, then you don't need to worry about generalization.

197
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,000
And for many programs, that's often the case.

198
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:30,190
But if you are aiming to generalize, you really have to think about, can I afford the risk?

199
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,750
Do I have the resources to be able to do a random sample?

200
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,140
And do you use a probability sampling method?

201
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,590
So the last thing that you do in the sampling process in general is you draw a sample.

202
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,590
And so you need to think about ways. You need to think about when you're going to draw that sample.

203
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,440
How you're going to draw that sample and then ways to prevent non-response.

204
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:12,320
Because if you've taken the time to develop a sample, ideally you want people to participate.

205
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,340
And you know, as we talk about, we'll actually start talking about this on the next slide.

206
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,670
Sample is often kind of the the question I know I get a lot.

207
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,520
It's not one of the most common questions.

208
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,950
No, actually, probably is one of the most common questions I get when I'm working with a group of people on evaluation.

209
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,150
How big of a sample size? We need to illustrate to our funders that we didn't waste their money.

210
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,280
So we want to make sure and oftentimes we may be working with a program that only,

211
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,820
like I have done, want programs where there were only ten participants.

212
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,890
Ever. So it's important to, you know,

213
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,600
think about ways that we can combat nonresponse because sometimes we really don't have a lot of people to work with in the first place.

214
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,580
So how big of a sample do we need? And really it does depend.

215
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,160
There's not really a one size fits all sample size.

216
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:38,480
Again, one program might have ten participants ever, and another program might have 3000 over the course of its life.

217
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,530
You know, obviously, the situations are going to be different in terms of sample size.

218
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,110
And it also is based on other factors, including what types of analysis we want to run,

219
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,960
what types of inference we're trying to make about the findings.

220
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,950
And then but with qualitative data and I'll talk again about this more next week.

221
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:19,670
The sample size is not as important. What's key with qualitative is that represent representation.

222
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,530
And so they are sampling methods that are not non.

223
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,660
There are non probability sampling approaches, but they are really helpful.

224
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,520
Now remember why I put it that put the amount of probability they with a non probability with a qualitative,

225
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:46,940
because non probability sampling approaches can sometimes give us a little bit more freedom to

226
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:54,380
make sure that we have that representation we need for qualitative data collection and analysis.

227
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,180
But I'm not going to leave you high and dry.

228
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:16,050
There are some factors that you want to consider when you're determining the appropriate sample size for a program or just any study,

229
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:23,280
but in this case, a program evaluation study. One question to consider.

230
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:31,070
Well, how precise do we want to be? So we have a imprecise means.

231
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:42,150
In can't in respect to our findings and conclusions, how important is it that we are precisely.

232
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,980
That we can be confident in the results that we get.

233
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,980
So if we have a smaller sample size, we can be fairly precise.

234
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,900
Right. We. You know.

235
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,860
For example, if I take that sample size of ten.

236
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:13,160
I can be pretty precise with an analysis of ten people, especially if that ten people is the entire program population.

237
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,020
But a larger sample size is going to allow us to be even more precise.

238
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,120
So if we have an intervention that has a wide reaching effect, you know, for example, a social media campaign,

239
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:40,820
or if we're doing policy evaluation, we want to be really precise because the reach of the intervention is a lot further.

240
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,110
The second question we want to consider is how short do we want to be of our answer?

241
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,470
Smaller size, we could be fairly certain.

242
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,840
Again, analysis will allow us to identify.

243
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,050
Some impact, some result, but we have a larger sample size.

244
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,960
It allows us to be even more certain of the answer.

245
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,030
So again, speaking with confidence. Our sample size is large enough that we believe that we are.

246
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,390
Observing something that will apply to the population at large.

247
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:31,670
The third question we need to consider is how much variation is there in the population you are studying?

248
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:42,410
A smaller sample size. If we know that our population is pretty homogeneous.

249
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:57,360
For example, the population might be super specific. Like with the example I gave you girls 12 to 17 in this very specific geographic location.

250
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:05,810
So this probably and I pulled that from a real example where there's also I believe there was.

251
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,540
Actually, I don't know if they're specific, but most of their participants, I know for sure are typically African-American.

252
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:23,980
So, you know, they're pretty homogeneous by race, by age, by geographic location.

253
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:33,790
So I don't necessarily mean I don't I don't need a large sample size because there's not a lot of variation within that sample.

254
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,910
But then take the call it the public health grad student intervention.

255
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:48,310
There's a lot of variation even in this room. Different departments, different schools, different places you came from.

256
00:35:50,270 --> 00:36:01,550
So I need a large sample size to account for the fact that there's a lot of variation in in this in the inside the population.

257
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,320
Even once I do my inclusion and exclusion criteria.

258
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:17,499
Then finally. How small of an effect do you want to be able to identify and effect sizes?

259
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,190
Really referring to the amount of change.

260
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,930
Right. So maybe there's this maybe this intervention.

261
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:32,379
I'm only expecting it to have a small change on the population at large.

262
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,280
Right. So I don't expect that. At the end.

263
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:52,300
You know, I'll take an example again with that site that Tim that group of ten that group of ten were participating in a recidivism or,

264
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,350
you know, reducing the likelihood that someone will go back to prison.

265
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:06,100
I don't. I wouldn't expect that the intervention that I was evaluating to really have a huge

266
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,660
impact like to be the only thing that drives somebody not to return to prison.

267
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,950
And I don't really you know, I didn't really expect that.

268
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,900
Kept getting lost in the example, but so I don't want to get lost in the example,

269
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,630
but the idea is that some programs you only expect to have a small change,

270
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,700
whereas there are some programs where you expect that to have a huge change at the end.

271
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,580
Or maybe I just want to be able to detect any change.

272
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:49,920
So if I want to be able to detect any change whatsoever because of the program, I'm going to need a larger sample size.

273
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,470
And this is just a roll of statistics.

274
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,990
And then if I am okay, just picking up moderate sized changes or large changes, then it's okay for me to have a smaller sample size.

275
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,220
So there are some givens. Um.

276
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:24,330
You know, when we're thinking about determining size, in most cases, we do want the sample to be as large as practically possible.

277
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,790
Again, we have to think of our resources. We have to think about time.

278
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:38,530
We have to think about access. And then, you know, we also have to think about, well, who already was engaged in the program.

279
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,220
Again, if a program only had ten participants, that's all I got.

280
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,020
There's not much I can do it. There's not anything I can do about that.

281
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:56,980
Another given is that when it's comparatively large, adding more units to the sample is not going to increase the precision.

282
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,130
So here's. An example that better illustrates what I mean by that.

283
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,050
So first, let's talk about margin of error.

284
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:19,090
And the margin of error is the maximum expected difference between the true effect and the estimate of the effect.

285
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:28,540
So, you know, when we talk about stats, the something, you know, an underlying assumption is that there is a true effect.

286
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,930
And what we're trying to do through our analysis is identify or estimate that effect.

287
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:50,900
The more representative the the group is, the larger the sample size is the likelihood that I'm seeing a small margin of error in

288
00:39:51,460 --> 00:40:00,290
between what the true effect is and what the measured effect is is going to reduce.

289
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,180
Right. So say again, I got the sample size of ten.

290
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,250
So the margin of error for a sample size of ten is 30.

291
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:21,030
You know, give or take 31.6%. And as you can see on this chart, the longer the larger the sample gets.

292
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:30,800
The smaller, the margin, the arrogance. But you might also notice and hope.

293
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:40,210
Oh, there we go. All right. Now I can point. So, you know, this this is a big jump from 10 to 20.

294
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,230
So, you know, that makes a big difference and gets you a smaller margin of error.

295
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:56,330
But as you go on, you can see it gets smaller and smaller and smaller so that if you have a you get to the point where you have 5000 people.

296
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,580
There's really not much of a change if you double that to 10,000 people.

297
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,470
So only a point 4% difference. So it's really not worth it to continue trying.

298
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:18,540
At some point, it's really not worth it to continue trying to increase it. This related to the p value of this it only in that it's about.

299
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,710
Yes. Yeah. One of the things that is out.

300
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,690
So the p value is kind of like the it's like a measure of.

301
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:40,879
Away from the beach. Yeah, it's kind of a measure like how likely it is actually.

302
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:49,130
Let me not say it. I'm just gonna. It's about finding the true significance because I knew I would try and explain it in a different way.

303
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,500
So, you know. Yeah.

304
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,260
Or. Oops, I'm sorry. It's a it's about probability of finding significance where there's no.

305
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:08,170
Yeah. So it is related, but things that you would consider.

306
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:22,280
So the when the population size itself is small, you know, a relatively large proportion is needed for the sample as well.

307
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:27,580
So that's another given. And here's another example.

308
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:34,810
So if you have a population size of ten.

309
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,220
So take my example where I literally only had ten participants.

310
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,730
It behooves me to get as many or to get all of those people.

311
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:53,000
But as the population size decreased or increases,

312
00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:05,420
the proportion of people that I need in the sample decreases so that if I end up evaluating a program where there were 500 total participants,

313
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,590
I only need 44% of those to.

314
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:24,129
You know, have a decent sized sample. And again, this is about level precision.

315
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:30,460
So. These are all talking about level precision.

316
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:35,020
So if I have. If I. If I.

317
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:43,280
This ten, 100% of ten is the same precision level of this 70% of 2000.

318
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,130
So when you're developing and I'm I promise you, I'm not going to test you.

319
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:04,060
I'm like, I'm mentally going through my quiz and in that test you on the on the power analysis because ultimately this is not a stats class.

320
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:11,320
And. If it was, you're all in trouble, because I cannot teach that.

321
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:19,220
I can teach methods, but sometimes the way I understand stats is not the way that you should teach that.

322
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,760
Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to get through.

323
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,660
But it makes sense to me, and it does give me the right answer, but it's a different way of thinking about it.

324
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,170
I think it's not a good way to teach it. But anyway.

325
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:41,140
You can calculate the sample size you need by doing a power analysis.

326
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,830
G Power Software Has anybody ever used you? Power software calculator the sample size.

327
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:54,530
Okay. So. I haven't used it in a while and I believe it's free.

328
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,390
But it may not be. I'm trying to free the students.

329
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:12,550
I think you can access it. But they're kind of four factors that when you are doing a power analysis, it's almost like algebra.

330
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,350
You need three of the four and it will spin out the other the other value.

331
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:25,100
That's how G power works. So the first thing you need to feed it is the alpha.

332
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,360
And so that's the probability of finding significance where there is none.

333
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:42,580
So that's what usually set the point five. Then power refers to the probability of finding the true significance.

334
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:52,229
So the kind of. Like. But I kind of think of them as like, you know, different ends of, you know,

335
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:57,150
different sides of a coin, but it's the probability of finding true significance.

336
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:05,670
And it's usually said 2.8. So those are ones that are usually fed into and they're pretty standard.

337
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:13,440
But the last two are the ones that were will often vary based on what you're doing.

338
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,240
So one is the effect that an expected effect size.

339
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,180
And you can usually pull that from a pilot study result or publish findings from a similar study.

340
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,060
Advanced sample size, which is often what you're calculating.

341
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,270
But it may be fixed, right? You may know that you only have ten people.

342
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:47,670
And so what you are doing when you run it through this analysis is identifying what effect size you're going to be able to pick up.

343
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:59,570
And that's just usually how the software works. But they will tell you again either what sample size you need to get the effect size you want,

344
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:07,870
or I will tell you with the sample you have what effect size you're going to be able to pick up and you can try and play.

345
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:15,350
You know, there's debates about whether or not you can play with the alpha or the power and adjust that.

346
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:19,280
But generally this is the except that standard.

347
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:31,400
So in terms of thinking about just sampling in general, in program evaluation, there really is no standard sample size.

348
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:40,670
We have a lot of factors that we're dealing with, including who was participating in the intervention that don't always come into

349
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:49,160
play when we are simply doing some type of observational study or other phenomena.

350
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,790
So any questions about the sample size in general?

351
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:09,730
And just know that when it comes to doing your assignment, I'm not going to ask you to do a power analysis.

352
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:17,880
But it is helpful to understand how they have at least an exposure to how these things work.

353
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,610
You may have a statistician you're working with. You want to make sure you understand what that person is doing.

354
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,480
As I said before. So we go on to probability sampling.

355
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,110
All right. So we'll talk about four strategies today.

356
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:45,330
Simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling and cluster sampling.

357
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,880
Send them. Simple, random sampling is just as it says.

358
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,130
You have. A sampling frame.

359
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:08,230
And you just sample randomly. Each unit in that sampling frame has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

360
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,630
It does require a complete sampling frame.

361
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,720
And so when you're thinking about, okay, well, how do I do this random sampling?

362
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,580
Honestly, you can see you can draw from a hat if you've only got, you know, a small group to work with.

363
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,169
But if you're working with larger populations, it's helpful just to have numbers assigned to each unit,

364
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:45,700
you know, person or school, etc., etc. and then use a random number generator off the internet.

365
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,299
And then you can, you know,

366
00:49:50,300 --> 00:50:01,820
just pull whoever you want to fall into treatment or you can pull whatever you want to be in the either control or comparison group.

367
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,470
Systematic sampling. It starts.

368
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:15,120
It's a little different. So with systematic sampling, it starts from a randomly selected point.

369
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:29,010
So maybe you have a list from 1 to 30 and you decide you're going to start at four and then pick every third person from there on.

370
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:37,540
So as you can see on here, it's the same way. So there's this group they start, it starts at number two.

371
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:46,720
Evan skips over to picks that person skips over to pick the next person, etc., etc.

372
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:56,249
Now if you're list. So remember, this is this is working off of a sampling frame.

373
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:07,710
It's working off a list. So if your list is organized in some kind of pattern that matches the interval, then the selected sample might be biased.

374
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:17,510
You know, one example, maybe you generated the sampling frame from a list of studios,

375
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:26,840
but for some weird reason does the teachers have the room and they just have the room arranged where it's like two girls and a boy?

376
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,880
Two girls and a boy. Two girls and a boy. And you decide to do every third person.

377
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,740
You just got to buy a sample. So you just have to think about that.

378
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,710
So it's best to randomize that list first before you do it.

379
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:49,120
Even if you don't. Even if you don't have a reason to suspect that it's not random.

380
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,730
It's just helpful, though. Just like we're playing cards. If you shuffle cards, you bring in cards.

381
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:00,430
From the last game, you got to shuffle off because they're already in some kind of order.

382
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,600
Well, no cards, you know, unless you want to be the one that's always drawn for.

383
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,990
So you got to shuffle. Okay.

384
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,720
I'm curious how many people how many people play in the school play, you know, or is it just like Oprah?

385
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:23,710
It's a thing. All right. Okay. I just worry about space.

386
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,500
Okay? I'm like, I'll start. I'm not going to teach kids colors for.

387
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:36,140
Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah. To use it, you know, to teach the kids colors and how to lose badly.

388
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,819
Bring them kids. Hmm. I hate playing cards.

389
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,870
My kids. They had temper tantrums. Well, I forget this.

390
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,670
You just got to learn to lose with a smile. Like, I'm not telling you where.

391
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:01,170
Just because you're my kid. Spread stratified sampling.

392
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,830
It's a good lesson. It is. They learn to lose in a good way.

393
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,630
And I gave him a hug and beat him again.

394
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:21,780
Stratified sampling. So this is where a population of interests is divided into separate groups that differ along selected characteristics.

395
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,100
Then a sample random sample is taken from each group.

396
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,070
So say, you know, I decide that I'm going to divide.

397
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,760
I almost wish I made this group, the greens and the blacks. But anyway, I should have changed the colors.

398
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,370
Pretend that the greens and the blacks. You know I'm talking about that.

399
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,590
You can talk to me after class. So you got the greens, you got the blacks.

400
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,670
You then divided everybody into these two groups.

401
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,630
Then you take a random sample from the Greens.

402
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,200
You take a random select sample from the blacks.

403
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:09,450
Now with stratified sampling, you can either do a proportionate sampling or you can do disproportionate sampling.

404
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,710
When you do a proportionate, proportionate selection. It's equal proportions sample from each group.

405
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:25,920
So if you know Mike, for example, you're going to take one third from the greens, you'll take one third from the blacks.

406
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:32,500
Disproportionate selection unequal proportion sample from each group.

407
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:41,530
So say even though in this case the Greens are smaller than the blacks, you just want to from each group.

408
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,020
That would be disproportionate selection.

409
00:54:50,930 --> 00:55:00,380
And so the thing is, you if you want the sample to reflect the true population, then you want to use proportionate selection.

410
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:09,950
If you want to know, for example, that, you know, did the intervention work better for the blacks versus the Greens?

411
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,150
You may want to oversample the blacks.

412
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:27,790
So you just have to think about, okay, do I have some analytical aims with my sampling or are some analytical considerations?

413
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:39,680
Last thing is cluster sampling and this is going to feel similar and I'll try to spell out the difference in a second.

414
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,210
With cluster sampling, the population of interest is divided into separate groups.

415
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:56,780
Then a simple random sample of clusters is selected, and you can't sample every person or unit in each selected cluster.

416
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,970
Or you can select a random sample of people or units from each selected cluster.

417
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:09,260
And typically, cluster sampling is used when you already have some preexisting cluster.

418
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:19,110
Perfect example is schools. If you're working with kids, kids are already clustered into schools.

419
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:30,410
It's a readymade group. And so cluster sampling can be helpful when you don't have a list of everyone in the the population of interest,

420
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,330
but you still want the advantages of doing probability sampling.

421
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:45,220
So it it is it feels in some ways very similar to stratified sampling.

422
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,320
But the difference between the two is that the stratified sampling,

423
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:58,060
you're all you're typically clustering people or stratifying them based on some characteristics.

424
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,340
You know it can be. Race it can be.

425
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:12,930
Age is typically done specifically so that you can have some representation across these different groups.

426
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:25,940
Cluster sampling again is just taking its often taking advantage of preexisting clusters, but then you're sampling within those preexisting clusters.

427
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,800
So half the time it's when you don't, you know, again.

428
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:40,680
The population of interest is already clustered in some way, especially if it's related to what you're doing.

429
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:48,390
If you're doing an intervention with school age youth across a district or across a county,

430
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,500
you might, you know, use cluster sampling because they're already in the schools.

431
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,510
Does that make sense, that difference?

432
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:13,610
So when you use each strategy so simple, random sampling is one best use when you are sampling from a relatively small population.

433
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:22,910
Systematic sampling is best used when you are sampling from a large population and

434
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:28,310
if you have a stream of eligible people who are available or will be available.

435
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:37,400
Stratified sampling is best. When you have specifics, you're interested in specific subgroups.

436
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:44,180
Again, you want to know, did the intervention work better for the Greens than they did for the Blacks?

437
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:52,100
Or vice versa? Or there's some characteristic that you know is related to the outcome of interests.

438
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:04,180
And then finally, cluster sampling is best used when the population groups that are separated already and access to all is difficult.

439
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:12,920
You know, again, located in different cities. You and I mentioned the schools at schools in different cities.

440
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,440
Bless you.

441
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:24,540
And then similarly, when you're working with nested populations and so massive populations are simply populations that are already clustered.

442
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:31,380
So students are nested in schools. Grad students are nested in big lecture halls.

443
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:39,050
And then also cluster sampling is best used again when there's no complete sampling frame available.

444
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:45,799
You know, maybe. There's a lot of missing contact information, for example.

445
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:52,910
And so you can't complete that list. But you, again, want the benefits of probability sampling.

446
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,160
And I will say that cluster sampling. So I think.

447
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:13,500
Like if you've worked a lot in community based organizations, especially with transient populations, you know, phone numbers change every week.

448
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:24,250
Addresses change every week. So it's not you know, it's not a far fetched option that you just won't be able to complete your list.

449
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:34,570
Any questions before I summarize, and then I'll spend the next the rest of class talking about other stuff.

450
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,070
All right. Right. You know, hanging in there. And again, I want to make sure that.

451
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:52,340
First. If this is new to you, it's probably like. But.

452
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,270
You know, I try to keep. I'm not expecting you to, like, completely understand everything.

453
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:12,210
When you walk out of this class, the important thing is that you understand the logic behind how our valuations are done.

454
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:24,380
And so hopefully doing the evaluation plan will also help help some of this information stick because you're applying it to something,

455
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,770
even if it's an intervention that you are just kind of making up as you go to write the paper.

456
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,730
So in summary sampling, we're taking the subset out of a larger population.

457
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:51,000
When we sample, we have a sampling frame. That's the list of people who are assessable that are part of the population.

458
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:54,510
So you need that for probability sampling approaches?

459
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,860
Not so much for non probability. Two approaches.

460
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:07,540
Probability and probability and then probability sampling strategies are helpful when

461
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:13,990
we are really aiming for our evaluations to be generalized to larger populations.

462
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,410
All right. So we're going to go on to the quiz.

463
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:28,910
So for the people who emailed me, it turns out that the questions were not about these questions.

464
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:38,510
So I'm going to email you directly. So whether you're here or here, I will respond to you today.

465
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:46,160
But I did notice when I looked at the metric, when I looked at the stats from the quiz,

466
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,420
that there were two questions in particular where there's a lot of variation.

467
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,720
So I just wanted to bring those to the class. Um.

468
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:59,030
The first one was this one.

469
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:05,690
Which of the following threats to external validity would you be most wary of with a single time series?

470
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:11,980
Design Panzer. No thieves.

471
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:23,480
Somebody took their pants. Now that the pin that goes with this computer.

472
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,219
A lot of you are new to the building, so you may not realize that people steal stuff.

473
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,540
That's why everything is is locked down. Man.

474
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,929
People just. You see it? Yeah. Oh.

475
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:44,520
Seattle. Oh, yeah.

476
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:49,160
Yeah. I would like to live in my house. Where is it?

477
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:53,360
It's right there. Where? Well, I'll do it anyway.

478
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:03,080
So remember. Remember that a single time serious design is multiple observations.

479
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,970
Before a program. And before or after a program.

480
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:21,950
Yeah. It's intervention. And then the holes are the observations.

481
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,980
So the question was, what's the thread that you would be most concerned about?

482
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:39,850
Now, the reason why the answer is testing and treatment is because say that the test is actually causing is contributing to the effect.

483
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,010
So you're going to see that you're going to see a problem there.

484
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,220
I mean, you're going to it's going to have an impact there. It's going to have an impact there.

485
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:57,230
And so on. That's why the response is interaction with testing and treatment.

486
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:04,440
Now, that doesn't mean that the rest of these threats are not problematic.

487
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:14,849
It's just that the one that you're most concerned about is the one that's directly impact, that's directly related to the design of a time series.

488
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:22,230
A time series works because the idea of the Time series is that you're taking the same test over and over and over again.

489
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:30,650
So if the test is is is part of the the test is part of the reason why the intervention is effective.

490
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,880
Then you're going to have a big problem when you remove. All the test.

491
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,360
Your results are going to be misleading.

492
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:54,110
Because now you just removed what turns out to possibly be an important part of the intervention that that people are taking these tests.

493
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:01,320
So that's why the that's the problem that that's why is the problem with generalizability.

494
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:08,410
But again. You should be wary of these other things.

495
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,440
Selection of treatments, setting and treatment, multiple treatments.

496
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:18,680
But this is the prob. This is the biggest problem here. With a time series.

497
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:30,040
Especially since you don't have a comparison group. So you can't even you can't even, in fact, try to see analytically was it to test?

498
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,660
So the second question that in this one was 42%.

499
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:40,500
I was like, Ooh. So I had to really sit with it.

500
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:48,290
And I'm like, okay, so you run a drug abuse prevention education for high school youth.

501
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:53,120
You decide to commission evaluation of the program because some community members.

502
01:06:54,380 --> 01:07:01,220
Ask the school board not to fund because they read previous studies about the DARE program and you believe it's a good fit.

503
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:07,370
So what's consideration best fit? The purpose best fits the purpose of this evaluation.

504
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:15,800
So the right answer was information needs. And that is the one I deemed correct because previous studies.

505
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:25,050
We're saying that it wasn't effective. So you need information to challenge that and that attitude.

506
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:32,879
But again, I know this that's a 42% and then I forget what it was and then write it down here.

507
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,820
But a lot of you said stakeholders. And so I rewrote it again.

508
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:45,900
I kept reading it and I said, Oh, so this is if anybody wants to be a teacher, these are the things you have to watch out for.

509
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:53,730
I read it again and I said, Oh, they probably zero in on this one because the school board is complaining.

510
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,730
So they check stakeholders. I said, okay, that's reasonable.

511
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:06,070
That makes sense to me. And I didn't make sure I eliminated that potential interpretation.

512
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:16,260
So I went back. Hopefully technology wise, I did it right and made it so that if you picked stakeholders,

513
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:23,270
you get credit for the question and you should still have credit if you checked information these.

514
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:36,590
Now if you chose stage and equity. Unfortunately, there's nothing.

515
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:41,930
There wasn't anything I felt that suggested that that would be the best fit.

516
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,100
Now may fit, but it's not the best fit.

517
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:53,990
But there's certainly a strong argument that stakeholders is the best fit and information needs is the best fit.

518
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:59,780
So hopefully from a technology perspective, we did I did it right.

519
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,190
I've admitted that campus is not my friend.

520
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:12,640
So you should see that at best. You should see that change. All right.

521
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:21,510
Any questions about that? And by the way, for the most part, the rest of the questions, I think the lowest I saw was 75% correct.

522
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:28,890
So I wasn't worried about those, but I did want to make sure I highlighted the two that were under that.

523
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:35,270
All right. So next. Is that next assignment?

524
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,750
All right. Right. Make that go away.

525
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:48,330
I have no notes, so I wanted to make sure I started off because we got questions about this already through email.

526
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:57,030
The evaluation plan template, meaning the CDC template, the one that follows the CDC requirements.

527
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:04,890
It's only a guide to respond to the requirements below because there are questions in the template.

528
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:12,580
The. But I'm not expecting you to respond to all of those questions.

529
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:22,800
Rather those are. Helpful thinking questions that help respond to what are the requirements for this class.

530
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:32,080
So even if there's something in the valuation template. Trying to think of a good example, like take like big tables.

531
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:42,850
I think tables are helpful. But if if it doesn't say that you have to do it in the assignment description, you don't need to do it.

532
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:53,380
So I just want to make sure that's clear. So what that's in that that means now and at the end of the class.

533
01:10:54,580 --> 01:11:03,400
So again, the for the final paper. That will also reflect what's expected of you and not the template.

534
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,590
But the questions are helpful. Right. So I want to keep them.

535
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:20,330
I just want you. I wanted you to have access to them. So for but for this assignment, the data collection plan is.

536
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:24,710
It should include both the process and outcome evaluation.

537
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:33,149
So you're going to come up with 1 to 2 process evaluation questions to the three outcome.

538
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:38,070
Evaluate questions for a total of 3 to 5 evaluation questions.

539
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:43,719
I've said it before and I said it. I'll say it again. It is.

540
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,000
Especially if you don't feel that confident.

541
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:55,720
It is better to have less questions because every question means needs a response in terms of planning for it.

542
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:03,550
So it's better to keep the questions low versus high.

543
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:08,319
You won't get any extra credit with us if you have five questions.

544
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,150
But the but the plan for answering those questions is not solid.

545
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,990
So you first want in this assignment. That's coming up.

546
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:30,650
I want to describe the purpose. So you want the purpose statement as it was presented in class?

547
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,850
So. Program relevant decision makers.

548
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,000
Information to be shared. Decisions to be made.

549
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:48,210
Then you want to make sure that your purpose statement is reflecting that, and then you want connect it.

550
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,610
Question So you want to make sure that the questions are relevant to the purpose.

551
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,440
So one the two process to the three outcome questions.

552
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:12,240
When you write about the process of evaluation, this is where you're going to describe what you're doing in the process evaluation.

553
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:21,260
The thing that we're going to make sure we look for is that you identify process indicators.

554
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:26,980
You know. We were giving you a page.

555
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:33,820
A page two. A page and a half. Not because you're just going to write indicators in a really big font.

556
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:34,120
I mean,

557
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:43,960
you still need to describe like the basic methods that you're going to go about in terms of answering the process evaluation question or questions.

558
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:52,500
But we will. You know, you need to make sure you have some kind of process indicators that are connected to your questions.

559
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:02,840
In contrast, the outcome evaluation has a bit more explanation,

560
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:10,850
in part because we've talked about different things that are more relevant to process, I mean to outcome evaluations.

561
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:20,959
So you'll have to specify and justify research design as well as using the design notation for the proposal.

562
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,470
Study design. I think it's.

563
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:38,370
Easier to create the graphic in some separate file and then put the picture into the plan that you submit.

564
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,920
I'm only saying that is because I've had examples where students.

565
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:53,500
Might have a treatment and a comparison group, but because word doesn't let you do things like that smoothly, it ends up warping it.

566
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,719
So then we have to come back and say, Did was it supposed to look like this?

567
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,120
So it's better if you just put it in as a graphic.

568
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:09,520
Describe your proposal's research design and how those are going to answer your outcome evaluation questions.

569
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:15,690
Internal and external validity. Proposed research design.

570
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:22,470
So we're going to want to see that you're discussing some threats and why they're a threat.

571
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,850
So if you say history and maturation are a threat.

572
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:33,100
To internal validity. Make sure you at least write a sentence about why those are threats.

573
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:36,260
Don't just say history and maturation are threats.

574
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,400
Because again, this is about under, you know. Exhibiting your understanding.

575
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,100
You want to describe and justify the sampling approach you'll use to conduct your outcome evaluation?

576
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:55,440
Again, we just talked about inclusion or exclusion criteria.

577
01:15:55,860 --> 01:16:02,280
So you're going to you know, if you say that this sample is a sample of school age youth.

578
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:08,580
You know, does that include high school students? Does it exclude high school students?

579
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:15,030
Does it include students based on geography?

580
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:21,149
So you want to make sure that you are clear about when you say the population,

581
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:27,870
that it's clear who's included as well as who might be there but is excluded.

582
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:35,550
So think about the example I just said. With the Girls Empowerment Program, we're excluding anybody who lives outside the Ban Harbor.

583
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,600
You also want to talk about how you would recruit participants.

584
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,000
Again, this is more like a sentence or two.

585
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:53,200
You need to go into we are going to work with Judy, who is the secretary, and keeps track of all the data on our participants.

586
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:58,750
You can just say we are going to work from a list of participants.

587
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:06,130
And then you again want to identify outcome indicators that will help you answer the questions.

588
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:18,270
And you have up to two and a half pages. I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest on page counting.

589
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:27,050
I only know this when it's really short. Or when it's really, really long now if it's really, really long.

590
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:34,330
You're not going to lose points or anything, but. I'm also then going to think about, okay,

591
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:41,440
is this person really being concise or are they just being wordy in the way of covering up that they don't exactly know what they're trying to say?

592
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:47,670
So just keep that in mind. The methods should.

593
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:55,170
So you'll describe the methods after. So you should include at least one quantitative and one qualitative method each.

594
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,920
And it doesn't matter necessarily where you put those.

595
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:05,620
So you could do all a process called qualitative.

596
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:14,720
Or you can mix it up. But in order to be able to speak to some of these things, you're going to need.

597
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:20,490
Some quantitative here. On the outcome evaluation part.

598
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,130
Sampling strategy, you have one page. Yeah.

599
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:33,730
That's an excellent. And so you describe the sampling frame and the sampling approach.

600
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,340
You don't need to collect or calculate sample size.

601
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:41,420
You know, as I said earlier, I don't need to do a power analysis.

602
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:52,730
Okay. Then when you describe your methods with quantitative,

603
01:18:53,690 --> 01:19:01,730
you want to talk about what mode or modes of data collection will you use to collect your data in the assignment?

604
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:08,460
And I talk about are computer aided approaches.

605
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:15,270
Those are the ones that start with see a. I decided not to teach on those just to keep it simple.

606
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:21,710
So don't you know, just know that, like, if it's a C, a CI.

607
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:30,590
Don't worry about that. You just need to at the level of is it mail, web, phone or face to face or, you know,

608
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:39,210
paper versus web if it's multimodal, like, for example, you're going to do both paper and web.

609
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:43,760
You just need to share that you're going to do both.

610
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:51,320
But we're also we're also we're thinking more about your rationale for the choice of data collection method.

611
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:58,070
So you want to speak to why do you think that makes sense? So if you do pick paper and the web.
