1
00:00:00,913 --> 00:00:05,965
In this session, we'll learn about Pedigrees and Modes of Inheritance.

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:10,189
Learning objectives are to define Mendel's laws of segregation and

3
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,705
independent assortment, to recognize common human pedigree symbols,

4
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:19,656
to describe the most common modes of inheritance which are autosomal dominant,

5
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:22,680
autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,945
And to identify the attributes of these common modes of inheritance and

7
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,091
human pedigrees.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,761
Remember Mendel's law of segregation,

9
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:36,191
which states that organisms carry two copies of each genetic factor, and

10
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:41,960
that there's segregation of parental factors during the formation of gametes.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,272
Even though each parent carries two copies of the genetic factor,

12
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:50,440
each gamete receives only one genetic factor from each parent.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,777
For example, this parent is heterocyclic as they carry a big S allele and

14
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,110
a small s allele.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,037
However, each of their gametes will only have a S or a s.

16
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:14,453
We can look at meiosis to see how gametes are formed in human cells.

17
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:18,886
In meiosis, you have one copy of the allele that you got from,

18
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:22,830
say mom and one copy of the allele that you got from dad.

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,328
These are just showing two chromosomes, the red one from mom,

20
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:27,584
the blue one from dad.

21
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,952
During meiosis, each of these chromosomes is replicated and

22
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,460
joined at the centromere.

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,655
Now you have two copies of the chromosome from mom joined together and

24
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:40,070
two copies of the chromosome from dad joined together.

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,800
These meet at the midline and

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,270
are pulled apart into daughter cells by spindle fibers.

27
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,683
Here you can see that the maternal chromosomes have gone together into one

28
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:52,660
cell, and the paternal have gone into another.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,203
This is the segregation right here where all the biggest alleles go to one side and

30
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:01,240
the smallest go to the other side.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,540
Finally, those two chromosomes are further pulled apart and the gametes, the eggs or

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,378
sperm each have one copy of each of the genetic factors or each allele.

33
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:22,794
In thinking through pedigrees and trying to understand how genetic diseases or

34
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:28,134
traits are distributed throughout a family, we can use some different

35
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:33,040
symbols to help us recognize what's happening within a family.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,740
The squares we usually use to annotate males.

37
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,569
The circles are females.

38
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,370
A lot of times you'll see with respect to a genetic disease of interest.

39
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,320
If the box is unshaded, it means the person doesn't have the disease or trait.

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,380
And if the box is shaded, the person does have it.

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,737
So white would be unaffected and gray would be affected.

42
00:02:56,737 --> 00:03:00,902
Sometimes, there's a box that is partially shaded and

43
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:06,960
sometimes that can indicate, for example, that the person is heterozygous.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,830
So this would be respect to some kind of genotype.

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,426
So they carry one copy of the disease causing allele and

46
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:18,286
one copy of the normal allele, but they themselves would be unaffected.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
Over here, I'm showing you when someone is deceased,

48
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,887
they usually have a line through a diamond indicates that the sex is unspecified.

49
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,594
This could be a pregnancy or

50
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:38,201
an early loss of pregnancy where they don't know the sex or

51
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:44,331
that the information in the pedigree just is missing sex for that one person.

52
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,641
The line joining two boxes or I'm sorry,

53
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:54,280
a box in a circle would be the mating of unrelated individuals.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,510
This slash indicates that there was a severed relationship.

55
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,692
And if there are two lines, it indicates a concerning consanguineous mating,

56
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,791
which we'll talk about later.

57
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:12,131
The proband is the individual who the family came to your attention through.

58
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:17,105
So if you're say a genetic counselor, the proband would be the person who comes into

59
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:21,260
your office and says, I have a genetic disease that runs in my family.

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,320
I want to know the risk of transmitting this disease to my kids.

61
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,150
Can we draw my pedigree?

62
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,671
That would be the proband.

63
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,710
Each person in the pedigree has a generation and a number.

64
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,958
The generations are usually labeled with roman numerals starting with I,

65
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,390
II, III, IV and V.

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,057
This is the first generation or the oldest people in the pedigree, and

67
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:49,228
at the bottom is the last generation.

68
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,120
People in each generation are labeled with Arabic numerals.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,760
So here you've got generation one and it has a male and a female.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,588
The first person in the pedigree is labeled one and

71
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:05,560
the second person is labeled two.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,599
And for each generation you can see that there are Arabic numerals

73
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:15,930
in order from people in the pedigree growing from left to right here.

74
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,445
This line indicates that these people had a mating and

75
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,780
the children of those matings are indicated here.

76
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,810
There's a child here, a child here and a child here.

77
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,850
This child got married to someone else and they had children.

78
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,430
So generation three are the grandchildren of generation one.

79
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,950
Now we're going to talk about Modes of Inheritance.

80
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,936
There are four major modes of inheritance, autosomal dominant,

81
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:52,510
autosomal recessive, sex-linked dominant and sex-linked recessive.

82
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,466
All of these modes of inheritance follow Mendel's law of segregation

83
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:02,210
because they're involving only one genetic factor.

84
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,640
There are other types of inheritance that involve more than one genetic factor.

85
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,837
For example, polygenic inheritance where it involves multiple genes or

86
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,900
multiple genetic factors, and multifactorial inheritance which can

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,510
involve multiple genetic factors as well as other things like the environment.

88
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,223
Polygenic and

89
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:25,151
multifactorial inheritance use Mendel's laws of independent assortment.

90
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,043
Mendel's law of independent assortment applies when there is more than one

91
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:34,060
genetic factor that is being inherited.

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,360
It states that when gametes are formed, genetic factors or

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,260
the alleles will assort independently from one another.

94
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,390
So here this is a picture of two different characteristics of Mendel seeds.

95
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,770
One of the characteristics is color.

96
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,157
You can have the Y allele which stands for yellow or

97
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:58,870
you can have the y allele which codes for green.

98
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,966
You can have the R allele which codes for round the seed shape,

99
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:09,480
round or the r allele that codes for the seed shape wrinkled.

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,209
If you look at this matrix, you can see that because of independent assortment,

101
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,401
the yellow characteristic and

102
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:22,310
the smooth characteristic assort independently from one another.

103
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,484
And you end up with seeds that are 3:1 ratio of yellow to green,

104
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:34,300
and a 3:1 ratio of smooth to wrinkled.

105
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,027
And that's because yellow and round are both dominant traits,

106
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:44,597
and green and wrinkled are both recessive traits.

107
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:49,794
In the end though, what I want you to understand is that round and

108
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:55,872
yellow assort independently from each other in the formation of gametes.

109
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,310
Okay, let's talk about the different modes of transmission.

110
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,964
We're going to talk about autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and

111
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,950
sex-linked recessive.

112
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,618
We're not going to talk about sex-linked dominant because

113
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:17,469
that mode of inheritance is very difficult to distinguish from

114
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:21,209
autosomal dominant in pedigrees, and it's also not very common.

115
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,537
So autosomal dominant transmission states that individuals who inherit

116
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:31,530
the dominant disease allele D will develop the disease.

117
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,510
Anyone who inherits that allele will get the disease.

118
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,059
So here you've got a mother and a father and this is showing their chromosomes.

119
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,801
This mother carries a D allele and a d allele at some genetic locus.

120
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,431
The mother has the disease because she carries a copy of the D allele.

121
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,431
Here the father also has the disease.

122
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,237
He carries one copy of the D allele.

123
00:08:55,237 --> 00:09:00,131
If these two people, for example, have children,

124
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:05,138
you can get this D allele chromosome going to the child

125
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:10,368
through the mother's gamete there, or you can get the d

126
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:15,729
allele going to the child through the mother's gamete.

127
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,351
And for the father, the same thing is true.

128
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,312
And there are four different possible combinations,

129
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,260
all which would be equally likely.

130
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,610
So the child inherits a D allele from mom and a D allele from dad because

131
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,670
they have at least one copy they're affected with the disease.

132
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,396
And because they have the same alleles, they're called homozygous,

133
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:37,901
which means the same.

134
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,680
This child on the end inherited a d from mom and a d from dad.

135
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,410
They're also homozygous, but they're unaffected.

136
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,018
They don't have the disease because they don't carry a D disease allele.

137
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:57,567
These two in the middle that got a D from mom and a d from dad,

138
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:03,698
or a d from mom and a D from dad are called heterozygous affected.

139
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:07,021
They're affected because they have a copy of the disease allele.

140
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:12,606
But they're heterozygous because they have two different alleles.

141
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:17,223
Each of these children has equal probability if the mother and

142
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:19,632
father are both heterozygous.

143
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:26,201
Here's an example of a pedigree of an autosomal dominant disease.

144
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:33,286
This is a disease called polycystic kidney disease that runs in families.

145
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:37,770
Usually the disease is diagnosed later in life and

146
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,507
it results from complications of cysts or

147
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:47,130
fluid filled bubbles that are forming on your kidney.

148
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,331
So this is the grandparent generation here, you have a female who is pp.

149
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:54,758
So she do not carry a dominant disease allele.

150
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,590
You have a grandfather here who's Pp.

151
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,555
So he's heterozygous and he carries the disease allele P.

152
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:08,820
He was diagnosed at age 50 and has since been deceased.

153
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,806
That's why he's filled in in gray because he has the disease or

154
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,014
the genotype that will lead to disease.

155
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:21,219
Here, he's got a son and a daughter who have

156
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:25,659
both been diagnosed with the disease allele.

157
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,106
They have been diagnosed with having the disease and

158
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:35,274
they both are married to people who do not carry that allele.

159
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:35,330
Here, we have people where you know the genotype, this person is Pp.

160
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:45,125
They were diagnosed at age 27 now their age 29.

161
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,350
Here, this person is also Pp.

162
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,292
These two individuals, we know they got a p from their mom but we don't know if

163
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:58,481
they got a P or a p from their dad because they haven't yet developed the disease.

164
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,708
This person here maybe was the proband who came into the clinic and

165
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,720
we indicate that by an arrow.

166
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,220
This person was diagnosed really young at age 15 and

167
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,800
also is heterozygous for the disease.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,606
We know that this person inherited a p from their dad but

169
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:19,343
we don't know yet if they have a P or a p from their mom.

170
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,064
The characteristics of autosomal dominant diseases or

171
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:30,571
traits is that every affected individual has an affected parent,

172
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:36,740
because the person inheriting the disease allele had to get it from somewhere.

173
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,181
There's a 50% chance that each affected parent will transmit the trait to

174
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,880
any child.

175
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,789
The trait is expressed in both males and females in roughly equal numbers.

176
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:51,283
Two affected individuals can have unaffected children if they

177
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,731
are heterozygous.

178
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:57,341
The probability of them having unaffected children would be one in four.

179
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:02,057
And the trait or phenotype is often more severe in those that

180
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:06,696
are homozygous affected than in heterozygous affected.

181
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:10,562
Also sometimes the home sickness affected or

182
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:14,750
two copies of the D allele for example is lethal.

183
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,770
Some commonly known autosomal dominant diseases include Huntington's disease and

184
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,621
the contemplation dwarfism.

185
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,750
Another common mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive transmission.

186
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,259
Here you have individuals that inherit two copies of the recessive allele,

187
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,290
d and only they will develop the disease.

188
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,162
So anyone who has at least one copy of the dominant non

189
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:44,670
disease causing allele will not be affected by the disease.

190
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,385
So here again, you've got a mother and father who are both heterozygous for

191
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:50,055
example.

192
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:54,798
They do not have the disease because they have at least one dominant allele

193
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,721
that is non disease causing.

194
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:59,968
From this mating there are four possible children.

195
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:06,636
You can have a DD, or two different ways to get Dd.

196
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:11,297
All of these are normal in in the sense that they're not affected

197
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:13,204
with the trader disease.

198
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:17,524
These are what we call carriers because they have one copy of the non disease

199
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,141
allele and one copy of the recessive allele.

200
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,974
So they don't show the disease themselves but

201
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:25,606
they could transmit it to an offspring.

202
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:31,100
And here you have the homozygous affected dd.

203
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,068
This is the only person in the family that would actually be affected by the disease

204
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:39,888
because they have two copies of the recessive disease allele.

205
00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:45,620
Here's an example of an autosomal recessive pedigree.

206
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,520
In the first generation, you have individuals who are heterosexual.

207
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
So neither one of them have the disease.

208
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,630
They can have children who are homozygous normal, heterozygous or affected.

209
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,329
So this individual is affected because they have two copies of the disease

210
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:02,948
allele.

211
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:07,317
If they mate with somebody who has no copies of the disease allele,

212
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:12,481
all of their children will be unaffected and all of them will be heterozygous.

213
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,518
But again, if you have a mating between two heterozygotes,

214
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,183
you can actually get homozygous dominant and

215
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:27,510
unaffected heterozygous or homozygous affected individuals.

216
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,927
If you have a homozygous affected individual that mates with another one,

217
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,702
all of their children will be affected.

218
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:39,065
This example shows the inheritance pattern of an autosomal recessive disease.

219
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:43,707
For example, albinism in a family.

220
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,608
Autosomal recessive characteristics are for

221
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:53,730
rare traits most affected individuals are the children of unaffected parents.

222
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,075
Because a lot of times you'll get two parents that are heterozygous,

223
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:01,180
they may and they have an affected child.

224
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,083
All of the children of two affected or homozygous individuals will be affected.

225
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:11,840
The risk of an affected child from a mating of two heterozygotes is 25%.

226
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,740
The trait is expressed in both males and females roughly equally.

227
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,073
And for rare traits,

228
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:22,199
the unaffected parents of an affected individual could be related to each other.

229
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,373
We'll learn more about that when we study concerning consanguineous mating or

230
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,627
mating between two individuals who are related.

231
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:35,654
Commonly known autosomal recessive diseases include Tay-Sachs disease,

232
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:40,691
Cystic fibrosis and Phenylketonuria all of which we'll learn about later.

233
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,463
The last mode of inheritance that we'll talk about is X-linked recessive

234
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,860
transmission.

235
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,037
Here you have a situation where the disease allele is on the X chromosome.

236
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:58,568
Females that carry a recessive mutation on their X chromosome can have

237
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,280
affected male children.

238
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,774
For example, here, you've got the mother,

239
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:08,524
she's got one non disease allele on one of her X chromosomes and

240
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:12,640
the disease allele on her other X chromosome.

241
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,904
Let's say that she's a carrier and that she mates with someone who is unaffected.

242
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:24,872
The father has a regular X chromosome and a Y chromosome because males are XY.

243
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:30,566
Here, there are four possible children XX which are normal female,

244
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:36,580
XY which is normal male, X with the mutation and X without the mutation.

245
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,291
This female is a carrier just like her mom.

246
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,860
She's not affected but she could have affected sons.

247
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,360
And here is an affected male.

248
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,630
They've inherited the X chromosome with the mutation from the mom, and

249
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,780
they don't have any other X chromosome to act as the dominant allele.

250
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,540
So for females to get this X-linked recessive disease,

251
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,430
they need to have two copies of the affected X chromosome.

252
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,844
But for males to get the disease they only have to have one copy

253
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:16,427
because they don't have another X to act as the dominant allele here.

254
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,840
Here you have an example of an X-linked recessive of pedigree.

255
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,071
In this example, you have a female who is not a carrier.

256
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,293
She is actually unaffected and

257
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:32,650
has two copies of the regular X chromosome without the mutation.

258
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,401
Here you have an affected male.

259
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,987
You can see that they're in gray.

260
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:41,372
They have one copy of the mutation and a Y chromosome.

261
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:48,156
Every female will have one copy of the regular X from mom and

262
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:53,705
one copy of the affected X chromosome from dad.

263
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:57,649
So they'll all be heterozygous and unaffected.

264
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:04,576
So this daughter, this daughter and this daughter are all heterozygous unaffected.

265
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,738
Males will always have the regular X from mom and the Y from dad.

266
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:13,355
So everyone in this generation will be unaffected.

267
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,140
However carrier females can have affected sons.

268
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,380
In this example, you've got a carrier female.

269
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,452
And she can either give X chromosome without the mutation or

270
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:30,417
an X chromosome with the mutation to her sons.

271
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:34,780
Here she's given the X chromosome without the mutation to both of her sons.

272
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,402
And here she is transmitted the X chromosome with the mutation to this son

273
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,630
and they got a Y from their dad.

274
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,601
So that means that this son is affected, and here is a carrier female.

275
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:51,620
Over here, you can also see that the same thing has happened.

276
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,011
This parent has contributed her affected X chromosome to both of her sons.

277
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,822
This example shows the inheritance of an X-linked recessive

278
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:05,979
disease like color blindness in a family.

279
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:11,061
With X-linked recessive diseases, there is no male to male transmission but

280
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:13,100
there is mother to son transmission.

281
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:17,855
And females can be homozygous for the mutation and

282
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:24,056
have the trait that means they have two copies of the affected X allele.

283
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:29,259
Commonly known X-linked recessive diseases including hemophilia and

284
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:35,160
color blindness which affects about 8% of males and about 0.4% of females.

285
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,872
Color blindness affects many more males than females because it

286
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:44,322
only takes one copy of the mutation to get the disease in males

287
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:47,845
where it takes two copies to get the disease in females.

288
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,040
I also wanted to mention complementation.

289
00:20:52,040 --> 00:21:00,226
This is a situation where two different genes can cause the same disease.

290
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:06,704
Here in the first family we've got parents who are heterozygous for

291
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:13,988
a recessive allele a, that causes the disease of for example hearing loss.

292
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:18,189
At a second locus that also causes hearing loss,

293
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:22,907
these parents have two copies of the dominant allele.

294
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,183
When they have children, they can have affected children.

295
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:32,254
The genotypes of those affected children are going to be aa, BB.

296
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:36,332
Because there are no copies of the recessive allele for

297
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:39,612
the parents to give them for the B locus, but

298
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,667
they've inherited the recessive allele at the A locus.

299
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:49,442
In the second family, you have parents who are homozygous

300
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:54,102
at the A locus, but heterozygous at the B locus.

301
00:21:54,102 --> 00:22:00,660
So they have recessive copies of the B allele.

302
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,474
A child who has hearing loss that are born to these parents has dominant alleles for

303
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:09,855
the A gene and recessive alleles for the B gene.

304
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:13,853
So here the A gene is causing this child's hearing loss and

305
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:17,294
the B gene is causing this child's hearing loss.

306
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,673
When they have children because they're hearing losses caused by

307
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,635
different genetic factors.

308
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:28,516
And they're both autosomal recessive in their mode of inheritance all

309
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:31,444
of their children will be heterozygous for

310
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:35,201
both of those genes, but they will be all unaffected.

311
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,535
This is a really interesting situation because a lot of times there are genetic

312
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:47,983
traits that are culturally cause people to be attracted to each other.

313
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:52,823
So for example, people who have hearing loss are part of the deafness

314
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:57,997
community and they meet other people who are deaf and they fall in love with

315
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:03,016
other people who are deaf and they share that characteristic or trait.

316
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:06,266
And so a lot of times when these people mate and have kids,

317
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:10,020
both of the parents are deaf, but all of their children can hear.

318
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,447
And so that creates an interesting social situation for

319
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:17,754
those parents and children to navigate.

320
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:24,053
So in this lecture we've learned about some common modes of inheritance.

321
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,868
In real life, things can be a little bit more complicated than that.

322
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:30,687
There are new mutations in different generations.

323
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:36,853
There are other things like a prosthesis, which means that your genotype

324
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:42,929
at one gene can sort of overshadow the genotype you have at another gene.

325
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,948
So there are different things that can happen.

326
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:50,921
That means that these modes of inheritance aren't always followed exactly in

327
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:52,352
human pedigrees, but

328
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:57,640
I think that they're useful as examples to help us learn about inheritance to start
