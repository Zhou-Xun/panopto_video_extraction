1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,020
I know you're defending the terms that we distribute here, she said.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah, but I see you're aware you're inside the black hole.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,640
Actually, no, I am. I am in the black hole, not Matron.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,910
So how are you doing? I'm good. Are you coming into classes of whatever has to be said?

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,890
I'm going to announce that I am.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,090
So I thought, David, in this meeting, this is not going to go well using that sort of like a oh in the [INAUDIBLE] zoom meeting as well.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,210
So I'm just going to go. And I said, Hey, what do I think do? And he said, It is so everything is automatic.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm like you said, it's such a record automatically. I just never done.

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,340
I said I'd just like figure out like, yeah, but we didn't know what to do.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,850
So based on this recent grant for like an hour, it's not offered as an academy for me.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,850
So I went to see what kind of make it work, you figure?

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:13,050
And I'm glad you were able to talk with Shirley. She was like, Can you actually, this is like it's almost like a check.

13
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,040
Yeah. But I also got called a lot of times on various occasions.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,100
I don't know if this thing on it is showing. Okay. Yeah, I mean, rankings, right?

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,190
Yeah. This is my first day presenting live in 30 months because this Michigan time

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,459
that you guys are doing Michigan time is they stopped it like three years.

17
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,980
Like, I know, but no, but so I'm supposed to start in a little bit. Is this what we expect, our stragglers or what we expected?

18
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,590
Stragglers are some folks on Zoom. People always come in late and stuff.

19
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,140
So you all know the difference between capitation and service, right? Right.

20
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,810
You all know the difference between capitation fee for service. Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,179
No, I'm. I'm capitated, so I don't have to work, but I would start now.

22
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,690
But I'm not. I'm going to wait till you guys say Mark start looking forward to that.

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,070
Yeah, I kind of have that. I kind of felt that you're going to come talk to somebody.

24
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:22,870
David was kind of. I'll give you a hug now.

25
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,090
So cool. Great to see you. Yeah, you do. Let me write my numbers.

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,830
I know you want to meet again. I don't.

27
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,850
Good doing this. I mean,

28
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:43,349
I think the signs are I'm worried about is it makes sense in some around how do you think that's working that's like I see that's

29
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,590
my problem is I don't know if we're actually you know I think that I think yeah there's an option but yeah I don't think yeah.

30
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,849
People think we're okay. Yeah. I think if David Hutton said we'd be okay.

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,450
So I'm hoping that you are. He said just technical tips.

32
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,720
All right. I sure do want you to talk yet. Now I'm hundred percent sure.

33
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,400
Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Let's think. I think.

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,490
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

35
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:25,720
I'm thrilled to be my first in-person lecture in 30 months, so I apologize for a bit of rust and I can't call you if you can't call me back.

36
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:33,820
I'm Mark Foundry. I am professor at the medical school and have been adjunct professor here in HMV for 30 years.

37
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,630
It's great to be in this setting.

38
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,420
I want to let you know that I'm supposed to be here for 90 minutes.

39
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,800
That's not going to be the case unless you want me to be here. Always excited to speak to David's class.

40
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:56,709
This is like my 11th year or something along those lines. I'm going to tell you about my journey with value based insurance design,

41
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,930
which is really why this fits so nicely in this class is like applied cost effective analysis,

42
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,830
although I would never use that in any setting outside of here.

43
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:14,470
It is my goal to hear from each and every one of you. I will ask really easy questions of which you can ask yes or no and check your box.

44
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
And then I'll be very clear.

45
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:25,750
As David knows, I've had this thing for my 30 years of the further you sit away from me is the likely highest likelihood that you get called on by me.

46
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,710
So you guys are off the hook? Most likely. And those of you in the back.

47
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,180
Good luck. You can hear me. Okay. All right. Again, projections.

48
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:45,180
And this is one of my favorite presentations that I do in the fact that I really do believe that most of you are going to be my boss someday.

49
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,690
And if you could hear and see like you're agreeing, right?

50
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:57,480
Absolutely. And this idea that I've been working on for a very, very long time, are your opinions on this?

51
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,730
Not that you think value based design is great, but you do or you will.

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,800
But the issues that you might have, like I understand conceptually this might be okay, but the problems of implementation might be real.

53
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,790
Good ideas are hard to come by. Implementing them are extremely hard.

54
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:25,740
The good news is David will have a copy of this slide deck, plus a whole bunch of resources that have been done by students like you over the years.

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,800
The center's work is almost always business school, public health, master's students,

56
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,310
a few undergrads and people from across the campus making this happen.

57
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,189
And it's been really extraordinary for me as a practicing general internist and health services

58
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:48,900
researcher that it's really become a one of the foremost applied health policy groups on the campus.

59
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,100
In the fact that I like to tell people I published and I still perished as opposed to publish or perish.

60
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,639
And the fact that I made a decision about 20 years ago to leave this fabulous ivory tower and

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,170
try to get people to believe in and implement the ideas that I'm going to be talking about.

62
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,570
We've had some successes. Some of you, again, you've heard of even before, you're all expert value based insurance.

63
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,950
Like, don't be afraid to tell you. Listen, my mother doesn't even know what value base which you'll hear from her.

64
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,260
But and it's it's a work in progress.

65
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,110
That's the most important thing I know.

66
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,709
It's hard for you to believe that you have this old faculty member coming up to you saying, I really want you to challenge me.

67
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:41,100
You really want me to give up good ideas, not because I'm teaching organic chemistry or calculus or even English literature.

68
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:50,040
This is when you'll hear things that are going on today that I can take something brilliant from each of you forward to help me with my work.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,230
What I also used to say, which may sound corny now,

70
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,720
is that when we had pre-pandemic eight master's students working in the data center in person, whatever.

71
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,590
I used to tell fellow students like yourself that their grade from me, which was nonexistent.

72
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,610
I mean, cares about grades or something. So their grade was dependent on how many Twitter followers they had, and which is not true.

73
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,290
But this is our Twitter handle.

74
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,220
It's a nonpartisan place where we tweet a lot of interesting stuff that I think School of Public Health and Master's students,

75
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,730
particularly Tempe students, would be interested in. So you could sign up for that, although I'm not given any grades.

76
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,100
And I think the most important thing, because David started this so many years for some reason, which is not you,

77
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,620
the people in this class are among the least interactive of any students I deal with around the country.

78
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,350
So, you know, I'm loving and you guys in the back were already going to say, you are going to blow that myth away.

79
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,020
David Somewhere. Seattle, he's somewhere far away. I can't wait to say I had a talk when I was a little rusty.

80
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:01,790
You know, my old jokes didn't work very well, but the students were amazing in the fact that they took me on and off on all my questions.

81
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,510
So here we go. So.

82
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:22,020
And if you are ready or aspiring to be clinician, in addition to me as a physician, I'll tell you, there's never been a better time to be a doctor.

83
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:30,960
I mean, it's just so unbelievably exciting to me about what I could do for you, your family members, the populations you care about moving forward.

84
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,680
But I think it's really interesting to me that if any of you remember, you know,

85
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,170
you know about things that would people would write in, calculate things and stick figures.

86
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,970
I go to health care meetings now, almost all virtual but tons and tons over my career.

87
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,310
And I find out that if I have one column for health, individual population health and one column for money,

88
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,970
almost all the health care meetings I go to are all about money.

89
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:05,460
They are alternative payment models, bundled payments, network creation, health plan design, return on investment and all these things.

90
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,370
And it just it discourages me a little bit that there's no health in the conversation around health care.

91
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,140
And I'm really trying to to improve that.

92
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,509
And it's also very interesting in the fact that just about everyone,

93
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,790
when we get into that health care cost part of the discussion, every wants to cut health care costs.

94
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,969
Right. And the great health services of researcher Woody Allen, you might know him.

95
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,980
He's a movie director, a comedian. He said the best way to reduce expenditures is death.

96
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,560
That was true then and true now. And I want to see how many of you want to do a quick box check in yourself off the list?

97
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,670
Are we spending too much or too little? $4 trillion a year in health care in the US?

98
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,240
Go ahead, please. I think it's about how much money we're spending. It's about how effective the thing is.

99
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:09,620
I know that the US health care system specifically, we have like the lowest accessibility of care even though we spend most of anywhere in the world.

100
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,149
And so I feel like regardless of what you're spending, it's not actually serving the population.

101
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:24,400
And you see my goose bumps from here. So I just presented a bunch of first years and you know, first of all, no one ever says that first.

102
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,090
So you can leave and a good way. You're fine.

103
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:33,010
You don't have to stay further. So the answer is, it depends.

104
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,020
No one. So that was your answer. Right. Does anyone? I feel different.

105
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,090
So let's just presume that our plant here, David plant, is.

106
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,249
No one ever starts out with information. Anyone have an initial reaction?

107
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,060
That was not that. Typically, HP students will be spending too much.

108
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,010
Right. But is that you're thinking?

109
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,010
I could. I could see you're thinking, what's your initial response to too much or too little?

110
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,740
You know, all you have to say is too much. You want to say anything more, just too much or too little too much.

111
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,700
Okay. I kind of had a similar thought.

112
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh, my God. You guys are so smart. And the same, I think, the same way.

113
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,950
So is this just the maturation of the first years? Don't know it.

114
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,610
And you just realize that doesn't get you the checkmark.

115
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:35,850
You have to say something. Yes. Think it's really interesting to me how the you see people who tend to take one side,

116
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,860
it's, oh, we have all of these problems access affordability disparities, which I embrace.

117
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,890
And then there's some people who say, oh, my gosh, we're breaking the budget, we can't afford it, which I embrace.

118
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,230
Right. So the problem and the answer, of course, is it depends.

119
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,370
So dare I ask your you're in optometry quit.

120
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,480
So naysayers because I want says on your head yeah sure.

121
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,050
But no this is just an eye test. This is not a judgment about what your head says.

122
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:11,640
Any ideas about how you might bring about this spectacular idea of improving efficiency by not spending anymore?

123
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,970
I think a big thing that I'm talking to, I'm an environmental scientist, so there's about overlap there.

124
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,650
I think something we talk about is having like sustainability driven hospitals making everything

125
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,729
like efficient and effective because I know that like some of the health care systems in Europe,

126
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,150
in places like Germany and Austria, like just in terms of not even health care necessarily, but like how they use their resources.

127
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,450
Because I don't like, you know, running buildings takes a lot of money and energy.

128
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,860
But if you can make the hospital systems more efficient from like a building standpoint, that alone eliminates a lot of risk.

129
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,740
So you remember what I said about you being my boss someday. So this is soon.

130
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:55,740
So kind of good answer above. My pay grade has little to do with cost effectiveness.

131
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:04,950
It does. But let me just say so. You all go through these spectacular quantitative classes, which, thank God, are remote memory for me.

132
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,439
So you are about know about Greek letters and regressions,

133
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,250
all these things I want you to think about before we get into how hospital efficiency in energy supplies, whatever else.

134
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,000
Total cost of care, right? Price times. Volume.

135
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,540
Right. Price times. And you see this third board.

136
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,020
Who who? How did I come on the scene? Published and still Paris.

137
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,400
One of my first papers 1990 ish underutilization of high value clinical services.

138
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,760
The things that I beg my patients to do, I beg them to do, they are underutilized.

139
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,120
So I became a value increasing guy. Right?

140
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,850
Let's just presume you're going to be the true public health for now, the flag bearer for public health.

141
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,940
You don't care about money there goes under again more prenatal care, free insulin.

142
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,630
You know all this free access to to primary care, all these things that you and I and then you are going to,

143
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,290
if you don't mind, going to be the actuary saying, oh, there he goes again. Right.

144
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:17,070
He's going to break the break. So no matter how efficient we make those hospitals and, you know, sustainable energy, I am in this third bullet.

145
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,690
If I were to ask you, which I may later tell you, your three favorite health care specific health care interventions.

146
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,130
Right. I'll say insulin because I sort of your three favorite health care interventions,

147
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,180
high value but then your brain or write it down your electronic tabular old school,

148
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,040
write it down and then also think about your three favorite low value services.

149
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,610
I just think and so this whole lecture, this whole journey I've been on is,

150
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:56,040
is robbing low value care Peter to pay high value people that's looking for that in before, but that is the 2023 big tagline that we're in.

151
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,719
So I've been about getting access and affordability.

152
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,140
Two things that make people healthier. Second, most readable soundbite I did not go to medical school to learn how to save people money.

153
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,219
Right? But if you can't beat them, join them.

154
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,760
Guy, I was with you. Oh, becoming. You understand?

155
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,510
I'm with you. Fiscal responsibility is important.

156
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,519
I am not that person.

157
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,160
You might have heard of the presidential campaign two years ago saying Medicare should be no premium and there should be no co-pays for any.

158
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,990
Right. That is not me. Go ahead. Talk about more accessible care.

159
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,639
Do you mean that like a financial sense,

160
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,220
if people can afford these screenings or whatever it is or is it in like you go to these communities, not all.

161
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,590
So the answer is and right. So you see where I focus, I'm not smart enough to do all those things.

162
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,310
But the point is there are some things that cost you nothing.

163
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,330
So let me just fast forward because I think we're off to a good start.

164
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,620
How much did your COVID vaccine cost for those of you who got it? 000.

165
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,000
You're not getting any checks. Were going like that. Did someone say nothing?

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,120
Zero. Well, so I'm looking to you, my ex-boyfriend.

167
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,530
How much did your COVID vaccine cost? Nothing. No. Who is it?

168
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,790
Do you know? You guys don't know who Michael J. Keenan is. Who is, like, the fiscal?

169
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,900
Who is the person who is saying we've got to not spend anything ever? So try it again?

170
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,460
How much does the Kobe vaccine cost? How much would you call the vaccinations? So what I love about you already.

171
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,910
So I've been zooming to 49 states. Okay, I ask this question to everyone.

172
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,750
So if you know anyone from North Dakota, go invite me, please. Do I want to check that?

173
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,049
So 49 states. I asked people what your COVID vaccine costs.

174
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:48,680
They all say zero, right? There has to be someone like who was sitting in that chair in the morning lecture saying, no, no, that's not zero.

175
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,939
It cost us something, right? Because you don't pay taxes.

176
00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:00,190
And those of you that start ups but you know, most of us who pay taxes, we paid for we all of us pay for the COVID vaccines.

177
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,620
Right. It's like, oh, you know, there's something we can't do, right?

178
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,790
We can't do that for insulin. We can't do that for prenatal care. We can't do that for the things that you and I want that more accessible.

179
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,569
And you might have even heard last week that when the COVID vaccine is no longer being paid entirely by the government,

180
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,850
about 30 bucks a dose, those friendly pharmaceutical companies are going to charge your health at 110.

181
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,900
I'm not sure if that's a good or bad price, but I care only about what you pay.

182
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,270
So most tweetable soundbites. Americans don't care about health care costs.

183
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:45,959
They care about what it costs. So I turn to you all my future bosses, the grown ups in the room have to negotiate what the COVID vaccine costs,

184
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,350
what a cabbage of the University of Michigan costs, what it costs for prenatal care,

185
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,740
all these other types of services that you access and affordability.

186
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,490
So there are two ways we need to look at things is the total cost and then the cost patients.

187
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,870
Total cost is way above my pay grade and lucky for me, as you'll see,

188
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:10,020
is if we have time to get to it is from a political standpoint, health management and policy.

189
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:21,960
This was unexpected and resonated beautifully in terms of moving the idea value based insurance line forward in the fact that very,

190
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,780
very few policy makers actually are sophisticated enough.

191
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,049
If you all decide about total cost of care, they also agree that out-of-pocket costs is actually as are more important than total cost.

192
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:40,440
But someone ought to deal with total cost, which I hope is you, because you are trying to figure that out as opposed to someone who has to be.

193
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,910
No. This is music that's crazier. That's a great idea.

194
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,280
Or whatever it is. You could react, you know? I'm rusty. You need to make me give me some props here.

195
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay, so. Fourth Board. If you think this problem that I've been struggling with for decades,

196
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:08,540
the tension between quality improvement and our desire to improve health and make things available to people.

197
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,650
Cost containment, keeping costs down. The tension has been there.

198
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,630
It's only going to get worse because what we are seeing coming down the pike in terms of what we can do for individuals or populations is amazing.

199
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,330
But really, really, really expensive. Really, really,

200
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,290
really expensive because people who are training in your department at the

201
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,610
Ross School saying we've been able to make exorbitant profits in health care.

202
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,090
Right. What to do when you think about that? But so we're going to price these things as high as we possibly can.

203
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,840
And I'm not going to give an opinion about my view of capitalism or not.

204
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,180
But this is the way things happen. No. One, our hospitals are not losing money.

205
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,219
The pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies are not losing money.

206
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,360
The pharmacy benefit managers are not raising money. So people have kind of decided to move this forward.

207
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,510
So I call this Star Wars Science and Flintstones delivery.

208
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,850
So ask your parents who the Flintstones are.

209
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:15,800
But it is a reference to the idea of of the fact that we can't get people the things that we already know could help them.

210
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,870
And that drives me crazy to have a patient in my office to know that there is

211
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,920
a specialty drug or there is a program like the diabetes prevention program,

212
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,030
types of things that it exists, but we can't figure out a way to deliver.

213
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:37,610
Which is, again, a skill that you all are learning. And I just why this lecture so fun for me that they really could be applied to day yesterday?

214
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,399
Tomorrow, like right now we need help. You come to my clinic Friday morning to see a situation where, oh,

215
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,020
I think this drug to help you improve your unhealthy weight would be the best way to go.

216
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,770
And if you're wrong,

217
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:56,870
anything about this extraordinarily amazing science about how to help people lose unhealthy weight but access has turned out to be a big problem.

218
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:07,310
Largely do it for donations. So I want to change the conversation in the U.S. from how much we spent, how well we spend,

219
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,620
which is why this Nassar here, you know, nailed the thing so effectively.

220
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,800
It's all about it depends and moving the money around.

221
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:24,830
And I want to make a point that is so poignant to me and is so relevant to this class in this class all week,

222
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,970
because all of you, I pray, can define what cost effectiveness is.

223
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,130
Right. We need to we don't we're not we don't need to define what cost effectiveness.

224
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,920
And you also can articulate each of you that by definition, if something is cost effective, it is not cost saving.

225
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,610
Right. You know that to buy, to table, maybe you hate it, you love it, whatever.

226
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,300
But almost every thing that I would consider high value in health care is cost effective, right?

227
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,790
There are most of the people who live in the world that I would count on you to influence.

228
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,860
Who, for reasons that you will think about during your nice walk through the ARB or whatever you're

229
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:11,510
doing next that they have somehow become to extrapolate that cost effective equals cost saving,

230
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,490
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Have you heard that?

231
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,360
And Ben Franklin said that I went to University of Pennsylvania. He founded it.

232
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,240
So maybe that's but the idea that, oh, if we screen for hypertension, our our health care costs will go down.

233
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,209
If we do a bunch of mammograms for breast cancer, our cost of breast cancer management will go down.

234
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:39,770
If we do screening for HIV or hepatitis C, our health care costs will go up.

235
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,720
Anyone believe that to be true? Is there anyone?

236
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,680
This is where you have to.

237
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,900
There has to be someone in the class who before today has been led to believe that if we invest in prevention, health care costs will go down.

238
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,660
May or may not be true. I guess what I said, it may or may not be true in all the users.

239
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,969
Give me. So make me very happy. I'll tell you what.

240
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,840
This hand in my pocket. There are five things that I know of that save lives and save dollars.

241
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,380
Right. If we let's just. If there are or what you think they are, I would love you to bring them forward.

242
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:17,080
Yeah, I was going to say on that point, well, first you made a point about like on the last slide, the fourth point.

243
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,280
Yeah, I actually I can't remember which article it was.

244
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,769
Maybe you read it or someone in this class did,

245
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:32,349
but it was talking about how higher R&D spending does then affect how well we're spending dollars on like the US health care.

246
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:39,870
And I always had this point that like, no, we have to reduce our spending in R&D so that we could spend it on other things like preventative things.

247
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,850
And so one point, so your comment is,

248
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,379
I think if the US is known for overtreatment and we spend a lot of money over diagnosing, having a lot of tests and stuff,

249
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,140
so if we were to shift that model of spending money like consistently running tests

250
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,920
and things and then shift our money towards being spent on preventative screenings,

251
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,319
catching things earlier so that you don't have to do all of that,

252
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,180
then that would save us a lot of money and there are a lot of research studies that show that.

253
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,260
So first of all, before that last third of your last third,

254
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,239
the two of you can come down here and give this because I'm feeling like really

255
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,799
fortunate that either you've two of you come up with an amazing idea on your own,

256
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,860
or somehow if you remember the movie Inception with Leonardo,

257
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,820
then I I've enough people around here doing Inception about what I've been doing for 30 years is in the two of yours brain, maybe yours.

258
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,390
Not sure about yours yet, but maybe mine. Not yet.

259
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,140
Now you got Navy. You got an exciting. And I want you to tell me why now or later.

260
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,360
So it's really, really important. Until you said that. Oh, that prevention will save money.

261
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:55,120
She brought up no. And low value care. Just remember that if you were to stop there, the two of you, it depends on how you care.

262
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,380
That's my life for 30 years. But I'll get. You'll see why what I mean by that.

263
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:11,310
But almost all the things that I recommend to patients and I'm not starting from birth to death are cost effective and not costly.

264
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,360
So remember this somewhere in the top ten tweetable soundbites.

265
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,880
If you buy more things that don't save money, you will not save money.

266
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,660
Right? There are people who. So if I tell you, oh, screening for hypertension cost effective, right?

267
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, but if we get people to diagnose their hypertension early and treat them, we'll save money.

268
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,330
No. Right. Breast cancer screening. Colon cancer screening.

269
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:45,790
Cervical cancer screening. All cost effective? Not. Is that because the prices of the University of Michigan puts on a pap smear?

270
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,220
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan pays for a pap smear. I have no idea. But they are not costing.

271
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,379
So if you find so again,

272
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,980
some you look to much your table is not that we're still teaching you more cost effective cost saving doesn't go that doesn't mean bells.

273
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,060
Okay. You know, all teaching of cost effectiveness analysis. No, no, you better.

274
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,580
It's. Yeah. Different, like when you got there's one like saves lives, save dollars for quadrants different model to listen.

275
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,760
What am I speaking for? Language 2.0 hundred.

276
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,210
I think two by two tables have four quadrants are the checkbox.

277
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:28,540
Yeah, man, you guys are killing me. So, you know, let me tell you about, you know, about the four quadrants of cost effectiveness.

278
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,140
Yes. I think a two by two table with four quarters in it.

279
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,630
Most people do not spend any time in the save lives.

280
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,940
They do what you call dominant right is still called done. So what's so you said I'm getting back.

281
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,510
I mean, let me go. What do you say? What what do you have in your domain strategies?

282
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,050
You said there were some cases where prevention saves money.

283
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:01,430
I mean, like for cases like the long term costs associated with the disease could be more than they've prevented, of course.

284
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,870
So it's better to get a screening done so you can take it or diagnose it at an early phase.

285
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,740
Okay. Do you guys know what quicksand is since you don't know what quadrants are?

286
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,750
I mean, do you feel the quicksand?

287
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:21,710
Okay, so you're they pay the costs for the patient who we screen for blank, who is early breast cancer, cervical cancer, hypertension, hepatitis C?

288
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,280
Yes, the cost for that patient is less.

289
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,880
The good news is for me as a public health professor and a clinician, as most people, I screen negative.

290
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,150
Right. So you are falling into the quicksand of every advocate who's come to me saying, oh,

291
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:47,300
I this hepatitis C patient we treated with this $100,000 drug, which I love, by the way, that prevented a $2 million liver transplant.

292
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,230
Correct. You guys all know how to do math better than I,

293
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:57,450
that the number of people who have hepatitis C we got a liver transplant is low in the cost of treating people.

294
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,890
100 K is high. And there's really smart people who set the prices, those things that make them cost effective and not customers.

295
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,150
So this is, again, a discussion that all of you need to be very articulate about,

296
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:14,320
because as I transition to what VP, it really is, is really important to me.

297
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:23,300
Some of you may not agree that health care interventions of high value, particularly innovation, need not be cost neutral.

298
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,310
Right. Cost effective is completely fine because I believe that health care, good health, is worth paying for.

299
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,550
I believe that education is worth paying for. I believe that transportation is worth paying for.

300
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:45,440
None of those things are cost. Right. And you will see as you get closer to the real world that there's going to be all

301
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,840
this discussion about cost neutrality in the idea of making things budget neutral.

302
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,120
Right. In understanding.

303
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,560
Because you were there until the very last third of your last third is we all using cost effectiveness analysis and other elements

304
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:12,710
need to figure out a way to pay for those things that I want to be able to provide you with minimal barriers as you come in.

305
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,740
Sadly, I diagnosed with type one diabetes. I say you're going to be taking insulin for the rest of your life, right?

306
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,370
I do not want you to have to have a bake sale to afford your insulin.

307
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:30,890
What's going on in insulin nationally is a really great example of what you need to do to help move policy forward.

308
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,830
Right. Why do we need. Why do we need skin in the game or cost sharing for insulin?

309
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,739
I'll tell you now that at one time I had four teenagers.

310
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,020
At the same time, my four kids. I could wait out you guys as long as you want.

311
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:55,760
So someone has to tell me why there is a national policy discussion around cost sharing for insulin.

312
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,500
Why is there cost sharing for in health care in general?

313
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,950
That's an easier one. And then tell me why there is cost sharing for insulin.

314
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,510
If you use a really well known economics term, which I don't use that often, you get bonus points from me.

315
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,640
Why is your caution? Should I go out for a while?

316
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:25,210
Go get my water bottle. Because the prevalence of is much more.

317
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,820
Well, no. But you know what? Maybe I mean, it's not that there is a fund.

318
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,430
It why would why would. Has there been co-payments?

319
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,590
You don't have to raise your hands, but co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles.

320
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,919
Right. That has been I used to lose sleep.

321
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,710
I was telling Rich over my patients with heart disease.

322
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,650
But I spent $40 for Lipitor, which most of you don't know was discovered in Ann Arbor on north campus.

323
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,480
Now, Atorvastatin now very, very cheap, but very expensive then.

324
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,960
And it used to drive me nuts and say and I would say, why?

325
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,510
Why is it.

326
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:12,570
Because it's the theory is that it'll incentivize people to take better care of themselves so that if you make them pay for it, they wouldn't want it.

327
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,600
Also known as Skin in the game. If you heard that term, I guess I get you.

328
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:23,690
I got you next. What do you do now? Remember? Well, something similar to what we do.

329
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,940
Save skin in the game. Provide a better be a better consumer is a really kind idea.

330
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,890
But if you are the actuary, why do you love I see you.

331
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,490
Why do you love cost sharing? It reduces utilization.

332
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,400
Right. And what the bonus term, a moral hazard term.

333
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,000
You know, you knew what you could have got. You had it on the tip of your tongue.

334
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,720
Is there moral hazard for insulin because you want someone who has to check the box?

335
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,400
No, no one is overusing insulin. I remember 30 years of practicing some them.

336
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,760
I don't have diabetes. I want to stick myself with the needle every day.

337
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,850
That hurts like crazy for a drug they have to spend a lot of money on. That's going to put me in hypoglycemic shock and up right?

338
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,520
Never. No no moral hazard in diabetes.

339
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:17,229
I was just going to say that, like, cost sharing reduces premiums and it saves your health insurance company money.

340
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,760
So I'm just doing it from the know. Right. So you can you can work without before you can.

341
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,060
Now, you gave the party line. Oh yeah, we want people to be better consumers.

342
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,979
It's like, no, no, no, no. You know, it's like the real reason.

343
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,390
The real reason is we want to keep spending down.

344
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,400
One group wants to keep spending on one group wants keep spending down.

345
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,090
It is part of that Star Wars science flicks don't delivery. Why?

346
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,650
You know, we're hearing this from the beginning, right? This is a tension.

347
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,969
And ultimately what I'm turning to all of you is that there's more than enough money in the system.

348
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:03,480
Right. First bullet here. I need your skills to move the money around based on cost effectiveness analysis.

349
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,940
Now, you might say, Oh, what if this class sucks? You know, it's so boring.

350
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:14,800
I don't want to learn this things that for the two of you or eight of you or whatever you're applying this thing, I need help.

351
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,030
Say, this is a problem for me, Mark.

352
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:25,750
I know you want to move the money around, but you're thinking, what's the good stuff in the bad stuff, right?

353
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,630
What's the good stuff in the bad stuff? And that is what you do, right?

354
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,129
At least in your problems. That's not your real life.

355
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,730
But what you're doing is, oh, cost per life, your verdict, quality, cost per maternal death, whatever it is.

356
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:48,250
You're telling me how much I have to spend to get a health benefit, and the better they are, the more I'm going to say that's good stuff.

357
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:53,490
And that's on to your point earlier. There's some bad stuff here, not so bad.

358
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,430
And so what do we think about that idea? I'll call on you the very back.

359
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,860
What do you think about moving the money around and just paying more and getting more people to do good things?

360
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,910
And I guess it depends where you move the money to rent,

361
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:14,500
so you move it to somewhere that isn't necessarily helping people or it's it costs more when there

362
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,710
is another different intervention that could cost less and it is not worth it to move money around.

363
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,250
So that's called American health care. What you said is what's happening now, right.

364
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,930
I see you. I y you y how three word answer.

365
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:39,389
Do we have we seen such an incredible prevalence of the fact that we buy so much [INAUDIBLE] academic term,

366
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:45,990
sorry, so much care that doesn't help people in the health care system hear from you.

367
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,660
And then someone's going to tell me three long answer.

368
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:57,690
Three word answer is preferred, but a longer answer why our system is so bloated with five things that don't make people any healthier.

369
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,560
I think. I just I guess I just I think that like, I really agree with what everyone said about the but yeah,

370
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:09,720
how about like, you know, moving money to the right places. But I don't think that it's a bad goal to also want to decrease costs.

371
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,460
Like I think that that those aren't mutually exclusive and that we should be like trying.

372
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,540
But I'm not disagree with you, but if I decrease costs by making insulin less accessible.

373
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,500
Right. This problem. Yeah, that's a problem. I think things like ways to reduce costs.

374
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,190
Which. Which? I will give you my idea, and you will tell me the better one.

375
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,160
Right. Or you want to give me. How are we going to reduce costs? So. Price times. Volume.

376
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,670
Right. So what you're going to say is. I'm in Michigan, graduate student.

377
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,980
I'm going to get people to lower prices. Good luck. There you have it.

378
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,960
Right. So I'm a volume guy. You need to understand. I'm a volume guy.

379
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,150
You know, I apologize. I said this earlier.

380
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,940
My first 15 years of my career was just do more of this because it's the right thing to do and it's cost effective.

381
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,899
Right. Understanding. I hope someone has a three word answer.

382
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,500
Why things that you have the answer. Good. You think you do?

383
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,010
It's like jeopardy. Whatever. Answering a formal question of.

384
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,010
Let me finish. So this. Yeah. So this idea of how this stuff moves forward is really problematic.

385
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,580
Three word answer fee for service. Right. It is fee for service. Right.

386
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:19,630
When you contact even that fee for service. So how do we get people to.

387
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,090
How do we get to decrease spending if predominantly we pay people for doing

388
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,880
whatever the [INAUDIBLE] they want to do at a price if they tell you what it is. Answer?

389
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,590
Sure. No. I mean, you know, we got confetti.

390
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,000
That's really dumb, but maybe. But do you have an answer? I don't know.

391
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,940
No. You think you have no choice?

392
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,850
I had a lot of hair when I started thinking about this, and my forehead was banging my head against the wall for 30 years.

393
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,320
It is really real. Even if you have an idea like value based insurance, like that's hard implementing stuff like that.

394
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,770
Unbelievably hard, which is what I hope some of your real practicum professors come and tell you like you could learn all this stuff.

395
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,280
Whatever class it is implementing. This is really, really hard.

396
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,189
Which is why I want to keep an eye on the clock here to to tell you about the journey which has been so fun,

397
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,889
frustrating, problematic and beneficial in the fact that the reason why your cobra shots were freebies.

398
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,530
Because if you did right, that is what I mean. If that is the ultimate idea of good stuff should be free.

399
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,630
Not only is it free for your plan since you're now CEO, the plan for next no for the next 45 minutes.

400
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,240
So the point is, oh my God, the government is picking it up.

401
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,830
Like, why can't we ask the government to pick up the cost of insulin, which is what I wrote them?

402
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,069
Why should the government pick up the cost of prenatal care? Those are things on my list of high value services.

403
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,300
You have other lists, but I'm saying, yeah, those are what health care delivery should be.

404
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,860
I'm not suggesting, as you were saying, that it should not be frivolous and it should not be evidence based.

405
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,910
And the clinical evidence is not enough, which is why we need you. Right.

406
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,440
We need you to tell me what are the financial implications of that, right?

407
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,770
And that's why I don't want to put patients.

408
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:08,660
We're moving on. We're moving on. Okay. So payment reform you guys have learned a lot about.

409
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,180
We'll learn probably till the day you cross your credit.

410
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:19,280
This to me, supply side interventions, getting clinicians to behave differently in my opinion, pay them more for the things they should be doing.

411
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,790
Pay them less for the things they shouldn't based on this same kind of evidentiary thing.

412
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,660
Alternative payment models, value based payment. There's a whole bunch of terms for that, right?

413
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,740
That is very, very big. And the most important lever, in my opinion, because it's the most important.

414
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,520
There's a lot of really smart people working there. So I'm not working at all on the payment reform side.

415
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,380
I have to a little bit, but that is what you all would call in your economics.

416
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,870
This is supply side interventions. This is the big lever.

417
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,250
I decided in the late 1990s it looks like last century.

418
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,730
I love saying that upstairs on the third floor that I was going to look at the demand side.

419
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:06,370
As a clinician working with economists like, well, it's not all what clinicians are paid,

420
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,110
it's about how patients are paid or patients are incented or not.

421
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:21,319
Right. And. You see on this bottom slide here is that while movement is maybe going slowly but

422
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,550
actually moving from fee for service to some type of alternative quality based payment.

423
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:36,020
What is happening? The world on the demand side, on the demand side has been, as I said, co-payments when I started co-insurance and now deductibles.

424
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,800
Right. And I want you because I can stick with you.

425
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,410
So what do you what do we think of so deductibles, lower health care spending, as you heard from your colleague?

426
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,040
No question. By putting a barrier in front of you on January 1st.

427
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,090
Right. What do you think about deductibles? I mean, like.

428
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,450
Yeah, like it it is a barrier. Patients getting saved.

429
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:05,780
All right. So you do like deductibles. Isn't that like, okay, the most common and most effective way to lower health care costs?

430
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,120
Right. You're saying off heart. You know, it's good to buy quality, but we need it.

431
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,929
So your your down on deductibles. No, no.

432
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,840
Remember the two word? It it depends. Right.

433
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,260
So this is where you're all going to come together now is where I don't remember what time you want me to be done,

434
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:31,190
but if we were to create a deductible that we I would be happy with and hopefully you would all be happy with.

435
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:39,620
It would be deductibles that apply to only allowed low value care.

436
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:48,379
You're that that's what you said you said we need to make have people pay more for the things they don't need.

437
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,050
That at best will not help them and at worst actually harms them.

438
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:54,920
Right.

439
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:04,250
So even and I don't believe that even setting a fee for service, if a clinician tells you that you need to get this MRI for your knee or your back,

440
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,440
even though all the evidence says you should wait six weeks and get physical therapy before that,

441
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,920
most people just say, my doctor said, and it will go into bankruptcy.

442
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,400
You know, the number one cause of personal bankruptcy in the U.S.? Health care.

443
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,090
Number one, cause of online fundraising campaigns.

444
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,930
Health care. Right. So it's a. So this is why is this a plan?

445
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:32,240
This is real. This is happening to people that you know or people you know, you know, the problem, medical debt is just extraordinary.

446
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,480
And it's really sad to people. Very, very sad. So I want to tell you, you all know what deductibles are, right?

447
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:47,630
Right. I say that because all four kids have crashed at least one of my cars, so they know what it is.

448
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,440
But 50% of millennials don't know it. So you guys are lucky.

449
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
And you know what deductibles are, what your friends don't know.

450
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:01,070
And this is just it's an old slide, but this is the one that keeps me up at night.

451
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,820
And I want to understand why this keeps me up at night.

452
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:12,530
Because when I started, half the people in America, employer based health insurance, had a deductible.

453
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,050
It was kind of small. Now again, old slide.

454
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,530
It's over 80%. And everyone I know it doesn't work for University of Michigan.

455
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,050
There is a health plan that they have to. It is the bluntest of all instruments.

456
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,490
I want to understand why I do not like deductibles and why you can 40 minutes.

457
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:39,360
Why not like deductibles as they are now is that most of you kind of celebrate January 1st,

458
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,510
go to a party, sing a song, talk to your friends and family members who have chronic conditions.

459
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,350
Talk to them about what January 1st means. Right?

460
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,079
So you all understand what January 1st your insurance plan kicks over again after you

461
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,950
struggle to meet that deductible in your plan and you're starting all over again.

462
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,379
And I've written about this January effect that who are the people who are most negatively

463
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,520
impacted are underserved populations and people with multiple chronic conditions.

464
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:14,790
It is a bad thing that I would argue in the world of cost effectiveness analysis, in health management and policy,

465
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:21,090
that you should kind of think a little bit more about the deductible problem and hearing your views on that,

466
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:27,510
because there's always going to be the health plan people. You're not saying, yeah, we need to have skin in the game, right?

467
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,640
And I say I believe in transparency, I believe in accountability.

468
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:39,110
But my patients should not have to have a Kickstarter to get a cancer drug that was designed to treat her to bring.

469
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,500
That is not the medicine that I train, the clinician that I train to become.

470
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,130
So why is this problematic? You see these numbers that are a little bit higher now.

471
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:54,070
I've been, you know, raising a national guilt trip on the same way I was trying to make a national guilt trip on the two of you.

472
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,969
Like deductibles are bad the way they are, right? The Federal Reserve, published in 2019, pre-COVID.

473
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:05,320
It's worse now. 40% of Americans don't have $400 in the bank.

474
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,879
Right. You have an accent, you go to the ER thousand or deductible, you have autoimmune disease,

475
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,210
you need an expensive specialty drug that's already got all these things.

476
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,470
People are not able to access the care that I beg them to get.

477
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,349
And it's just there's nothing worse, as I said,

478
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:30,240
to actually have an opportunity to apply Star Wars science to my patients and have them be in Rolling Stones delivered.

479
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,680
Right. It's just I'd rather not have the treatment available then.

480
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,100
No, it's out there. Right. And not be able to give it to them.

481
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,920
That is really bad. And that that really is the motivation for value based insurance design.

482
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,120
So every presentation I've ever given, this is my oh, this is new.

483
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,470
Just show you I've been doing this for 20 years. This is The New York Times this summer.

484
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,700
Deductibles are ridiculous, right? Please.

485
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:02,100
You remember that? What's that game where you fill in the the word thing when you fill in a word?

486
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,370
You were in the car as a kid and you'd have to fill in a verb or an adjective or whatever else.

487
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,370
Deductibles are what is it called now? Nitrogen. I want you all to have your own ballot for deductibles are blank.

488
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,780
If it's great, that's fine. It's not really. You tell me and you'll say they're great. You work out.

489
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,590
That's great. But deductibles are ridiculous. They suck, they're mean. Their equity worsening, disparity worsening.

490
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,149
All these things, they are bad, right? That doesn't mean.

491
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:33,240
So hopefully some of you will take as I will take your conservative view, I do believe that deductibles should be applied for.

492
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:39,989
You said it before. When do we pay deductibles? Low value care. You're everything you says.

493
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,340
You can set anything. It's all brilliant. Okay, so this is what I was getting. And this is my ma up.

494
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,080
This is my mom. She's 88.

495
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,540
She said, I can't believe you had to spend $1,000,000 to show that if you make people pay more for something, they'll buy less.

496
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:57,540
So your moms are always right. That is the most important lesson of this lecture.

497
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,990
And imagine my mom, one year of college, you know, not really sophisticated from a quantitative standpoint.

498
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,459
And when I was telling her about all these consultants, which are graduates of this program,

499
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,900
talking about skin in the game, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm like, You've got to be kidding me.

500
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:18,090
Like, you're putting this barrier in front of the things that not only I know are going to help my patients,

501
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,940
but here are the things I'm being benchmarked as a condition through alternative payment models that you love

502
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,810
anti fee for service right so I'm being benchmark how many my diabetic patients go to the eye doctor every year.

503
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,460
The more those patients go to the eye doctor, the more money I make.

504
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,110
That's pretty good. That's a good. You take that right? You'd spend more on that, right?

505
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,830
Oh, is that good? I should be paid to have my patients get healthier.

506
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,600
This. This is a well known quality measure. You're not. You need to be you need to be excited.

507
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,680
That's efficient. I should be rewarded and encourage my patients to make sure they get a diabetic eye.

508
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:05,939
What do you think? The coverage of diabetic eye exams in the U.S. in 2022 compared to 1988 when I started covering studying diabetic eye exam,

509
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,080
do you think your coverage is better or worse? Same.

510
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,530
Easy question, because you know where I'm making you look. What do you think? I'm sorry, I.

511
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:25,210
You spaced out better, safer satellite phone coverage for diabetic eye exams in 2022 terms of access affordability

512
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:32,530
for eight credibly well known low lying fruit high value service compared 2022 to 1988.

513
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,620
Better coverage, same coverage. Worse coverage. You know my told you, this is so easy.

514
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,310
Worse. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

515
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,880
Worse. Why? One word. Deductibles.

516
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,159
Right. So it was all eye exams should be made accessible.

517
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,630
We're going to have no co-payment. Oh, by the way. Yeah. After you meet your $2,000 deductible, which you only have $400 of the problem.

518
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,610
Right? So imagine since you and I are the liberal equity reducing, equity enhancing disparity reducing team.

519
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:15,909
So imagine when I told my mother that after we published so many papers, make people pay more to go to the doctor.

520
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,030
They go more or less often easy.

521
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:26,800
Make them pay more to fill their prescriptions more or less often. Let's make them pay more for their diagnostic tests, more or less often.

522
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,859
Right. So this is like the easiest way to tenure? No. To me, it was like we kept saying, Oh, my mom's right.

523
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,630
Let's study what I'm thinking. The papers came out all over showing my mom was right.

524
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,910
Yeah, right. Which is what you said.

525
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:48,010
Imagine when I told my mother I had to raise another half million dollars to show that poor people are impacted by high prices more than rich people.

526
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,179
Right. I'm glad you're. No, you're dying. I'm glad you're laughing.

527
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,909
Right. This is a an award winning paper in a high level journal that my mother's like.

528
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:04,950
I'm I'm becoming an academic. This is too easy, right? These are the questions you're you're trying to answer, like this is tough.

529
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:10,300
This is not even microeconomics one on one. This is the world of the economy.

530
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:17,200
So we although now you might know the current administration has made equity a top policy priority,

531
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,570
thank goodness these papers from the year 2000, we were talking about equity.

532
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,840
A small way to enhance equity is get rid of cost sharing as a blunt instrument.

533
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,710
Right. We need to get rid of caution as a blunt instrument.

534
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:39,160
So here is where the rubber meets the road. There are people like you, the mean people, profit maximizers, the three of you.

535
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:46,120
We say, Mark, you know, there is no way that we could get we can't be Bernie Sanders, right?

536
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,809
No. Everything free, no copy. Right. Which is how I'm labeled.

537
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:55,360
Right. You know, Huckabee. Oh, there's that founder guy saying deductibles are bad, co-pays are bad.

538
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,629
And then you come up and say, oh, no, he wants to apply Doctor Bowles for only Obamacare.

539
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:06,670
Right. So I so I talked to let's say, look, this is our my liberal side.

540
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:11,410
So I want cost sharing to be gone. Right? And then I walk over here and say, oh, don't worry,

541
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,810
I'm going to put enough car sharing in place for the things that we don't need to the point you made earlier on.

542
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,500
And all things are going to be good, right? So.

543
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,640
This is your great idea of value based insurance, right?

544
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,060
This is your idea as a group, right?

545
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,450
What should we do? Precaution. Right.

546
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,050
Instead of having it be the same for everything. Right.

547
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,850
We are going to say you are not going to come up with we're going to make this instead of the cheap

548
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:49,000
stuff being cheap and the expensive stuff being expensive as you apply a co-insurance or deductible.

549
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,160
We are going to make the good stuff cheap or free and we're going to make people pay through the nose for stuff they don't need.

550
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:02,830
Right. So this is where I need to stop.

551
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:08,230
And you only can tell me like you didn't. You thought you knew what it was.

552
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:16,360
Right. But now you know what it is. And this is where your chance you especially to say, like, do you like it?

553
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,940
Is it possible what you don't like about it? Tell me where you are.

554
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,830
So you've now been indoctrinated by the guy who came up with the term value based insurance design.

555
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,720
Been working on it for decades. You're hearing put in front of you saying, are you on board or not?

556
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,560
And if you're not, which is fine. You need to tell me what you prefer over this.

557
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,540
Including, you could say the status quo is just fine.

558
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:49,540
So the one thing I mean, I like it, but, you know, let me just can I just bask in that for a second before the button?

559
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,880
All right. You like it? Good. All right, so it's a but then maybe you can answer clarify for me.

560
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,940
But when assigning something as high value or low value is where I get tripped up.

561
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,630
Okay, I never got that question before. Right, everyone.

562
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,499
So I'm going to get to that because this is why I hope you're thinking the two of you is like this is I knew it.

563
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,770
This is my idea. You're like, you didn't need founder continue to come up with this idea.

564
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,280
This is my idea. Why hasn't this if you like it.

565
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,980
Why hasn't this become ubiquitous? Right.

566
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:31,320
You raise one person. Yeah, I had I saw I was going to say, I think it is a good idea to place like if you think about deductibles,

567
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,920
for deductibles to be placed on things like low value based care.

568
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:45,000
But what I will say is I feel like conversations like in this, like the health space tend to always be about like where can we move money around?

569
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,889
And like, what can I take out of this to put it into that instead of like the, the bigger picture,

570
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,920
in my opinion, obviously everyone has a different opinion about like what matters.

571
00:52:53,340 --> 00:53:00,510
The bigger picture should be like, what structure can I set in place so that we don't always we're not always thinking about like and like solvency

572
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:08,520
and having an outdated infrastructure like for a system like that or a share in our company's shareholder profits.

573
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,270
I mean, yes, all above my pay grade. So I'm going agree with them.

574
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,050
And like the Inflation Reduction Act, like, for example, like that's made up.

575
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,590
We'll get there. Me okay, you guys have to tell me when I'm.

576
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,140
We got stuff. Okay, your point. So why so you don't like it?

577
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh, I was just going to say, I think it's a great idea. Thought, okay, everyone gets and then save up.

578
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,380
So I think it's good. But the problem is, is I have my suspicions about it being implemented effectively, right.

579
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,940
As a public health student,

580
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:46,230
I've learned I'm not going to trust that the healthcare system will necessarily serve the needs of people who need it the most.

581
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,820
That's like demonstrated by insulin. Insulin is insanely expensive. It's so cheap to produce.

582
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,569
They're doing it just not to be a jerk, but they're doing it to make the most money.

583
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,309
And that's really all they care about. And I feel like with this design, although it doesn't increase health care spending,

584
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,050
it kind of I feel like puts a cap on some of the ways that they can charge people for these things that go up in price.

585
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,710
Oh, God. Okay, this is exactly what I'm hoping for. So the back row is coming through big time, so.

586
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,299
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was going to say, I know that there's it sounds like there's like a 20 year research gaps.

587
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:24,270
I'm curious to see or you can discuss a little bit how I suppose folks might be in the space of engaging with like policymakers.

588
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,990
Like what's that window of opportunity, that looking like we met before?

589
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:37,100
No, no. But I have I have referenced your article before, so I think it's a couple.

590
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,380
So you like it, but there's a lot of us.

591
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,830
But, you know, status quo sucks. Academic term deductibles.

592
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:52,260
Bad, bad. Inequities, disparities bad, bad, bad and not good was also decreased.

593
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,200
The use of low value care which is kind of good.

594
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:01,920
Were not moving forward deductibles in the right place may be good if you're caring about fiscal stuff, but cost sharing in general,

595
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,070
there isn't a lot of things that have moral hazard anymore in the things that we care about in this discussion.

596
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,460
That's just little to none, right? Okay.

597
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,450
So this is the biggest problem.

598
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,460
We've had two major, major areas about implementing these.

599
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:28,740
One is what's high and low about. Right. So you've heard of low lying fruit centric has worked in what he calls fruit below the ground.

600
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:37,200
Things that I can walk into a room of Republicans or Democrats, management, labor, drug companies, health plans and just say diabetic eye exams, good.

601
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:44,970
Right. CTS, MRI for healthy Michigan students are trying their best back playing soccer over the weekend before they go to Tibet.

602
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,910
We'll get to some dangerous things, expensive things, whatever.

603
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:56,069
So here is the big problem, is that I asked you, I think, to think about your three favorite high value services, low value services.

604
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,460
So here are mine, which is illustrates the first problem.

605
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:05,340
Three Favorite High value services colorectal cancer screening, coronary stenting back surgery.

606
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:11,370
Three Favorite Low Value Services. Colorectal cancer screening, coronary stenting back surgery.

607
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,740
You need to understand. So I'm watching you.

608
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:22,530
I would talk to CFO of Fortune 50 companies spending more on health care than anything else in their business more than some countries.

609
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,460
They hear that line, right? They said too hard.

610
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:34,470
They didn't understand that MRI's aren't always bad. They didn't understand that colonoscopies were always good.

611
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,820
Right. This is point number one term called clinical nuance.

612
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,900
Right. A value of a service. This is why David invites me here.

613
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,899
And cost effect. I can say value because no one knows.

614
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:52,620
The cost effectiveness means the cost effectiveness of a service depends on who, when, by whom and where.

615
00:56:53,340 --> 00:57:00,450
Right. And this is when you read a cost effectiveness analysis carefully, you might see if it's being done by people want it used a lot.

616
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:10,590
We'll pick that scenario of the right patients. And if it's a payer, the bad the bad guys like you like oh, we could find it when it doesn't work.

617
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,469
Right. Statins, which I talk a lot about,

618
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:20,460
these drugs are lower cholesterol when used in a person who has heart disease and had a heart attack close to cost saving,

619
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,650
cost effective, like to beat the band. Nine out of ten people who take statins.

620
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,950
I'm not very hip until it like me have not had a heart attack.

621
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:35,820
So the cost effectiveness is still okay. But not not low, but okay.

622
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,150
Not in the area that you and I would agree. We should be paying for it.

623
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,230
So that's why when you look at cost effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening,

624
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:48,810
one of my favorites in a first degree relative, I'm giving you the answer to my question.

625
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:57,179
Costs it right. I've been on TV saying not only should the colonoscopy be free, the health plan should send a limousine to the patient's house.

626
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,889
Because there's one reason is someone was saying earlier, it's not just money. People can't get a day off of work.

627
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,719
They don't have a driver. That all these types of things.

628
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,730
I want all the barriers to be removed because this is one of those few things that will actually save money.

629
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:15,960
Right. Which I'll get you in a minute. One of the most controversial aspects of the bill is contraception.

630
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:18,660
Let's leave ideology notwithstanding,

631
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:26,400
why is every health plan since contraception become available covered contraception generously is because it saves money.

632
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,540
Right? So you and me, I don't want any. Well, so my plan, right?

633
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,950
That is what we that's kind of an interesting area. Let's keep the ideology out of it.

634
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:40,230
But kind of interesting about saving lives to save money. So the idea of clinical nuance has made it really hard.

635
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:46,140
And you were saying implementing it really hard. That should not stop us, right?

636
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:53,550
Because the easiest way to do it is some drugs are typically used in a very, very homogeneous population.

637
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:58,169
Let's talk about insulin. Right? So you'll say, oh, we can't do it.

638
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:05,580
And so and so this drug. So once I drop in insulin, 99.99% of people take insulin, take it for diabetes.

639
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,890
So, you know, by definition what their condition is, there's no overuse and why.

640
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,770
You mentioned Inflation Reduction Act. We'll get to that in a second.

641
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:21,120
But to me, this is like if I can't convince people to make insulin accessible, give me that for certain populations.

642
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,200
If you don't take it, you will die. Right? I have a tough road to hoe.

643
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:34,380
Which why did you. Right. So you said price of insulin not allowed out of pocket costs for insulin a lot, right?

644
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:41,460
Grown ups like you should negotiate insulin costs be lower you somehow maybe know mark Cuban from shark tank is

645
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,700
starting an insulin factory the state of California and starting your own insulin factory someday you don't.

646
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,910
Low cost insulin. I don't have to worry about today.

647
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:53,770
Particularly in January, you'll hear me on the radio saying someone's going to die because the deductibles for.

648
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,239
So you how do you incorporate equity considerations into this plan?

649
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,590
So I know some communities have a lot less access to these resources.

650
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,650
You're also plan. So equity is top priority for us.

651
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,680
Go ahead. I'll get your side. Go ahead. Oh, I just had a question.

652
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:17,660
I wonder a more of an opinion question if you saw or heard anything about Senator Van der

653
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,820
Walt announcing a plan for Michigan to develop its the state like what you think about that.

654
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,490
So you will see an editorial op ed with the student,

655
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:32,510
a young faculty member like you calling on Senator Rand Paul to adopt not only insulin manufacturing,

656
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,600
which is a ten year thing to putting in place for insulin.

657
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,250
So the answer is sure.

658
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:43,610
You know, our friend who works in, you know, environmentally healthy buildings where we should be manufacturing insulin at a lower price.

659
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,660
Your question and this is civic, if you've heard of that, this is Mark Cuban cost plus drugs.

660
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:52,909
This is all happening. And I know I know Senator Vandewalle.

661
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:58,850
And, you know, he's not someone who's anywhere near as sophisticated as you are before he went into state politics

662
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:04,399
about these issues and needs to be educated on the manufacturing and the net price of insulin.

663
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:12,469
What you should care about. Right. But in the meantime, as it says this Detroit News, the Detroit Free Press op ed is in the meantime,

664
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:17,890
while you're trying to drug the net price of insulin down, don't put my patient in the goddamned right.

665
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,670
Don't make my patient be in the middle of your failure to negotiate.

666
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,740
To her point on why insulin costs are so high,

667
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:32,390
but insurance should be that it should cover and you can still not check your box and just I haven't forgotten you haven't you haven't spoken up yet.

668
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:37,700
You and what we're getting in the second half. So if you haven't spoken up, it's going to be time.

669
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:44,809
So disparities really quickly. Remember, equity very important to me.

670
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:51,560
Disparity reduction very important to me, kind of flies in a parallel track to the evil people who want to spend less on health care.

671
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:59,420
Because I will tell you that it's bad enough that underserved populations always don't get the high value services.

672
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,009
Or the biggest disappointments to me.

673
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:08,880
I won't have time to go for it in detail, but you can find that the website, as I said at a conference about 12 years ago.

674
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:15,990
Is that the only good thing I could see about lack of access for underserved populations is just probably getting less low value care, right?

675
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:20,489
And if you're not, you know, if you're not getting high value care by way over there in low behold because our

676
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,990
system is so bad that there's now a growing literature to show that the same

677
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,990
populations who don't get the things that we would all recommend based on evidence

678
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:31,379
and cost effectiveness are also getting more the stuff they shouldn't be getting it.

679
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:39,960
All right. That is horrifying. The fact that lack of high value care has been an equity issue as shown by our research here.

680
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:44,370
You know, my mom said these people are being screwed by high prices.

681
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,050
And we showed, not surprisingly in TV programs, they actually help the underserved more.

682
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:55,200
Don't need it. You know, my mom didn't need a M.D., Ph.D. to show that because your hand really up now you're breaking the stretch.

683
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:03,360
Yeah. 1/2 for good. This idea that we've but we wrote in our very first paper in 2001 that this will reduce disparities.

684
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:08,940
And you didn't again, you don't need a Ph.D. to show that if you remove barriers to not just financial,

685
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:14,580
sometimes transportation, sometimes administrative, that will be able to make disparities not go away.

686
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:20,700
But would you please? So like, from my understanding is that the US healthcare market is inherently.

687
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:28,590
And functional in a way, because it's geared towards it's geared towards payers, geared towards insurance companies.

688
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:37,200
And how can you expect really the elephant in the room, I feel, is that how can you expect someone to afford insulin when the payer,

689
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,880
which usually everyone should have some, which everyone should have within this country,

690
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,180
is having a health insurance plan and they're the ones in for insulin.

691
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:52,530
So with that being said, what do you think would be the best solution out of this?

692
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,490
You know, because, you know, so it's great. That would often comes up.

693
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:01,230
So someone has described the U.S. health care system as a circular firing squad.

694
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,010
You know, everyone's blaming everyone else and someone blame the drug companies.

695
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:10,169
You're blaming the health plans, you're blaming the policymakers, you're blaming the health care providers.

696
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:15,960
All systems are all guilty. And what's great about about America is that it's follow the money, right?

697
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,930
Follow the money in my my first line of my first line says there's more than enough money.

698
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:26,399
Right. Which is pretty easy for me to get all those people and I deal with all of them say there's more than enough money.

699
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,550
Right? All those parties say there's more. Enough money. Right.

700
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:37,560
They just want their peace. Right. What I have said from the very beginning, with nowhere near the expertize and education that you all have,

701
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,340
is that the people are making those folks healthier should get more money than those who don't.

702
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,740
The money should flow to health. And if you believe in equity, the more money should even flow to those.

703
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:56,340
Right. That is easy to say. The your point about some ideas are easy, but implementation is hard.

704
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,600
So it's really no one's willing to admit I'm the people making money, making me healthier.

705
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:04,800
That's been the beauty kind of side light of debate, like who's against this?

706
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,000
People who are against this are people making money, not of making Americans any healthier.

707
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,910
That could be. You're not going to stand up and say that even though you would, but not your young people in real life.

708
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,600
You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it. Drug company. No, you wouldn't. Oh, yeah. We're we're selling snake oil.

709
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,690
Right where, you know, there are people who know they're selling snake oil,

710
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:25,770
usually in the supplement areas or whatever, but they're not going to admit it.

711
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,970
Right. So that's been kind of it for someone. You want to get to the policy points.

712
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,189
That has been incredibly enlightening for me to know that's anyone say I'm going to

713
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:38,999
stop you to say who is against more of the good stuff and less of the bad stuff,

714
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,930
right? It's just defining you. You you make it to finding good stuff and bad stuff has been has been problematic.

715
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,130
All right. Here we go. I've been waiting. Good. I had one point which I want you to.

716
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:55,860
I'd only got I. This wasn't confident enough because I know around July in the outpatient,

717
01:05:55,860 --> 01:06:03,260
we went to the opossum below, losing that the insulin cost out of pocket has to be reduced to $35.

718
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:08,980
Or that $35 a month. Yes, inflation reduction.

719
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:13,319
I'm going to get to that. I'm not sure I should give you credit for it, but that's good. You spoke very well.

720
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,670
I'll give you credit for that. So people are listening, right?

721
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:24,209
Insulin. No, no. But I want you all given you understand the cost of a baby, there's something that you haven't heard of, like cancer.

722
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,570
Kill them. All that people I've heard of that's equally cost effective insulin, that people are listening to policies.

723
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:36,150
And that has been the approach I've taken. So you hadn't heard of even before today.

724
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:46,890
So my article. Thank you are one of us. I went to Washington in 2006 with a government affairs person here from the School of Public Health.

725
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:51,990
The only policy training I had was Schoolhouse Rock. You might have known that I was singing.

726
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,840
I'm just a bill. I'm only a bill. I usually would have him on these slides.

727
01:06:55,890 --> 01:07:03,120
I had no idea what I was doing, and I basically went to Capitol saying, I think we should make high value services less expensive.

728
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:10,110
To which they said, Oh, that's great, that'll save money. And I'm like, know, I would say no, but I would force me not to say that's not true.

729
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,840
Everyone kept saying, because they didn't have your training, they're like, Oh, that's great.

730
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,570
All the screening, all this preventive care saves money. There is something called the preventive care mandate.

731
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,590
You're nodding because you've heard of it or just making me out of a 35 year

732
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:28,560
anniversary of the primary care mandate is one third of a one page of a 900 page law,

733
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:36,030
also called Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act. I had the great honor to help write this small section.

734
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,709
This small section mandates that all these evil health plans who don't want to

735
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:47,430
give you anything must cover a hundred services or so now at no cost to patients.

736
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:52,200
It is the ultimate v big break. It is the pinnacle of my professional career.

737
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:58,980
Right. So your cervical cancer screening, your HIV testing, your age, your mom's mammograms,

738
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:03,630
colonoscopies, whole bunch of shots, depression screening, healthy weight screening.

739
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:08,280
Go on. Because you had just eight Obamacare free preventive care.

740
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:17,160
You could see 100 things on this list. Notably, Section 2013 was amended to cover COVID tests and vaccines.

741
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:28,919
So you have me to thank for that. Maybe. But so this is been for you who said it is hard to do or you to say what did you do on the policy thing?

742
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,550
Why I published and still perished. Right? As I just said, I have tenure.

743
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,230
I am going to be an outlier faculty member, not just in this school or medical school.

744
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:43,559
Very, very few people say, I'm going to try to make my idea a reality as opposed to just writing grants and writing papers.

745
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,250
Right. That was the decision I made, which turned out to be a good one.

746
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:51,059
Now, 15 years later. Right.

747
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,330
But it was no one encouraged me. In fact, I was discouraged by my.

748
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,870
Why would you want to do that? They don't policymakers don't use science.

749
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:01,530
They all these other types of things are people your age. I'd meet with you.

750
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:05,489
They would just be looking at their Blackberries. You don't know what those are. But Blackberries at home, seeing with your friends,

751
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:10,650
were meeting for beers after work and it was so unbelievably frustrating to be able to get this idea across.

752
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:19,110
So we got it into the act. What's amazing, your timing and I fault David Houghton for this is that if you weren't living under a rock,

753
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:25,860
which most Michigan graduate students are, you may have heard that just eight weeks ago.

754
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,660
The ultimate punch in the gut seeds of an ideological judge in the state of Texas basically

755
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:36,050
said that for all of you and everyone else but my greatest professional congressman,

756
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:40,320
he is going to overturn this nationally because of a technicality, which is legit.

757
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,549
Nothing to do with the content. It's just something that legally is that I don't understand.

758
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:48,720
And most of my lawyers around say, yeah, they screwed it up when they wrote the regulations or whatever.

759
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:55,620
And there is a chance that when you think here about verbatim free preventive care next it will be very bad news.

760
01:09:56,550 --> 01:10:02,670
It'll be extraordinarily bad news that this small part of the ACA, which has impacted all of you,

761
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,460
most of you with insurance, I think you have to have to go to Michigan,

762
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:14,910
your family, your friends, 152 million Americans have better access to preventive care services than they did before this part of the law.

763
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:19,799
And you can look, we did this great review of the fact that my mother was right.

764
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,560
When you made things less expensive, people bought more of them.

765
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,220
And it shouldn't surprise you that the benefits were greater in underserved populations black and brown communities,

766
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,940
rural communities, multiple chronic diseases, low and no surprise when you move a barrier if you have a lot of money.

767
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,370
No big deal deals, you have less money. So this is kind of telling when I was saying this is apply,

768
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,110
this is happening now we are writing and researching and doing everything we can for remedies.

769
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,400
If this goes to the Supreme Court, most people think, given the leaning of the Supreme Court,

770
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:56,220
it will be up this overturned, 2713 will be upheld and we would be back to the future.

771
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:02,250
I would be back knocking on every health plan door on your door saying, but come on, you've got to cover these things.

772
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,720
You know, they're not that expensive. They aren't saving, but they're the right thing to do.

773
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,200
And I have a paper coming out very soon, maybe next week.

774
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:17,370
I just got so nervous. I surveyed the national organization, a bunch of firms like your firm,

775
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:24,420
and said if if the Supreme Court upholds the reversal of 27, 30, 30, what would you do?

776
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:32,880
Three quarters said they're going to keep it in place. Now, that's better than I would think, but that's still is really bad for 25% of people.

777
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:37,620
But that's where we are with just people are just answering because they don't know who knows will happen.

778
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:44,160
My guess is to your point about inertia earlier that it's going to be hard for them to make changes because it

779
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:50,130
took so much work to put in the program to remove caution for these things that hopefully will keep them in.

780
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,840
So I want to close with two other policy things.

781
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,630
You can see this deck is all available to you. Medicare, this is the IRA.

782
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:05,250
So it was great. Some of you might remember the Inflation Reduction Act was this thing called build back better.

783
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,450
It was this gigantic program and a whole bunch of people were putting everything in there.

784
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,590
And I've been working on a bunch of things, even related things, for a very, very long time.

785
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:22,290
And you should know, I worked with the Obama administration, the Trump administration, by showing this bipartisan thing, which is very, very rare.

786
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,400
But who's against for the good stuff? Less and bad stuff, as long as you're not making me the bad guy.

787
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:33,030
So the IRA had four vivid elements that I've been working on for a long time.

788
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:39,029
And as you said, thankfully it should come as no surprise that the first person to bring an insulin

789
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:42,750
co-pay cap to the administration branch of the United States government was me.

790
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:51,030
And Donald Trump's administration actually put in the first model test of what was called the senior savings plan model in Medicare,

791
01:12:51,240 --> 01:13:00,120
capping insulin at $35. And how many examples do you know of a Trump administration policy being touted by the Biden administration?

792
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,570
So much so that he talked about it in his first State of the Union address. Right.

793
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:08,620
Because this is not I don't need you to basically say it's a good idea. I need you to just keep this going.

794
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,820
Who's against the idea of having insulin?

795
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:16,290
You have to have a bake sale for your kids, right? You probably heard.

796
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,990
Thank you. Starting January one, Medicare, $35 out of pocket.

797
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:34,530
The Democrats tried to overturn. So that was 50 votes in the Senate to put an out of pocket cap and commercial plans require 60 votes in the Senate.

798
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:43,649
Democrats wanted to get everyone on record on insulin co-pay gap and seven Republicans actually voted no.

799
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:53,160
Republicans voted for any amendments for anything on the IRA except seven Republicans crossed over to vote on the insulin co-pay cap for commercial.

800
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:02,010
Remember me when whatever happens happens two weeks from tomorrow during the lame duck session.

801
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,730
There will be a whole bunch of people or guards who, you know, that's I'd be beating the drum,

802
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:12,100
bring up the insulin co-pay cap when you can't blame or win anybody because lame duck,

803
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:18,860
we might actually be able to revisit the $35 cap for commercial you have to go through before the next year.

804
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:26,110
So we're very, very hopeful that. But why can't it be for all the other things that you could have on your mind that you care?

805
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,890
So I'm telling you to remind you, right, I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

806
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:35,379
This is happening, you know, in real time. We are writing new legislation to replace 2713.

807
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,380
We are working with all these things that I have no training whatsoever.

808
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,459
Figure out what administrative executive actions could help plug the holes.

809
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:48,640
What can we work with health plans and other payers to say let's just keep it in place because it's the right thing to do.

810
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,209
It is going to cost you any money and maybe you could come in and say it actually saves money,

811
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,560
which it doesn't, but someone else besides me will say that. So that might that might happen.

812
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,790
So that's what we're happen. Reactions. Comments.

813
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:05,540
Who hasn't spoken up? You've spoken of nothing to say no.

814
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:11,090
You like the idea. You're on board, you hate it, you do it, and you understand how cost effective.

815
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,140
And so this is what our cost effectiveness is determines the good stuff and bad stuff.

816
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:20,940
Right. And for you to say in this population, it's only cost effective, the same drug in another population, not.

817
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:26,160
That's where it gets tricky. To your initial point about why it's hard, which is why I do for below the ground.

818
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:31,550
So speaking for people on the ground. You're looking for.

819
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:41,150
How do we make the tactical smart? Right. So the spread is very, very broad from begging my head against walls for a long time.

820
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:50,000
You talk articles need to be smarter. What does that mean? We need laws to say that if you want to make something predictable, you can.

821
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:57,890
5 minutes. And most people try to run as far away from the Internal Revenue Service as possible.

822
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,710
I'm like Fred Flintstone banging on the door saying,

823
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:08,480
I don't understand why you at the IRS oversee jurisdiction over something called high deductible health plans with health savings accounts.

824
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,870
But because of the tax implications, they make the calls.

825
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:20,240
And there was a one sentence law that said even if you Ford Motor Company, which I worked with them, wanted to make insulin free deductible.

826
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:28,160
There is a line in the IRS regulation that says there is a what's called the safe harbor for preventive care.

827
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:38,990
2713. But you cannot cover anything for an existing illness, injury or condition bring up, which means insulin can't, which means like trauma surgery.

828
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:45,169
Talk about no moral hazard, right? Why would you want to have your life rude not only having a horrible event happen to you,

829
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:49,280
but then ending up with these extraordinarily financial toxicity that comes with it.

830
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:57,200
So went to the Obamas, went to Trump, said you need to start a path toward smarter deductibles.

831
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:05,720
Your that's your hashtag. Right. I want to talk articles on no deductibles, on high value services, high deductibles on low value care.

832
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:13,140
And July of 2019, just another great day when you say like, wow, you published into buried, right?

833
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:19,370
The IRS. They called me up saying, Mark, we're going to put out a guidance saying your dreams coming true.

834
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:26,240
We are going to allow health plans to make these services, these 14 services, predictable if they want to.

835
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:31,010
Not a mandate, but a voluntary thing. So it's a may not show.

836
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,870
So my friends in D.C., they're like, oh, we got the ruling. They're popping champagne and all these types of things.

837
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:40,999
But my friend from NASA's going to say getting the rule passed is only small and you have

838
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,470
to see if people actually do it because it takes work to change the benefit design,

839
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,460
its co-pay structure.

840
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,710
And of course, as a nervous evaluator, I would have been happy when 10% of people in these plans getting some access to these things.

841
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:04,580
And it turns out that we showed that 75% of firms made a change on the 14 services and 81% would go further,

842
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:09,889
which is part of our activity now to go beyond the 14 service.

843
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:17,780
More to suggesting there are people, evil folks like you who are warm hearted to say, you know, what are you or you know you all that.

844
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,559
But, you know, we can we can move the money around and the actuaries, we want to run.

845
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:33,600
So I'm going to end with this. There typically is a person who plays your role in real life and says, we can't afford this route.

846
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:37,990
Y ve been stopped. You know, is that you buy more things that don't save money.

847
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,460
You're not going to save money. So vendor comes in and says, Make this more affordable.

848
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:46,120
The actuary says, What? Premiums have to go up by this are deductible.

849
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,330
You know, it's all about pushing on this balloon. You know that metaphor.

850
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:53,950
You know, if you save money here. So there's a bunch of ways.

851
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,629
How do we pay for this? Do you want raise premiums?

852
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:01,600
Which is what I thought. I took one class like this in insurance, like.

853
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:06,940
Oh, yeah, if you believe a service is valuable, you just have the whole world shared equally from premiums.

854
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:12,730
That turns out the p part of your health management policy that is politically not acceptable.

855
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:20,920
You probably know of people who know people. Now we're in open enrollment around the country who choose which academic term really

856
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,450
should be health plans for themselves because they pick the lowest premium rate.

857
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:33,670
If any of you are addicted to sports like myself, you see a thousand commercials every weekend for car insurance.

858
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:42,040
There are some insurance companies that sell low premiums, [INAUDIBLE] coverage, and then there are some that sell higher premiums.

859
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,420
Better coverage like mayhem. Cover this more expensive. Jake from Allstate.

860
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:51,400
I don't know, Flo. I don't know who's selling what, but there are so many out there that they're always touting either my premiums are low,

861
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:56,230
which means your coverage is bad or your coverage is great and they don't talk about your premiums.

862
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,768
So you but many of you probably buy.
