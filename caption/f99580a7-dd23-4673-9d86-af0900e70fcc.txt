1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,000
Friday prayers tomorrow and tomorrow, then.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:16,190
Oh, God. Yeah, I could do after.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
What a bit of time you had.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:39,610
How do you know when you. So we can do, like, this plasma screen, right?

5
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:54,780
Yeah. On Friday. I haven't really seen him on his way home.

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:12,750
And so I've heard a lot of people begin to submit and some are feeling inclined to do that or help.

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:28,410
Everyone had a lovely holiday. So today we're going to continue our discussion of community needs assessment.

8
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,390
And then we will starting on Monday, resumed talking about international trade in the United States.

9
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,840
Today.

10
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:54,870
I just want to pick up where we left off and we were talking about the need to the needs assessment, again, is going to be variability in the steps.

11
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:04,640
For the most part, the structure and framework of conducting a community needs assessment is very similar from guideline to guideline.

12
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,840
But before we start,

13
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:17,610
I just wanted to call your attention to two new workshop reports from the National Academy that I thought some of you might be interested in.

14
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,370
Those of you interested in cancer care, especially those of you that may be going on to be dietitians,

15
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,190
that might work in oncology for your interested as a public health professional,

16
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:40,379
the top one promoting health equity cancer care is a new workshop reports and addressing structural racism,

17
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,490
bias and health communication that the foundational drivers of obesity.

18
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,030
Also in the report you'll note that there's a charge for support for these.

19
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,160
But there's also a download Free to the public, free to all of us.

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,520
So I usually just use my new Ms. account email account and I just say it's for educational purposes.

21
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,450
Okay, these are phenomenal resources.

22
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:15,059
These are researchers. So there may also be some community organizations,

23
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:25,200
but typically these are based on some workshop that was convened and researchers that are leaders in that topic area.

24
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:35,400
And in some cases there may also be community stakeholders involved, especially when we're talking about community based top topics.

25
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,059
So again, these are just phenomenal resources.

26
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:46,950
And so I just wanted to call and call out these two reports and they're easy reasons.

27
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:57,960
These are not complicated, but they're also a great place to get cited, you know, sources and and so forth.

28
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:12,330
But the other point I just wanted to highlight here is, is it just a reminder that your food for thought assignment is due on Friday, September 16th?

29
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,719
Both assignments in this class are going to be do on a monday to Wednesday,

30
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,600
but every once in a while they may be assigned to do on a Friday, just to give you a little extra time.

31
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:35,730
So again, it's Friday. Let's do it new hey by clock or 1159 in the evening, but it's due at noon.

32
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,580
And also, I just wanted to call your attention. Carol Shannon from our U.N. Library Services.

33
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:55,230
So it used to be Tubman Library, which is just down the hill a little bit at the medical school, used to be our public health library.

34
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,940
Most of us don't pull a book anymore because this.

35
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,410
So many books online. It's actually a beautiful I've got a great place to go and study if you've not checked out Tubman Library.

36
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:16,280
But anyway, Carol Shannon is our library services person for public health,

37
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,890
specifically for nutritional sciences, and she's going to be visiting the course.

38
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,959
Many of you are maybe new to University of Michigan or as grad students,

39
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:35,870
and she's going to be walking through how to do a search and that searches and having to do list reviews or any topic.

40
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,080
How do you conduct an efficient search using resources here at the University of Michigan?

41
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,390
She's going to be doing that on the 19th in person, but she has a module.

42
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:58,339
If you go to an I will I don't think it's published yet that day, but I will make sure it's published on September 19th.

43
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,110
I'll make sure that page is accessible to you and world.

44
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:11,260
There are modules that she would like you to go through before class, and there's a number of those.

45
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
I think there's only two modules, but there's some topics within.

46
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,299
You know, you're not getting graded on it. There are some quizzes.

47
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,120
You're not getting graded on the quizzes just to help you understand whether or not you gained the information.

48
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,820
But if you could please go through them, review them before class on the 19th.

49
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,140
It'll help. She's going to do some in class. Excuse me?

50
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,230
She's going to do some in-class activities in how to do conduct efficient searches or effective

51
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:52,780
searches and help you bring forward any of your classes if you have to look for scientifically.

52
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,100
And then I think that's it, actually. Okay.

53
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:10,780
Any questions about what I covered also today, your topic.

54
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:21,969
Target population, target community was two. Okay, so if anybody had any issues, I would assume you would have touched base with me before.

55
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,120
But if not, please grab me after class.

56
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,729
Okay. All right.

57
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:36,910
So today we're just going to talk about just types of variables, the varied variety of data or indicators that are found in assessment reports,

58
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:47,280
contrast and compare primary and secondary data, as well as the significance of including the social determinants and community assessments.

59
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,819
And so again, we're just going to be covering data.

60
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm specifying the type of data that's needed.

61
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,260
And then is there existing data or do we need to collect new data?

62
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,740
And obviously once you collect the data that needs to be presented in a format that is meaningful, facilitates interpretation,

63
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,600
so that anyone reading the report will understand the significance of this data,

64
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:27,790
as well as for those who are going to provide recommendations and priorities based on the data.

65
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:40,600
Okay. So in general, I think it's safe to say that most, if not all, community needs assessment are going to have demographic and economic data.

66
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:46,390
So what would be economic? Demographic data? Household income?

67
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:56,190
Household income? CAITLYN Oh, age ranges, age ranges.

68
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,170
And that's based on population distribution in the US right now.

69
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:13,270
But employment, employment and those that are employed, unemployed and there's even maybe even deeper into those.

70
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,390
What else? Race. Race.

71
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,050
Ethnicity? Yeah. Family members.

72
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,810
What's that? Number of family members? Yep.

73
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,750
Family members. Household makeup.

74
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,990
What else got his education attained?

75
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:44,020
Yeah. Educational attainment. Employment status.

76
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,630
One or two. Yeah. Employment status, yeah.

77
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,460
Yeah. Living situation? Yes. Living situations.

78
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,749
Yeah. And think of anything else that might be like prevalence of disabilities or something like that.

79
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:16,210
Be part of it. Yes. So, yes, it let me ask, where do we get most of this data from in the United States census?

80
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,790
Yeah, U.S. Census Bureau. It is a plus for us, meaning full loads of data.

81
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,500
So there's a lot of even the social indicators for the U.S. Census Bureau.

82
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,010
So there's a lot of data in the U.S. Census Bureau.

83
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:47,480
You guys will have an opportunity to identify, locate data in the U.S. Census Bureau, extracted up it in a table and used it in a meaningful way.

84
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:56,840
But yes, short answer is there's a lot of demographic and economic and social coming out of U.S. Census Bureau.

85
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:08,180
Okay. Labor, manufacturing jobs that will come out of the U.S. Census Bureau.

86
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:16,970
But we also have the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So we have a number of resources in the U.S. but I it.

87
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,240
Okay. In addition to demographic and economic data,

88
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:33,220
what else would you assume would be sort of another huge umbrella of data that's included in an assessment like health?

89
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Exactly. Yeah, that often is the largest component.

90
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,580
But again, it depends on the very primary goal of the assessment.

91
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:57,540
If you have an assessment that's based on poverty, then obviously that one may have more demographic and social factors as well.

92
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,260
You know, jumping ahead when we're talking about health data without looking at the slide on the next brainstorming.

93
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,810
What do we mean by health kind of indicators would we be interested in?

94
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,830
Prevalence of disease. Prevalence of disease in particular.

95
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,840
Chronic disease. Chronic. And where do we get that information from?

96
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:34,420
Department? Yes, specifically data coming out of hospitals like discharge.

97
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:44,260
So oftentimes it's hospital wards that are providing information on certain chronic disease prevalence.

98
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:50,800
Okay. So the states have generally it's called vital statistics.

99
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,140
Some will be accessible. For some states,

100
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:07,180
you have to actually reach out and indicate what data you would like because it's coming from often discharge data from hospitals and so forth.

101
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,250
There's obviously going to be personal information that can be linked, and so obviously that type of data would never be put out.

102
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:25,420
And so certain states just have a different process of really enabling public access to vital statistics.

103
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,790
Okay. So prevalence of chronic disease or morbidity, that's morbidity.

104
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:42,310
Statistics. What else? In addition to morbidity, what would be mortality?

105
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:51,790
What factors are contributing to the top five or ten death rates in the United States?

106
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,890
Anybody know at the top one is transmitted by this disease?

107
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,110
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:13,840
But that's, you know, important information for a community, the county and so forth to know what the top factors contributing to mortality are.

109
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,370
What else would be health indicator? A health indicator that you'd want to include?

110
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:26,790
Right? Right. Birthrates. Yeah, but it's certain lifestyle factors like smoking.

111
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Any kind of lifestyle factor.

112
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,510
Where can we get? Yes. Health knowledge.

113
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,140
How much that people know about taking care of themselves? Yes.

114
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:49,990
So the knowledge, belief and attitudes of health and environmental factors like in your industrial site.

115
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,840
Yep. Yep. Environmental factors could be so.

116
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,250
Actually environmental contaminants from a waste site.

117
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,200
So there may be data on lead.

118
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,690
Arsenic if as.

119
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,470
And so forth. These are all chemicals that can be emitted from industrial sites.

120
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,090
Yeah. So there might be environmental data. Let me say, led in the water supply.

121
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,600
So where do we get?

122
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:45,420
Lifestyle or health risk factors like smoking, physical activity, as well as maybe some beliefs and understanding knowledge of health.

123
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,140
Where might we get some of that information in the US? The doctor's office.

124
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes, let me rephrase that, because I didn't ask that question. Well, where do we what surveillance system collects data in the United States?

125
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:09,350
Sorry, I didn't phrase that well. And Heinz does and Heinz does.

126
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,820
The problem with Heinz is that not all of it is cut out.

127
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:28,060
You know, we get some descriptive data for and Heinz, but and Heinz really relies on researchers, you know, taking the data and putting it out there.

128
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,130
Yeah. Instead of this acronym of PR. Yeah.

129
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,490
I and I always I stumble over this one too.

130
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:43,040
So it's the behavioral risk factor, surveillance survey, behavior risk factor.

131
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:55,760
So it's VR, FSS. Yeah, that's collective in every state and that's where we get a lot of our health behavior data.

132
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:07,340
What are people doing? This is self-reported because you repeat that it was VR, but it's the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey.

133
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,760
So it's the VR F se.

134
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,570
I think I have it in another slide. Oh, yeah, yeah.

135
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,930
But here you guys are brainstorming. You guys are doing a great job at it.

136
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,180
So yes, it's our VR, FSS, it's our survey.

137
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,010
I don't have a specific one. I have another slide that has a low birth weight data also is an important

138
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,960
because that can be sometimes an indicator of other issues in the communities,

139
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,200
county, state, so forth.

140
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,780
Okay. But other nutrition help there.

141
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,450
You guys have already given some great examples of health nutrition.

142
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:09,010
What kind of data might we be interested in if it was if this assessment had a strong nutrition aspect to it?

143
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,379
Yes. Proximity to grocery stores. Yes, proximity to grocery stores.

144
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,950
So this actually gets into food systems and data.

145
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:28,270
Right. Food access. Yeah. And we have a stores of that in the U.S., which is very useful for that kind of data.

146
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,260
What else? Security. Yes, food security data.

147
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm going to remember. I have to say, I have to remember which branch of the USDA spits out the statistics on food security in the United States.

148
00:18:49,330 --> 00:19:05,060
Anybody remember or anybody know? As I'm saying this now, I can't remember if it's the I think it's the economic the.

149
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,230
It's the IRS. The USDA. Yes. Economic Research Service.

150
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,530
Yes. Yep. Thank you. Because there's also an agriculture research, and sometimes they get those too mixed up.

151
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,890
So it's the economic research service, that arm of the USDA that.

152
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,460
We conduct a survey every year on food security,

153
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:41,400
and so they compile and put out the data every year on food security, economic reasons, research service.

154
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:50,710
Yeah. And we're going to revisit a lot of this data because this is part of our nutrition monitoring.

155
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,890
So, again, we're going to revisit a number of this. What else?

156
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,160
Anything else that comes to mind? Age at her age of death.

157
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,200
Age at that age of death. Yeah. That. Yes.

158
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:13,120
And I'm trying to think of and we have to have data on that.

159
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:28,410
I just know we must. That's not one you commonly saying, but we must have it because we like so much other data that Wayne County won.

160
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,409
Oh, it was in the Wayne County. Okay. So that'll be it would be interesting to know, I'm assuming.

161
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:40,720
So that's going to be a vital statistic, one that's coming from the states, from death certificates.

162
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,820
Yeah. Yeah. What else? What? Obesity rates?

163
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:56,970
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Availability and for the consuming food availability.

164
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:09,280
Yes. Food availability. Yeah. There's going to be.

165
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,860
So the food availability data is we're going to be covering that actually on Monday.

166
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,980
And that is not something that is actually surveyed of individuals in the United States.

167
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,590
Instead, it's part of its data of what food is available in the United States.

168
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:42,380
But almost all countries have that type of data, food supply data, what's available for the population?

169
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,780
Think of anything else when school lunches be part of it?

170
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:03,120
Could be. Yeah, especially children. And part of that is children are a key component, if not the whole sustenance of children's business,

171
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:15,540
school food and grocery stores like they very well may include that because that's an issue in terms of food access and.

172
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

173
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:28,589
Do they try for any, like nutrient efficiencies, like vitamin B, like the iron and that kind of stuff in a community needs assessment.

174
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,549
That is not that is that's a little. Well, let me take a step back.

175
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:46,380
If it's about kids and if there is a particular concern, I have not seen in the assessment reports that I've seen with kids, I've not seen specifics.

176
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:56,610
Micronutrient deficiencies. I've seen food concerns like, you know, soft drink consumption or or added sugars.

177
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:06,240
Now, that being said, in countries that or communities in countries where there is issues with malnutrition,

178
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,990
that very well could be an indicator that is being monitored.

179
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:19,809
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not saying that this not a needs assessment that was done in this country that might maybe monitor iron and children.

180
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:31,870
But I haven't seen a specific micronutrient addressed as that tends to be fairly specific or work for a needs community needs assessment.

181
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,050
Yeah. Yeah. What about already governmental programs?

182
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,210
I mean, works for. Yes. So as part of the inventorying, the resources.

183
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:50,200
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. What resources are in the community that relate to nutrition and health?

184
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,880
Because that's part of the assets of the community.

185
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,980
I don't know who would be like on a survey, but do they care about people's level of knowledge on nutritional matters?

186
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,460
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, they can.

187
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,510
Yeah.

188
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:13,060
The assessments on kids, do they take into consideration things like when I take my kids, that pediatrician they're asking you to monitor in house?

189
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,710
Do they wear a seatbelt or sit in a car seat? Do they wear a helmet when they bike or rollerblade?

190
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,400
Do they take into consideration just safety issues for content? Yeah.

191
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:29,739
Yeah. Yeah. It really does come down to the goal or the overarching purpose of the assessment.

192
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,820
But those can come into play. Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Okay. You guys got all of it at the inception.

194
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,100
Maybe physical activity levels and breastfeeding rates, but.

195
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,620
Yeah. Okay.

196
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,600
I just wanted to quickly review primary data versus secondary data.

197
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,650
So that was actually highlighted in the quick assessment report.

198
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:07,510
Primary data is collected first hand and is part of the community assessment planning.

199
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:20,650
So in other words, in the planning phase, when data is the data that is decided is needed for this assessment and at that time,

200
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,830
there may be data that's required that's not already out there.

201
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,000
And so a decision is made. We need to collect this data.

202
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:41,290
We need to develop a survey administered, administer it to the target population and collect that data and present it in the assessment.

203
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,970
So primary data is collected specifically for the assessment.

204
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,810
In the wake needs assessment.

205
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:06,060
What would be an example? Does anybody remember or anybody, any of the data jump out that you thought, oh, that would be the primary,

206
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:17,340
secondary, primary, primary primary could be like if you wanted to survey for like what needs to be explained,

207
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:30,270
like, hey, you could if there was concerns that there wasn't data like internal data that they don't put out to the public but how themselves.

208
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:44,670
Yes. And specifically what I noticed is they had some data in terms of they interviewed with participants, which agencies as well as staff.

209
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:57,450
And that's common when agencies need to do their own needs assessment, they will survey the clients that they serve or care for.

210
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:04,700
They'll also survey their own staff. To determine if staff is satisfied working there.

211
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,800
Are there any issues? Likewise, any participant's clients are surveyed to find out if the services are meeting their needs.

212
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,200
And I think that makes all sense, right?

213
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:24,610
In an assessment, especially if it's an agency, they want to know are they actually doing what they need to for participants?

214
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:32,140
And then also, is staff happy the job, the staff, you know, are there any concerns coming from staff?

215
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:38,110
So that's those are great examples of primary data and you'll see that data in the wick assessment.

216
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:46,420
Think I have an example here. And then secondary data has already been collected by another agency.

217
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:52,390
So that's U.S. Census Bureau, that's the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey data.

218
00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:00,650
It's data that may be collected by a foundation. And so forth.

219
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:13,800
Okay. So. Secondary data is what you guys are going to be locating and compiling for your needs assessment.

220
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:21,360
And I will say that for community needs assessments, a vast majority of the data is secondary data.

221
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:30,120
Unless they have the funding or if it's an agency where they have internal data or they've conducted their

222
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,800
own surveys and collected primary data for the way the Wayne County assessment that how secondary data.

223
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:53,220
Okay. Yep. If you go through and look, you will see if it's a if it's a well-developed community assessment report under every figure or graph,

224
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:01,560
there should be a footnote that says where the data came from and in the way they used a lot from the U.S. Census Bureau.

225
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:08,999
Um, I've talk my head, I can't remember some of the other secondary data sources,

226
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,890
but it's so there's a lot, there's a lot of data that can be gathered that's already been collected.

227
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:25,470
They don't have to start from scratch. So 2016 unemployment rate published in a report.

228
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,030
Primary or secondary? Secondary, right.

229
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,690
It comes from labor statistics, U.S. Census Bureau. This is from the week before.

230
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,059
This is about services that need improvement.

231
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,360
According to which staff in primary and secondary.

232
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:55,320
Yeah. This is a great example of them administering a survey to this staff regarding everything from breastfeeding,

233
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,260
counseling, quality control or improvement program coordination, staff training, and so forth.

234
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,300
So the important take home point is that assessments are a mix of primary and secondary.

235
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,059
Given the fact that you have surveys that have to be developed, collected with agencies,

236
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:29,250
there can be faster turnaround time if this is a community wide assessment that maybe a hospital may be initiating.

237
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:37,830
These can take a year. But more to conduct because it could take a while, especially if they're collecting primary data.

238
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:53,579
Okay. I'm going to jump over these because you guys have already kind of touched upon one thing that I wanted to highlight here is this.

239
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,970
You know, there's a mix of both internal data.

240
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,309
So again, this is from the Wake Assessment Report. So we have in the middle.

241
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,380
So on the column on the left, we have race, ethnic distribution or just titles.

242
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,770
And then we have in the middle column participants of the Montana Way.

243
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:23,400
So again, this is internal data. And then on the far right, we have race, ethnic distribution for the state of Montana.

244
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:32,460
That's going to come from the U.S. Census Bureau. So this is an example where we may have a mix of data that was collected internally.

245
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,120
Primary data coupled with secondary data.

246
00:31:44,880 --> 00:32:01,560
Okay. The other point I wanted to make here is that so this is an example of data from the Wayne County Community Assessment Report.

247
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,400
This is a mix of data. So you see up here underneath the legend.

248
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:13,290
It says Source American Community Survey. That's the U.S. Census Bureau.

249
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,750
So this is data did not graduate from high school.

250
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,829
Households without a vehicle. Families living in poverty.

251
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,670
Households without Internet. That is all data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

252
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:37,659
But Dana, the campaign here. It's demographics, social,

253
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:50,800
but it's simply a below average community because it's not it doesn't have access to a lot of Internet in comparison to like the Detroit area.

254
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,320
Right. So it's providing some information on the social environmental factors.

255
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,590
This is essentially social determinants of health.

256
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:20,820
I mean, these are an example of determinants. And this is key because know assumptions are can be made when one is developing programs.

257
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:27,930
Oh well let's do a telehealth and folks can access it that way.

258
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,090
No, maybe not.

259
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:39,330
I mean, I've seen community needs assessments that have surveyed the community to find out how many folks have smartphones for that very reason.

260
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,600
We cannot make assumptions when we're developing programs to assume that everybody is going to have access.

261
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,920
So that's why these social determinants are so critical, be included in an assessment.

262
00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:02,010
But I wanted to just this one I just want to call your attention to when they did their assessment, they also collected primary data.

263
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:12,630
They conducted a survey to ask residents some of what are some of the key concerns they had or issues that need to be addressed.

264
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,820
And the residents consider grocery stores an important quality of life asset.

265
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,120
They also consider access to healthy foods as the most important and priority to address.

266
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,140
This is key, and this is one of the reasons why I wanted to highlight this.

267
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,950
This is help going to help inform the priorities recommended at the end of the report.

268
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,390
And this is a great example of serving community members.

269
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,910
What do you think is the most important priority that should be addressed in your community?

270
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:56,940
And so they collected data and information from the community on what they feel is most important.

271
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:12,300
Okay. I also just wanted to shout out that community assessments are done not just in the United States.

272
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:19,960
They're done in many countries. So this is an example of a community assessment that was conducted in Taiwan,

273
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:29,500
and it was conducted specifically targeting the aboriginal people of Taiwan.

274
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:40,629
And one of the issues that came out of this is that there was so little secondary data specific to indigenous populations in

275
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:50,860
Taiwan that primary data had to be collected and they ended up publishing it because it will likely be useful for others.

276
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,280
So this is an example of one that was published.

277
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,630
I can't remember if I found where I found this. But anyway, most needs assessments are made publicly available.

278
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:14,070
That's the whole point of them. Anybody in the community should be able to access the needs assessment and read it so they're all made public.

279
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:24,390
For the most part, there may be some countries that may not publish so readily, but this is an example of one that was published some.

280
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:37,600
Okay. And these are just some more examples of where we get I think we've covered almost all of these in our discussion.

281
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,770
Those of you who selected Washtenaw County are a community.

282
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,140
Locally, Ann Arbor, Ypsi or so forth.

283
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,960
So in Washtenaw County this our county actually collects county level data.

284
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,350
So you'll have access to some county. You get to see what county level data might look like.

285
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,950
Okay, not all counties have the funding resources infrastructure to do that, but there are some.

286
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,620
So this is a good example of county level.

287
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:20,470
And even if you didn't pick a, you know, in our community in Washtenaw, you'll still have an opportunity to take a look at it.

288
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,480
Okay. I want to circle back to social determinants again,

289
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:42,820
sizing the importance of including it in a needs assessment and certainly back to what was published in the Wayne County.

290
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,990
This is one example. This is another example.

291
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:53,050
This is coming from this, not a footnote there, but that's coming from the U.S. Census Bureau.

292
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,270
Why is rent data important to include in a needs assessment?

293
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:06,670
How much of the entire income takes up? Okay, how much of a person's income it takes up?

294
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:17,840
And why is that concerning? All, the more it takes up, the less there is to spend on other things that are necessary, like food exportation.

295
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,720
So it's important to think about the flexibility that individuals have, a household has, if they want a roof over their head.

296
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,160
There's not much elasticity in making rent you happy.

297
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Generally speaking, they need to make rent. So then we're talking about utilities and other expenses like food.

298
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:49,260
And this is where we see people having to cut back maybe prescription drugs, they have to cut back.

299
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,760
So this data is critical. That's part of the social determinants of the housing.

300
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,840
Why housing can impact a person's health.

301
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:18,350
What other factors about housing? SPENCE Yeah, well, kind of related in the Wayne County data, they were also showing like the changes in population,

302
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:26,600
so people leaving certain areas and that has to do with housing and wages and all those are important factors to consider,

303
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,350
like who is leaving the community. Right. Right.

304
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:39,420
And what's happening in Detroit with rent and housing prices, it's gone.

305
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:48,800
Gentrification is going up, and that's going to impact individuals ability to meet, rent, buy a house.

306
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,169
Yeah, well, I just have a general question in terms of kind of like looking at this and thinking about it.

307
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,659
Like when you see like Dickinson County, it's like 28%, 24.6%.

308
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,770
But then in Michigan, it's 44.3. Like what?

309
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,799
I'm just trying to think about in terms of like salaries and how cost of living is going

310
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,640
to affect like you're going to get paid more for the same job and like maybe Ann Arbor,

311
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,740
then you might in another spot just.

312
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,890
And so like with that, that's not really a question, but I'm just trying to think about like how that plays into these.

313
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,610
Like, is it lower just cost of living lowered one area.

314
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,790
But wages are like, you know. I know.

315
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:36,890
So you're highlighting a really important point. Do wages do wages change?

316
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,430
Do we see a change in wages when rents go up?

317
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,380
Yes. Not always.

318
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:52,409
And in fact, that's and that's one of the key issues in Detroit is rents.

319
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,750
And this is happening in other cities as well.

320
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:07,980
So in some cities where the median income may not be as high as the state, but now we're seeing rents and the cost of housing going up.

321
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:15,870
You've got a disconnect now of how much individuals are making versus how much money they actually have to spend on housing,

322
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,730
utilities, food, transportation and so forth.

323
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:36,120
So I just think this is a good example of why housing is a key social determinant, why it's something we have to really learn more about.

324
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,860
I just wanted to do a shout out this. I just came across my email this morning.

325
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:49,440
So this is a researcher, faculty member from Health Behavior Health Fed right here in the School of Public Health.

326
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,830
She's in one of our departments, and she says her research is to study the link between public health and housing.

327
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:08,190
I will post this slide, but I think if you just did a quick search of her name and housing and public

328
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,839
health in the School of Public Health website or the University of Michigan,

329
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,310
you can. The article is really interesting, and I encourage all of you to take a look.

330
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:25,320
It's not long, but it highlights some really important points about why housing is such a concern and respect to our health.

331
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,750
Okay. How are you guys doing hanging in there?

332
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,370
Yeah. All right. I'm going to forge ahead.

333
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:57,840
I forge ahead. And you guys want a five minute break? We continue continue the motor through sources for data on social determinants of health.

334
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:08,370
This is just resources for you guys. You will use some for your needs assessment, but you're likely going to get it from the U.S. Census Bureau.

335
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:15,840
But I just moving forward as professionals, I wanted you to be aware of where you can access data,

336
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:22,350
social determinants, data, and these are all great resources.

337
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,620
And examples of social determinants from the U.S. Census Bureau's here on the far left.

338
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,800
And then these are just the links for various resources on the right.

339
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,310
Oh, my. I motored through faster than I realized.

340
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:56,830
Okay, everyone, any questions? So again, the purpose today was just to go over data that we would expect to see in assessment.

341
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:03,729
Also to highlight that we're seeing more and more social determinants of health data included and

342
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:09,790
they should be and they need to be is critical because that's important data for program planning,

343
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:21,759
because remember, the whole purpose or often the overarching purpose of assessment is to meet is to determine

344
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,590
unmet needs and often develop a program or identify an agency that can address that.

345
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:38,469
Any questions about what I covered? So this is providing you sort of a background in the assessment.

346
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:46,030
This also provides you information when we move forward with your project because you're going to be collecting data again,

347
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:51,820
using secondary data to do a mock needs assessment for your community.

348
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,740
So these are all resources that you can use. Okay.

349
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,050
I just want to go over the next assignment. This is going to get you.

350
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,110
This is the next step in your needs assessment project.

351
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,830
You guys submitted your topics to target population, community and so forth.

352
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,750
Liz and I will be going over them the next 24 hours or so.

353
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:26,820
If you haven't heard from any of them, either Liz or myself, in the next day or so, you can assume you can move ahead.

354
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,530
Well, you'll know, because we all have said it's complete. You've got a grade.

355
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,000
And if there's no comment, like, oh, this is too specific, we recommend this, then go ahead.

356
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,230
You can move ahead. Okay. And actually, all of you should be able to.

357
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:49,980
So I think our comments will be self explanatory so that the only time that we make recommendations is if you pick a topic that's too specific,

358
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,580
we recommend kind of step back and broaden it a bit. Okay.

359
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:00,060
So the next step is your background section. And this is due the end of September.

360
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:12,540
The purpose of this is to provide a context for your needs assessment as well as an opportunity to get into the literature,

361
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:22,680
as I used to tell students, dig into the literature regarding your topic or your nutrition concern or health concern and.

362
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,640
These are not all the instructions. They're most of the instructions.

363
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,799
But when I read this in class,

364
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:39,450
please make sure you always go to the assignment and canvas and go through it in its entirety because I don't cover everything.

365
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,790
I just want to cover the key points that I want to just explain.

366
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:55,770
So the first step of your background is to simply state what the goal is, and that's your basically your title, right?

367
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:04,470
It's the purpose. It's the nutrition concern or health concern, the target population and the community in a statement.

368
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:15,210
So all I going to do is just do a standalone. What is your goal so that Liz and I know right from the get go your goal is a copy of the assessment.

369
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,020
Part two is where are you going to provide an overview of your nutrition or health

370
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:30,270
concern utilizing at least two sources from the scientific literature in this discussion?

371
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,170
You can use more sources, but I want at least two.

372
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:45,470
Okay. So why is your nutrition concern or health concern a public health concern?

373
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,300
And I know some of you selected your topic is just simply health.

374
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,790
So why is the health of the community a public health concern?

375
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:02,410
You can take whatever angle you want on it. If you want to just talk about chronic disease.

376
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,870
You want to just talk about the overall well-being of the community.

377
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:18,440
That's fine. Okay. Most of you have sort of a specific like food access or food insecurity and so forth.

378
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:18,919
But again,

379
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:29,150
those of you have just sort of a broad health that you're assessing the health of adults in Ann Arbor pick some aspect of health to answer it.

380
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,110
Part two. Okay. So the question is how why is the concern,

381
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,739
a public health concern in communities include in your discussion whether there

382
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:44,510
is evidence of disparity with respect to the nutrition or health concern.

383
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:50,120
Using at least one citation in the scientific literature.

384
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,850
Okay. Most of us can sort of speculate.

385
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,870
We believe certain things. That's great.

386
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:06,020
But none of us are at the point of our careers where we can make blanket statements and not cite them.

387
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:20,810
Right. So if you have a very definitive statement that, you know, obesity and overweight are factors that increase the risk of chronic disease.

388
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:25,430
I want a citation. Okay. And the reason is,

389
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:37,160
is because this is a professional document and all of you need to get used to when you're producing professional documents as you're out working.

390
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,159
You need citations because anybody who reads it may not understand or know that information,

391
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,170
and they want to be able to go and look it up and learn more about it.

392
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,220
Okay. So it's really important to cite your statements.

393
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,820
Any questions about that so far? Yeah.

394
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,740
Which would be like the best source to find.

395
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,030
Oh, this is a disparity. Like how?

396
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:13,460
What a source that you can show that could support that statement.

397
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:19,100
So, you know, depending on what your nutrition topic or health topic is.

398
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:28,280
So let's say you have chronic disease and maybe you decided diabetes or if you're talking about chronic disease,

399
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:36,500
you could look at it globally and just see if there's disparities overall in chronic disease among race,

400
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:47,720
ethnicity, maybe gender, or maybe if your topic is chronic disease, maybe you'll say I'm going to focus, for example, blood pressure.

401
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:58,660
Maybe blood pressure is higher in men than women. Maybe blood pressure is higher in African-American populations relative to Caucasian.

402
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:05,360
So that's what I mean. When we talk about disparities, we're talking about there's differences in rates.

403
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:15,920
Is there a difference in food insecurity? Do we see more children versus adults that are food insecure?

404
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,140
So that's what I mean by disparity. Do we see differences?

405
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,170
And given your health concern, do we see differences in populations?

406
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:34,500
And that makes sense. Yeah.

407
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:42,150
So just to clarify, this part is a lot more broad. And then like we'll focus in on our community that we selected like Ann Arbor.

408
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,800
So this is supposed to be like specific to Michigan.

409
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,309
It's not specific to Michigan. It is not specific to a community.

410
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,490
Thank you. That's an important point. This is broad. This is just general.

411
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,970
Yeah. I want you to get some sort of background information about your topic.

412
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,740
This purpose of this document also is to give you some citations,

413
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:12,470
because when you start collecting data for your actual needs assessment and you collect education attainment,

414
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:22,790
I want you to be able to say in one sense, why is education attainment important in this document relative to your nutrition concern?

415
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,120
Why? Why? Why do we collect education attainment in an assessment?

416
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,990
What, how? What how does that matter to food access?

417
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:41,310
So. That circles down to the next step.

418
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,660
Part three is social determinants.

419
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:54,510
I've got how does Social Determinants influence nutrition and health concerns for each of the following determinants income.

420
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,020
Employment, housing, transportation, education.

421
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:07,560
I want you to briefly discuss 2 to 3 sentences per determinant how or why that determinant can adversely or negatively impact health or nutrition.

422
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:15,900
And I want you to find the citations, and because you're going to use those citations in your actual needs assessment report.

423
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:24,210
So this background is going to kind of give you a chance to do a little mini review that you're going to be able to use later in the report.

424
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:36,570
Okay. So it's broad. It's not necessarily relevant to your when I say broad, though, if you are doing adults, if your target population is adults.

425
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:44,600
Ideally, your citations should be addressing adults, right?

426
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:52,640
Your discussion should be addressing adults. For the reader, it would be a little confusing if you start talking about kids,

427
00:53:53,660 --> 00:54:00,739
about, you know, why is food security a concern with respect to adults in Ann Arbor?

428
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,550
And then you start talking about kids as a reader. That would be kind of confusing.

429
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:10,820
So if you if your target population is adults, your discussion should really be focused on adults.

430
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:26,770
If your target population is kids, then ideally you're going to be talking in general about why you know, why this is an issue for kids and so forth.

431
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,889
Yeah, so do the results of these studies or surveys.

432
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:35,740
Do they go to some sort of like representatives, like policy policymakers like to implement any sort of like.

433
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:45,040
So the assessment report will be read by individuals in the community who are interested in policy development.

434
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:50,100
So. Seven two or something like that.

435
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,440
Yeah. Are you talking about the primary data?

436
00:54:52,450 --> 00:55:02,050
But when a survey is is conducted and data is collected just like like if a policy were to be made, like, I don't know, like a nutritional policy.

437
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,489
Yeah. Like school lunch, like, boom. Like, who is it?

438
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:14,190
Like, is there like, city councils or like county councils are like, is that a state type of thing if.

439
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:20,520
Well. So the federal government. I mean,

440
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,899
we have a school lunch program that's run by the federal government and then

441
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,310
it's administered through the state and then through the school districts.

442
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,820
But we have legislation for the school lunch program.

443
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:51,060
Now, that being said, there may be flexibility in that and how it is administered that a school district can initiate some of its own policy.

444
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:58,560
And in fact, I know they can, because they the school districts need to develop wellness policies.

445
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,719
And in that, it can be everything from the types of vending machines you might have,

446
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,880
what you you know, the types of foods and drinks that are provided in those vending machines.

447
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,270
And it may also inform some aspects of what they do with their school lunch.

448
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,090
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

449
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:27,080
If my population is like children and like social determinants of health kind of lead future,

450
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:33,230
say, oh, let's say nutrition influences and children like lifelong sex.

451
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:39,739
Is that an important aspect to tackle with this, or should you focus on like the children specifically,

452
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,880
not like future outcomes of if this pattern continues?

453
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:49,870
So you can you can highlight future patterns, but you can also highlight, you know,

454
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,970
especially when it comes to, you know, some of the determinants here, like transportation and so forth.

455
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:03,050
You can talk about it from an adult standpoint because you'll be talking about it from the parental ah, caregiver.

456
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:08,090
Yeah, yeah. So just make sure the reader understands that you're talking from a caregiver standpoint.

457
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:17,330
If the household does not have any transportation, that has implications of uh oh blah blah, blah, blah, does that.

458
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:24,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just think there are finding for like points the third one for the social determinants of health.

459
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:32,570
Yeah. So it's that it doesn't have to be. So let's say your topic is like chronic disease and adults in Detroit.

460
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,900
Right. Would say so. It doesn't have to be data from Detroit, but it should be discussing chronic disease in adults and.

461
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:47,420
Correct. Yep. Yeah. Because the citations here, you're not going to find specific citations to your community.

462
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:56,450
I'm just you're just getting into the scientific literature to see what information is out there that links income,

463
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:03,560
employment, ah, unemployment, housing, transportation, education to negatively impact health.

464
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,600
And some of you may have picked food access, some of you may have picked breastfeeding.

465
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:18,680
You may not find a specific paper that links the social determinant to breastfeeding, but you may find a paper that links.

466
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:30,160
Some aspect, you know, one of the social determinants with an adverse effect on women's health, mental well-being.

467
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,370
It may not be specific to breastfeeding, but it's still about women's health.

468
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,070
So you need to just think broadly here for this background section.

469
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:46,250
Okay. Does that help clarify?

470
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:57,480
And you may not find a paper that talks about how unemployment can impact food access.

471
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,700
All of us intuitively. Oh, my gosh, a person's been unemployed.

472
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:09,990
You could imagine that's going to impact food access. Again, you may not find it specific,

473
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:13,170
but we know that there's papers out there that are going to highlight that being

474
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,910
unemployed or having low income and so forth are going to some adversely.

475
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:26,240
Impact. Yeah. So the one that you may have a little tricky time with is housing.

476
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:30,479
Just because the article of that faculty member from Health Behavior Health said

477
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,080
she made the comment that there's not a lot of research out yet on housing.

478
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:42,240
Do what you can in terms of finding articles that talk about how housing issues can impact.

479
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:50,720
Health. And for those of you that are doing kids or adolescents, the paper may be only about adults.

480
00:59:50,760 --> 01:00:00,210
That's fine. Just let the reader know that all you could find was linking housing challenges to poor adult health.

481
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,990
And just be clear about that. Yeah, I just took that.

482
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:12,840
So if there's not enough information on, like, one of the aspects of social determinants of health should be addressed, that there isn't as limited.

483
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,980
And for me, I'm going to be shocked if you can't find at least one article.

484
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,660
Okay. No, I mean, it's just one of the topics, obviously.

485
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:25,079
But we don't have to address all the social determinants you need to address.

486
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,740
All of you need to address all 505.

487
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:36,190
You have to address all five of those. Okay. So if there is not a source, I would be shocked if you can't find the source.

488
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:45,540
That's why I picked these, because I think you should be able to find a source that links any one of those to an adverse effect on health.

489
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:49,229
It just may not be your target population, but that's fine.

490
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:53,830
Just let the reader know this is. It was nothing about.

491
01:00:53,850 --> 01:01:04,530
You know, while there hasn't been any research on housing and adverse effects on children's health, this author reported blah blah, blah.

492
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,460
Housing impacting adults. Yeah.

493
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:16,610
And. Okay.

494
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:23,830
And then number four, you just are going to do a brief paragraph where you recommend three community

495
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:30,280
stakeholders that you think would should be involved in the planning process of this.

496
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,459
Community needs assessment, your community needs assessment.

497
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:39,940
So sort of think of yourself as part of a big committee that's planning.

498
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,600
This community needs assessment. You should be sitting at the table with you.

499
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,180
Okay. And you don't have to have specific names.

500
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:57,639
You can go back to that slide where we talked about potential stakeholders that should be at the table when planning a community needs assessment.

501
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,010
So based on your topic, your target population in your community,

502
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:09,820
I'd like you to come up with three potential stakeholders who should be at the table planning

503
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:14,690
the community assessment that can include nations that you know are in the community.

504
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,430
That might. Yeah, it could be an agency, right?

505
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,280
Yeah. There's examples on that couple of slides that we went through in the last class.

506
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,060
So if you need some ideas, some of you I know are from outside, you know,

507
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:34,210
from outside of Michigan and may not be familiar, especially if you chose Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and so forth.

508
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,530
So just broadly, who should sit at the table with you?

509
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,070
You don't have to be specific if you're not familiar with the community.

510
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:52,270
Okay. And the rest of the instructions for the assignment are just, you know, formatting and so forth like that.

511
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:57,790
The last thing that I wanted to highlight is the references for your background section,

512
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:02,950
which will also be the format for your command, your needs assessment.

513
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:09,580
The guidelines I use using are the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

514
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:20,860
The link is here. Once you land on that website, you just scroll down until you get to the reference section and it gives you provide two guidelines.

515
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:32,350
But basically what I would like you to do is the numerical numbers within parentheses at the end of the sentence.

516
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,580
So no, we're not using super scripts, we're not using subscripts.

517
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:43,840
Not that you would use subscripts. We're not using super scripts. We're not using the name of the researchers.

518
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:50,230
You're just going to use numbers within a parentheses. And this is an example.

519
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:58,899
This is from an old needs assessment background section where the requirements were a little bit longer than what you guys have.

520
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:08,170
So there was more this word text here. But anyway, the point is the very first reference you can see is on the it's at the end of the first sentence.

521
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:19,090
That's the very first reference. So it's number one within parentheses, the next reference, number two and so forth, you can see it's sequential.

522
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:33,040
One thing I just want to highlight is that if you reuse, I see my right here, if you reuse a reference, then you just highlight what number it is.

523
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,450
If you have multiple ones, I'm going to jump down to the very last sentence.

524
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:45,040
You have multiple citations for a sentence statement, then you just use commas right here.

525
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:52,990
And then another example is if you have citations that are specific to the topic.

526
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,920
So for example, in this statement, this is a statement here, it says, studies among infants and children,

527
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,620
a reported association between food insecurity and increased rates of iron deficiency.

528
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:12,729
This author wanted to make sure that you knew that reference for addressed iron

529
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:19,719
deficiency reference five addresses mental disorders with impairments and infection,

530
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,260
chronic illness and obesity was addressed by Reference six.

531
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:29,230
So that's another approach you can take, but otherwise they should all be at the end of the sentence.

532
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:36,460
Okay. So it's just it's much easier and especially in your needs assessment document, which is going to be a long document,

533
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:44,650
we know names, you know, one citation approaches the name of the researcher and then the day it just gets so unwieldy.

534
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,630
So this numerical approach is in parentheses. It's neat and tight.

535
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,970
And so, all right, that's all I have.

536
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:03,880
And this is just showing the citation number one links to your number one on the reference page.

537
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:11,330
Likewise, citation number two links to is pretty standard.

538
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:18,950
So this is a format that some students are familiar with and sometimes some students have some hiccups in this format.

539
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:23,700
That's why I'm going over it. Any of you have any questions as you're going through your paper?

540
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:31,820
You can let me know. Yep. Let's see. For example, like the U.S. Census Bureau was referenced before Coleman Jensen.

541
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:36,620
Yeah. When you're listing them like these just happened to seem to be mostly in alphabetical order.

542
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,270
That doesn't matter, right? Like you're just going to reference them. One, two, three.

543
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:47,270
Even if it's not in alphabetical order like you want to do. These are referenced in order of what showed up in the text.

544
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:52,430
Yeah, I'm just saying, I'm sometimes used to having it alphabetized and so it just is not.

545
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,999
That's why I'm saying this is a different format. This is not alphabetized.

546
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,650
This is based on what shows up first in the actual text.

547
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,110
So number one. Is this citation?

548
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:16,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These are questions.

549
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:22,260
Do you have a recommendation for a site for storing references as we're going?

550
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:33,780
So, Carol, Shannon is going to actually give you some ideas for citation managers.

551
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:38,190
I know it's been a couple of weeks. You guys can go ahead and get started.

552
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:46,980
And there are some free. And I can't remember last year she had a definitive recommendation to students.

553
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:51,959
I can't remember if it was Mengele, but there was another one.

554
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,630
They're free. So she will have some recommendations.

555
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:06,450
But you can look in the library for citation manager and there may be some guidance at the Taubman Library for Citation Manager.

556
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:19,230
Yeah, because I know there are I think there are a couple that are free, but you can go ahead and get started in the questions.

557
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:27,120
All right. Nice. Have a good rest of the week.

558
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:37,710
And as I said, we'll have the grades posted for your topic kind of pop and community within the next day or so.

559
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,120
And then you guys are good to go to get started on your diet.

560
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:55,140
Have you? As I started.
