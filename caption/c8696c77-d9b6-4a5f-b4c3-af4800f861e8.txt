1
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:48,130
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So we are continuing our convergence topic.

2
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:04,380
And so we are basically positioning ourselves to be able to interpret typical statements in papers when you develop a new estimate.

3
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,530
Let's say you have theta m. Hat is an estimate for some parameter.

4
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,570
As for the true value of the parameter theta.

5
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,190
And we typically say that, uh, uh, theta and head is consistent.

6
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,040
And they said, theoretically, this is just an example.

7
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:07,350
Let's say normal. With variants.

8
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:31,510
Insistently estimate it's. By.

9
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,950
Sigma squared. And so remember, this is virtually in every paper.

10
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,470
Well, in some exotic ones, the distribution may not be normal.

11
00:02:50,860 --> 00:03:04,170
This is a typical statement from your developer, and you estimate that so so far we can relate to the first component of it and to the sigma squared.

12
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:20,700
Um. So that means. To.

13
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:35,940
I think that's being consistent. Which means that most of the time it's a simple.

14
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,930
Not the strong consistency statements statement.

15
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,919
That means that this goes on. Probability is in.

16
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,280
Goes to. Infinity to. I constantly writes that in this particular case,

17
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,220
we consider as being an example of a random variable that is degenerate imposes zero variance, right?

18
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,560
This is a constant. Degenerate.

19
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,130
The variable that has. ZDF.

20
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,320
It's a 0 to 1 afterwards.

21
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,990
Sid. However, the general distribution rate continues.

22
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,840
And also there's another song, The Strong Version.

23
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:02,520
We have. Feet and heads almost surely ascend to infinity.

24
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,110
To that theater. Right. In which case we say. We have strong consistency.

25
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:26,730
Right. And there's another consistency statement and that is about the variance by it.

26
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,360
So it can't be about the original estimate, right?

27
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,650
Because now it goes to a constant. So it has variance zero and it's about some normalized the version of the estimate.

28
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,740
So some normalizing numbers there.

29
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,190
So we have better. The state.

30
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,410
And this goes either in probability or almost truly.

31
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,360
Is goes to infinity. Okay.

32
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:16,500
This. Right. The single. So this guy is the true.

33
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,560
Variance. Some normalized.

34
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:45,640
Estimate. Zation is used.

35
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,050
Eight and a half minutes. Not in the generals.

36
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,970
Okay. So that's the typical script that we're following, right?

37
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,120
What's still missing in that script is the symptomatically normal thing.

38
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:38,700
That we haven't characterized yet. Yeah.

39
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:59,070
This is about asymptotic distribution. Requires.

40
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,720
And you. A lot of convergence of concepts.

41
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,790
And we will have convergence in distribution.

42
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,860
It would be like this and we will have convergence week convergence.

43
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,360
Yeah. A wavy arrow.

44
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,040
I didn't know. It's okay. And so I'll define them later.

45
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,370
Uh huh. This is just an appetizer. What's. What's gonna happen?

46
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,760
Yeah. I'm having a new mode of convergence. We'll consider some relationship with the ones we already know.

47
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:30,130
So last time we looked at the relationships between, uh, uh, convergence in probability and almost true convergence,

48
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,480
we found that convergence in probability is weaker than the almost true convergence,

49
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,920
so weak that does not mean weak convergence that signal to the different kinds of.

50
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,790
Then. So with that being the case,

51
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:55,310
we looked into additional conditions that would allow us to imply almost true a convergence from convergence and probability.

52
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,240
And we basically found that.

53
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:14,240
That if the sequences are tiny, we have that happening with a sequence of random variables.

54
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:24,590
Or if convergence in probability is such that the probability of a soup of.

55
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,620
In. Going somewhere with an.

56
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,540
So that was. Then sufficient?

57
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:49,450
That's right. That's a stronger statement. So we shouldn't confuse it with the soup of the probabilities, because the soup of the probabilities,

58
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:57,010
a calculus concept and it's simply a it will be happening just because we have a sequence of number.

59
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,550
Numbers mean probabilities converge to zero.

60
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,220
Um. So we have.

61
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,340
It's convergence in probability. And this is.

62
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,850
Well imply almost sure convergence.

63
00:11:44,290 --> 00:12:20,650
That's what we had the last time. And that was it.

64
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:35,820
Right. Okay. So I will finish up the conditions that, uh, we can use to imply almost true convergence,

65
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,720
uh, with, uh, a pretty important one that's, that's being used elsewhere as well.

66
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,900
And it's called Braille. Literally.

67
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:04,090
Lemme. So right now I will just utilize it in the same fashion as we used in the previous lecture.

68
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,530
Um. Mainly as an additional as a stronger condition on convergence and probability.

69
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:25,240
That would imply almost full convergence. But it has a standing on its own unrelated to the modes of convergence, and it's basically like this.

70
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:36,210
So suppose I have a sequence of events. A m.

71
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:48,169
Right. Yeah, I suppose I have the I build the series by summing up their probabilities.

72
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,230
So and so one to infinity.

73
00:13:52,250 --> 00:14:03,690
From the beauty of a. I suppose this series converges meaning that this is less than infinity.

74
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,060
They? Probability of.

75
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,870
Leave soap. Okay. And.

76
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,129
The probability of an event that's there.

77
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,450
Infinitely many, uh, events happening in this sequence.

78
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,790
Uh, for, uh, a given ami girl that belongs to leave soap.

79
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,300
Then this has the probability of zero.

80
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,550
So with probability of one, there's only a finite number of variables are happening.

81
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,300
In this context. So let's do it.

82
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:21,030
Prove. And I will later take the aim to be specific ones used in the definition of convergence in probability.

83
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:33,750
And this would allow me to claim almost true convergence, because remember, one of the alternative definitions for was convergence,

84
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:46,440
as we proved probably the lecture before the previous one was that probability of name some of the deviations of acceptance from ex.

85
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,140
Greater than epsilon. So that had a probability of zero.

86
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:02,230
So this cinema provides us a bridge from a series of probabilities of events to the claim.

87
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,520
Of the almost sure convergence. Okay. So but the proof first.

88
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,140
So let's consider. The serious.

89
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:27,640
Probability. Let's say I'm considering a tail of my sequence entails.

90
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:33,610
Okay great. Legal and. Of a key.

91
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,440
And this is less of equal to the sum, right?

92
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,970
He created equal and of the probabilities.

93
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,750
Key. And because my series converges.

94
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,210
So this goes to zero is and goes to infinity.

95
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:20,340
Because the series converges. The series is numbers it's six Key Peele fake.

96
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:39,270
So this is basically a calculus fact. If I have a limit on the series, then the sum over the table goes to zero is my top point.

97
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,510
So the tail goes to infinity. Right.

98
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,809
So then from there, I'm writing it in the form.

99
00:17:48,810 --> 00:18:02,870
That's the limit. Is and goes to infinity probability union k grade to equal and e key is equal to zero.

100
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,400
Right. So then these are decreasing events.

101
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,430
Limits of decreasing events is the intersection of all of them.

102
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:35,770
Right. And I have continuity of probability. Probability and the definition of the limits of events.

103
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,900
That gives me the probability. The intersections.

104
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,980
And from one to infinity union key to equal and.

105
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,470
Okay. And this is equal to zero.

106
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,240
Well, the thing I have in brackets is by definition.

107
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,510
So. A.

108
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:30,200
And Girls to infinity. And this is what we wanted to prove, right?

109
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:52,190
Now another fact from calculus. This is a note.

110
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,300
So since we are talking about convergence of a series of numbers.

111
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,130
Right. So. We have some.

112
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,120
And from one to infinity, it's an. We have these less than a few.

113
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,320
So do you remember any sufficient condition that make that happen?

114
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:37,580
From Calculus. So in order for.

115
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:46,150
This too happens. It is sufficient.

116
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:03,530
Text and. As the order.

117
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:19,010
One over. And to the power one plus Epsilon.

118
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,940
Epsilon is some number greater than zero.

119
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,900
And that means that it's an.

120
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,330
Wealth must go to zero, as in goes to infinity.

121
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,100
Faster. Let's say.

122
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,020
What? Him? This is just a reminder.

123
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:58,370
The series. So, um, and that means that.

124
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:11,160
So if I now make a condition. So if I now borrow em from the definitions of convergence, almost surely, and convergence in probabilities.

125
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:22,260
So then. And there would be deviations. A and B.

126
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,630
The events of x and minus its.

127
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:37,200
The Equal Epsilon. The.

128
00:22:41,380 --> 00:23:00,290
The condition. Some of the series and from one to infinity of and less than infinity would mean.

129
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,740
That probability of ill will go to zero.

130
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,400
Now, that fact, per se, is just the definition of convergence and probability.

131
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:33,930
Right. But because of the serious context and the fact from calculus, this would mean that this probability would go to zero faster.

132
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:44,320
Then. The minimum required.

133
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,550
For one and probability, right?

134
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:59,050
So for convergence and probability. So my ends just need to go to zero somehow.

135
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:10,360
Right. And if it goes to zero at the rate of one over and one minus epsilon, epsilon is greater than zero.

136
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,900
So that wouldn't be enough for the series to converge.

137
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:23,020
Okay. So the corollary. Is then as follows.

138
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:33,410
Suppose. The series converges from one to infinity of ability.

139
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,620
And instead of and taking the events that.

140
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,030
Come from the definitions of convergence.

141
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:01,250
So then. It's in convergence.

142
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,820
Truly. Two? Yes.

143
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:21,500
And the proof is very short. So by the.

144
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:32,740
But I'll tell you lemme. The probability of flame.

145
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,440
So. These events.

146
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,970
It's an minus. It's a collapse of them.

147
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,430
And Cincinnati. Is zero.

148
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,010
Then we had. When we can see that convergence.

149
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:12,060
So this was one of the equivalence statements for almost sure, convergence.

150
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,930
That's when the soup of those events is. So that means.

151
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,300
And by the alternative. Cleveland's.

152
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:38,010
Statements. Show a convergence.

153
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,580
So this means. The sand was almost truly tracks.

154
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,870
So once again, we make a little bit stronger condition,

155
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:13,489
making the convergence of probabilities of deviations of exam from X and by the

156
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,460
amount greater equal epsilon for any absolute of our choosing greater than zero.

157
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,960
So this happens faster than is required. Just.

158
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,340
By making them the elements of that.

159
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:35,210
Most probably would just go to zero. So we make the assumption that the series needs to converge.

160
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,590
So then this would be enough for almost true convergence.

161
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,740
That's a consequence of me. But I will continue.

162
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,680
Lemme. Okay, then.

163
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,900
So if you remember in calculus, you also had the so-called Kashi sequences.

164
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,649
So you may have heard this this catchy name.

165
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:21,780
So this is a Polish mathematician in the context of Caché distribution, which is the one that doesn't have a name.

166
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,240
And that reminds me of a paper. So when statisticians.

167
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,370
When first the high throughput technology became available.

168
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,130
So engineers started looking at how to analyze high throughput data.

169
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:51,050
This is about gene expression, but they have. Thousands of genes measured at the same time.

170
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,290
And I came across an engineering paper that was.

171
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:07,720
Using a tissue distribution for the gene expression and then derived some methods based on the empirical mean for that distribution,

172
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:16,060
which was pretty funny because it doesn't exist, right? So one of the curious facts about this distribution.

173
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,260
So you may remember this from calculus.

174
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:38,040
So we had a theory in there that the sequence of numbers were just to.

175
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:49,360
The limits ex. So that's equivalent to saying that it's an easy to shoot sequence.

176
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,560
And the definition was for the cushy sequence.

177
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,370
That. The difference between two numbers.

178
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,380
In the sequence, supposed to go to zero when both of these numbers go to infinity.

179
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,890
So this is happening for any numbers and in them, regardless of how they go to infinity.

180
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,610
So. When that goes to zero.

181
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:49,010
So that's called the caching sequence. And this is yet another, uh, definition of a limits of the sequence of numbers.

182
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:58,640
This is a direct carry over of this fact to, uh, the situation where we have, uh, probabilities.

183
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,560
And random variables. So it's is called.

184
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:16,840
She? There are versions of it, right?

185
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:32,050
Rates in probability. And that's when for any epsilon greater than zero probability of.

186
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,600
The deviation between any two members of the sequence.

187
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,229
So this goes to zero. Yes, I am.

188
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,280
Go to infinity. Then.

189
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:56,750
So she almost surely. That's when they'll probably be with you.

190
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,080
And there's also equivalent definitions, of course.

191
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,690
Just like anything. So we're not going to do much with it.

192
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:12,870
It's just for your information. Sometimes it is actually used in the proofs.

193
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,630
Not that every member will read it in the course. That's why I'm not giving proofs or anything.

194
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:32,690
It's just for the fact. And then there's a theorem.

195
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:43,000
Without proof. That basically carries the calculus result over to random.

196
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:53,620
The variables exam goes to x almost surely or in probability, and that's equivalent to x and.

197
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,250
The she. Almost surely.

198
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:17,670
Probability respectively. This is why I.

199
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:33,750
Okay. So we now basically are almost done with convergence, with almost true convergence and convergence in probability.

200
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,000
So if we need any other kind of small custom facts about them.

201
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,750
We will basically address them on the fly.

202
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:54,270
And then coming back to the motivation for today's lecture, which was kind of a typical statement about estimates.

203
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:03,690
So we want to introduce a new version of convergence that will address the asymptotic distribution part of that statement.

204
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:10,560
And there are two convergences that are fortunately equivalent.

205
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,090
And we won't prove that equivalence because it will take quite some time, but we will at least state them.

206
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,390
And this is so the first one is convergence in distribution.

207
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:58,740
So we say that it's an convergence convergence in distribution to some limiting random variable x if the CDF x and converges to f x at each.

208
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:14,640
Point of continuity. Yes.

209
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,550
X. Okay.

210
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:27,310
So we have a CDF. Uh, it maybe, uh, it may have some jumps to it.

211
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:34,180
That's the countable number of jumps, as we know, because it's, uh, uh, monotonic, uh, bounded function.

212
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:44,170
Uh, they, and there are points of continuity or intervals of continuity where the CDF is continuous.

213
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:57,610
So if I have the CDF for sequence members m uh, converging point wise at every point of continuity of that limiting CDF,

214
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,260
then this is called convergence in distribution.

215
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:11,260
And then there is another definition inspired probably by.

216
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:20,239
Some functional analysis because this is that in spirit,

217
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,190
it's very similar to some of the statements occurring there, especially in variational calculus.

218
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:32,010
So it is called converging weakly two x.

219
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,140
So one is convergence and distribution. Another one is Convergence Weekly.

220
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,720
And this happens when for any bounded.

221
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:14,410
And continues to function. Yes.

222
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:20,600
We have. The expected value of half of.

223
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,540
And. Goes is in goes to infinity.

224
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,310
To the expected value of F of x.

225
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:45,089
Now the reason why it has functional analysis flavor, it's because it's a statement of some fact that takes place in a certain class of functions.

226
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:52,799
Right? So the bounded and continuous functions F and it happens for any function in that class.

227
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,070
Right. So it's a uniform convergence statement, uh, as far as F is concerned.

228
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:05,280
Right. And that way it's much stronger than this happening for one specific F, right?

229
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,770
Of course, for one specific F, it's trivial and it doesn't mean much, actually.

230
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:20,310
But what this is required to happen for a whole class of functions, that then becomes a pretty powerful statement.

231
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,550
Okay. And then that lemma that fortunately.

232
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,360
Takes place. It bears the name of parking on a toll.

233
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:52,590
The French name. That means convergence in distribution is equivalent to the convergence.

234
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:14,379
We are having it without proof. And because of this very fortunate fact, we can use these two definitions interchangeably.

235
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:20,450
Right? So we can say we convergence meaning convergence of distribution the other way around.

236
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:25,720
Right. And we get the flexibility in the proofs to use either one or the other.

237
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,700
Okay. Then trying to get ready to some of these proofs.

238
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,050
I need some further limits.

239
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:53,770
All right, so this is. Of addressing some of the issues on the fly that probably belong somewhere in the first half of the course.

240
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,920
So we have sequences of events in and B in.

241
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,460
Such that I have. The limits.

242
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:34,430
D of M. It's some P of A and it exists.

243
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,910
K and the beams are some events that have a limit of one.

244
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:55,250
As in goes to the CDC. So then.

245
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,130
Probability of an intersection b and.

246
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:14,380
As the limits. The same the same limits of.

247
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,640
Right. In other words.

248
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:31,180
So if I need to if I don't like Ames for whatever reason, for the purpose of my proof, I need to build an intersection of them with something else.

249
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,440
So as long as there's something else, uh, probabilities.

250
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,210
Go to one as it goes to infinity. I'm not altering the limit in any way.

251
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:47,350
So that's the sense of this lemma. Um, so let's give the proof.

252
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,350
So you can tell it's basically using instruments in the first half of the course.

253
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,380
It's a straight up. It's.

254
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:09,150
P of an intersection the m so I can write it.

255
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:16,459
There's probability. Intersection make a double compliment, right?

256
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,280
That's not changing anything. Yeah, I see that.

257
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:31,880
So I let one of the cameramen sink in, and then I have compliments and the inverted sign.

258
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,850
Of the operation on the sets of the union.

259
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,980
Then I'll write. The probability of the complement is one minus.

260
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,340
The probability of implementing union.

261
00:42:52,310 --> 00:43:00,540
The temperament. Then I will.

262
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:07,620
I have a formula afraid to rate the probability of union of events.

263
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,980
So that's the sum of probabilities. Each of the events.

264
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,690
Minus the probability of their intersection.

265
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:38,830
And then I look carefully at, uh. The members of that series.

266
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,910
So the probability of B goes to one.

267
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,020
So the probability of being complimented will go to zero and goes to infinity.

268
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,270
No. This guy, um, that's an intersection.

269
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,910
So it's less of equal probability of any one of the members of that intersection.

270
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,729
And for us in particular, the beam complements that.

271
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,710
Again, those two zero is in goes to infinity.

272
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:27,059
So that thing, uh, essentially is and goes to infinity goes to one minus probability of a complement.

273
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:36,300
And that is the probability of a. That's just what we.

274
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:50,030
Wanted to prove. Okay, then.

275
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,360
So why do I need it? I need it for the proof of the so-called Slutsky type statements.

276
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:09,970
No Slutsky means. So if we go back to the motivation and that's a typical statement right here.

277
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:21,970
So the parts that we have, the variables are consistently estimated by something, how this fact is used in the asymptotic distribution.

278
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,450
Right. Because we really know the variants in our models.

279
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:42,100
Right. We have to estimate it. And typically, the asymptotic distribution statement is made with the known variants and the limits.

280
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,450
But we have to live with the fact that we have to substitute a consistent

281
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:51,700
estimate instead of the true variance into that asymptotically normal statement.

282
00:45:52,270 --> 00:46:02,350
So the Slutsky type result tells us that we can do that without altering the symptomatic statement in any way.

283
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:14,660
So if we want a kind of a sloppy generic formulation of a smooth skin type statement.

284
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,680
So in a week. The Virgin's.

285
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:49,670
Statements. Just a weak convergence statement would not be altered.

286
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:09,490
By substitutions. Some not random.

287
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:20,100
Quantity. And by a random one.

288
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,460
They had. Girls in probability to the constant.

289
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:45,210
That's kind of a sloppy version of it. And we will see a bunch of specific rigorous statements of this kind.

290
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,810
Right. So if I have a variance in my, a true variance in my, uh,

291
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:58,489
asymptotically normal distribution statement for an estimate just developed, uh, then replacing the variance,

292
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:04,610
the true variance there, which is a random quantity by a consistent estimate for the variance,

293
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:10,580
would not alter my we convergence statements or some in distribution.

294
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:23,660
Right. So this is what LMI like this was for. So I'm just positioning myself to myself to be able to make those Lewicki proofs.

295
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:30,080
And we'll start with, uh, uh, the first statement of the type.

296
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,310
I don't remember which was the type that Slutsky actually used.

297
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,810
And then gave a name to all of these.

298
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:58,210
So if I have XM converging, it would lead to X that has some CDV effects.

299
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,600
And I have some random variable that goes in probability to zero.

300
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:22,430
Then if I have a statement of X and plus y am.

301
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,160
Then this will have the same limit. Right.

302
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:38,549
So adding something to x2x and that convergence in probability to a constant.

303
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:50,460
In this case it's a zero. Right. Does not alter the limits the convergence limit of example, which is still the x right with a CDF false.

304
00:49:58,390 --> 00:56:45,030
Okay. Well, we'll do it after the break. Okay.

305
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:55,690
So the proof. So the idea is that I want to squeeze.

306
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:04,640
The CDR between two numbers minus Delta and Delta.

307
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,680
So take. Some Delta greater than zero.

308
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:19,850
Right then so my way and is going in probability to zero.

309
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:28,800
So the. Probability that why am.

310
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:38,209
Is less equal, Delta will go to one and goes to infinity.

311
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:42,890
That's by definition of convergence in probability.

312
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,630
So for a delta greater than zero.

313
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:53,160
Then, uh. So let's take, uh.

314
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:01,220
Let's consider a CD of. Of X and plus y in.

315
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,260
That's going to be if. It's and swi and as a function of.

316
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:19,890
That's going to be the probability that X in class Y and is less equal x.

317
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:36,330
I'm considering the limit of that thing. As time goes to infinity X and plus Y and of X.

318
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:48,070
So that's going to be the same as the limit. Probability, I'll take the event.

319
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:59,420
And I will do the intersections with the event twice in grades equals minus delta.

320
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:06,010
All right. So I know that's the probability of this guy.

321
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:17,290
We'll go to one. Because why there is to zero in probability.

322
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,980
Right. That's the. A statement of their.

323
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,990
And then by the memo we just had.

324
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:47,350
Then my above. So if I do an intersection with something that, uh, whose probability goes to one that doesn't alter the limit.

325
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,370
Okay then. So let's consider now.

326
00:59:52,430 --> 01:00:06,950
Since I have intersection, I have two simultaneous inequalities a plus y and is less equal x and another one is Y and the greater equal minus delta.

327
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:17,629
That allows me to write that X and is less equal x minus y and that's from the

328
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:25,430
first inequality and from the second y and I have it less so equal x plus delta.

329
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:41,020
Okay. And from there in particular, I have that my x is less equal x plus delta.

330
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,220
Now. So if I have.

331
01:00:52,910 --> 01:01:10,280
From event a it follows me by that means that for that any element of the A is also an element of the B, the means that A is a subset of B, right.

332
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:19,780
So using this logic. So I just derived from a certain event.

333
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:26,980
Another one. Right. So then this event must be a subset of this one.

334
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:42,880
So I have the. It's and plus y and less equal it's intersection with y and greater or minus delta.

335
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:50,360
That's a subset. It's in less equal legs.

336
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:57,760
Plus the. And now the probability.

337
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:08,520
This one. Is there anything to be less equal than probability of this one?

338
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:23,310
Because of that relationship. And this probability is the CDF can evaluate that x plus delta.

339
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,559
Yes. The probability that something is less equal. Something, right.

340
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,480
So it's clear that something. And now going to the limit.

341
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,220
I will have the limit ascend to infinity.

342
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,260
Yes. Extend for us class and it's.

343
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:58,610
That's the limits of the probability and plus Y and equal x.

344
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,680
This is less equal than.

345
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:11,340
The. Yes, it's.

346
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,720
That's what this goes to most, that.

347
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,790
Okay. So that was one thing and it's another thing.

348
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:40,790
So I would consider X and plus delta.

349
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,520
So just bounded this limit by this guy on the right.

350
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:57,220
So the logic is that I want to do the same thing on the left for this limit.

351
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:06,840
And then I'm going to say that X is a point of continuity where convergence of CDs is supposed to take place.

352
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:13,660
And if it's a point of continuity, then the fact that my delta is any number greater than zero,

353
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:25,960
so I can make Delta go to zero, and by continuity I will have this limit squeezed to f x of just x.

354
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,600
Right? So that's the logic. Um.

355
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:35,520
So I'm considering intersections with y and less vehicle delta this time.

356
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,950
So that's another consequence of the.

357
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,820
Facts that this guy is less equal delta right.

358
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:57,399
Than I am is between minus Delta and. Then this will be part of the event.

359
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,680
X and plus Y and. Less ex.

360
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:12,570
And that happens if I just add up the simultaneous inequalities in the intersection.

361
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:28,479
Then from there I get that the probability of X plus y and equal x is greater.

362
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,760
Equal to the probability. And less an equal minus delta.

363
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,390
And this is a. It's an.

364
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:47,500
It's my. And as before, in the limits.

365
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:59,140
This will go to facts. Delta by the weak convergence of a6x and two x.

366
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:12,600
Right. So summarizing. I have the limits.

367
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:23,140
Of the senior center. Plus, White House of cards squeezed between U.S.

368
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:29,000
It's minus delta. And if.

369
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:40,770
It's still. Okay.

370
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:58,670
And I need to say that. So we not only take some delta greater than zero, we also take X.

371
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:32,640
At some point of continuity. But.

372
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:43,250
Yeah. Six.

373
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:53,460
Right then, because it is a point of continuity.

374
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,030
Most have AKs. I have stacks.

375
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:14,280
It's minus delta, uh, go into effect.

376
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:22,570
So that's. Plus or minus, it doesn't matter as Delta goes to zero.

377
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:28,540
That's just by definition of continuity and as this happens.

378
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,780
So with Delta. In two zero.

379
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:54,120
This staff becomes the if it's in class white and it's those to its it's.

380
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:04,980
For an arbitrary point of continuity, for any point of continuity, which is what the facts was.

381
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:08,790
And this by definition, means that.

382
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:17,070
Yeah. And plus, why am. There was.

383
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:23,460
Well, either weakly or in distribution. To.

384
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:29,220
Right. This is what. We intended to build.

385
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:52,799
Right. So we just showed we've taken a some right and perturbed the we convergence statement about X

386
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:58,470
and that it goes that it has X and the limit in distribution of the weak convergence limit.

387
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,460
Right. And because Y was going in probability to a constant.

388
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:07,350
So that did not change this entire distribution of the sum.

389
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,739
Right. So we did it just as an example.

390
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:20,610
There are many Slutsky statements because we have complicated expressions, we have products, uh, ratios, all types of things.

391
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:27,240
But uh, so you could use this, uh, an idea similar to this one to.

392
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,890
Furnish some of those statements. So we.

393
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:39,600
Uh, can have the product. So it's clear.

394
01:10:50,700 --> 01:11:03,120
So we have again some statement of we convergence, we have why and now going in probability to one instead of zero, still a constant rate.

395
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,939
So then if I have a product at certain times, why?

396
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:14,740
And I will have a saying. Leave it. With convergence limits.

397
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:27,460
Why it's so proves. It's archetype statements.

398
01:11:33,550 --> 01:12:00,910
Can be seen a lot. Then another lemme.

399
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:09,710
There is about the relationship between convergence and probability and convergence.

400
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:16,100
In the special case, when convergence in probability happens to a constant.

401
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:21,050
So that's precisely when we use it is a consistency thing.

402
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:28,980
Uh. So we have XM converging weekly to sea.

403
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,200
That's a constant nonrandom thing.

404
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:42,710
So then, despite the fact that it's generally weaker than convergence and probability of convergence and distribution.

405
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:49,340
So we do have convergence and probability of a center constant in this special case.

406
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:03,760
Yeah. The proof. We take epsilon greater than zero.

407
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:10,630
We consider the probabilities that would be implicated in the statement of this lemma,

408
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,280
which is the probability that x and deviates from the constant by.

409
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:21,180
Less than epsilon. So I need to show that this would be going to one.

410
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:28,050
So I can write it, just unfold.

411
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:33,420
So X and minus C will then be between minus epsilon and epsilon.

412
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:52,740
Then this is an intersection minus C being less equal epsilon and, uh, minus epsilon being less equal s and, uh, minus C.

413
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,260
So far we place both of them as, uh, by the CDF.

414
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:06,330
So I get F and it's saying F, C plus epsilon minus F, x and.

415
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:13,010
C minus epsilon. Right.

416
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:24,409
This would go because I have convergence. We convergence that's equivalent to the convergence uh, in uh of CDs at every point of continuity.

417
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:32,540
Then this would go. To the F only constant.

418
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:44,630
So that's the limit. It's C plus epsilon minus, uh, all the constants of C minus epsilon.

419
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:54,890
Now the F for constants. So, once again, what this is, it's zero up to that constant, and then it jumps to one.

420
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,410
So this is how we'll see. Well, thanks.

421
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,170
Looks like. Right.

422
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:16,740
So if I am to the right of the C and that's equal to one, and if I am to the left of the sea, that's equal to zero.

423
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:29,980
So that's a one. And because it goes to one then my in those in probability to see by definition.

424
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,520
That's the end of truth. Okay.

425
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,830
That's it for today. There's a new homework.

426
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:46,520
That I posted yesterday.
