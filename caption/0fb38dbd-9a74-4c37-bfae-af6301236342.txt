1
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,309
So we should talk about social identity in the classroom? Yeah, definitely.

2
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:39,370
I think social identities like our race ethnicity, but also gender, ability status, immigration status,

3
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,040
sexual orientation, any number of things and how it shows up for how we're teachers in the classroom.

4
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,940
Yeah. So our identities as we present out in the world and maybe even our invisible identities.

5
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,930
Right. They matter in the classroom whether we want them to or not.

6
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,390
We kind of take them with this wherever we go.

7
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,440
And so we have to think about as teachers what that means when we take those social identities in the classroom,

8
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:12,640
and then especially more so when we're thinking about deploying anti-racist practice in the classroom as well.

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,840
Yeah, definitely. So what does it mean for you and the identities you hold?

10
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:26,020
Well, obviously, I'm a black woman, so when I'm in the classroom, it does feel like there's a certain amount of risk.

11
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,140
Certainly a different amount of risk than you might hold as a white man teacher.

12
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:41,950
And so when I'm thinking about that risk, I'm thinking about the things that might be accepted for folks to hear come out of my mouth.

13
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm thinking about the power I may have inherently in the classroom.

14
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,170
I'm thinking about how effective I might be as a teacher.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,629
That's kind of on baseline.

16
00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:02,260
And then when I think about antiracist pedagogy, I think about the additional layers of risk, about disrupting whiteness while being in this body.

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:10,090
Yeah, definitely. I think for me and you, you you named it risk looks a lot different as a white man in the academy,

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,790
I'm working within an environment that, you know, historically was built for people that look like me.

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,600
And so what it means to be an anti-racist teacher means that I may be, you know,

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,650
pushing the envelope in certain ways, but it's it's maybe seen as innovative instead of as risky.

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:39,670
And so in that sense, I hold certain advantages because of my identities that when I enter the classroom, it's very different. Along that same line,

22
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,270
when I go into the classroom, it's kind of status quo, right?

23
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,980
There's not really any disruption just by the nature of me entering the classroom.

24
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,470
If I want to engage in anti-racist teaching that disrupts the institution,

25
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,799
I really need to think about how I'm designing the course and all these different things so I can be disruptive.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,510
But I am myself and my identities I hold aren't inherently disrupting the space.

27
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:14,800
But in terms of risk, I think, you know, as we've talked about before, anti-racist teaching is really all about disrupting hierarchies.

28
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,360
It is inherently about not just thinking about your own classroom,

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,850
but also the broader institution and society and transforming hierarchy in those spaces.

30
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:32,530
And so anti-racist teaching can be about pushing against that, those power structures and kind of the status quo.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,180
And that can be risky, I think, especially when you're a teacher that may or may not have job security or are concerned about

32
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,419
how you're going to be evaluated by people who maybe aren't engaging in anti-racist teaching.

33
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:54,100
And so I think that type of risk is is is true for almost any teacher that's engaging in anti-racist teaching.

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,880
Absolutely.

35
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:03,519
And there's definitely a spectrum, I think that by this nature of disruption, that there's a layer of risk attached to it no matter who you are.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,400
But certainly it differs depending on the intersecting identities that that you embody.

37
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,280
I'm also thinking about what that means when we are in the classroom and the

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,959
kind of reflection that we need to have as part of our antiracist practice

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:29,110
to be cognizant of what it means to be situated in certain social identities and to also understand the social identities of our students as well.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,490
Yeah, that's a really good point because, you know, as we've said,

41
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,730
the classroom is not divorced from society and so our students are showing up with certain social identities.

42
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,360
We're entering the space and all those power dynamics within society play out in those classroom interactions.

43
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,319
So what that means is that you and I could enter a classroom with the exact same reading list,

44
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,410
with the exact same activities and the way that those will play out and the way those will be perceived,

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,210
the way that they'll be evaluated by our students is going to look different by

46
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,040
merely because of our social identity and then the social identity of students.

47
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:20,530
Absolutely. And we have to think about what that means in terms of the choices that we make in the classroom, again, kind of baseline.

48
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,850
But when we're adding that additional layer of anti-racism, those choices,

49
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:34,280
feel like there's even more at stake when I'm thinking about the students identities versus our identities.

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,230
Is this need for, you know, making choices and navigating between what might work,

51
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,940
what might not work, that it's a constant kind of negotiation all the time in the classroom.

52
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:56,000
What's coming to mind as a particular situation in class where I was teaching about structural racism and in a group setting.

53
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,280
One of one of my students denied the existence of structural racism.

54
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,320
It really made the other students uncomfortable across the identity spectrum.

55
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,690
So all gender, all sexuality, all races.

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,120
Let it be known that they were really uncomfortable by the fact that this student was denying the existence of structural racism.

57
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,520
So there are choices that have to be made in terms of how do we address the harm that's been made?

58
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,390
How do we address the student who's potentially making that harm?

59
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,270
How are we addressing whether or not the concept of racism is being delivered?

60
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,630
Does that matter more or less than the actual safety of students?

61
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:43,270
And what we chose in the moment was that in our teaching team, there was a white man who had gone through anti-racist pedagogy training,

62
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,990
and we kind of deployed this white man to speak to this other white man student,

63
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,170
to have him think in certain ways about why racism may or may not exist.

64
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,290
And we knew that he would be interpreted and accepted in particular kinds of ways and if I approached the student.

65
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,060
So those kind of choices in the classroom are having to be made all of the time.

66
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,459
There was also a certain amount of risk that I avoided by not being put in that situation

67
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,290
that we made a decision about what kind of harm might be done to me as a black professor.

68
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,270
What kind of assurances needed to be made ahead of time with other people in the network?

69
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,570
So there's this constant negotiation.

70
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:33,190
One, when you're talking about really hard things, but even when you're not, the social identity can show up outside of those hard conversations.

71
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,950
Yeah, that example raises so many different things that are really important to reflect on.

72
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,370
And one of them is that, you know, in that situation,

73
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:50,170
you were essentially able to use some of the advantages held by a white male teacher to respond to the situation.

74
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,179
In other scenarios, you might not have that same opportunity if you don't have a teaching team or,

75
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,710
you know, and and then you have to make a choice of whether you're going to take on those risks or not.

76
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,130
And so I think that can be really challenging.

77
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:12,429
And the other thing that it really raises for me is that, you know, as a teaching team, you all decided the appropriate response.

78
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,250
And then you you thought through how a different teacher with different identities,

79
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,230
how it might be received if they delivered that, that kind of response.

80
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,740
And so, you know, it just highlights the point that it is different depending on who we are and what our social identities are.

81
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:36,970
And so that reflection piece of thinking that through, which your teaching team did and it's important for all of us,

82
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,630
I think is is critically important. Yeah, I think when we're talking about anti-racist praxis,

83
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,629
there's this iteration between reflection and action and reflection and action and then that space in between.

84
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:56,260
Right. And so it's really important for us as teachers to create that space for reflection within ourselves,

85
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:05,680
within our teaching teams, within, you know, all these different kinds of spaces so that we can make appropriate choices.

86
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,040
Also kind of owning and understanding what's an appropriate choice, right?

87
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:17,680
Like we're going to make mistakes along the way. Sometimes there really is no best way out of a really hard situation.

88
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,069
And I think that probably many,

89
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:28,060
many teachers can attest to being put into really hard spaces where they have to make a decision that isn't optimal either way.

90
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,500
But it's this idea of reflection and action that really does, I think,

91
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:40,000
push forth the practices of anti-racism in that classroom where we have a certain level of intentionality.

92
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,160
So it's about thinking about the harm. It's about the disruption.

93
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,260
It's about having the hard conversations. It's about, you know, flattening power dynamics.

94
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,260
There are all these things happening at the same time that that we have to kind of think about simultaneously.

95
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:04,030
Yeah. Now, that's a really good point. And there aren't always easy answers or path forward, especially if we hold marginalized identities.

96
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,870
Well, I've certainly enjoyed having this conversation with you. And I know, you know, given our social identities,

97
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,840
we haven't been able to speak directly to our own experiences with certain identities that other teachers may hold.

98
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:24,880
But that piece of reflection and especially finding colleagues or friends who you can talk through how

99
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,390
your own specific identities show up in the classroom and how that impact has in the similar ways that we've been able to talk about things.

100
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,320
But also we have other people we talk with. I think that's really crucial for for any teacher.

101
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,870
Absolutely. And I think having these conversations openly in the classroom really is helpful.

102
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,830
So that reflection piece can be shown and modeled so that students can understand how important that reflection and action piece is as well.

103
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah, really good point. Well, great to talk with you. Yeah, same here.
