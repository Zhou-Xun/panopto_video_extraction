1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, and like I said, if you wanted to chat you can just unmute yourself and and holler if you like. that'll be fine for the main thing that my goals here today is to kind of just very briefly talk about

2
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:40,000
what active learning is, and then talk about and compare contrast, attendance, space participation, which is a really common form of trying to assess students active learning, and compare that with inclusive base types of participation or active learning, and then I also want to

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
kind of describe some alternative strategies for assessing participation besides.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just you know, Button, c. at attendance. student is there, and then also list some of the tools available to

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The school. public health instructors that can be used to help assess some of those inclusive participation.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Active learning strategies. So, just as a little bit of a reminder i'm sure most of you have this kind of knowledge already.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But active learning includes these teaching methods and strategies that involve student participation into the classroom.

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So they are an active participant in the classroom and they're engaged with the material in a in a meaningful way. Right?

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So they're not just a passive listening to a lecture but they're engaging with the instructor and with the peers as well.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's an approach instruction that involves actively engaging those students with the course material, whether those are your lectures or with the readings, or any other kinds of materials you have going on in the classroom Do it

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
intentional reflections, discussions, problem solving case studies, role, plays, etc.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And one thing will I will show you guys, is how active learning is mapped on a continuum.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So this is just a quick kind of an assessment.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oops activities not found. Hello, Hmm one moment Let's see what's going on here.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There, Here we go. Yeah, it's coming up now? to just kind of see how are you guys are assessing active learning in your courses now.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you go to the website, you can also do this on your phone as well.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The link is up there. Pull upcom Monica Rosen, 984, and you can put in your end trees. For how are you currently assessing active learning in classrooms?

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are there certain strategies you're using discussion prompts or 1Â min reflections

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And Joanna has nicely put that link direct link to the pull.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Everywhere, in the chat,

21
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is some class participation. Yeah, that's a common one you're seeing discussions in class.

22
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You probably said a couple of minutes in class to interrupt a little bit

23
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So go ahead, move on. These are 2 really common forms of the assessing active learning.

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We also know. And one thing i'm also so interested in is you know, are there.

25
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So how So when we look at some of these different ways of techniques, we're assessing active learning. there is this continuum prepared for us by crt from the simple that is easy for instructors to imply that take

26
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
less time to the more complex that require a lot more forethought.

27
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We have reflections in the discussion. Sink pair, share kinds of strategies down a little more simpler.

28
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Aspect. and then we also have these more complex ones Experiential learning. peer reviews are kind of more in that midway role playing simulations that, you know, can be a little bit more complex and Take a little bit more time.

29
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But a little bit more authentic in nature. So when we kind of like, break up these groups of types of the simple to the complex, we know that the simple forms of assess of active learning take less time take less class time as well as

30
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
instructor preparation. they're normally on that more low stakes like the quizzes.

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They don't account for a whole lot on the graded components, and their purpose is a little bit more to give students a time to reflect on what they're learning right and the complex types of assess active learning.

32
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They're a little bit more engaging. They take a little bit more effort on the instructor side, but they can be more authentic, especially when you're thinking about who your students.

33
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are, and the types of things that they're trying to learn right So if you're in a graduate level, course you might want them to be a little bit more authentic right than on the on an undergrad class, so we'll

34
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
kind of in the next workshop I want to prepare one that focuses a little bit more on those complex active learning strategies.

35
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But today we'll kind of over them all so on when we looking at this continuum, i'm just a little bit curious.

36
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you if you guys could head back to the poll everywhere, link

37
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And this you should be able to click on on these i'm kind of curious. What experiences you have, or what have you used, and what are you currently using?

38
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As far as active learning techniques

39
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Got a cup. Okay, Studies coming in here, I see a lot of case studies in peer reviews and school public health.

40
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, and some experiential learning

41
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Arch: Group: Discussion: Yeah,

42
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Great causes for reflection that's always great kind of give a little time out, and and the lectures give them a moment to think about things that just stuff.

43
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Perfect. Listen, you give me a pretty good sense as to what you're doing, and I'm also interested in knowing which ones are you in interested in which ones have you not explored yet.

44
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But you're thinking about possibly implementing

45
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I think if you should re be a little refresh that I think it might go.

46
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, there we go. Jake saw a discussions. Is anybody familiar with that, or is that just sound kind of interesting to you, cause this is one that I actually had to read up on.

47
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I mean i've heard of it but I haven't actually implemented.

48
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I have some colleagues who've done it and for some problems.

49
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's seems like really a good way because you like remixing the group somehow.

50
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But right? Yeah. So i'm an at that, was you know one thing I clicked on like , if if finding you know appropriate, you know scenario was appropriate, you know questions or or class topics right what that might be an

51
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
interesting way of of using, of going about it versus just like discussions or something. right.

52
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So what Jixon discussions are are Basically, you have students that are broken up into different groups that have different types of information.

53
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So e. These different groups play a different type of expert in a different area.

54
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And so then you bring the groups together. and they each have to contribute to solving a problem.

55
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And so this is where it gets the jigs saw name because each person is basically a puzzle that they're trying to put together the full puzzle.

56
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's it's an interesting strategy for sure and I can imagine a couple of different scenarios, especially in public health, where this is like different players playing in in the public health policy.

57
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Which you can, you know each make a domain and they come together and solve a problem as well.

58
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So that's that's a great one thank you this also gives me an idea so like kind of which technologies might help with these different types of active learning techniques.

59
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So when we're we're designing for active learn we're designing a for us we're designing an assessment.

60
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's a couple of different steps that I think that our gets our mind in in there. second one is that we wanna make sure that we know what our course goals are. What are the course goals for The student what are those learning

61
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
objectives. and then step 2 is your is to define what your class environment is.

62
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So your class environment may be a large course with many students in it.

63
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It may be a smaller class, it may be hybrid.

64
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You may also need to consider who your learners are if you're teaching an online class, and you have students who are busy and have alternative strategy alternative schedules.

65
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
These things are all needing to come together to get an idea as to what your individual course environment looks like, and then step 3 is to decide which tools aligned with those course.

66
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Goals, or, you know, allow students to actually achieve the goals of your course. So it's not enough just to say I want to implement a piece of technology for the sake of implementing that technology you need to have a purpose it needs to align with

67
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the course goals. So we talk about Step one in defining what the course calls are for active learning.

68
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm certain that many of you are familiar with the blooms taxonomy that's what we have here on the left from shallow learning at the remembering stage up to the higher creation, stage, and we think about

69
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
active learning. We can actually take this and kind of flip it upside down such that you know, lecture and audio and readings are a little bit more on that passive side.

70
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Not to say that passive learning is is a bad thing but if we're trying to pool students up into those higher levels of learning, then we probably want to be having them do more active things which is teaching others practicing by doing

71
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and having those demonstrations and discussion groups so again, if you're wanting to do more active learning it's best to kind of create learning objectives that are situated more at that higher level of blooms.

72
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So then the step 2 is to kind of like. Think about what your class environment looks like.

73
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That can help facilitate active learning in this case.

74
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Is your class face to face? Is it a large class? Are we going to have to think about the dynamics of a large class and the feasibility of working certain types of assessments?

75
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Are you creating multiple modalities? Is it a hybrid?

76
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or does it have asynchronous components Even if a class is face-to-face and on in in class on campus, we can still implement asynchronous components to our learning learning isn't restrictive

77
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to just the in-class time. it can actually also be occurring, especially in large classes.

78
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can have an asynchronous component to have students engage in active learning that way as well.

79
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then, lastly, don't forget about the learners who are your learners, this semester in this class?

80
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Are they working professionals that we need to consider having more flexible, due dates, and whether they can actually attend certain things at certain times, relate to step 2 is that the class environment.

81
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is that attendance doesn't necessarily mean that active learning is occurring?

82
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So just because students are there in your class with their button, their seat.

83
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They may be, you know, doing whatever it is that they need you know, looking at their phones or kind of zoned out So we don't always want to necessarily say that we have an attendance component to our course, and that

84
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is for sure assessing active learning attendance doesn't necessarily mean that students are participating right.

85
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And so when I look at this active learning ecosystem and we're talking about a couple of different pedagogical approaches to it, we're talking we'll talk about soon in a moment different types of

86
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
technologies could that can enable act to active learning.

87
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We also have this bubble for space and space doesn't necessarily mean the physical environment.

88
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It doesn't necessarily mean the classroom space just means that learning environment.

89
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The students who included it. The hide, the modality is included.

90
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It. if you have an Lms and you're using a lot of your core site, that is included as well into your space, your learning space.

91
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So the second part of the step 2 is to consider inclusive learning inclusive learning.

92
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My you know, there's a lot of different definitions out there. but I really like this definition that the Imperial College of London put out there, and that is inclusive learning and teaching recognizes that all students entitle have an

93
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
entitlement to the learning experience that respects diversity, enables participation, removes any barriers, and anticipates and considers a variety of learning needs.

94
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So this brings in that learning space, and those learners themselves, and by having alternative ways of assessing participation besides just attendance.

95
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We can actually, therefore, make that classroom in the active learning experience more inclusive as well.

96
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So when I think about what the formula is to come together to create this more inclusive and active learning.

97
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It comes down to that first step of having a good thoughtful course design that is, having those clear course goals and those learning objectives plus matching the technology that enables students to you know, collaborate and engage So when we think about

98
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that active learning we're looking at that bloom's taxonomy, the active learning aspects are always kind of leaning more towards engaging students with the content they're actually doing something and they're collaborating with

99
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:08,000
one another. So if we can like target tools, technology, tools that enable that that are going along with our course design, then we will naturally be creating a more inclusive and active learning environment, So then step 3 is to talk about this technology tools

100
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that help with engagement in collaboration some of the tools that we like. quite a bit in our department, and we have many school public health professors using our perusal yellow dig, pull, everywhere.

101
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And then also, what we all have access to already is Google suite.

102
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We have given a workshop, and we have some materials here from the tools of for engagement and collaboration workshop.

103
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you guys, I will send out these slides afterward But if you're interested in seeing these tools a little more in-depth, we're just gonna kind of briefly talk about them.

104
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Then you feel free to visit that link on the resilient teaching canvas site.

105
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So let's start with perusal have any of you have used perusal or are familiar with it.

106
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, No. Okay, So perusal is a social annotation.

107
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
E-reader. Basically, it's an e-reader though it can actually use a lot of different types of media as well.

108
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It allows for direct and asynchronous peer discussions to occur regarding various forms, of course, material, as mentioned normally.

109
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What we see it mainly being used for our pdf articles like readings, especially in grad school.

110
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're doing a lot of those heavy ratings so this is where like you could recreate a seminar style type of class in asynchronous environment.

111
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I've seen perusal being used both for in-person and online classes.

112
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So it works well. it plugs into all lms that we're familiar with it. Pleasant? well with the coursera and campus.

113
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So if you're teaching in either one of those modalities it does work well with them.

114
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You can also put in books if it's an ebook web pages.

115
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Podcast i've seen put in there as well and images and videos.

116
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then students can actually draw around it. and i'll show you a little bit of what Peruz all looks like.

117
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Perusal can be used as a graded component of the course with the in it has a custom viable.

118
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Ai artificial intelligence algorithm that we can change a little bit, depending on what your course goals are, and, as mentioned, it does have an Lti for campus.

119
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
In course there are making it really easy to implement. So essentially, this is what proves all looks like when you first log in with a reading on there.

120
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So you have a reading that's in here we upload the Pdf.

121
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And then what's happening? on the side is that students and including the instructor as well, can highlight certain areas of it and pose a question about this.

122
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, for instance, maybe they are seeing a graph here and it's a scatterplot, let's say scatter plot, and you have all these little dots around, and maybe there's an outlier and the student wants to hey? what's going on with this person

123
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
over here. It has the ability to actually draw on here as well.

124
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So this is actually kind of interesting, and I and I like us to kind of jump in there and try it out.

125
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I can actually show you also what a little bit that Ai.

126
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And where the greated component of this tool is happening as well.

127
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I will put the link in the chat. Just one moment

128
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So in the chat i've taken you guys to the resilient teaching campus site, and from there you'll see perusal.

129
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So kind of walk you through. how to get there it's gonna take you here

130
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And then here is the try it. See the sample, whole perusal assignment, and then you can click on there.

131
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Ask you to log in

132
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then you'll want to go ahead and load that proposal sign in a window

133
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And so here's a reading that we've uploaded into it.

134
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is what the pro it, if you build it into canvas that you, as you see here, it'll navigate you directly into perusal, and if you open this, this may be collapsed on your side, so maybe collapsed,

135
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
like that, but you can see the conversation. So these are these other tools that are occurring over here, and you can see all the conversations that are happening.

136
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And then who is putting those conversations in there?

137
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So this is a really great one. I still like for greg classes, and in those who are trying to replicate a seminar cell class without taking too much time away from the in-class time period.

138
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So you could assign something like this for a week. and then they can get a grade component for this.

139
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And so anybody else who's also on the reading you can see who's coming in, which is nice, you can see some participation happening there and feel free.

140
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is actually just for our resilient teaching. Only instructors on here.

141
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If you want to see what this looks like, feel free to, you know highlight something, and write something in there to see what that kind of feels and looks like.

142
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I do want to show you a little bit of where that grade is coming from.

143
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you wanted to implement a graded component of the course from here.

144
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So in here we have the scoring and you'll see these where is the grade coming from?

145
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So let's say, for instance, we wanted to implement perusal and we want to have 10 readings in there.

146
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We want 10% of the final grade to come from engaging with perusal and with students with each other in perusal.

147
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it's saying that it's going to take 60%. from annotating that is actually highlighting and leaving the comment, it's gonna take 20% just for simply opening that reading and looking at it.

148
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So maybe you want to emphasize more of just them.

149
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Engaging with the reading. They can customize and change these these values.

150
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But maybe you're for your course schools it's more about them having discussions with each other, so we could bump up

151
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You know the conversations, for instance, active reading component and getting responses from others.

152
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So getting responses from others is that students liked it. they cut reply back to another student who left a comment.

153
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And they can also up vote. For instance, they thought that was a really great question.

154
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They can upbook that as well I believe that they can tag each other, including if the instructors in there, and they're like, hey?

155
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't understand exactly what the researcher was doing here Professor.

156
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So-and-so, can you elaborate a little bit here?

157
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So then the discussion can happen there as well, and this can happen at any time, because it is all asynchronous.

158
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So, as I mentioned, these are all customizable. This is just the default.

159
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But this all then comes together. So if you have 10 readings and 10% of the grade is coming from here.

160
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This is how that's, calculated there's a lot more you can do with perusal, including like sorting into groups and giving different groups.

161
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Different readings, including also a peer review in here. but I won't go too much into perusal.

162
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I just kind of wanted to touch it. a little bit did anybody have any questions, or would like me to elaborate anything specific about perusal while we're here

163
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I guess i'm curious if it's you know I use mainly textbook chapters, right, but they're all in the library.

164
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Can, you you know, download if it's like in the Yogan library?

165
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Can you download a Pdf of a chapter you can get into perusal like That's allowable.

166
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay, yes, you definitely can, if it has a Pdf component to it.

167
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I know that not all. Oh, e reader ebooks and library are downloadable, but often there will be something in there that allows us to download so many chapters. And then we can actually upload that in there too, and i've seen textbooks be

168
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
uploaded into prism to do this kind of stuff.

169
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, Thank you.

170
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The perusal again. Really great option if that's you know if you, if your course is centered around ratings

171
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And when we kind of think about perusal and where does it fit along that continuum, we kind of say that we think that there's both simple and complex components. and this is all dictated by how you set your course, up

172
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
so large group discussions. Yes, you can have this as you've seen There's that running thread that's happening there.

173
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It does have a peer review component to it, so students could upload their own writing, and then other. they can then randomly be assigned to others, and they can actually leave their comments and get a graded component for it

174
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:53,000
with perusal as well. you can imagine. if you have case studies, you could upload that as well, and inquiry, learning, and, to be honest, some of these other ones could probably be mapped on there as well it just depends on

175
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:03,000
how your course is is is has been designed. So the other one I want to talk about in just briefly kind of cover.

176
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There is pull everywhere. I have infused a little bit pull everywhere throughout this works, so you've kind of seen this.

177
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So you may be familiar with it. I know that in our town halls the Dean likes to also put some pull everywhere.

178
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Questions in there as well, and so pull everywhere. is this interactive.

179
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It creates an interactive lecture, basically if you've built it into your slides.

180
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
A Pole everywhere has a plug-in for both Powerpoint and Google slides.

181
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So you can actually have them be built directly in here. I can actually show you kind of what that looks like, at least in the Google slides component on.

182
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Here So once you've enabled the plugin you'll see the pull everywhere right here, and you can actually immediately insert a poll everywhere.

183
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Type of question and it engages the audience by capturing feedback and then presenting those live results.

184
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's flexible. It allows you to have graded or anonymous responses.

185
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
A poll everywhere now can be built into canvas as well.

186
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So maybe you want to add just a poll in campus, a random one, and they can get like a one. points or something like that.

187
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That can also be doable. It allows also first to ask questions with correct answers.

188
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Or Maybe you don't want to present the correct answer or maybe there isn't a correct answer, So it can also be used for survey types of responses, and it presents from the web or integrates with other tools you use and it's

189
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
also mobile, friendly, so that students can actually download the app and use their phones in class to take the surveys as well.

190
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So why not put these little distracting devices to good use in the classroom and have them be using it for course.

191
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Work They can use be used independently or with a team, and you can also reuse questions.

192
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So you can create a database of questions that you want to maybe use between several different courses.

193
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That can be done easily as well, I see joanna here is putting in there that there's a slack integration now, so that could be kind of interesting as well, especially if you have an asynchronous component. you're you're active in

194
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:14,000
slack with your course and I think that there's also some gamified elements to to pull everywhere as well as like timed time types of questions as well, so you could make it a little bit fun so just to kind of give you an idea as to what

195
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:29,000
pull everywhere. Looks like as far as setting it up. So this is what, when you first go in there, you would have this window. once you've got your you know, account setup that you have these various different types. of question. question prompts you can start with you have multiple choice.

196
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So maybe these are twisted types of questions. The word clouds.

197
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I I think that Dean the Dean has used those a couple of times where it creates a nice good word, Cloud.

198
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
If you want to get just open-ended types of responses from students. Q. and A.

199
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So the students can ask the question back to the instructor.

200
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And this is great for large classes where you know maybe they're a little shy, and they don't want to raise their hand or interrupt anybody.

201
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You can also have this clickable image. You, I think I showed you guys an example of that with the being able to click on the continuum survey responses.

202
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
They can be anonymized. so that they don't actually present the results.

203
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They're just sending it directly to you and your email box open it in competition, and there's even even more.

204
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you click on the you know the more button you can include images in here.

205
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
As responses, or as part of the question. So what as your knowledge check?

206
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,000
In which phase of mitosis does in my my, my my mitotic spend will begin to form, As you can see, you can get responses from.

207
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There as well in this multiple choice style fashion. you can break these up into groups, and you can have teams.

208
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Be competing for the right answer, which is kind of me as well as I said.

209
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You can have like a little bit of a gamified component to it.

210
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then also you can use the word cloud, which I really like, and it's nice whenever you have a lot of questions for a large group.

211
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
These can be pretty interesting. as Mitch. You can also do the up down, you know.

212
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Response questions coming in and then I have a there's a little video in here that I thought it's just a minute video.

213
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That kind of explains a little bit more pull over the audience is competitive.

214
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Side with pool. everywhere competition. you create the questions the audience please for points competition, , in your presentation creative present multiple choice questions.

215
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The audience responds on their devices and the renewable shows everyone who is able to here's how it works.

216
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Your competition starts the welcome slides. Here the audience learns how to respond.

217
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Next up is your first question, followed by possible answers. Keep it on timers.

218
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is how long the August has to respond when it runs out.

219
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The correct answer is revealed. Everyone who was spotted correctly.

220
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Earth was that moves up the meeting Board is, whoever has the most points at the end of the competition.

221
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Competition is a breeze set up and play. It can be as long or short, does he, Mike, and makes you the star. Your own tribute?

222
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Contest competitions joins the very audience of engagement activities available on poll everywhere.

223
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Create your first competition today by signing up for a free account.

224
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, everywhere, dot com, but just kind of gives you an idea of what you can do during the app actual live session.

225
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So the one thing to know about polarware compared to perusal is that pull? Everywhere is your happen.

226
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Everything is happening asynchronously But this is a good way, especially for large classes and lecture based types of classes to kind of get students a little bit more engaged in in the actual lecture that's gonna try and play

227
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:08,000
again. So when we think about poll everywhere and we're if it's on the continuum you know you can use these for a group of evaluations, this is definitely along the lines of those interactive lectures you can build in

228
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
like reflection points. you know so you've lectured for a few minutes.

229
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Now you send it back to the students, and you can lecture for a few minutes and throw another poll everywhere out there.

230
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So it just kind of gives that, you know, breaks things up in the monotony of just only passively listening the whole time.

231
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You can use it for brainstorming article reviews and sessions, such as the gameified components.

232
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But again, as mentioned, this is just how we're kind of thinking about it, depending on how you designed your course, there's probably could be other ways in which this would map onto this this continuum.

233
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So the next I want to talk about is yellow dig I normally say that this is the newest tool in our in our box, but we've had it now.

234
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I think, for over a year now we have had some moderately good success with using melodig.

235
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yellowdig is an educational based social network like platform. and I say it's like a platform that social network, because it kind of has the the presence of what Facebook or linkedin or Instagram might look like what this

236
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
continuous feed that aims to create a community based discussion form for students.

237
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It can be used as a graded component. it is made for education, and it has an Lti, which means that they can integrate seamlessly into canvas, and on we have found a way to make it work with

238
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
course, therein out, too. and it also has a customizable Ai algorithm.

239
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So we can decide how students are getting points. and how much of those points are going towards the students final grade.

240
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So it's designed to foster a collaborative social learning, and it does this because it has a gamified element as well out to it, and it re to help reshape some of the students behavior.

241
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It with the Lti, and with also just with how elig is set up.

242
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It actually does lower the burden on instructors that you don't have to, you know you're not running the show.

243
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Basically of the discussion form. you're putting the the control back into the students.

244
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They're having the discussion they're deciding what they're interested in, and what they want to talk about.

245
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It provides tools to identify students who might be falling off the radar.

246
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:28,000
With that you get points, and there's also a lot of really rich analytics on the side of yellow dig which creates like these network maps.

247
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So you can actually see who is connecting with who and who might not be connecting at all.

248
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It fosters a different kind of relationship between instructors and students.

249
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So traditionally. It is the instructor who says I had this discussion prompt, And I want you guys to talk about this.

250
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And so you're constraining and you're making it very narrow about what students can talk about regarding the course content in the case of yellow dig you're kind of flipping that you're saying i've given you all

251
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
this course material i've been lecturing about this kind of stuff?

252
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What in this area do you want to talk about? and you allow it to kind of like naturally grow from there and in the lines with evidence-based types of practices in teaching and learning and principles of trauma-informed

253
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
pedagogy, and that is it is giving the voice back to the students.

254
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's more inclusive. because, it allows them to decide the directionality of what they want to talk about, and what's their interests so traditionally?

255
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:33,000
If, for instance, this would be what a typical discussion prompt student behavior might look like, we might have 5 different topics, a different topic for each week.

256
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
They want students to engage with, And what this is depicting, is it?

257
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
This is the instructor who says, This is the discussion prompt.

258
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We want the students to talk about, and early on we had this Go, getter student, who is the first one to respond, first one to reply, and then, as you know, time elapses getting close to that second week deadline.

259
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then we get a bunch of students who might reply or put something in, and as time comes, you know, passes on.

260
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What we start to notice is that towards the end of that fifth topic, fifth Week. This is pretty much what the students look like.

261
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
They're always waiting and cramming to the very last minute to put in a response, or put in a reply to that topic with Yellow Dick.

262
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What we see is something more along this line. Maybe the instructor from the very beginning puts in a post about, you know, a response in a discussion form.

263
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And we have students who were Yeah, you still have your go getter. But now, as we're kind of moving throughout the course, we allow the students to start to start what the discussion prompt is going to be about and maybe this turns into a different

264
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
topic a topic that the instructor didn't see coming, and so at some point the instructor may jump back in and talk and post.

265
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Some, you know, allow that to stem to different discussions but you're really allowing the student to kind of navigate the discussion around the course material.

266
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So it is a lot more natural of a discussion. So what Yellow dug does it allow you to post responses?

267
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Comment on others, create reactions. Emojis likes, and then earn points for every interaction that you do on the platform.

268
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It allows them to start conversations that might be more open-ended, And, for instance, you could use this in a student journal or a blog post.

269
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But any way that you can imagine like it's not this very constrained.

270
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Discussion format. So I want to go ahead and allow you guys to kind of see.

271
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And we what yellow Dick looks like so i'm going to invite you?

272
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm going to throw this in the chat here and It will take you to the .

273
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Community and our resilient teaching canvas site again.

274
00:36:47,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And so what you'll wanna do is just come down here and push the yet load deck community and a new window

275
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And so here is our resilient and teaching yellow dick community. it's again only for instructors.

276
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So I do invite that if whatever you want to practice or play around with, feel free to do so, yeah, you're more than welcome to do so.

277
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So we have Joanna here she's put in this introduction to the students, to kind of model.

278
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
How the students should use Yellow Dick, but also as a good nice introduction for what to do.

279
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So as you can see as i'm scrolling through This is just like kind of like a Facebook would look like with these different posts going on, and to create you would push this blue button over here

280
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And so we have our windows popped up. I can give it a title.

281
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I can write in my full text right there, and as you can see there's many different options for how how to format your post, including making attachments, putting in a recording. you can draw in there.

282
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You can add a pole. Students can add a poll to other students, and now they can also put formulas as well.

283
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This is a new feature. and if you have these instructors can dictate topics. so maybe you don't want to constrain exactly what you want students to do.

284
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But maybe you have some prefformulated topics that might map onto the modules of your course.

285
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And so this students can then tag those with one or many different topics that allows them to filter through the material.

286
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Students can also pin this, or the instructor can pin their you know, if they have, like a particular thing, that they want to make sure that bumps up to the top, because it things can get lost in this.

287
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Feed, they can pin it as well, and then as over here on this window you can see here's where the points up are.

288
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So ours are a little bit meaningless for this particular example.

289
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But, for instance, maybe you want 10% of the courses overall grade to come from interacting with each other in the yellow Dick platform, and they need You can dictate what that is.

290
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Maybe they need to get 10,000 points over the 16 week.

291
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Course. So each interaction of typing on here so I can just write something.

292
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You'll see that it's calculating that they be to get at least 40 wards in order to get 250 points.

293
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So it does have some pre populations in here for what they recommend.

294
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Each interaction should be worth. but you can also customize this as well.

295
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So maybe you don't want be able to take up too much of your class, or you wanted to account for more.

296
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:51,000
We can change these point valuations for everything whether it's liking something or smiling to something.

297
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You would get a point you'd get points for those one thing I wanted to kind of show that I think is really useful.

298
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
As I mentioned, you can kind of track whether students are calling, falling off.

299
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The radar here is from the data. they have very rich learning analytics in here.

300
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We can look at the community, help to see how many posts are going on, what those averages look like.

301
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Just any descript, active information that we might want to know about what our course community looks like.

302
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
These take a little bit of time to generate, especially go a lot of students, and is very active and engaging.

303
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Course

304
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
We'll skip this for now, but it will pop up eventually.

305
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So then we have some additional reports. We have the point report.

306
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So if we want to see who are the high achievers here, we can look at that community reports as well.

307
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It can download everything as Csv. if you like to kind of like.

308
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Do some of your own data management of that, and you can also look at the network graph.

309
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So this one, I find to be very useful if you just need a quick glimpse to see who's interacting with who and who is not interacting at all.

310
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
This is a great way. You can look at it that in table format as well.

311
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Is there anything that and you they would like need to explore or explain a little bit more about yellow?

312
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Dig,

313
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So how do you? first of all, grade these interactions on a more of a substantive scale.

314
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In other words, you can get a certain number of words in, and that gives you a certain number of points.

315
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But what if those comments aren't substantial what are they just busy work, kind of comments, right?

316
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So that would you know, that could limit things a little bit and this isn't going to, you know, evaluate things for quality.

317
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This is more, and this is where I think that this is going to be more of a low sticks type of assessment.

318
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I would say, put this at 5 to 10%, I probably wouldn't account for it too much more than that.

319
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Because it is more about the unity than than equality.

320
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
At this point. and it is about kind of trying to give that control up to them. Right?

321
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Joanna, if I may just chime in and suggest that there's a feature built into yellow dig that's called accolades.

322
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
This is where the instructor can go in and award points for quality posts.

323
00:42:43,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And so if you wanted to construct your yellow dick site to maybe the the free, the points they earn just by hitting that 40 port limit are low, and then you go in and actually give them their point boost

324
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
that's going to get them to like their point goal. that would be one way around that.

325
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, great point, great point. right? So this would also model, it to other students like this is what I'm looking for, and if you hover over those, each of those have some sort of comment, and you can modify them to be that that one says like

326
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:35,000
verified. answer there's some that are like hey? you taught me something, you know. bonus 50 points things like that, and those can all be customized right?

327
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Great question,

328
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Is there anything else i'm missing joanna from covering yellow deck?

329
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't want to spend too much time with it we do actually have a workshop that we devote to yellow dig.

330
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But I just kind of wanted to brief over it a little bit No, I think that's a great introduction and one of the workshops we're sharing out.

331
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We had some feedback from faculty who utilized it in last fall, in case you want to hear how those experiences went for them.

332
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And we've done some really unique things so students I mean instructors have used this to replace a discussion form, but we've also seen the this user for poster presentations.

333
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
We have sharing Cardeau, who is using this as a simulation, a role-playing simulation.

334
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So there's a lot of unique, different ways you can think about using lid.

335
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If that's something you know that you're interested in so when we think about Yellowdig as I mentioned, there's so many ways you could you use the olig so it's we have this expanding kind of like across the

336
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
board on like the spectrum. we we've seen it as mentioned for simulations as well.

337
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
But anyway, you can think about replacing a discussion board, You know this.

338
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Could this could hit upon that? So the last one is Google suite.

339
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Google suite. Everybody has access to this. but there it is a clever creation tool.

340
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We use it a lot in the work world. and Now, we're just trying to bring students into how we might use this in academic education world as well.

341
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So Google suite includes the drive Google drive which is a folder file management system.

342
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Slides, like Powerpoint are, is a slide creator.

343
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We have gox, docs which is a word processor jam board which i'll talk about because that's a little bit one.

344
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's a people are a bit more unfamiliar with which is a essentially a virtual whiteboard.

345
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And then we have sheets, which is a spreadsheet processor informs, which is a survey tool, and I believe that there might be even a few other types of Google suite tools.

346
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But these are the most common ones. So drive, and of itself is this dynamic cloud based tool.

347
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That is a one place update, basically. So because it uses hyperlinks to get to things, we can actually include these in our course, and they can see the same every year instead of like for instance, downloading our

348
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
assessments that might be written in a word, Doc, and then updating them with new dates and then re uploading them.

349
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If you include, you know, the Google suite instead with a Google Doc. you can just maintain that same link every year, copy that entire course and just update the actual document instead of the link.

350
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This supports both asynchronous and synchronous components.

351
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
In person, virtual and mix can be used. And we, you can have alternative participation grades component to this.

352
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
If you wanted it integrates across all the other Google tools.

353
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So, for instance, the links, if you have slides that you want to, you know, move to a doc.

354
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It. They all talk, and they speak. we well with each other.

355
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It also allows you to upload office and open office and Max version as well.

356
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So it does convert to and from all other major processors and it's University supported and it integrates with our email So that makes that nice.

357
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And because, you know, we have this. we have unlimited storage, not to mention that we also have the ability to add mentions and comments on things.

358
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And if you integrate this wisely, you could actually having students commenting and discussing with each other regarding any kind of document that you upload as well, if that's something that you wanted to do So just to kind of go over a

359
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
few of these I wanted to talk about what Google Docs can do.

360
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Google Docs has a other really cool feature that if you change the extension to the end, let me just show you kind of what this looks like.

361
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Of an actual document. Sorry I had like this little zoom window at the end of an actual document to copy.

362
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Students can actually make a copy of whatever documents you have too.

363
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So maybe you don't want them to mess with your document, and I want to show you guys what this looks like by giving you guys a copy of it as well.

364
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So put it in the message. and so if you click on this document here it it's going to immediately prompt you to make a copy of this.

365
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So this is good for students, if they wanna have a copy on the end, too.

366
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But this form is pretty interesting, because it kind of already compares a lot of those tools for collaboration engagement that I was mentioning

367
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And so this is your own copy, and you can do what you like with it.

368
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Slides what i'm using now, you could share for instance, if you are doing interactive lectures, so maybe you're used to putting your lectures in powerpoints.

369
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But if you put them into Google slides and you share this link out to students, you can actually have have built in activities right in this slide deck.

370
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So we could have an empty slide on here and as students to populate it with their own laptops with material.

371
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So again, we're just trying to think of like unique and different ways to bring students into the active learning. active learning.

372
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There. you can also do the same thing with Google sheets.

373
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So we could make. For instance, maybe you have pre-populated sheets that have algorithms in there, that are doing some kind of data analysis, and you want them to make a copy of that.

374
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Or you want them to input their own data into it and we can see a live engagement with that as well, and it keeps a running tab of everybody that's been going into the document.

375
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So you can kind of get an idea as to who is working with these documents.

376
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The other one. that I kind of wanna show are you guys just from a template is is the jam board.

377
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So i'm gonna go ahead and copy jam board in here and it's in the chat

378
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So, as I mentioned, janeboard is basically like a virtual whiteboard.

379
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We have these different slides tabs so appear if you want to 8 that you can click through.

380
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And there's just so many different ways that you can put in here.

381
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You can have graph sheets in here, so maybe you want to have students drawing on here.

382
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
There's different pins, so there's our little normal distribution

383
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We also have sticky notes that you could put in there as well.

384
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Benefits of working from home versus working in the office.

385
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Students can add, add their new sticky note

386
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And then images as well, they can add whatever images they want.

387
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And then we also have like, for instance, you can in be interacting with an actual image as well.

388
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So if you upload the image, you could have students be engaging with the image as well.

389
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So I currently live a month pleasant and that's where we're at

390
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
This is really nice. Especially you can do this asynchronously or synchronously, by sharing the link.

391
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You could just easily grab that link and then throw it in your slides, email it out to students, and so they can engage with with each other.

392
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
This way on their own time. If If that's what you were valuing in your class.

393
00:51:39,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We have the highlighter tool. Is there anything that you guys would like to see more regarding Jam board

394
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Oh, there was one mention. I wanted to say as well that Jim Board actually also worked with the tablets that are in the classrooms and students as well.

395
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
If they have tablets, and they have the pin, the Silas, they can actually use that as well.

396
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:30,000
There kind of a cool little tool

397
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So again with Jan Board and Google suite. More generally, it kind of falls along this entire spectra.

398
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
All the way from, you know, simple writings or little assessments, all open to those types of inquiry.

399
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Learning. This might be a good tool jam board as well for the jigsaw discussion.

400
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I can imagine. So I just wanted to throw this back out i'm kind of curious like, don't know a couple of different tools that just highlight, you know, very briefly went over them, but i'm kind of curious which tools are you

401
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
guys most interested in learning i'd like to build out another workshop, you know, that goes a little bit deeper.

402
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So i'd love to get your thought thoughts on which tools kind of really spoke out.

403
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Spoke to you

404
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Person,

405
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Sweet,

406
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And that's great awesome so we do have like I said Mentioned.

407
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,000
We have a yellow dig workshop that we had given and I've also given Google suite workshop before as well.

408
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
One that I haven't done yet is I haven't dug deep and and presented anything about perusal.

409
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So i'm glad to hear that you are interested in pros as well.

410
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Just be we're ending Everything here I wanted to remind you that we do have a another workshop coming up next week on June the 20Â s.

411
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:31,000
The transparent assignment is and then after that i'll be following up with this active learning, and basically a set of part 2.

412
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I will be focusing a little bit more on those complex active learning strategies in the learning by doing.

413
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We'll talk about mainly case study simulations and tech tools that can help with putting case studies and simulations. together.

414
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And then I have a couple of resources in here. Some links out to, you know, a little bit more about active learning, a rubric for selecting active learning technologies, which is a great one.

415
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And then some of the stuff that we put together regarding tools for collaboration engagement, some additional tools on resources about crusal and Poll everywhere as well as yellow digging Google suite.

416
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We have a couple of minutes and i'm just kind of curious, and if anybody had any other questions or comments

417
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Hi, Grecian greatly appreciate everyone who showed up today.

418
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And allowed me to kind of talk to you about the different tools in our toolbox for this, and I and I hope to see you guys soon and again, if you have any questions with setting up any of these tools, we've helped many

419
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:55,000
others put these tools together in their course so we're happy to help you get it set up as well, Thank you.

420
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:10,000
This is really helpful. Thank you.
