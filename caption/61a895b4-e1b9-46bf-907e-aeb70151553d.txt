1
00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:14,226
So we'll go ahead and get started. Welcome everyone to the classroom, recording with pen octo workshop. We have a couple people in the room here with me thank you so much for coming in person.

2
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:25,226
And then we have some people joining us remotely over zoom watching this, we are recording this session and so I will be emailing it out to you, along with some additional resources.

3
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:29,226
Later this afternoon.

4
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:32,226
A few things as we get started.

5
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:38,226
life transcripts should be available for those of you that are viewing online remotely.

6
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:42,226
If you have questions, I have disabled the unmute option.

7
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:56,226
Just to reduce audio issues for us here in the room. But my colleague, Frederick is watching the chat, so please type any questions you have and she'll make sure those get relate here in the, in the classroom.

8
00:00:56,226 --> 00:01:04,226
My name is Joanna, back of it, and I work with the instructional services team and the Instructional Technology consultant.

9
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:21,226
And we are going to talk about Conoco our basic agenda is to just step back a bit and what is Conoco, and then how to enable Dokdo in your Canvas site, because it's integrated into Canvas.

10
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:31,226
And then we're going to talk about what is going to be involved with recording in the classroom, when you're teaching in person.

11
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:40,226
Here in the building, but then you also may have students that are absent students that are viewing remotely after.

12
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:49,226
And so how to kind of balance some of the logistics there. And then I'm going to open it up for those in the room if you want some hands on practice in this computer.

13
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:52,226
You are welcome to do so.

14
00:01:52,226 --> 00:02:13,226
So what is Conoco. This is a very flexible video recording device program. It has a desktop application. It has a mobile application. And that now has a browser web based application for recording.

15
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:18,226
And so these are all different ways that you can record content to share with your students.

16
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:24,226
Additionally, it allows allows for uploading videos that you recorded elsewhere.

17
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:34,226
Maybe it's a something you recorded on your computer, or maybe you went on site somewhere and recorded something with your phone.

18
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:45,226
The pinnacle program also allows for student uploads. If there is a video project that's part of your course. You can create a student assignment.

19
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:57,226
And then students can use the desktop, mobile, or web recorder, in order to create their assignments or upload the video

20
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:03,226
panoptic allows for in video discussion, there's a side panel.

21
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:23,226
In every panoptic video where if you type notes or questions, those become time stamped to that location in the video, You don't get notified of discussion that's taking place in your video, but it's good to know and, in case you want to assign a specific

22
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:29,226
video that students should be making comments on.

23
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:39,226
But not they'll also have a live stream function we don't use this a lot, but it is just a one way broadcast, so it's not zoom, lets people cannot interact back.

24
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:43,226
Only through a discussion tab.

25
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:52,226
But it's a one way broadcast, that will record and broadcast live, and then post to your Canvas site

26
00:03:52,226 --> 00:04:07,226
cannot stop so also allows us to add an auto generated captions to our videos that we upload, which is a nice feature to help us support students with disabilities.

27
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:12,226
And then, as I mentioned, we have campus integration.

28
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:21,226
So let's look at how we set up conduct oh and our campus sites, if you are in front of a computer right now and want to check your own Canvas site, you're welcome to.

29
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:26,226
But I'll also have the slides and instructions shared with you afterwards.

30
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:43,226
In your Canvas site, you're looking for a menu item in the left hand navigation menu of your course called pinata recordings. If you don't see it, you can go to the settings and then across the top the navigation tab.

31
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:57,226
The first block of tools in the under the navigation tab, it shows what tools you have active and tools that students can see with some exceptions.

32
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:16,226
There are some tools that are active, but students cannot see such as New analytics is one that's an instructor only tool, below the top set of tools is another really long list of tools that are disabled for your course, you're going to scroll through

33
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:32,226
that list until you find pinata recordings, and click on the three dots on the far right, those three vertical dots tend to signal more options or expand a menu of more options.

34
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:42,226
When you click that menu, you can click Enable, which will move pinata recordings to the top set of enabled tools.

35
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:48,226
You can click and drag and rearrange these tools in any order you would like.

36
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:56,226
And then you'll scroll all the way down to the bottom of this page and there'll be a Save button.

37
00:05:56,226 --> 00:06:14,226
That Save button will basically make the pinata recordings link available in your left hand course navigation, and you can go ahead and click on that and then clicking on that button that menu link will basically start the process of generating a folder

38
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:18,226
in the put out the system to store all of your recordings.

39
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:28,226
It's also managing the permissions, saying, okay, the instructors, the instructors and ta is in this Canvas site can create videos.

40
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:40,226
And the students in this Canvas site, have a viewer only role.

41
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:54,226
So now that we have that setup that's sort of the first stage to kind of create that recording, set up a workflow for your class. So now let's look at Penn octo in the speech classrooms in the sky rooms, there's a Windows computer, any to the classrooms.

42
00:06:54,226 --> 00:07:13,226
In the SPH rooms, there's a Windows computer into the classrooms. That is equipped with the pinata desktop recorder already installed it, the computers will be equipped with some sort of microphone pickup, the type of microphone pickup and microphone

43
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:18,226
options are going to be different depending on what classroom you're in.

44
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:34,226
So we will look at some options. There is a meeting out in many classrooms, that's been installed specifically because we need to be recording our classes in this sort of some people are remote Some are in person.

45
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:42,226
There is a tabletop USB mic that has a wide range of pickup, that may be an option.

46
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:58,226
And then, the big lecture hall. 1655 maybe has some additional video and audio options that are not available in many of the smaller classrooms.

47
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:01,226
There are also video options.

48
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:05,226
So the meeting I will can also record video.

49
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:13,226
In addition to the microphone pickup. So depending on whether you want to just do a voice narration, or if you want to capture some video.

50
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:30,226
And then it's also going to capture some course materials that you decide based on what your content is, so there's going to be an option to record my screen, which is almost like you know screen sharing and zoom, but with the full desktop.

51
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:44,226
You, it'll show everything you're doing on your screen, or you have the option to just record PowerPoints word of warning when you use the PowerPoint checkbox.

52
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:53,226
It won't record. What it does is it captures a still image frame of each of your slides.

53
00:08:53,226 --> 00:09:05,226
And then it sort of indexes the text to make it searchable in your recordings. So we wouldn't be capturing if you do annotations. If you have animations.

54
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:22,226
If you have an embedded video clip in your slides that PowerPoint option will capture those. But the capture my whole screen will capture those. So something to keep in mind, and sometimes just as a safety maybe even having it record both is not a bad

55
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:36,226
idea because you get that slide search ability, and any actions you may have done on the slides or videos embedded that don't get picked up.

56
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:48,226
Any questions about that before we keep moving forward.

57
00:09:48,226 --> 00:09:52,226
So some references I'm going to share with you after the fact RB.

58
00:09:52,226 --> 00:10:07,226
A link to the available classrooms and conference rooms web page on the SPH website. It provides sort of some additional details of what resources you have available in the classroom as you're teaching in.

59
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:13,226
It has the list of all the rooms and then you can kind of see checkbox of what's available to you in that room.

60
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:25,226
And then each classroom is equipped with some documentation of FB Lecter. So in this room I have a laminated sheet. That tells me a little bit about how to project.

61
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:41,226
And so, you might want to either slip into your classroom sometime when it's available or get there early if there's not a class meeting before yours, so that you can get acquainted with how to get setups.

62
00:10:41,226 --> 00:11:00,226
I will also say. Each room has a little phone number to contact classroom support. This number will go to IPZ you can get immediate help, depending on what kind of help you need, they might be able to remote into the computer at the podium, and assist

63
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:10,226
that way, or they can send someone to you in person.

64
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:17,226
So we are ready to demo, the application that you're going to use here in the classrooms.

65
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:31,226
And for that, another document I'm going to share with you is the

66
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:35,226
platform recording with panopticon handout.

67
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:44,226
And I need to just locate it first.

68
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:56,226
Because that's basically walk through the steps of getting set up so it's something that you want to print off and take with you, those first couple of class meetings, until you get the hang of it.

69
00:11:56,226 --> 00:12:04,226
And so my first step is to go to your Canvas site and launch panoptic that way.

70
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:16,226
Why I'm suggesting that is that will make sure that Phnom Joe records and posts to the correct Canvas site.

71
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:22,226
So I'm going to pull up canvas.

72
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:28,226
Login.

73
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:31,226
I'm going to use one of my practice sites.

74
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:43,226
And I've already enabled panoptic in this site so I see the pinata recordings menu in the navigation.

75
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:51,226
So, this is what you're putting up the recordings area looks like when you have recordings that have been completed.

76
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:54,226
So you'll see as a semester goes on.

77
00:12:54,226 --> 00:13:02,226
They're going to be in a list like this. there's a thumbnail image that's just grabbed automatically.

78
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:04,226
It has the name of the recording.

79
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:10,226
And that name is actually a hyperlink to begin playing that recording.

80
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:24,226
Because I'm the instructor every time I hover over a recording, I get a set of menus that appears students won't have access to these menus, but I can modify some settings such as changing the name.

81
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:30,226
Or maybe changing the availability restricting availability of it there's several different settings in here.

82
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,226
There's a share icon.

83
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:39,226
This is automatically available to students enrolled in this Canvas site.

84
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:48,226
But maybe you want to share with a colleague, you need to come to the share and sort of add them to the view of view ability permissions.

85
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:59,226
Be Edit button is actually going to allow you to view this in an editor and maybe trim the ends off.

86
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:08,226
And then stats. you can go in each video and see who viewed that video and for how long.

87
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:19,226
So maybe there's a specific topic you covered. And students may be worth doing great. Maybe I want to go see, did they get a chance to view this video or not.

88
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,226
And then I have the ability to delete.

89
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:31,226
And this is important because this is going to give you the flexibility to go in and practice, create some practice recordings and then come and delete them.

90
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:41,226
I also have the ability to make changes at the folder level up here in the upper right corner of this pinata recordings page.

91
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:48,226
Alright so let's go back to our pepto Rick classroom recording with panoptic instructions.

92
00:14:48,226 --> 00:15:03,226
And we're going to use the Create button in the Canvas site under pinata recordings I have a green Create button in the top center of my screen gives me the options I have to add content to this page.

93
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:14,226
And there's a pinata for windows which is the desktop application panoptic capture which would be a browser tool that's tab that will open up and allow me to port or upload.

94
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:19,226
And so for recording in the classroom I'll use Conoco for Windows.

95
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:28,226
If I didn't have this installed, I would have the ability to download it, but I know it's already on the computer so you just need to click open.

96
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:37,226
And so the browser is saying are you sure you want this program to launch an application on your computer and you could say yes, open pinata recorder.

97
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,226
It may take a moment to load.

98
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:47,226
And I'm getting an error message here only because I am also simultaneously.

99
00:15:47,226 --> 00:16:00,226
I have different another set of devices on this computer, you should not see that.

100
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:06,226
All right, so this is the page that's going to allow me to set my record settings.

101
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:13,226
Notice that in the upper right corner, it has signed me in. It says sth Canvas slash my unique name.

102
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:18,226
You should see your unique name there.

103
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:31,226
In the very top center. I can verify what folder I want to record to mine has like a practice course name but your should be your public health or episode, or whatever your course number is.

104
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:34,226
And then below that I can name my recording.

105
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:46,226
By default it names it to the day of the week, the date and the time that I'm starting this recording.

106
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:57,226
The top block on the left, allows me to set up what panoptic calls primary sources. This is my audio and video.

107
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:02,226
And so, audio is required.

108
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:14,226
And so this may be a little difficult to see in the room, but because I have multiple devices plugged into this computer I have multiple options for recording.

109
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:31,226
This is actually a Elmo document camera device which I don't need to be using that for audio. The USB microphone USB audio codec. That is this flat microphone that sitting here at the podium.

110
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:44,226
My next option is echo canceling speaker phone meeting our Pro. That's what I want to use for this recording today.

111
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:47,226
Now you can record audio only.

112
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:57,226
Or you could go ahead and enable that video, I'm going to go ahead and do video with the meeting owl.

113
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:01,226
And so now we're seeing a preview of that video.

114
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:10,226
If I had multiple devices and I wasn't sure which to use, you could click through and sort of preview them.

115
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:13,226
So I'm now seeing a preview of my video.

116
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:25,226
And just to the right of my video. I'm seeing an audio level meter, and you should be seeing green bars, as you're talking as a way to verify if Conoco can hear you.

117
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:35,226
From this microphone source. So check one, two, check, check, one, two. Great.

118
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:49,226
There is an option to capture computer audio. So back to if I have a video or audio clip that's part of my lecture or presentation today, I might want to go ahead and capture that.

119
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:59,226
Below that are, what kind of the call secondary sources, what's the what's the screen, or what's the content that you want to show.

120
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:14,226
And so here's what we need to be creative and think about how do I make sure my students in class can see my content, but also the students who are viewing this after work, how are they going to be able to see my content.

121
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:26,226
I could go right on the whiteboard across the room and that would work fine for in class. And because I'm not using zoom nobody's going to interrupt me and tell me remind me that they can't see what I'm doing.

122
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:32,226
But my students who watched this afterwards aren't going to be able to see what I was doing.

123
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:43,226
And so we just need to have an awareness of we're really balancing between two audiences.

124
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:55,226
So here are those checkboxes I mentioned a capture PowerPoint, which again are just the image, grabs of my slides or capture main screen, which is everything I'll do on the screen.

125
00:19:55,226 --> 00:20:10,226
So if I open a different software, if I switch between a browser the Canvas site to PowerPoint to maybe are four different software, it's going to capture all of that.

126
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:13,226
So I have the vault setup.

127
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:21,226
And I'm ready to hit record which is the big red button in the upper left corner.

128
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:25,226
So we are now recording.

129
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:32,226
And so, you'll notice when I hit record, I now have a pause button that's been added.

130
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:35,226
So if you take a break in your class.

131
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:39,226
If you think of it you can pause the recording.

132
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:46,226
If you can remember to unpause that when you return.

133
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:58,226
Now I can't make changes to my video and audio sources, but I can make changes to the secondary devices.

134
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:15,226
So, I had one question where an instructor, it's mostly a discussion course so he really just needed the audio and video, but he might want the option to pull something up on YouTube or on canvas.

135
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:35,226
So we decided, all right, he's just going to record audio video, but if he ever comes over to the computer he can come and check and uncheck these boxes, which will disable or turn it on and off.

136
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,226
Alright.

137
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:49,226
Any questions.

138
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:55,226
One tool I have here on the Windows computers and as page classrooms.

139
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:00,226
Is this screen is a screen that I can write on.

140
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:16,226
I have a little pen here, little table that I have a pen device here by the computer. That is a stylist to us on this computer screen.

141
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:22,226
It's currently plugged in, but I can disconnect that.

142
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:33,226
And if I was using PowerPoint. I'm using Google Slides today so it's not a good example because Google Slides does not have an annotation. Draw tool.

143
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:42,226
If I were using PowerPoint that does have a pen tool, integrated I could write on this screen.

144
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:46,226
If you.

145
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:53,226
Yeah, so any program that has an annotation tool I'm going to jump ahead a little bit,

146
00:22:53,226 --> 00:23:00,226
because I set up a jam board example.

147
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:11,226
As an alternative, so if you're a Google Slides user jam board could potentially be an option to get those annotation features.

148
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:22,226
One thing I want to notice is the position of this screen, isn't that conducive for drawing on. But another nice feature of these screens if they have a latch on the back.

149
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:29,226
It's going to let me just lifted and lay the screen down a little flatter so that I can write a little easier.

150
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:41,226
So, this is going to mess up my webcam position for those viewing online, but it shouldn't make my braiding a little easier.

151
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:55,226
So.

152
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,226
thing happened on my toe.

153
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:06,226
Right.

154
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:12,226
Alright, so if I need to work out problems.

155
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:34,226
My meeting or just became disconnected.

156
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:38,226
Sorry.

157
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:49,226
I lost my lights my our lights on here.

158
00:24:49,226 --> 00:25:12,226
When I load a screen I wonder if it's catching on.

159
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:13,226
see if it'll just keep going.

160
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:25,226
I'll just keep going. Go ahead and stop that recording

161
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,226
appears to be hooked up properly.

162
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:31,226
Sorry about that.

163
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:35,226
When I stopped recording.

164
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:41,226
It's going to switch me over to this other tab on the recorder called manage recordings.

165
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:50,226
It's going to zip through an upload process that you'll want to hang on and wait for

166
00:25:50,226 --> 00:26:04,226
it has gone ahead and finish uploading and now it's moved on to the processing step. Now you're, you're free to leave your free to sign out, and leave and it'll keep working in the background to post to your Canvas site.

167
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:17,226
But there will be an upload step that needs to finish.

168
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:24,226
So this is reconnecting so I'm going to go ahead and start that once more try again.

169
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:33,226
So just to reiterate, a little bit of what you can do a jam board. We typically talk about jam board in a collaborative sense, here's a link to the jam board.

170
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:40,226
Everyone drop a sticky note about this a brainstorm or almost like a flip chart type activity.

171
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:50,226
But this is a gamble that's only for me. I haven't shared it with anyone but it allows me to utilize the draw tools

172
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:58,226
that I might need if I was using a whiteboard.

173
00:26:58,226 --> 00:27:06,226
And then, so this text I set up in advance, using the text tool and jam board.

174
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:11,226
So that I didn't have to hand write everything out.

175
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:31,226
And then I can also in jam board, it's a little hard to see on the screen in the room, but jam board allows you to change the background of the page to a dark aligned paper a graph paper, or you could even upload a specific image.

176
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:40,226
So maybe we need to

177
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:46,226
win points on a graph,

178
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:52,226
demonstrate something that way.

179
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:54,226
So this is one option.

180
00:27:54,226 --> 00:28:13,226
And then one thing I did for myself was I put that jam board link in my slides, kind of trying to set myself up for a seamless transition.

181
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:20,226
Alright,

182
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:25,226
so this handout kind of covers those different areas we talked about setting those up.

183
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,226
And then after class.

184
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:41,226
you'll want to go ahead and stop that recording, and I have a little note here, be aware of capturing any after class discussion with students, if a student approaches the podium, and you're standing right by where the microphone is that is going to get

185
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:48,226
captured if you're still rolling. And so that's where also where that edit capability comes in handy.

186
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:55,226
I can go and just trim the end on that, and the other students won't see it.

187
00:28:55,226 --> 00:29:02,226
So, wait for upload we talked about and then finding out of an Octo.

188
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:20,226
So you would use the sign up button in the upper right corner to make sure that the person who comes in the class after you doesn't also accidentally record into your Canvas site.

189
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:31,226
And then you would log off the recorder. If you're using amplification voice amplification microphones like I'm wearing a lapel right now turn those off before you exit the room.

190
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:50,226
One other note regarding, you know, sort of, maybe you want to preview or think about if there's anything you need to edit before that recording gets published to the class, you would have the available availability, the ability

191
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:54,226
to set up the recordings in this folder.

192
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:58,226
Using the gear icon

193
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:18,226
to say, I want to be able to first approve them before they publish. So that would give you an opportunity, you don't have to respect your office to catch it before it posts, you would have the ability to go in and have it wait for you to manually publish

194
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:20,226
it before it becomes available.

195
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:31,226
So if you were to click on the Settings gear icon in the upper right corner of the pinata recordings page in your Canvas site.

196
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:38,226
There is a set of menus on the left. And the third one down his settings.

197
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:43,226
And if I scroll down, there's a section called availability.

198
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:58,226
It says sessions become available. And by default we have that set to immediately as soon as you stop recording, and it uploads and it finishes processing it'll post immediately to the Canvas site without you needing to do anything.

199
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:09,226
Another option is when approved by a publisher, meaning it's going to hold it until you go in and release it.

200
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:24,226
And then you also the ability to set a disabled date. How long do you want that video recording available in your class. By default it's set to forever.

201
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:35,226
But perhaps you may have reasons where you don't want students to have to be able to view these after the semester is over, whatever works best for your courses and programs.

202
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:48,226
And so I would be sending these on the folder level, meaning every recording I add would have the settings applied.

203
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:56,226
So let's look at a recording.

204
00:31:56,226 --> 00:32:02,226
So here's the one we just did before the meeting, I'll

205
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:03,226
cut out.

206
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:17,226
And so this title is a hyperlink now which means it's ready to view, it's published the one above it is not a hyperlink meaning this is it's still showing me it's still processing.

207
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:22,226
So if I click on this the recordings open in a new tab.

208
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:26,226
And this is basically the layout

209
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:27,226
of the viewer.

210
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:34,226
The primary source that video appears in the upper left corner.

211
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:40,226
Below that are some menu items including the discussion, tab.

212
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:51,226
As a student, I also have the ability to leave notes just for myself and bookmarks, in the video for myself that others cannot see.

213
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:57,226
And then in the center is showing whatever the screen or slides.

214
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:03,226
I'm showing

215
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:11,226
in the upper right corner I also have the ability to switch these.

216
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:24,226
So in the case where maybe I'm recording a blank screen, and it's really the instructor lecturing and not showing anything I could switch to this instead.

217
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:30,226
I have the ability to pause and play. Reverse back 10 seconds.

218
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:33,226
Jump forward 10 seconds.

219
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:37,226
I can modify the speed that I can watch this video in.

220
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:48,226
Maybe I was in class, but I just want to do a quick review before the exam. I could come in and maybe watch this in one and a half speed or listen this.

221
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,226
Yeah.

222
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:53,226
So at this point right here.

223
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:57,226
This is when I disabled.

224
00:33:57,226 --> 00:34:06,226
Maybe it's in the camera now. There was a point at which I disabled.

225
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:25,226
Because I'm the instructor and I'm logged in, I have some tools available here at the top that students won't see, I have the ability to manage the settings on this recording, including renaming it if I wanted to, I could share again, I can open the editor,

226
00:34:25,226 --> 00:34:31,226
I can see stats.

227
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:39,226
So I'm going to go ahead and click on the editor, just so we can take a quick peek at that.

228
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:45,226
And this basically shows what I have recorded

229
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:48,226
in the video the audio.

230
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:52,226
Audio waveforms.

231
00:34:52,226 --> 00:35:05,226
And if there was some recording in the beginning before class started that I don't want, I can move my mouse to the beginning of this timeline and I get sort of a thicker gray bar.

232
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:10,226
When I reached that I can click it and drag it in.

233
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:17,226
And so sometimes you'll have to play to listen

234
00:35:17,226 --> 00:35:20,226
to see if that's the actual beginning you want to start.

235
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:26,226
Maybe you need to drag it a little bit further I can do the same thing at the end.

236
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:36,226
If there was a 10 minute break in the middle of your class that you don't want to have all the sort of mulling around, and conversations.

237
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:44,226
I can click my mouse in the beginning right here, and drag it to make a selection.

238
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:51,226
And so each of these great out areas won't play for students.

239
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:54,226
This is called non destructive.

240
00:35:54,226 --> 00:36:02,226
Right, so the, you know, whatever got recorded is still there it's just not gonna play for the audience that you don't click that little scissors.

241
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:09,226
So, you don't click that little scissors. You don't need to click the scissors. Okay.

242
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:13,226
It's basically just a click and drag selection.

243
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:15,226
Yeah.

244
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:27,226
and so I would click the Apply button in the upper right corner to apply those. The video will begin processing again, which will make it unavailable for short amount of time.

245
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:34,226
And then it will post the version with my edits into the Canvas site.

246
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:46,226
While we're in the edit mode I want to show you the automatic captions option because you have to come into the editor in order to add those.

247
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:54,226
I have some menus here that are different from what I saw when I was just watching the video as a viewer.

248
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:58,226
One of these menus says captions.

249
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:01,226
And there's a menu that says import captions.

250
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:13,226
And the first option is to import automatic captions so this is these are just automatic automatically generated similar to how the zoom live transcript is an automatically generated.

251
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:18,226
so it's not going to be 100% accurate.

252
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:26,226
All right, and so that just inserted. All of that text and so I can do a quick scan.

253
00:37:26,226 --> 00:37:29,226
And then I can apply.

254
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:39,226
That's going to attach those automated captions and save my edits and changes apply close the editor. Yes.

255
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:52,226
And it's going to go back to processing and I can close this tab and walk away.

256
00:37:52,226 --> 00:38:01,226
Any questions.

257
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:07,226
So I'm going to give you some time

258
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:14,226
to come on give you those of you who are here in person to come and look at the recorder.

259
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:22,226
If you would like some hands on.

260
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:41,226
Otherwise I am open to answering additional questions or using this time however you'd like to have some hand sanitizer here would like to use it before, and or after using the keyboard.

261
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:47,226
Question I guess it's what you're doing now, I have guest speakers who will be coming on zoom.

262
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:56,226
So, if I, I guess I would come into the classroom, But the zoom up.

263
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:59,226
Have them log on.

264
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:07,226
And then the tonight So, and capture your tire screen.

265
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:19,226
Yeah, so there is a slight possibility and just to make sure that question, got relayed. This was a question about, I have a guest speaker that needs to come in over zoom.

266
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:24,226
How does that work when I'm recording with an Octo.

267
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:41,226
It may depend on what classroom you're in what devices are available. Because Conoco, and zoom may try to use the same video and audio sources, and they can't both use the same microphone.

268
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:51,226
So there could be a chance that you'll need to stop the pinata recording and record it on zoom.

269
00:39:51,226 --> 00:40:00,226
And that's going to be logistically challenging several speakers. Yeah.

270
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:09,226
Just do zoom. Perhaps if you have several guest speakers, just record that classes that class in zoom.

271
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:21,226
Okay, so then in that case would you recommend that. Is there a way to to say I'm a little concerned students or even if I, you know, have laid out is, you know, this hybrid, etc.

272
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:30,226
I'm a little concerned students are still going to try to chat. Is there a way to disable Chad, there is, yes.

273
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:34,226
In zoom.

274
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:39,226
When you're the host you have a security item in your menu.

275
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:46,226
And it's a quick way to manage what zoom participants can and cannot do.

276
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:55,226
So we're seeing this in the room right now zoom participants may not be seeing it, because I don't think this computer setup to show the zoom menus.

277
00:40:55,226 --> 00:41:07,226
If I'm screen sharing that security button is in my floating toolbar like it is now, if I wasn't screen sharing and maybe somebody else was screen sharing, it's going to be in the bottom toolbar.

278
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:18,226
And so these checkboxes next to screen share chat. Rename themselves on mute start video, those can all be enabled or disabled.

279
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:27,226
So if I don't want participants to chat, I would click on chat to remove that check mark.

280
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:32,226
So, maybe, uncheck share screen.

281
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:39,226
Chat shirt, start video.

282
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:47,226
Yeah, depending Sure. Well everyone, I guess it's only going to be the guest speaker, I guess. Wait.

283
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:55,226
Yeah, because your guests you your guest speaker would be the only person joining over zoom correct right that's right. Oh yeah porting it for the students.

284
00:41:55,226 --> 00:42:08,226
That's right, watch out for, like, I probably don't meet you. Yeah, you will not need to do that unless yeah students were in zoom which is not, it wouldn't be live for the students would only be the recorded the students that would be live for the guest

285
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:14,226
speaker. That's right, you wouldn't even be sharing that zoom link with your students.

286
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:28,226
The only thing I think we would need to work out is how you schedule those like if she schedules through Canvas.

287
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:46,226
So then I guess it depends on high C so maybe just give us nimbly, the guest speaker. That's right, and then go through zoom to like get the recording, and then put the zoom link of the recording into my camp yeah so that so and then this is where you

288
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:59,226
have to sort of evaluate sort of like you know to go through Canvas, it will automatically. You know the recording will automatically appear and can go through Canvas to give zoo.

289
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:00,226
Yes.

290
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:13,226
Okay, I did not. Okay. Um, but, um, but the drawback is that nice able to access that way. The other way you control.

291
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:21,226
You know, it's only the, you know, a move and the guest speaker doesn't session but then they have to do some work on the back end to share the recording.

292
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:31,226
So it's, you know, you have to sort of see for yourself but what but what you what you want to do.

293
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:48,226
That's right. So, if you're doing some of your classes recording in pen octo, you might consider it's extra steps for you, but it's more consistent for your students to take that zoom recording and upload it into the pinata recordings area, so that students

294
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:53,226
are always looking for the class recordings in the same place right. Okay.

295
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:55,226
Okay, so you would do it.

296
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:59,226
So first you go to the zoom page.

297
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:03,226
And the recording would be there.

298
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:21,226
And you can download it, you can either record to the cloud, which you can access when you go to zoom.us. Okay, accessing recording, or you can record it to your computer and either take that recording file from the computer or just pull it from the cloud.

299
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:26,226
When you log into your web browser and there.

300
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:42,226
Yeah. And so I would probably suggest recording to the cloud, because otherwise it's going to live on the classroom computer which means you have to stand here and process that recording they're sort of like a conversion stuff it goes through when you

301
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:47,226
save it on your computer because you're not using your personal machine.

302
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:59,226
This way if it records to the cloud, you can go back to your office, wait for it to process and add it to panoptic from your own computer later.

303
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,226
Right.

304
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:16,226
So if I recorded to the cloud that means it goes to the zoom site. That's right. And then, and then before it okay so is there a step between it being on the zoom page and uploading it from there by herself that downloaded to my computer, then upload

305
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:30,226
it here that's right but I don't want to immediately, do it to the computer because I'll be in the classroom and I will be in my bed right you'll have deleted the class back to you and then you'll have to come back in the later to get it.

306
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:34,226
Yeah, so it's a tricky balance

307
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:53,226
also have some zoom guest speaker, yeah I'm just thinking about like if students want to ask questions but I know different classrooms have different like audio pickups but generally it's I'm in my gosh, somewhere in the first floor on the page two, and

308
00:45:53,226 --> 00:46:09,226
a 35 students. So like, generally are the microphones good enough that if a student had a question like would you recommend they like, come to the front of the room near the leg and ask should they like. Tell me a question and I asked them to recommend for interaction, I think you may find

309
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:24,226
interaction, I think you may find that you have a meeting lol in that classroom, but you said seats 35 that has 360 degree pickup. Yeah, what you might do is have the student asked the question asked them to project.

310
00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:36,226
And then the guest speaker, have a guest speaker let you know if they did not hear the question so that you can relay it closer to the mic.

311
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:53,226
Yeah, and I think kind of setting that up at the beginning of, we're going to have students ask questions if you don't hear the question let me know and I, so we can repeat it could recruit and say something as a question in the chat about the captions.

312
00:46:53,226 --> 00:47:04,226
This captioning have to be able to split up each video, as part of post editing or is there a single setting to click once to enable captioning for all recordings.

313
00:47:04,226 --> 00:47:11,226
It has to be manually added on each individual recording.

314
00:47:11,226 --> 00:47:24,226
I will look through the settings in the admin settings to see if that's an option but I have not seen that as a blanket setting.

315
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:33,226
Thank you for that question.

316
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:39,226
We have 10 minutes I'm going to back away from the computer to open it up, if anyone was Did you have a question.

317
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:41,226
Yes.

318
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:47,226
For zoom for the zoom recordings, is there a way to edit.

319
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:52,226
There is a beginning and end trim.

320
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:58,226
But once it's in Conoco. You could also turn something out of the middle.

321
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:01,226
Using the editor.

322
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:06,226
So if you're recording and zoom. Yeah, and it's in zoom.

323
00:48:06,226 --> 00:48:10,226
And you plan to move that to pen Octo.

324
00:48:10,226 --> 00:48:21,226
You would download the video file upload it to pen Octo. Oh, I see. And that's just uploading it to Canvas, uploading it within this context of an octo within camp.

325
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:25,226
That's correct.

326
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:34,226
So I can have it once I get it, and I do that. Excellent yep so you will use this edit button, and then you can make a lot of different cuts. Okay.

327
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:50,226
So bringing different out of it. I want to. That's right. You can edit in, you can either have it. Do the automated trend script, the automated captions or because zoom also generates an automated transcript.

328
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:56,226
You could consider using that, upload a caption file.

329
00:48:56,226 --> 00:49:07,226
Because zoom the recording area zoom is also going to allow you to download the transcript that zoom made.

330
00:49:07,226 --> 00:49:17,226
So you could if you wanted to use the transcript that was used during the generated during the zoom meeting, you could upload that file here.

331
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:24,226
Because zoom creates a lot of different recording files.

332
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:34,226
So that would be just another option, but the automatic captions is still an option.

333
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:43,226
So, you may be thinking that, you know, for the most part, and I'm not just speaking to people on the call.

334
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:57,226
You know, these editing tools or something you're never going to use but, be mindful of, you know, if you take a break during class and somebody comes up to the podium and starts talking to you about a, you know, personal issue they're having or, you

335
00:49:57,226 --> 00:50:13,226
know, you forget to stop the recording after class, and, you know, same thing somebody talks to you about something that should probably not.

336
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:24,226
So, you know, just keep that in mind as you go because it happens fairly often we get tickets from my perspective we say, yeah, that should be, yeah, pull that video Can you can you pull that video down because I if there's something on it.

337
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:44,226
That should be, yeah, pull that video Can you can you pull that video down because I if there's something on it. After class. And so, yeah, we can sort of make it hidden, and then we can also kind of clean it up and make it classroom ready, but you will

338
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:49,226
also have that ability as well.

339
00:50:49,226 --> 00:51:00,226
And so, one, one way where the waveforms come in handy as you can kind of see all right this is sort of dead air. What is that part is this where I stepped away to take, you know, a break myself.

340
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:05,226
That's going to help guide you on where to make puppets.

341
00:51:05,226 --> 00:51:10,226
One thing I didn't mention is,

342
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:19,226
if I were doing something, you know say I was on here for a long time and that was kind of the last slide of my presentation.

343
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:23,226
I could just trim

344
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:30,226
the slides off the screen share off and just show video and audio.

345
00:51:30,226 --> 00:51:37,226
So maybe I recorded my screen, but all I had up the whole time was just the pinata recorder, like this.

346
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:44,226
And that's really they're all that's really all there is to look at, besides my video,

347
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,226
something that could, you know, clean it up a little bit for the viewer.

348
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:55,226
I can just snip off the slides or screen portion.

349
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:58,226
And this will continue to play.

350
00:51:58,226 --> 00:52:07,226
So if you need to have video and audio you'll want to make sure you're on the video, audio track to make sure that gets grayed out.

351
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:15,226
If this were like a break time.

352
00:52:15,226 --> 00:52:17,226
Yes.

353
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:41,226
So I guess the other thing is, so the channel I think this whole thing through seventh guest speaker on zoom will be coming out of those speakers up there.

354
00:52:41,226 --> 00:52:57,226
If you have somebody speaking over zoom it's going to come out of the wall speakers, but you can switch that zoom speaker to come out of the meeting our so that this is the microphone, and the speakers so that there's not an echo for the speaker.

355
00:52:57,226 --> 00:53:09,226
So if I have sound coming out of here but it's going back into my microphone, the speaker might tell you, I am hearing myself back.

356
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:21,226
That may be where you need to call for help to figure out how do I set this up to where I don't have that feedback, or my guest speakers having trouble.

357
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:24,226
Can you show me what my settings should be.

358
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:26,226
So I'll just have to go to my classroom.

359
00:53:26,226 --> 00:53:40,226
Yeah, it's a very that that is a very tricky thing. And so, yeah, feel free to call and get help with what's the ideal setup for your room.

360
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:43,226
For me throughout this was incredibly helpful.

361
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:50,226
Thank you so much for coming.

362
00:53:50,226 --> 00:54:07,226
Anything else for anything else on the online any additional questions we can answer before we log off.

363
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:30,226
So if there's nothing else, I will just go ahead and end this session, but I will wait a few moments but you are free to go thank you so much for joining us online today.

364
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:36,226
Yes, please go ahead and ask your question.

365
00:54:36,226 --> 00:54:43,226
I may need you to type it though.

366
00:54:43,226 --> 00:55:12,226
Yeah, we'll wait. Thank you.

367
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:16,226
water.

368
00:55:16,226 --> 00:56:08,226
Sounds good. Yeah, I can watch it and shut it down from here. Thank you very much.

369
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:10,226
Okay.

370
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:17,226
Oh, are you supposed to record class discussions.

371
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:21,226
That may be a question above my level.

372
00:56:21,226 --> 00:56:29,226
It depends on the class discussions and definitely if it's group work it's not going to work

373
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:36,226
for a seminar I think if we can try, we should.

374
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:47,226
But depending on the size of the class and the classroom and the types of discussions, this may be technically will challenge.

375
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:55,226
Were you able to hear Frederick's response to that.

376
00:56:55,226 --> 00:57:14,226
Excellent. Yeah. And what I don't know is how long the court for the meeting is, if it could be played at the meeting our could be placed some like more in the center of the room as opposed to the front of the right so ideally, so yeah 25 students, if

377
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:21,226
that can be placed somewhat centrally depending on how long the cable is.

378
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:27,226
I have found that they're typically close to the computer

379
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:33,226
age to women suddenly, let's go ahead and just

380
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:40,226
pull be available classrooms page.

381
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:43,226
Just to see if we can get.

382
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:53,226
I'm not familiar with the building enough, so I need, I found this to be really helpful to get to get a sneak peek.

383
00:57:53,226 --> 00:58:10,226
So cute.

384
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:15,226
So that should pick up from the front of the room.

385
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:23,226
What it won't pick up. Oh, it didn't work well for the hybrid class and fall but maybe these elements are better.

386
00:58:23,226 --> 00:58:32,226
Right, the meeting I'll have a 360 degree view Let me see if I can put it in front of a webcam.

387
00:58:32,226 --> 00:58:38,226
So it's picking up the sound from all around.

388
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:50,226
So hopefully that will get better pick up what it's not going to pick up it's not going to pick up if students are having discussions in groups. It's just going to sound like chatter.

389
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:57,226
And that's just unavoidable.

390
00:58:57,226 --> 00:59:06,226
Yeah, so that's the meeting I was not already sort of at the front of that desk where it can get good student pick up.

391
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:09,226
You can see if you can scooted over there.

392
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:23,226
We'll have you give that a try and see how it goes.

393
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:35,786
Thanks so much for coming.
