1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,219
As an executive member, it's great to have student involvement because we really,

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,830
really, actually, really rely on your guys, take an opinion and even like, you know,

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:26,379
I would say like informal musings about like how things are going and chair of the Mpd's Curriculum Committee for the past few years

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:34,270
and it's always like so helpful because I know there's always stuff that like students are talking about and just like faculty have.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,530
What about communications? So if anybody has interest, it's a good item for your CV leadership.

6
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,290
So yeah, if people are said that it's super, super helpful,

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,560
it's a good way to just get to know people somewhere informally and have those networks built so great.

8
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,499
And you know, we always I always feel like, yeah, it's just communication is like a perennial issue.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,210
And we all understand, like, everybody gets kind of like down in their, like, rabbit holes of stuff they're doing and like.

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,170
But then you talk to people and you're like, Oh, I have no idea.

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
This is. That issue, you know, could be resolved or whatever it is.

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,110
So it's like often it's an issue like people don't know.

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,760
And then when people walk around and think that people do, you know, they don't, it's like there's like a miscommunication opportunity, so.

14
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,060
Cool. Okay. I it's kind of fun to see everybody, like, in the hallway, too.

15
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,249
So, okay, today we are going to talk about, well, lots of different things.

16
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,020
And this is what we talked about already, even some of these themes and we'll return to them throughout.

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,059
But really today,

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:01,330
kind of I think of of like setting the stage for a lot of the context for a lot of the child health topics that will kind of dove into.

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:13,050
So I know there was a mini lecture and then a few of these kind of more overarching readings that that people were to do for today.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,950
I also just want to highlight, if not a few of you guys about developmental context,

21
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,549
paper topic, and it's not at all like required that you talk to me at all.

22
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:28,180
But just to the reason I have you guys submit like a topic is just if people have questions,

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,819
it's sort of easy sometimes just like ask and canvas, but then also like just sort of thinking about the scope of people's questions.

24
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:46,200
And so if I may or may not have the opportunity to, I think I will go in and probably comment on those topics.

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,639
And if I say like, sounds great and that sounds great, and that's like a appropriately scope topic.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,680
And if they say like, Ooh, that's super narrow or too broad, those are usually kind of the, the comments that I give or I say, Oh,

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,290
and I get really excited about a topic and I'm like, you, I want to look at blah, blah, blah, and so get some resources there.

28
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,360
But yeah, certainly. And the other thing to note is like, you know, we're not 100% bound to this topic and I know it kind of all.

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,450
So if you sort of have a vague idea, then just put that up and then I can kind of give you some feedback to like guide.

30
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,000
And as people are thinking about it, I'm happy to, to chat more about.

31
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,519
That's right. So today we'll kind of go into the social context of mechanisms like this idea

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,490
of how do things get from the external environment into us and into kids.

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,300
And we'll go over to sort of comments and questions about readings.

34
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,260
And so I think breakout might be left up.

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,850
To me, this room feels hard to do like little breakout groups, but I love to have full group conversation.

36
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,590
Sometimes we'll do break out. We'll see if we can get to that. But I want to talk to you guys with you guys about screening.

37
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,889
And for ACS, which we has become, certainly, it's been interesting, as I've even taught this class,

38
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,750
it's become more and more like the kind of common discussion with our ACS.

39
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,740
But then also even more recently, there's been a little more focus on screening for protective factors that are what people

40
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,180
are starting to call and was mentioned in that reading benevolent childhood experiences A,

41
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,200
B, C is everything's got to have its acronym right and to get some traction.

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,680
So I think that's an interesting idea.

43
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,410
So thinking starting sort of big picture and we've looked at this before,

44
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,010
but this is this idea of how do things get in and at what levels are we thinking about

45
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,559
in terms of both just influences on child development and then the plural corollary,

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,900
which is interventions with child development.

47
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,250
And I think it's also important to note that adverse events can occur at different levels and can positive events at different levels.

48
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:16,810
And of course, we all go through life experiencing a mix of those principles and across adverse and positive events.

49
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,139
And when we're thinking about interventions and what we can do with like different levels of intervention.

50
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,900
So interpersonal interventions, policy interventions, community placed interventions,

51
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:36,640
school plays, interventions, is are we trying to like combat at each of those levels?

52
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:45,940
And then how might we do that? And I think one thing that we want to think about is this question of what protective factors,

53
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,530
just kind of thing or older term now for B.C. is maybe, but what protective factors may exist at each of these levels.

54
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:02,259
So, you know, just looking at this diagram is not the most, you know, fancy, but what do you think?

55
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,940
What do people think about, you know, aces, which we talk about a lot, that should be easier to generate examples.

56
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,390
What are some examples of aces that people could see it at different levels.

57
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,770
Parents lots of parents to the. Yeah.

58
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,940
Well, that's right. That's just, you know, family and livable and families and one of these micro system levels in here.

59
00:06:46,300 --> 00:07:00,240
The things. Things like in the school context, maybe. Like Jack was like, well, I hate to bring it up, like school shootings and stuff like that.

60
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,770
A more proximal like individual like bullying could also be considered.

61
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,310
Yeah. I don't know. Kind of like, you know, my, um.

62
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,180
When we think about all the isms and that's one that we've had a reading on, they can also exist across levels, right?

63
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,309
There's so much packed into that.

64
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:40,570
So there's like big macro system factors, Cronos system factors like that, historical time, how have things changed, not changed.

65
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,400
And then also like on an individual level, so like health,

66
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:52,450
I mean a lot of like health services research and how racism exist in that context and then the sort of like interpersonal interaction type context.

67
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:59,500
So thinking about that contextual thing, contextual level is so important for thinking about interventions because you're,

68
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,620
you're trying to sort of generally situate interventions.

69
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,050
You get great for the interventions that did this, but like no intervention is going to do that.

70
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:23,559
There could be some that are on not here. Things, for example, like how do those things and interventions out here can?

71
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:37,620
Certainly maybe. But it's really hard to thinking about the outlay of resources, you know, concentrating an intervention at multiple levels,

72
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,490
even though we all love to think and talk about multilevel interventions.

73
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,700
Like an emphasis at one level more than.

74
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,300
That's because of practicality. About the very end,

75
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:03,380
we'll talk about some more like positive youth development interventions that are kind of this across different levels to solve this.

76
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,600
You know, I don't know if I'll show this graphic again, but like, you know, it's probably in most of our heads at this point.

77
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,170
What about protective factors? Any protective factors people can think about as example?

78
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,910
Like the importance of having a strong, like, present parent.

79
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,480
But I think also just. But.

80
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,120
Example. Yeah. So having these multiple, you know, responsible, loving, caring adults.

81
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,930
Psychologists say you could go to throughout the day. That could also be.

82
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:15,769
So anything that's sort of sitting here in that school context and linking up school and health services, we'll talk about that as well.

83
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,900
We talked about like school based mental health clinics.

84
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:31,850
Collecting on our like access conversations like that is sorely needed and not well staffed for lots of reasons.

85
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,930
Emily, did you a little hand?

86
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:44,299
Yeah. So I think I like to just sort of have you guys muse on the protective factors across levels,

87
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,020
because I think that really does help us figure out if we've had experiences trying to do

88
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,819
interventions like where our kind of comfort zone is and where we think we might be most impactful.

89
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,690
Because I think the great thing about certainly HBP is we can go lots of different places.

90
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:09,800
But. And sometimes it can be hard to think about, like pulling out protective factors like parents, parenting,

91
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,080
caregivers, clearly as a big, important one that we've talked already a lot about but that where can protective.

92
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,510
Lurking. Tucked in that are child.

93
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:31,610
Child focused. And I think then this continues versus it's big picture history, historical trauma, mistrust and racism.

94
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:40,610
So that's kind of that big picture kind of historical time, understanding that as a situating factor and social.

95
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,480
Right or all of our intervention efforts.

96
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,450
So just to sort of briefly review mini lecture.

97
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:01,940
That's what I was just saying. So we can have stress and we can have positive sort of trickle down effect across these different levels.

98
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,879
Stress can get under the skin in many different ways. And I often talk about biobehavioral.

99
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,450
And again, when we're talking about little children, there's so much biology that's just like really actively happening.

100
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,649
And so what we know is that if children experience these stressors earlier in life,

101
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:29,870
it can kind of reshape their development about their developmental trajectories because they have such this early switch.

102
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,710
If we think about life course development, health theory, that's kind of what that is referencing as well.

103
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,970
And and then there's this parent as a buffer parent is a big, big protective factor or caregiver.

104
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,950
This early relational health is really critical. And so in order to achieve that, we need to really think about.

105
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,760
Yeah. We were like outside of that individual child level and if we think about what caregivers are impacted by that, define.

106
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:15,620
So a lot of intuitive sense. But I always harp on this point because if you think about kind of where resources are devoted and thinking about like,

107
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,890
you know, what people want to give money to, what causes people want to support.

108
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,290
Sometimes it can be easier to make the case for kids,

109
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,050
but it can be a little more difficult and in some cases a lot more difficult to make the case for kids parents.

110
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,979
Like, why should we help these parents who are, you know, engaging in bad behaviors in different ways?

111
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,780
Right. Like this is sort of a messaging that happens. You know, the kids, you know, are the kids of these parents.

112
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:51,140
And I work off and I'm in a project with kids of incarcerated parents.

113
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:58,440
And so what what that project is often talking about is like, you know, how do we help the kids?

114
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,490
And in order to help the kids, you need to help the parents, even though the parents, you know, are in this situation did something bad.

115
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,299
So in some cases, they really did do something that.

116
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,870
Right. It's not like everybody, you know, can can not do something bad.

117
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:25,900
Right. But it's this piece about supporting parents that I think is difficult to, like, sit with sometimes in interventions.

118
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,200
And so we want to think about why we're supporting parents.

119
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,950
If you're needing to, like, make the case like, okay, you know, this parents struggle with substance abuse.

120
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,080
This parent was incarcerated. This parent is living in poverty.

121
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:46,700
Lots of things are going on with this parent. The reasons that we want to invest and support these parents is that by that,

122
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:54,890
they are this critical support for kids that thinking about intergenerational transmission and stopping intergenerational transmission of aces.

123
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:11,280
That's critical. So did you guys have any kind of comments, questions, thoughts on either the mini lecture or readings that came up for people?

124
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:26,600
That's a question. Nobody. Well, that you kind of have to remind me when they talk about a child.

125
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,950
Both were interesting, patrician and like noticing that like a parent had.

126
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,510
And to maybe like another piece in the church. How this is impacting your child.

127
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,120
And oftentimes that might be a bigger motivation.

128
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,570
That is so bizarre because I never would have thought like that would have been in the scope of nutrition.

129
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,430
But like, I think that. Yeah.

130
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,220
So but also like family subsets. I think it's really interesting to think about like.

131
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:08,120
And farther out in. And like thinking about our discussion of vaccinations like that also has to happen.

132
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,560
Like all these things need to happen. Like, it's a power packed time potentially.

133
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,470
So thinking about that, like pediatric medical home, maybe where the pediatricians like,

134
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,150
oh, okay, I've discovered this, you know, concern, oh, parents are smoking.

135
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,980
Let me go and walk you down the hallway and hook you up with somebody who can help with that,

136
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,650
give around that, as opposed to me having to do it and visit.

137
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:40,100
But can I covered in a visit and then come back to you is like a nice, nice model, I would argue.

138
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:48,110
But definitely it expands the scope of like a pediatrician visit or another

139
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,069
context where we might find out something about like a family that we think,

140
00:16:52,070 --> 00:17:00,170
oh gosh, you know, this family could use resources in this area to help the child achieve their maximum developmental well-being.

141
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,230
LOUIS And that made me think of something else.

142
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,560
Oh, I guess I would just comment, too, in this AP statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics, it's 2021.

143
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,630
So it was kind of a all of us who study and think about early relational health all the time.

144
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,320
We were super excited to see that because that was really I think I put it in like further readings for you guys.

145
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,170
Oh, no, no, no. I put it maybe next week, but our next class meeting.

146
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:46,260
So just really focusing on that as kind of a context and as an outcome and as a protective factor that's really important for kids,

147
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:55,590
especially young kids was just sort of nice to see that focus because we know that that is really critically important.

148
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:04,260
But either it sometimes can be like taking that or, you know, only thought about in the context of like pathology.

149
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,780
And remember I was talking about those attachment styles.

150
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:14,579
Like, you're sort of a anxious avoidant attachment style, and there's a lot of dimensions to that early childhood relationship.

151
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,080
But the function of it is really to provide that safety and security so directly related to attachment.

152
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:30,059
Okay, I'll click through the other reading pieces as well.

153
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,120
But I put this up here also.

154
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,239
Clearly, this is, as we've talked about already,

155
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:48,240
like an ongoing issue and consideration for all of thinking is the ultimate cross level, social, contextual influence of right now.

156
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,770
We've talked before about how it can interact with child age and family stage in terms of how the impacts are felt.

157
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:04,170
One of the readings that I gave, we've heard a lot about negative impacts of COVID, of course,

158
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:14,820
but one of the readings I think is in for the readings was like for some kids it was kind of okay to not be in school at least for a time.

159
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,400
Like it probably wasn't okay for anybody to not be in school for two years. Very few kids.

160
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:30,390
But for some kids, like who had, you know, social anxiety or who were bullied in person in school, it kind of was a reprieve from that.

161
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:40,120
For kids. We think about it. Also, this comes up with regard to child abuse because in child abuse reporting.

162
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:52,479
So what happened in Covered is that people who were primarily doing home visits and things and being presented

163
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,600
with situations where they might witness child abuse that they needed to report weren't doing those home visits.

164
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:09,309
And so there was a lot of like panic at the beginning of COVID saying, oh, gosh, these kids are going to be, you know, left in an abusive situation.

165
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,740
And I think that that is true for many kids.

166
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:19,420
And I think that at the same time, there were some interesting efforts that were sort of a new model of child protection,

167
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:31,360
that were more community based and that, you know, did not rely on child health like CPS workers to detect and monitor child abuse.

168
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,829
But that were more sort of community based efforts to support families who are

169
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:44,470
otherwise getting reported sort of equitably in the child protection services system.

170
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:55,120
So I think even though we can look at COVID as a big social contextual factor at that macro level, going in across all levels, generally negative.

171
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,640
But I think it's that interaction between like what the families, other circumstances are and what happened with that family and COVID.

172
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,620
It's not always a super simple story. I do have a lot of additional.

173
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:21,440
In that chapter, we can just try to get a little more specific on readings from the text.

174
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,780
I just love this child's public health book.

175
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:32,590
So I kind of like how they like go over a lot of things in a ton of detail, but I feel like they cover the key points.

176
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:42,820
Did anyone where any of the experiences they talked about in this chapter, ones that people hadn't thought about before?

177
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,550
No. They talked about parenting styles, nutrition.

178
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:59,920
They kind of go through a lot of topics where people are kind of familiar with most of those before anything that was surprising or.

179
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,010
Differently about populations that you'd interacted with before.

180
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,830
I know. I think we have some nutrition people in here maybe.

181
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,860
I know, but nobody has an interest inside. Oh, that's so interesting. I feel like usually I've got like they are you guys.

182
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:32,700
Like, I usually there's a bunch of interesting people. Um, so I know they, they just they dealt with breastfeeding and nutrition in that chapter.

183
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,630
They also talked about child maltreatment.

184
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,680
They kind of covered a range of what we will come back to in terms of interventions, but this sort of sets the stage.

185
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,820
That's considerations, Collins. Yeah. Oh.

186
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:04,010
Just wondering if anyone else maybe find an explanation or another mention that there was a significant disparity in breastfeeding rates.

187
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,740
The lowest rates among the most impoverished groups.

188
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:19,160
And like I know, one formula for being signs of some breastfeeding ultimately is free because the woman is.

189
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,050
So lowest among that population.

190
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:34,440
They mentioned education in the reading, but I was thinking, could it be because those women can't afford to stay out of work for as long?

191
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,770
Or like why else we think that might be happening?

192
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:48,330
It kind of seems like that would be beneficial for poorer families to continue breastfeeding so they don't have to have the expensive formulas and it.

193
00:23:51,010 --> 00:24:04,910
Thank. Since you really want to advocate for yourself, like for your baby to not give the formula.

194
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:53,860
But. The time associated with breastfeeding is like something that's like your child's one thing, but also, like pumping in, like the equipment.

195
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:11,420
It's all a lot. It takes a lot of time. And if you're working two jobs or as multiple kids like that, time balance can be really challenging.

196
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:25,890
They don't understand is necessarily, but like if there is some type of like biological response to probably like the amount of stress that was.

197
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,490
Yeah. Yeah, I can get a nutrition standpoint if you're stressed.

198
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:52,790
You can. Yeah, absolutely.

199
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,920
So like we've got baby biology,

200
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:04,520
we've got mom biology and malnutrition and mom's history of producing factors that relate to milk production, more or less milk production.

201
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:14,780
Definitely the process of breastfeeding. It's also, you know, often represented as like, oh, it's a beautiful thing.

202
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,630
That's a big, big natural feature, baby. And it's and it's inexpensive, right?

203
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,710
It's like all of these things. But the reality is that it's often difficult.

204
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:33,030
It's often doesn't sort of work out right away. And so it can be stressful and frustrating and.

205
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:44,249
It used to be more common in hospitals to have like formula samples and sort of have babies be given formula.

206
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,350
And so that's a lot easier in a lot of ways because there's less like resistance.

207
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,410
The baby doesn't have to work as hard to get formula.

208
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,640
And so it's been increasingly recognized that that's not a great baby or mother friendly.

209
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:09,140
Oh, they have like baby friendly hospital policies that sort of discourage the giving formula more and more.

210
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,710
You think a baby food article. And at the beginning, it's we still have all these factors that are really important.

211
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,279
Babies. And we have convenience and we have, you know, expense.

212
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:36,550
And we have to. You have to have a freezer to put it in to store up for later and all sorts of things that are sort of it's like the hidden costs,

213
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,480
like the hidden costs, which sounds wonderful and like it's probably start up and it's great.

214
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,229
It's free and it's. Why not? And. Desired thing to have happen.

215
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:55,460
But it's there's a lot of potential barriers there that we are learning more about how to account.

216
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:08,880
Yeah, certainly. And nutritionally, it's one reason why.

217
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,850
That's a lot of nutrition from breast milk and also a lot of immune protection.

218
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,079
And so the sort of education around like, well, why would I even do this?

219
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:31,400
It's a hassle and it's painful. It's painful. The reasons why people might not want to be doing it.

220
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:43,220
Person is important, but. Disparities in breastfeeding rates.

221
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:58,740
Anything. Any other topics? And this one? We talk about maternal smoking and things like ADHD.

222
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,890
And it just made me think about. Like maybe like the 50 to 60 and then maybe like.

223
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:27,110
A big thing and adults are walking around. What does population variations rate and in those.

224
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:36,270
Then I don't know if it was right, but certainly, like if you guys are familiar with the thalidomide.

225
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:48,010
That agenda. Basically, it's smoking, but it's it was a medication that they gave women for morning sickness, pregnant women.

226
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,069
And it turned out they didn't really know. But it was a teratogenic, meaning it was a danger to infant development.

227
00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:00,490
And so many children who are exposed to one of my were born sort of without limbs.

228
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:09,490
And so it was really widespread and it was really tragic because that particular drug had been given to women for morning sickness.

229
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:15,850
So there was like this sort of perfect storm of really bad, you know, challenging birth outcomes.

230
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,610
And these women had been sort of unknowingly targeted with this drug.

231
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,870
Looking on like a broader scale.

232
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:37,100
I mean, if you talk to people who do prenatal smoking research, they will say, you know, if you can do it's like worse than like, you know, taking.

233
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:47,170
In the depression, like smoking is really, really damaging to sort of fetal development and size and function and all sorts of things.

234
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,400
Side of and I would say the data are out.

235
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,340
The data are not and yet are. Well development.

236
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:07,340
There have been a few emerging studies recently on marijuana and fetal development and infant outcomes.

237
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:16,650
You know, very early in general, I would say if you can avoid substances because it's not.

238
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:24,010
That's. But we don't quite know the patterns of kind of business and outcomes associated with.

239
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,280
Example. Yeah. Good. Great point.

240
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,559
Anything else? And this one. And this is just like a good overview chapter.

241
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,330
I think we will talk more about child abuse and family conflict.

242
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:51,750
Some of the terms I think like they have this like family breakup and conflict that sounds like high drama,

243
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,960
but it's, you know, thinking about family dynamics with kids and how that can kind of impact us.

244
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,420
Yeah. Yeah. One thing that.

245
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:16,060
Like as a as a sort of childhood obesity eating researcher we hear so much about, like promote family meals, eat family meals.

246
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,710
I would argue that's like also a source of big stress for parents like my.

247
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:31,590
But what we don't really know is like I think family meals are great, but I think like if you're stressing yourself out to make a family meal,

248
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,560
you know, that is probably more you know, you got to weigh the costs and benefits.

249
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,969
But in family meals, I agree. Like there's a lot that happens.

250
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:45,280
There's a lot of like interpersonal dynamics, like how was your day?

251
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:54,690
Engage in conversation. And you can also, if you're going to plan police sit or gather as a family, you can maybe make.

252
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,400
I and that to me much more stressful to do if you are knowing you're going to have to eat in a rush and you're going

253
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,730
to also have to fight about eating broccoli or whatever it is so you can set the stage for more like experimenting,

254
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,530
eating. And then also, yeah, just,

255
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:21,920
just think about family meals as an example of a family routine that is really rich with lots of different ways to sort of nudge the system.

256
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,879
And so it is an important like intervention idea and context,

257
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,880
but the way that it's kind of message around is often like, you know, eat five meals, you know,

258
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:38,000
as a family, we can that can also, you know, kind of backfire if people are like,

259
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,899
well, I didn't do the five meals, so let's just everybody in the A TV like I'm done.

260
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:48,350
I'm not going to try that anymore. Yes. Why are we recommending family meals?

261
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,650
What are all the things that can happen? Could they happen at other, you know, gathering ways?

262
00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:02,430
Could they happen at other times in other location? Um.

263
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:10,430
Okay, let's see. Okay. And then I gave the AP public policy statement, and again, this was another one where, like,

264
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:22,810
I think this one is 2019 and this was another like interesting policy statement factor that it sort of like rose to the to the point,

265
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:31,730
you know, to the point of making a policy statement around racism in from pediatrics, you know, from pediatricians who are like, you know.

266
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:42,450
It's saying children, you know. So bringing in this sort of big social context into the pediatric setting, I think it was a, you know, kind of.

267
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,610
Right. And also, like pediatricians aren't able to solve this.

268
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,530
Right.

269
00:35:49,540 --> 00:36:01,330
But sort of it's a way to sort of situate the work of pediatricians as a primary source of, you know, influence, hopefully on children and families.

270
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,680
So anything they do have a lot of like, you know,

271
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,950
I say pediatricians aren't going to solve this and they're not because of the much larger issues on pediatricians,

272
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:21,550
but they kind of give a lot of steps of here's what pediatricians and people in this space can do.

273
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:35,170
What did you guys think about this one and sort of the steps they suggest and in terms of, you know, combating racism as a virus, curious racism,

274
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:47,320
this idea that like, you know, the ones that I was talking about, like racism is one big stressor for many parents that kids may be picking up on.

275
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, and also, that's what my favorite little pictures just to sort of illustrate that context concept.

276
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,190
Uh, this one. And this again.

277
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:08,850
These, like steps of. But it's for this stuff.

278
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:17,440
I thought that they went through a lot. And one thing that kept coming up in my mind, especially with the first bullet point where there.

279
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:31,240
Providers should be, like, sensitive. And just sort of like that is ideally would happen but I think.

280
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,200
And like, historically, it was like racist. Racist.

281
00:37:47,360 --> 00:38:01,100
I think that there's a lot of nuance in the. Some people might not even have the skillset.

282
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:18,910
So I think the other. But.

283
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:32,790
I mean, these propositions. Thinking about, like, remember remembering our vaccines conversation too.

284
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,090
Like that's around a really specific issue that kind of lives in a part.

285
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:48,159
Think that it's a question like how do we deal with bringing in this big social context that can also cross levels?

286
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,309
So it's like happening in the office moment and then it's also happening at work.

287
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:59,250
Like, how do we kind of, you know, work on.

288
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,020
And other context in which people exist.

289
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:52,100
Yeah. And he said yes. Okay. Maybe the pediatrician could.

290
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:14,849
Oh, but then there's also other factors. I have to bring this up because I agree.

291
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:26,280
And aspirational, by the way, is like one of my favorite words. So I lot like having this policy statement out there I think is like a very cool,

292
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,139
good step, but it is aspirational and it is like you can't do this in an office visit.

293
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:38,190
But by saying we think it's important and it's a priority and like that list of priorities,

294
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:48,419
it's on one of the early slides where it's like sort of acknowledging where this professional focus can be or can move towards.

295
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,380
Same thing with the relational health statement, too.

296
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:59,280
So it's like you can't fix relational health in an office visit, but we can sort of elevated to a discussion and a priority professional awareness.

297
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,860
Yeah, that's sort of a really big picture piece. Yeah, I think. I think like.

298
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:20,399
He said there's not many solutions. Well, I have this problem.

299
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,630
I can't do anything about it. Damnit.

300
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:33,610
Yeah. Mm hmm. Like it's not to be taken on lightly.

301
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:40,440
Right. And it's as with many things around screening, which we'll talk more about screening.

302
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:49,319
Be aware that if you're screening for something or if you're asking if you're bringing something that's like have a plan, right?

303
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,950
And have something, know your resources that are available to you.

304
00:41:52,950 --> 00:42:00,210
And if you know you don't have the resources like a, you know, working behind the scenes to create those resources is important.

305
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,550
And then be when you're screening for things,

306
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,880
think about matching up what you're screening for with what you can actually provide, or at least from start to.

307
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:19,270
That's really important. I mean, for all things, screaming for anything that's that's important because we talk about how important screaming is.

308
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:24,370
But then you can do damage to relationships if you scream and then say, oh, that's a bummer.

309
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,880
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's very helpful.

310
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:37,370
I just think that you have to. Like. Now you brought up this thing, and you make me feel guilty because I can't.

311
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,020
It's not to go to tangent,

312
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:56,600
but like this morning I was on a phone call with the woman who is working with indigenous populations from which she is from in Bolivia.

313
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,980
Long story. But we were talking about parenting and parenting interventions and she was just like, What?

314
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:14,159
Yeah. I just spent a long time like sort of trawling through lots of different things and I found some things,

315
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,719
but they all had like a paywall or they were just so or they were certainly not in Spanish

316
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,900
and they were certainly not culturally adapted to like the group that she's working with.

317
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:30,659
And there were just so many layers of this type of discussion, huge, big issues, really wanted resources.

318
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,530
And I was like summing a few things that I could find that felt like they could be helpful.

319
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,130
But yeah. Office visitor.

320
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,550
It certainly is important.

321
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:50,720
So I think that I like these policy statements, as you guys can probably tell, because they do kind of give like that big picture.

322
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:56,840
They are aspirational and they're they're sort of saying like, this is what we think is important and where we should go.

323
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,129
And then it's like, all right, thinking about like implementation science and like,

324
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:13,010
how do we go from that to program development and then hopefully program evaluation of those programs?

325
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,780
See anything else on this piece?

326
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,440
We can talk more about screening to. Um.

327
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:42,010
Okay, so one thing that I think is cool and this idea of like moving from, okay, here's this big picture macro issue of racism.

328
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,209
Here is this AP policy statement that said, Hey, this is important.

329
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,500
We need to pay attention. We need to really think about strategic and systematic ways to work on this.

330
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:56,250
And I will say, in the past few years, there have been a number of different, you know,

331
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:02,800
like starting with these sort of academic research publications in this area, some even,

332
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,030
but some have been talking about well,

333
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:14,019
certainly there have been publications and research on like how to talk to kids and sort of as a ground up idea,

334
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:24,280
like how do you talk to kids about racism and impacts? And then also some just sort of big picture like context papers,

335
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,719
I would say like key considerations like this is how we need to think about things and

336
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,820
bring this into our thinking and then also even some ideas for like interventions.

337
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:44,200
And again, this is an example of a really big social context, macro influence and sort of where,

338
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:51,219
how do we move from understanding that's there and that's really important and that's affecting child development in these documented ways too,

339
00:45:51,220 --> 00:46:00,880
like acting on that and think. But where do we want to situate interventions that can maybe help address address this?

340
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:08,559
Yeah, I'm thinking about how. All right, Dr. Anderson.

341
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:51,280
Who? And a.

342
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:19,250
That that's a good example of an intervention that is at that family context level

343
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,580
that involves parents reflecting back on their being parenthood in their own history.

344
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,880
And then also going forward, like here's some parenting behaviors and actions and things to discuss.

345
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,170
The other one, I think I mentioned this to the other day when we were talking about this,

346
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:49,399
but there are some interventions that are really around racism focused on this, like how to how to talk to children about it.

347
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,000
Because I think that's been this big fear, right? Like, okay, if I point out, you know, differences between people to children,

348
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,090
they're going to like embrace those differences in a way I don't want to do.

349
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,130
I don't want them to embrace them.

350
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:09,620
And so there have been like some really just sort of I would call it basic developmental science researchers who are like testing these questions.

351
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:17,090
And some have kind of moved in the direction of interventions where they talk to kids about like noticing difference.

352
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:21,260
What does that mean? And like this is very basic child focused interventions.

353
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,809
And I think that's also interesting too,

354
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:31,400
because that's like really at the child level and then family level and then we think about like broader level.

355
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:40,579
So here's another example of an intervention, I would say, about these like macro media campaigns,

356
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,879
you know, mental health stigma, awareness like big picture things.

357
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:53,910
It's really hard to evaluate their impact at the same time, like those macro these macro social context influences,

358
00:48:53,910 --> 00:49:05,090
it's like you have to just at some level, you know, make them infused throughout the culture, right, in order to sort of shift attitudes.

359
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:15,590
And so PBS Kids, which I love, PBS kids, but they did this sort of series and they have like these are actors and scripts,

360
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:21,700
but they're sort of processing their sort of modeling how to talk about race and racism.

361
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:31,820
And I will say also to date, a lot of the findings from some of these like child, you know, just how developmental scientist,

362
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,250
experimental kind of studies with like 30 kids or 50 kids are not things like big picture things,

363
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:45,370
but they're sort of finding like, oh yeah, kids don't have sort of more racialized beliefs as they talk about race and racism.

364
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:53,810
So that's that's good to know. And I would say, like, we may have perhaps assumed that, but it's kind of good to have some research to back that up.

365
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:06,380
And I think that kind of just going through racism as an example and through third major social contextual factor.

366
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,200
But there's other examples we can think of, right,

367
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:19,910
as sort of big picture influences on child development and equally challenging of like how to go from this macro change to like the child and what,

368
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:27,890
what levels of intervention can we think about that so that, um, let's see, I see that.

369
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,819
Okay. A little bit about screening.

370
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,309
Any other thoughts on. Feel like we'll come back.

371
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,260
But I like to talk about this as an example because it is more in the common parlance now,

372
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,110
like I've given that I used to give another article on race and racism where when I first started

373
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:55,080
teaching this class and so many of these articles have come out since starting this class since 26.

374
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:06,480
So I find it really fascinating that it is kind of picking up steam as an issue and an important and good book.

375
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:12,020
And yeah, this I don't think I gave you guys the racism as a virus article, but it is a good read.

376
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,910
And so people are interested in that area. It's that it also kind of lays out some steps.

377
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:24,350
Okay. So let's switch focus a little bit and talk a bit more about screening.

378
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:32,870
So I sort of said one thing that could be negative about screening, but in terms of the.

379
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:42,170
What are the contexts that children are living in? What are some other can and people?

380
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,040
Can people think of any other downsides to screening? What would be helpful?

381
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:55,400
It could be challenging to look. They're talking more about.

382
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,540
And they have actually suggested now screening for social determinants of health.

383
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:05,570
Uh huh. And texts. So what do people think about that?

384
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:27,999
It could create bias. And even I don't know if anybody's been to like your health care system that they

385
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,780
do those partners in health questionnaire partners in care and I have it I'm like,

386
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,780
you know, authority from some of my colleagues. They're like, oh yeah, those data aren't always used.

387
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,870
Like the questionnaires sometimes don't get entered in to.

388
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:57,229
Hopefully most of them do because those are really important data like political career decisions, but they don't always get entered in.

389
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:02,120
So even like that kind of a basic level of, you know, I filled out a questionnaire.

390
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:08,599
Is it going to be entered in the data stream to like inform our bigger picture pieces?

391
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:15,170
And is it going to be used by my clinician? And if my clinician uses it, are they going to be forming biases towards me?

392
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:21,260
If I say yes, I'm, you know, have problems obtaining adequate food, everyone.

393
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:44,350
Yeah. Anything else? And so a false result, I.

394
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:05,990
Big see and things like that. Think about resources, right?

395
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:11,190
Like if somebody says, yes, I'm having this and you divert resources to the person, resources are always rare.

396
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,420
Right. And the person doesn't need it. And you can kind of give an extra.

397
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,950
What, what would maybe be a reason that. Yeah.

398
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:31,020
For like sort of false neg, you know, false negatives or inaccurate screening responses around and social determinants of health.

399
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,500
I mean, like, you know, do you have a place to live?

400
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:41,250
Do you have adequate food? Is someone in your household harming you like these kinds of questions?

401
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,130
What would be. But.

402
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,990
Mayor's office. Thinking about it. And I think the time that a provider.

403
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:03,410
I know in like community health. Like I went to a doctor once, I had three concerns.

404
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,800
Like, All right, we have a lot of concerns. We only have 10 minutes.

405
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,700
Which one do you want to go? It. So this makes me think of like what you screen and you have like all these positive responses.

406
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:26,720
What do you even address? That's the thing.

407
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,229
If you're the provider and you're like, Oh goodness, I see there's lots of positive responses here,

408
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:41,460
but there's all that the parent is coming out about something else. I know I have unstable housing.

409
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,040
But what I'm here for today is blah, blah, blah.

410
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:52,010
Yeah, it's building in like it's sort of around managing expectations to about like, here's the kind of things we're going to ask about.

411
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:57,330
Here's the kind of resources we have. You know, here's how your data will be used.

412
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,430
All of those kind of concerns are important.

413
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:12,030
Think about before implementing a screening process and the like, sharing that information is.

414
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:20,280
Look to the health care system, to that provider. You know, you may not want to share that information.

415
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,300
And so that's really.

416
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:37,730
But when people are going to a doctor like let's see when it's not a routine appointment, like someone in there with a concern or something.

417
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:48,850
And if you're administering. Yes.

418
00:56:49,760 --> 00:57:06,440
Also would. Which is great, you know, but.

419
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:55,090
Yeah. So the parent who's kind of got concerns then kind of going back more often although attended the fact that you mentioned.

420
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,100
Absolutely that's considered a.

421
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,850
As he goes back to the accuracy things I know from personal experience, going to my description,

422
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:15,220
growing up when I was like probably around 12 or 13, they started doing the depression screening.

423
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,109
But I think it was literally three questions that range from How many days?

424
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:25,590
Are you sad? How do you feel? Obviously owning your own life from might be.

425
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:30,600
But it's a sad news. There are so many different other factors, I feel like.

426
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,800
Yeah. On the screening at all.

427
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:46,690
I say that like from from a parent perspective on the like managing expectations around them.

428
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:54,970
I've talked to adolescent medicine colleagues who are like those amazing people who love to work with teens.

429
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,540
It's awesome that they exist. Not everybody has access to them,

430
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:08,770
but like in chatting with them about that that pediatrician visit where they kind of switch over and the parent is sort of booted out of the room.

431
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,480
All right. Because of that, Ian may need to share with the pediatrician.

432
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:14,380
That's something I wanna share.

433
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:23,379
But yeah, like those questions get pretty intense for a teen, you know, especially kind of a young teen to be answering.

434
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:35,750
And so that could definitely. Means he wasn't expecting it or the parent isn't expecting it, or there's the questions are answered and nothing is.

435
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:43,060
Done with the information that compose all kinds of sort of additional stressors.

436
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:55,650
If a child is, you know, indicating those highest levels of screener, there is a system in place for that to be acted upon.

437
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:00,180
But we have to trust that system is in place for all these.

438
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:06,810
And it's really important. I think I'll say one word about.

439
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,340
After that, they did a screening.

440
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:23,390
There's this big research group who looks at screening and outcomes and screening for social determinants of health.

441
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:29,990
And what they did was they said, okay, well, let's see how kind of automated we can make this process.

442
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:34,939
And so they developed a way to say if someone had a housing concern,

443
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:42,530
they would like generate a letter like a pre-written kind of letter from the pediatrician to a landlord and,

444
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,890
you know, kind of fill it in with the concerns that the family mentioned.

445
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,720
And that letter went from pediatrician to landlord.

446
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:58,160
So unlike a family talking to the landlord, the pediatrician sort of gave this like prescription for changing this aspect of the housing,

447
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,790
like, you know, lead abatement or something like that.

448
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,129
Landlords actually made sort of more change and addressed some of the housing issues that the

449
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:15,920
family had been asking about unsuccessfully when it came from like the the powerful M.D.

450
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:21,980
Right. So I thought that's an interesting example of kind of trying to tweak at the big picture level,

451
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,110
you know, connect these systems and maybe try to switch behavior,

452
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:35,690
change behavior without the family having to like constantly advocate for it if they don't have the power to, to do so.

453
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:46,250
So I always like that study and okay, I'm thinking about screens and trying out screening for aces and social determinants of health.

454
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:55,490
And then this one, this reading which they gave, they have like a little table about benevolent childhood experiences.

455
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:08,330
That contrasts nicely, I think, for ACS. And I think if we look at these, they're like table two and and so they have at least one safe,

456
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,690
safe caregiver, one good friend beliefs that gave comfort,

457
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:19,880
enjoyment of school teacher who cared, good neighbors and other adults who provided support opportunities to have a good time,

458
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:26,150
which I think is kind of like an interesting item, but it kind of reflects like, did you have like a child,

459
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:35,870
you know, like a child focused activities in your childhood, kind of positive self-image, predictable hum routine.

460
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:41,689
The thinking about those items, um, what do you guys think about screening for,

461
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,560
for those in pediatric or other kind of child, child family focused contexts?

462
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,930
And then the meeting mentioned that even in the president is aces.

463
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:04,510
Sometimes these these were able to offset or outweigh those negative effects I think.

464
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:14,140
The screen for one, you should screen for the other because if you want AIDS that you want to intervene for.

465
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:32,230
But if there's more easy. Point that balance and maybe one of the bases is like leverage to, you know, there's a protective factor there, right?

466
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,100
You can use that to kind of counteract that. He says, even if it's not already actively kind of doing that.

467
01:03:37,110 --> 01:04:16,170
Yeah. I think that goes is also reflects that idea of like, you know, setting up expectations, setting up a context for why these are being asked.

468
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,620
And I agree. I think it could be really stressful if that's.

469
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:30,959
Yeah. I was thinking just now as I was looking at this and like I feel like they're screening for like coping mechanisms for stress,

470
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:39,300
whether it's like adaptive or maladaptive. So it just made me think about other questions that could potentially be asked to stand there.

471
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:47,990
Coping skill. Basically you buffer a lot of those things.

472
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:51,510
But so. Yeah.

473
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:57,639
And I would say these are more. I feel like when I look at this list,

474
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:04,540
I think I'm protective factors that are like sort of we're thinking like about statistics and interaction effects and that kind of thing.

475
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:11,560
Like, are they present or not present? Do you have a zero or a one value on this, which is kind of how these a lot of these tools are designed,

476
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:15,770
but then also like Carly's example of the depression scale.

477
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,850
Like there's there's lots of range there and there's lots of different things involved there.

478
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,990
Like, could we also screen for more, you know,

479
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,720
coping mechanisms or mindsets or things that are a little more variable and like, what does that look like?

480
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:32,770
And I know that's getting, you know, again, we don't play at all at the feet of the pediatricians because that's.

481
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,830
Through having positive coping skills,

482
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:53,410
skill skills in ways that we can detect when not having those coping skills beyond the sort of like social context of aces happens because happens.

483
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:05,680
Great increases to receiving Medicaid. But.

484
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:23,130
Kind of like, okay, now we're screening for these. But.

485
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:31,569
Well, it's this it's like these recommendations that kind of come down come down from from, you know, different governing bodies.

486
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:40,500
And this is not a this is not tied to Medicare reimbursement, but these sort of big picture recommendations to that U.S.

487
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:47,260
Prevention Screening Task Force sort of comes out with recommendations about what you should screen for.

488
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,280
And that idea, unintended consequences, is super important.

489
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:58,659
So we've been talking about a lot of sort of it's not small scale isn't unimportant, but like more micro system,

490
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:06,220
unintended consequences, like feeling bad, stressing out parents, you know, having somebody not be listened to once you ask.

491
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:14,780
But also these bigger picture things like with the vaccine prep stuff we discussed the other day, do families leave?

492
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:21,200
Do families then not get care? Do pediatricians or any provider can opt out because they're required to screen?

493
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:30,280
And so it's interesting to look at the state of California because they have mandated more and more of the ACS screening.

494
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,120
And they're sort of, I would say, at the forefront of thinking about this.

495
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:42,790
That's what many things in California. But that's my bet. But one of the things they they have also done, I think, in a good way,

496
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:49,540
is they've offered a lot of training around handling these social context factors,

497
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,110
understand what it means to do screening and understand and have, you know, to.

498
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,479
And also provide resources for it. So it's a moving situation, I think,

499
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,350
but it's a really good point and I think we always want to be aware of that when we're again

500
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:11,830
in public health and trying to do these macro interventions or recommend them or design them.

501
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:15,700
What are the unintended consequences? Yeah. I just had another.

502
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:21,280
I feel like I need more info to adequately understand the more times that are generated.

503
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:29,180
Oh, yes. Yes. Let me.

504
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:37,700
I have that in a few slides. Okay. That's basically the idea.

505
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,089
There is screening like not only for the child's current conditions,

506
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:47,030
but the conditions that the parent grew up in with the knowledge that the conditions that you grow up in

507
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:53,810
as a parent kind of trickle down to your childbearing and your child's experience of being parented,

508
01:08:55,100 --> 01:09:00,110
you know, on average. And so we will talk more about that.

509
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:06,110
And I think I have. Yeah, let me let me go through some of these guys.

510
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,240
But let's get there.

511
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:20,020
So I'll kind of go briefly, but this is also more on the resilience bill and they kind of unpack with more of this idea of like coping style,

512
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:28,360
like what are some, you know, in-between processes that kind of help explain and that we could maybe intervene with that are beyond kind of like,

513
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,919
oh yes, this happened to you and you know, you had this many aces or you didn't like that.

514
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,490
So it's a really blunt instrument. I would say the aces screaming.

515
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,900
But it's important because I'm sure I've said this already,

516
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:52,640
but like when this started to become important is when physicians who were looking at adults, like cardiac patients found that.

517
01:09:54,570 --> 01:10:04,010
Who have more of these like heart cardiac outcomes and more of these like stressful events in childhood.

518
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:13,170
And so I always kind of joke like as soon as they're like big adults, cardiac physicians got involved in understanding early childhood stress,

519
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:20,580
it became much more important sort of to the world because that's such a huge population and it sort of put a foot.

520
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:26,080
And I think that's this for the study is this is this study.

521
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:32,860
So it's like a really, really big sample size and associated with these adult health risks.

522
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,180
So this is also just some facts about aces.

523
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:42,880
And there's this sort of idea of like this cutoff and this is why it's a total blunt instrument.

524
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:52,479
But statistically, sort of if you have four or more aces in your history, it's associated with poor outcomes over time.

525
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,250
So this is like this cardiac the cardiac findings.

526
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,200
And I think just getting to this point,

527
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:10,139
it kind of previews this multi-generational point or intergenerational transmission point, which we'll talk about.

528
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,050
But this idea of like, why is relational health important? Right?

529
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:18,570
We talked about like them in infancy and like there's a lot of learning that happens in these interactions.

530
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:23,430
But it's also this idea of, okay, these issues may have happened to me.

531
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:28,409
I can't change these past experiences, but I can have restorative experiences.

532
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:37,469
And that happens through relationships. And the idea of we'll talk more about trauma and trauma informed work in the

533
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:41,880
resilience film I think does a pretty good job about kind of unpacking that.

534
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:47,100
But the idea of something being trauma informed is like saying, okay,

535
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:52,710
something happened in your past versus like, why are you functioning poorly, right?

536
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,160
Like to put, you know, go again, be kind of like traumatic and blunt about it.

537
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:04,710
But the idea of being trauma informed is asking a parent or a family, you know, what happened to you versus what is wrong with you.

538
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:09,120
Right. And hopefully we are past the point, but I'm sure it happens.

539
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,940
You know, what is wrong with you? It's just not a great question.

540
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:17,670
If you're trying to move towards like a positive relationship and a trusting relationship and an intervention,

541
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,710
what happened to you is maybe a more appropriate way to think about it,

542
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:30,300
even though that may not be a great question to ask a family, that that's kind of how they talk about defining what's trauma informed.

543
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,510
And so because of these statistics, these early adversity statistics associate with later cardiac disease,

544
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,140
etc., we really want to get in and work on that early.

545
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:46,500
And that relational health piece of early relational health is what is critically functional, functional, important for the child early.

546
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:51,900
And we can disrupt that intergenerational cycle of passing on these sort of traumatic events.

547
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:01,479
Um, I think we will talk about this more and we've already kind of talked about this,

548
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:12,370
but I think I just wanted to also make sure you guys had I mean, you can find these items anywhere, but these are the aces.

549
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:17,010
And just looking at them, I don't know how well you can read up on.

550
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:25,299
Some of them are like pretty heavy duty, like physical abuse. Some of them are, you know, more broad.

551
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,140
Like, did you often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important or special?

552
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:35,620
Um, this is, I would say, social determinants. So you didn't have enough to eat, had tawdry clothes, had no one to protect you?

553
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,380
And were your parents ever separated or divorced?

554
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:46,569
So a lot of people have this item, a separate or divorced item that can be very different from a lot of these other items.

555
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:55,060
So I think the other thing that I would say about SS, it's like an unbalanced it's an unbalanced blunt instrument even though it sort of is,

556
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,060
you know, is it kind of was the first measure that was out there.

557
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:05,709
But so many things with measurement and I'm glad that I'm kind of bringing up like the upper class.

558
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:09,820
Like we have to think about how we measure this stuff and understand what our measurement means.

559
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:16,150
So a lot of people now are looking at like clusters of aces, like emotional neglect,

560
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:25,389
obsessive abuse, social determinants of health, kind of scarcity kind of items.

561
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:33,610
So this is questionnaire has become used for many people that I would argue it's.

562
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:42,370
And it's also maybe incomplete. So again, that we were talking about racism at the beginning of the hour.

563
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:45,820
So like there's no kind of racism experiences on here.

564
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,920
But people have made like, for example, COVID impact questionnaires.

565
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,370
Some of those COVID impact questionnaires also have racism items on there.

566
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:00,909
Some have COVID only items on their summer ACS type items.

567
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:07,520
So there's lots of different ways of measuring is going back to the big picture thing is social context factors that influence child development.

568
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:11,680
So I present other stuff,

569
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:17,500
but I would just give it a big caveat like this is not a perfect measure and we can certainly improve and people are working to improve it.

570
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,299
And so I think we covered a lot of this in our discussion.

571
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,930
So like why we're asking when you ask, who do you ask?

572
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:31,060
Is it the parent? Do they know what's going on, what to do and what resources you can provide?

573
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:39,730
And and I'll just this really gets to Jackie's point, like, so here's the divorce item, 36.2.

574
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,329
That's like really, really different from physical abuse.

575
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,989
They can certainly co occur in household substance abuse is up there.

576
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,800
HUSSLE Mental illness is up there. And some of these more intense.

577
01:15:53,490 --> 01:16:00,240
Aces are not nearly as common, but like divorce is in separation a relatively common.

578
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,640
So that's kind of an example of how they are distributed.

579
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:12,540
This is a sample of over a thousand parents and this is in parents and here.

580
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:17,219
So the other thing to notice is that social determinants.

581
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:25,980
So again, these big macro factors, poverty is one such factor and so you're more likely to have public insurance if you're living in poverty.

582
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:33,060
So here are the percent of families who have four or more aces in public insurance.

583
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:41,040
The sample of the public insurance, 10%, almost 11%. People who had four or more aces in private insurance were 6.6%.

584
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:47,400
So that's thinking about again, like how the macro factors are shaping our ACES likelihood.

585
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:53,190
The other thing I would point out is that mothers reported having more aces than fathers.

586
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,970
And if we think about, you know, lots of things we've talked already about, like likelihood of disclosure,

587
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:05,760
rates of violence against women, lots of different things can be contributing to that statistic.

588
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:12,750
So I like to kind of end on this note of aces are not like happening in a vacuum, right?

589
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:18,120
She shape that but these are certain sort of particular ways in which that aces.

590
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,030
Okay. And that actually this is what gets a.

591
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:42,770
So this screening parents around how they were parents are screaming parents with their aces or other

592
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:49,099
things that we think are important how they were parenting being how they were being parenthood,

593
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:58,190
how it shaped them and how they making the link basically for parents that like things that happened in your past around your parenting,

594
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:06,589
you know, as you parent, especially in early childhood, those can maybe be triggered for you in lots of different directions and just sort of

595
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,220
alerting parents and like we were talking about breastfeeding right at the beginning,

596
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:17,500
that's a great you kind of think about, gosh, what does this mean to you?

597
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,499
Like how does this fit into your idea of what parenting is like?

598
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:27,680
How are you? Parenthood and breastfeeding is one of those issues that people often struggle with.

599
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:34,130
It's a real challenge of early parenting, and I think it can can trigger a lot of things for biological and behavioral and psychologically.

600
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:43,040
And I think this is the other thing I always make. The point I make about the ACS questionnaire is that it didn't matter any

601
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,760
protective factors like you guys saw that there's no protective factors on there,

602
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:55,580
and that we do know that this idea of, you know, was one who made you feel special, loved or importance.

603
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:00,910
Like that's really the key critical issue for childhood development, right?

604
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:06,980
And that it's relational help and it can be lots of different caregivers and it can be teachers.

605
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:13,790
And so I think I would land on the idea that screening for protective factors sort

606
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:17,690
of broadly and maybe really relational health for talking about young children,

607
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:23,530
that question can kind of capture a lot of stuff. And, you know,

608
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:31,519
for parents of young children and it's a little bit I think it's a little bit less threatening than some of the other questions we talked about.

609
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:38,179
But I think the idea is, you know, figuring out for parents, did you have somebody like that?

610
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,720
And like, can you be that person in your young emerging child's life?

611
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:48,050
That's a big task of parenting. And it's hard to do, but that's an.

612
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:56,840
Um. Yeah, I heard.

613
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:57,980
Well, is this.
