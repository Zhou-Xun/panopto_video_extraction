1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,350
Good afternoon, everybody. How you guys doing?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,909
Today is the last day of class. Still, we have quite a few people who are not here yet, so maybe they will join us later.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,670
Or maybe we'll get to review the slides online. But you guys ready for the semester to be over?

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,080
Yes. Yes. You can take a break and recharge, right?

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,000
I hear you. And then rooting for you for that.

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:39,310
So I'll start as usual with some announcements and then we're going to continue talking about today, which is infectious disease surveillance.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,719
So our first reminder is that the final project and three are due on Friday at 1159.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,299
I was three will include content from weeks five six and today so week seven and

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,530
we're going back to our twice multiple choice format for final project reminders.

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,540
Remember to send your your article to Hawaiian by email and then find reminder,

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,430
which is very important for you to make sure that you are answering everything that we need for each process.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,760
Keep the prompts eight and then put your answer beneath each problem.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:31,480
It makes it easier for us to know that you've addressed everything for that particular question rather than maybe addressing it later.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,300
If you are doing as a form, as a term paper, it's going to be hard to evaluate if we have to look for you across different points in the paper.

15
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:53,620
And then I got a question last week in case any of you or any of the groups have decided to do bullet points, no bullet points in the final write up.

16
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,030
So you can answer the question in paragraph form.

17
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,830
It could be one paragraph, it could be multiple paragraphs, but no bullet points for the answers to different fronts.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,760
Now, if you are describing what contributions each group member make, you can use bullet points.

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,660
If that's going to help you not go over you on your word.

20
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,480
Any final questions about the final program?

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes. Clarify. Yes.

22
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:39,160
Nope. So the question was the contribution from each member in your group, whatever was included in the total award?

23
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:48,190
Yes, references are not included, but your contributions will be included in your total will come again for that section

24
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,790
if you find that you're running kind of most of the work you can do for that point,

25
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,450
and that's fine. Any other question?

26
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,990
All right. So today our topic for today is infectious disease surveillance.

27
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,830
And when we think of surveillance, I know sometimes a lot of us might think this is the key thing that we do.

28
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,420
And one of the topics about surveillance comes about.

29
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:25,770
But you'll see as we've covered through the last six weeks, that surveillance includes multiple types of data.

30
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:33,620
And this process is one has going. So for today,

31
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,710
we'll talk about a general view of infectious diseases and then we'll spend some time

32
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,010
to briefly introduce the major infectious disease surveillance systems in the U.S.

33
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:57,140
And I want to introduce, because there's a lot of information, but it gives you a sense of what this particular data set and data source is all about.

34
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Now, you can go to this site when you have time to get additional information if this is something you're interested.

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,610
So we think infectious disease, a key component that we need to think about is transmission.

36
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,959
This is very important in helping us understand the disease one and then to try to understand

37
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,580
how we collect surveillance data when it comes to infectious disease surveillance.

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,790
And so there are multiple ways that infectious diseases can be transmitted.

39
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,819
You can have a direct contact or indirect contact, and within those two categories,

40
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,310
you can have food, water, which could be which could be fecal ora route.

41
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,870
You have the airborne route, which we've become familiar with with COVID 19 vector borne in Michigan,

42
00:04:48,870 --> 00:05:00,629
we have West Nile virus and then there are other vector borne or mosquito related transmissions and you have the perinatal route wherein in effect,

43
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,590
a mother could transmit a pathogen to her child.

44
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,850
And this falls in a separate categories are more of a so the other types of transmission will be

45
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,510
consider horizontal transmission where the transmission is coming from one source to the next.

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,290
The vertical transmission is where a mom will pass a pathogen to watch how either during pregnancy or go into labor.

47
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,570
And so this is a separate category until it falls on a contact of direct contact groups.

48
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,060
So any questions about these that general transmission routes as it relates to infectious disease surveillance?

49
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:52,620
Okay. So after understanding or having a sense of the different gestation rounds,

50
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:01,230
a key step that we need to be able to implement in infectious disease surveillance is determining infection.

51
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:11,160
And there are multiple ways that we can do this. The most common and most obvious way is when people present with symptoms.

52
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,740
But we know that this can just be a tip of the iceberg.

53
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:26,100
So this diagram on the right side of the screen shows how if we focus only on symptomatic presentation,

54
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:36,620
we're just seeing just a little bit of the total number of cases compared to using other types of methodologies to determine infection.

55
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:43,650
And so with visible cases, you have those with clinical early symptomatic illness.

56
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:52,140
But then the bigger section of cases would be a non-clinical illness where you have preclinical and for preclinical.

57
00:06:52,140 --> 00:07:00,120
These are individuals who do not have symptoms yet, but symptoms were eventually develop subclinical.

58
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:08,790
You can think about it as those who do not have symptoms and most likely if nothing changes, those individuals will continue to not have symptoms.

59
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:17,970
And then persistent and later. And those are those types of infections that kind of stay for persistent, stay for a long period of time.

60
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,190
And then for later on, you have infections where a person has become exposed.

61
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,890
The pathogen is within the person's body, but the person is not exhibiting symptoms.

62
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:40,350
So the infection is there until other conditions allow that particular infection to become visible or at least to have symptomatic presentation.

63
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,020
And so one example of latent infection could be if somebody is exposed to TB.

64
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,160
So sometimes people become exposed to TB, but they do not develop.

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:58,530
I can see the disease, that bacterium stays in the body and it remains later until either there's a

66
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,480
very stressful time in a person's life or maybe they have another infection.

67
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,620
Or say nutritional status is one where they are not getting a good amount of nutrition

68
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,470
and that can lead to the presentation and development of the active TB in this case.

69
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,880
Any question about these different types of infections?

70
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:32,040
Three Jesuit rebels were. All right.

71
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:41,130
And then in addition to not having all cases present with symptoms, in some cases, symptoms can be nonspecific.

72
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:53,460
And then, as we talked about, sometimes nonexistent. So on this slide, we have a fever taking from the CDC,

73
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:02,100
which has characteristics and maternal birth outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory confirmed COVID 19.

74
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:12,600
And so the group in the group Blue Eye, those pregnant women in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, around 63 participants.

75
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,480
And then they light up. Do you have individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy?

76
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,570
208 participants. And so for COVID 19, you see how there is across the different types of symptoms.

77
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,420
And then also varies by what individuals were in the first or second trimester.

78
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:42,300
So you have around maybe 6 to 8% of individuals in the first trimester of a second trimester presenting with fever,

79
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,730
chills or chills, whereas you have just around 60% of individuals in the terror trimester.

80
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,730
And so in most cases, except for nasal congestion, congestion,

81
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,090
all of the symptoms you have more individuals presenting in the first and

82
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,800
second trimester with these symptoms compared to those in the third trimester.

83
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,150
And then decreased smell, decreased taste, diarrhea.

84
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,780
You see, those are you have a smaller percent of individuals presenting with some of these symptoms.

85
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:30,209
So the message from you is that we need to be mindful when we do our case definitions about what to include and if we include those,

86
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,690
how specific those symptoms may be to what we are trying to define.

87
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,950
I'm actually really surprised that nasal congestion you have such a small percentage of individuals,

88
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,620
both for those in a third trimester in the first and second trimester presenting during pregnancy.

89
00:10:49,640 --> 00:11:03,530
This is another image from CDC where you have a cohort of women who were hospitalized between the ages of 15 and 49 with COVID 19.

90
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,620
And from this group, you have 598 women who are pregnant with COVID 19.

91
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:18,050
And you can see from this group you have around 55% of those women were asymptomatic.

92
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:26,300
And if you go down to the different subcategories, those who complete their pregnancies and those whose pregnancies resulted in life births,

93
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:39,110
you'll see for each subgroup, those without symptoms seem to be to have a larger percent compared to those who are presented with symptoms.

94
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,880
So this can be problematic and we are using symptoms to define a particular condition for surveillance purposes.

95
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:59,270
So in addition to symptomatic presentation, there are other ways that we can use to detect infections so we can do microbiology.

96
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,610
And this allows us to determine those who have disease at the current point in time.

97
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,600
And then when microbiology, we are able to identify which organism that person may have at that point, etc.

98
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,840
So if the person is presenting with a symptom as common to influence us,

99
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,180
come to RSV and come on to COVID 19, which are things that we are dealing with at this point in time.

100
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:38,720
You can do microbiology that will allow you to be able to get some information about the particular pathogen that's causing that person to be sick.

101
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,350
Then you have immunologic assays and this is useful in telling you what a person has been

102
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,370
exposed to a particular pathogen and what did that person develop a reaction to that,

103
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,250
an immune response to that particular pathogen.

104
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,010
So it doesn't tell you what that person currently has the disease, but it tells you whether there's been previous exposure.

105
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,320
And then another way you can detect infection would be using molecular epidemiology,

106
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:15,500
where we are using sequence data to track how a particular outbreak is spreading in a gaming community or across communities.

107
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,220
And so these are ways that we can use to detect infection.

108
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,420
But in the field and what we are still trying to make of and then if I test are available,

109
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,470
sometimes we go by symptoms which has its benefits and also disadvantages associated with that.

110
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:46,430
So one of the ways to proceed when you are investigating an outbreak or collecting data for infectious disease surveillance,

111
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,860
you need to be able to establish what symptoms associated with a disease of interest.

112
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:04,100
You need to identify whether there's a diagnosis, pathway or guide to give people some sense of how to diagnose this particular infection.

113
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,890
You need to identify which populations affect. Is it little kids affected mostly?

114
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,820
Or is it a general population? Or is it affecting older adults?

115
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,950
You also want to be able to define a geographic location and also timing.

116
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,840
And these are very important.

117
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:30,769
When we do epidemiology, I've had people say, but can we just give the information and not necessarily include tiny, tiny.

118
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:38,120
It's very crucial us. And just think about giving somebody information about the case fatality associated

119
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,140
with COVID 19 and not indicating the timeframe that you're referring to.

120
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,019
That can be very misleading because with the case fatality associated with COVID 19,

121
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,320
if you're telling us the information for today, public health resources need to be moved around to address that issue.

122
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:01,640
But if you're talking about case fatality from 2020, when the COVID pandemic was at its peak,

123
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,450
then we know that you're talking about something historical.

124
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:14,900
So we always need to put the date, the time or the timeframe in context or whatever epidemiologic measures we are reporting.

125
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:27,220
And when we do our case definition, we need to be able to identify the sensitivity of that test or the case, that definition that we've developed.

126
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,220
Sensitivity is the proportion of true cases that are detected by our surveillance system.

127
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:42,639
And so you have true cases. And when you define who are going to be considered a case, you are going to miss some people.

128
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:53,470
And this sensitivity measure gives you a sense of in general how well your case definition works in identifying those who have a disease of interest.

129
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,590
And then for specificity, that's the proportion of non cases or non disease.

130
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,870
Individuals wish your surveillance system is able to identify as not having a disease of interest.

131
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,640
And this can be very important in surveillance and screening and data collection.

132
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,750
And then finally, you have the positive predictive value.

133
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:27,890
So among those who use screen, what proportion of those individual truly have illness that meets the case definition?

134
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,620
So in this case, there are positive predictive value. The base population is not the general population.

135
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,780
The base population is the group of people who have already tested positive based on your case definition.

136
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,660
And then sometimes you might have another test that might be the standard, the gold standard or the diagnostic test.

137
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,370
And then from that group,

138
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:59,340
you will go and apply the diagnostic test to see how well that case definition was able to capture those in the population who actually had the.

139
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:09,910
So think of it this way. So for COVID 19, you might have symptoms like some of the symptoms shown on that slide.

140
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:23,680
For pregnant women, fever, congestion, diarrhea, you might have a whole list of of symptoms in the early stages of the data collection process.

141
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,910
And then from those individuals who meet that case definition,

142
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,250
then you'll collect samples from those individuals and then maybe send them for laboratory testing.

143
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:42,360
And from there, you'll be able to have a definitive answer about who is truly a case and then who may have looked like a case.

144
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,480
But you don't have much microbiology evidence to support that.

145
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,170
How do we identify cases?

146
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:04,499
We can identify cases by either actively going into the community and trying to get information on those who have symptoms or we can work actively.

147
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,600
Maybe we'll hospitals and laboratories to give us information as soon as the information becomes available.

148
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,650
The other method would be passive, which is where hospitals, clinics,

149
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:30,720
labs would collect information and send the different forms or reports to the health department on a regular basis.

150
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:37,740
And this allows the process to be happening over time is cost effective.

151
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,180
But this system is likely to miss is asymptomatic cases.

152
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,590
So people who have symptoms would be those who were present at the lab for testing.

153
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,820
And so for those who do not have symptoms, they're more likely to miss them,

154
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:59,700
which would be slightly different if you were actively in the community trying to get information about those who could potentially be cases.

155
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:09,850
For Case ID, you can also use our syndromic system and this system is based on using signs and symptoms.

156
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,100
This system can be useful in situations where it takes a lot to get testing results back,

157
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,260
and a similar situation was used at the start of the COVID pandemic.

158
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:34,840
However, testing wasn't widespread at the start of the pandemic, and so samples had to be collected from the different states and then sent to CDC.

159
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,980
And that's a long time if you have a highly contagious infectious disease.

160
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,970
And so in that case, sometimes you will use signs and symptoms.

161
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,880
It allows you to get a quick sense of who could potentially be a case.

162
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,970
And with that, you can start public health prevention programing at that point in time.

163
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,180
The disadvantage with that is that you're going to pull a lot of people who have different conditions.

164
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,350
It could be COVID, it could be the flu, it could be RSV. It could be somebody who is responding to allergies in the atmosphere.

165
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:19,720
So you you have a benefit with a syndrome, assist them to get the cases, potential cases quickly.

166
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,000
But you also run the disadvantage of having more people than true cases in your sample.

167
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:36,520
And in for case ID, the final example is contact tracing, which can be prospective or retrospective.

168
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:46,570
So retrospective contact tracing is where we have a person who's a case and we go back in time to see who was exposed,

169
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,860
who that person who has the disease at this point in time,

170
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:59,020
who that person was exposed to in the past, or if would be prospective contact tracing, where now the person has developed the disease.

171
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,939
And then you try to get information for who may have who may have come in contact with

172
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,290
that individual and follow those people over time to see if they develop the disease.

173
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,830
So it could be we can go back in time or you can go forward in time to see who will become newly deceased.

174
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:25,720
And so when we identify who's our case for giving plays in a giving time.

175
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,410
We need to then put that in the context of Is this the usual?

176
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:40,390
Is this what we see at this time regarding this particular illness, or is it more than what we expect for this time and for this particular illness?

177
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:47,890
And so if it's within the category where it's just the usual number that we get on a yearly basis or the time of the year,

178
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,430
then we consider that to be endemic. These are the numbers that we generally see for these particular conditions.

179
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,930
Now, if it's above a certain number or a certain threshold,

180
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,170
then we start thinking this is an epidemic related to this particular condition for this time of the year.

181
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,310
And so we need to be mindful what time of the year?

182
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,950
So in the fall of the flu cases might be endemic, was expected.

183
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:21,840
Well, if you had those same numbers coming maybe in June or July, then it would be something slightly different.

184
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:30,790
And that's why it's very important when we think any epidemiologic measure that we report the time or the place.

185
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:37,540
All of those things can be very important. And also, who's getting the disease of interest?

186
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,940
Is it in the usual group or is it in a new group? Those are all the things that we need to think about when we think about.

187
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:55,370
Outbreaks and in final there will be one epidemic where we have a worldwide epidemic.

188
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,010
There's also a component to classifying something as a pandemic.

189
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,409
There's this administrative component.

190
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:11,570
So you might have a large number of cases in a given area and then sometimes across countries or maybe across continents.

191
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,250
But a pandemic is usually one that's called or labeled by the World Health Organization.

192
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,940
So even though my CEO might be thinking this is definitely to go in the direction of a pandemic,

193
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,920
what is not officially called that unless the World Health Organization calls it that.

194
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,400
So there's this whole administrative component associated with that.

195
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:44,040
Any question about infectious disease terms and data collection.

196
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,560
Terminology. Okay.

197
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,900
So we'll do a quick overview of the National Infectious Disease Surveillance Networks.

198
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:05,010
We will cover briefly the National Notifiable Diseases Network, foodborne illness, antimicrobial resistance,

199
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:12,840
hospital acquired infection, vaccine uptake and vaccine adverse events, and then finally influenza.

200
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:26,730
So the national notifiable diseases, this is done through CDC, but CDC collaborates with local health departments across the U.S. to collect data.

201
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:34,200
So each local health department will collect information and send that data set to the state,

202
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:43,049
the State Department for the state health department to combine that information, which would then be sent to the CDC.

203
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:53,250
And CDC is going to combine data from all states and make a nationally combined data set available for people to use.

204
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,750
And the goal really is for this timely reporting of data to detect disease when and where happens.

205
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,490
The goal, of course, with CDC is to stop disease before it spreads.

206
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,850
But CDC is collecting information also that's going to strengthen the science if they get new information

207
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:18,210
about how the disease is spread or if they get new information that's focused on the laboratory aspect.

208
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,870
They are going to share this information with the health department that produced the data for them in the first place.

209
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,850
CDC is always working to improve how we control disease.

210
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:37,560
And this ties in with when we talked about at the first class how data collection is always on goal.

211
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:47,770
We collect data, we inform what's important to certain communities, and then we use that information to develop programs.

212
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,970
And then those programs are then evaluated and to see how well they are working.

213
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,180
The ultimate goal is to keep people healthy and minimize the burden of disease.

214
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,010
So how do we do surveillance for the NOTIFIABLE database?

215
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:15,760
So the first step would be if a patient presents to a health center with a particular disease,

216
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:26,530
the health care team will collect information and then report that information to the local or the state health department.

217
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,930
After the Health Department collects the information, the information is then sent to CDC.

218
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,820
At that point, it becomes notifiable.

219
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:44,080
So that's a difference from the state, from local health centers to the local health department and the state health department.

220
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:54,700
The disease is considered reportable, and the states decide which diseases are reportable from the state health department or the CDC.

221
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:04,480
It becomes notifiable. And the CDC is going to work to combine the data and then use the information to send it back.

222
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:12,819
You know, go back to the previous slide to produce information that's helpful to the individual patient information

223
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,750
and also to advice the health care team and then to also support the health care department.

224
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:30,070
So is is just this process that's ongoing and then keeps informing from which the data will be originating.

225
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,879
So there are protocols set in place for how people, health departments,

226
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,380
laboratories should inform the local health department or CDC about certain conditions.

227
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,370
So certain conditions are required to be reported within 4 hours.

228
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:59,490
So on the same day that you get a positive test and then some other conditions are routinely notifiable,

229
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:08,010
meaning when the next cycle for reporting data becomes available, then that particular test result can be sent.

230
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:21,750
But for SA's small pox and some other conditions, individuals from these different labs or hospitals need to let the CDC know as soon as possible.

231
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,919
And the goal there is to really give CDC the alert so they can be on top of any

232
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,680
potential outbreak and then try to minimize that as soon as and as quickly as possible.

233
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,920
So with this information that CDC is collecting is a wealth of data that they are collecting.

234
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:47,530
So they make it available in the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report.

235
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,450
And then you are slowly combining the data from all of these states,

236
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:06,670
and then they make the information available for people to to use as the need to the MMW are can be found on the CDC website.

237
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,940
And then they also released in journal form. And so when COVID started in 20.

238
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,389
The U.S. now 2020, that was a very useful source for me,

239
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:27,500
looking for information on COVID 19 among people during pregnancy because I have interest in pregnancy and preterm birth.

240
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,410
And so I was looking for information about data CDC was collecting on pregnancy and preterm birth.

241
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:43,840
Other times, we can go through the published literature to get information on published studies.

242
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,910
But this was a situation where everything was ongoing. So a lot of those data had not rushed to the peer review process to be published.

243
00:29:52,360 --> 00:30:03,730
And so this allowed us to to have access to current information related to COVID 19 among people doing pregnancy.

244
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,070
The other network is the food borne, water borne illness.

245
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:22,550
This is also operated by CDC. It includes the national outbreak reporting system or laws in this system, collects information on all waterborne,

246
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:30,710
foodborne and enteric disease outbreaks so similar to the Notifiable Disease Network.

247
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,690
People get sick. They go to a health center.

248
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,410
They help center diagnose them for giving illness.

249
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,900
And then they quickly let the health department know.

250
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:51,050
The Health Department identifies that as a potential outbreak, and then they investigate and make the information available to the CDC.

251
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:59,990
CDC works to combine the data and then make the data available for anybody to use to answer any research question that they may be interested.

252
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,160
So if you visit the site, there are different ways that you can look at the data.

253
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,880
You can look at outbreaks for giving timeframe.

254
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,830
You can look at outbreaks for a given year.

255
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,930
So you can look at the information by month. You can look at the data across years.

256
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:30,640
You can present the data based on the source of the infection.

257
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:38,320
And then you can also look at the data by the etiologic agent responsible for the outbreak.

258
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:47,370
So if you're interested in infectious disease and you want to see information for a specific location, you can go to the site.

259
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:57,420
The link is there to play around a little bit with the data and be able to get information on outbreaks related to these different infectious agents.

260
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,980
The other network is the Antimicrobial Resistance Network.

261
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:17,480
This network, specifically National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Network Norms, is a collaboration between CDC, FDA and the USDA.

262
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:27,320
And the goal is to keep to keep tracking information about and sometimes microbial resistance among humans.

263
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,460
The ones that you can find retail meets and then also inform them.

264
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:38,990
And so they are doing routine testing of these different sources to be able to inform the program.

265
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:55,040
This is really an important. Topic because it's projected in the next 25 to 30 years that antimicrobial resistant infections,

266
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:06,080
this is where you have these pathogens that are resistant to the known antibiotics that are used to treat people.

267
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:17,930
And so it becomes a problem because the pathogens are developing resistance faster than we are able to develop new drugs for these pathogens.

268
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:24,080
And so it's becoming a problem that in the next 25 to 30 years is projected to be the leading cause of death,

269
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:30,380
even taking the place off of cancer and making cancer second place.

270
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:36,320
And so this is truly important and really we need to have data on this on an ongoing basis.

271
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,020
So for humans, CDC operates the samples that are collected for humans, for retail meats.

272
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,550
This is operated by FDA and then for farm producing animals.

273
00:33:49,910 --> 00:34:01,160
This is operated by the USDA. So for some of the pathogens, they are similar across the different agencies.

274
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,860
For humans, you also have Vibrio and shigella.

275
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:19,340
These are two pathogens that can lead to diarrhea in people for the most part equally and enterococcus pathogens.

276
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:26,330
They some of them cause illness in people, but the bulk of them don't.

277
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:36,830
The major concern here is that they might develop resistance and transfer that resistance to other parts here that might affect people.

278
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:46,670
And so this is very important. And that's why these two other agencies track these pathogens to see how they are changing over

279
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:54,960
time to to be able to have information about potential crossover from one pathogen to another.

280
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:03,440
In terms of antibiotic resistance. And then we have health care associated infections.

281
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:14,150
This is a network that includes acute care hospitals, rehab facilities, long care hospitals,

282
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,600
and they include information on many types of hospital acquired infections.

283
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,260
So it could be one that's associated with a device.

284
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:33,050
It can be associated with a procedure and then also have information about organizing specific health care acquired infection.

285
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,439
It's very useful for informing anti-microbial policy based on the data that

286
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,730
they're collecting and analyzing that might make some changes to existing policy.

287
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,620
So this table here shows the different types of hospital acquired infections.

288
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,470
So that says I wish would be surgical site infections.

289
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,940
Some of them are catheter associated urinary tract infection.

290
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:10,090
And this is when individuals who are in the hospital for a different reason and a need to have a catheter inserted to help them

291
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:18,009
go to the bathroom because of the procedure that they're going to be undergoing will limit their ability to go to the back,

292
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,870
get up and go to the bathroom. That can lead to a urinary tract infection.

293
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:29,530
But the urinary tract infection is coming about because of the catheter that was inserted.

294
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,359
And so you have information about the baseline information that is collected in how

295
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:45,670
those facilities are doing over time with the different hospital acquired infections.

296
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:54,370
And so they have the standardized infection ratio and this tracks how hospitals are doing or

297
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,620
facilities are doing in terms of what's expected and what they actually see in terms of infection.

298
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:10,540
And so if they have a standardized infection ratio, which is called serve as our if they have ACR of zero,

299
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:19,240
meaning the expected and they actually estimate it will be the same if you have it in start as greater than

300
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:27,850
one meaning what was estimated the actual infections happened to be higher and if it's less than one,

301
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:33,370
then they estimate it is higher than what they actually had.

302
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,760
At that particular point in time. So the SARS takes into account.

303
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:47,040
We talked last week about for cancer by certainly hospitals.

304
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:57,580
It wouldn't be fair to report cancer by hospital if we're not taking into account how sick people were when they went to that particular hospital.

305
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:06,010
And so the story does something similar where in the end they take into account and incorporate

306
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,510
the characteristics of individuals for that particular location to be able to determine.

307
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:21,370
Ah, so it's not just a blanket calculation where you just have the total number of cases and the total number of people going to the facility.

308
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:27,100
They take into account a number of chronic conditions that individuals have and then they incorporate

309
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:34,980
all of that in terms of generating the estimated number of cases that for a particular time frame.

310
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,220
Any question about the network's cover so far?

311
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Okay. So the next one is the vaccination uptake.

312
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,480
There's the National Immunization Registry,

313
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:03,450
VAX view and Vox View actually collects information from different sources to be able to keep this database up to date.

314
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:11,640
The National Immunization Survey collects data on kids 0 to 35 months.

315
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,670
We know that the school vaccination assessment reports they are necessary for kids to go to kindergarten.

316
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:28,050
And so, you see, if you're looking at the data, the rates would be lower among kids who are not going to kindergarten yet.

317
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,150
But once they get to kindergarten, where they have to meet the requirements to be able to enter school,

318
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:40,890
then you'll see that immunization rates go up a little bit more to support kids being able to go to school.

319
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:49,860
Then there's the and that is T and then we can get adult vaccine uptake from the virus, which we covered earlier in the semester.

320
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,730
And then the next flu, influenza vaccines for children six months to 17 years.

321
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:04,260
So there are different sources that these that are producing information for the National Immunization Registry.

322
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:11,370
And this is possible and allows us to have a full sense of the different subgroups in the population.

323
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:17,250
How will that be immunized against immunized influenza?

324
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:30,580
And then for reporting vaccine adverse events, there's the vaccine adverse event reporting system bias.

325
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,770
This is a collaboration with CDC and the FDA.

326
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:44,020
And so anybody can report an adverse event associated with a particular vaccine.

327
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:53,100
The system is not necessarily verified. So if somebody has information that they want to submit,

328
00:40:53,100 --> 00:41:00,660
they can go to the site and then submit that information and they the information becomes part of the database.

329
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,940
And that's why it's not verified.

330
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:13,380
But if somebody is trying to file a claim, then that's going to go to a process that's going to be checked and evaluated carefully.

331
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,440
Well, if it's just somebody reporting information about this is what happened to me or this is what happened to my child,

332
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,310
this information can be submitted without any verification.

333
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,540
It becomes part of the data that.

334
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:37,670
Most of the reports associated with this network comes from manufacturers, and only a small percent come from individuals, about 7%.

335
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,610
The bulk of this come from manufacturers and in health care facilities.

336
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,000
So this is what the forms, the form looks like.

337
00:41:50,080 --> 00:42:02,500
You can either report the information online or you can print the form and then send this to the entry into the system.

338
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:16,890
So the influenza surveillance, we have two key ones, the U.S. Flu V network.

339
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:32,970
This is a sentinel surveillance system, meaning these are select centers that have been identified to collect information on flu that's circulating.

340
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:41,819
You might wonder sometimes they'll say the existing flu vaccine is not so effective or the

341
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:49,950
existing flu vaccine doesn't have the circulating flu strain for this particular season.

342
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,620
This is how we are able to get this information.

343
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,119
When you go to your doctor's office, they're able to take the samples and tell you whether you have the flu,

344
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:05,880
but they don't have the information to tell you what strain is in similar to what is in the circulating vaccine or not.

345
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:13,860
These sites are the sites that collect information to give us information about how effective the circulating

346
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,930
or assisting flu vaccine for that given period is compared to what's circulating in the community.

347
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:34,710
So you have them with the PPIs being Dr. Monto, who is a world renowned specialist on respiratory diseases.

348
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,479
And Dr. Martin, the two pieces for Michigan.

349
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,530
So we're happy to have them here with us.

350
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,290
And then the other one is for so the first one is for flu sickness.

351
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,250
The second one is hospitalization associated with influenza.

352
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:02,340
And so they have this test negative design where in individuals who present with acute

353
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,580
respiratory illness and cough would be selected as almost like a case control design.

354
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,300
And those individuals would be tested if they test negative, then they are considered the controls.

355
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,710
And those who test positive, they are willing to participate in the study.

356
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,259
Those individuals would be the cases and then it will follow those individuals who are not followed

357
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:34,200
but collect information to see whether they took the the vaccine and how hospitalization rates are,

358
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,620
I think, among those individuals in the study.

359
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:49,800
For this, we have a slightly different map. So for the flu vaccine effect effectiveness network, you had people the map is slightly different.

360
00:44:51,450 --> 00:45:02,310
And now for the hospitalized influenza vaccine effectiveness, the map includes some investigator from Texas.

361
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:08,520
But for Michigan, the site continues also for the paving study.

362
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:18,660
So Michigan is playing a major role even when we have data out about what's the circulating strains versus what's in the vaccine for that year.

363
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,810
Any question about flu vaccine network? Okay.

364
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:35,670
So, yes. So damn quick question.

365
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,870
So sometimes you'll see here we have families come and participate in the study.

366
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:51,720
So I don't know if you've noticed, I think is in that building the flu clinic where the participants come to give samples,

367
00:45:52,250 --> 00:46:05,410
do they give samples and then they'll collect samples for people in then. Then there's Corvette, which is new as recent as 2020,

368
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:14,050
but you can get data on how COVID is spreading or the number of cases and also deaths associated with COVID 19.

369
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,430
This information is readily available on the CDC website.

370
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:27,760
I know in Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health has a website where we're reporting COVID cases on a daily basis,

371
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,210
and then they changed it to a weekly basis,

372
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:39,700
having checked recently to see how it's changed, what it's going back to daily or continues to be weekly or maybe monthly.

373
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:46,690
But you can also get information from the CDC, COVID tracker, where you can look at COVID cases,

374
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,010
new cases, deaths that you can compare by state or you can look at the U.S. versus are giving state.

375
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,280
So this is information that I copied from the CDC site yesterday.

376
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:13,600
So this is what covered new cases in the last seven days look like across the U.S. for Michigan, we are in the category,

377
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:22,720
not the highest category of cases, but almost the category are almost at the highest four new cases.

378
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:29,030
So we have between 5.7 thousand to 10.7.

379
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:42,100
Thousand cases in Michigan. Now look at the reported deaths.

380
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:48,700
Michigan had this blue, the darker blue, but not the darkest blue.

381
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,640
Well, four deaths. Keeping Michigan as the focus.

382
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:02,980
You see, Michigan has jumped from the category just before the highest category to the highest category four deaths.

383
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:11,050
So it can be interesting to see how certain locations are doing in terms of new cases.

384
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,580
But then we also need to think about the diverting associate that we are giving infectious disease.

385
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,489
What is it matching the number of new cases,

386
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:28,150
or is it entirely different for deaths associated with a giving infectious disease, in this case COVID 19?

387
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,870
Any question about the college tracker. The link is right there.

388
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,630
If you can just click on it if you're curious to see what's happening.

389
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:44,320
There are so many other metrics that you can use to understand what's happening regarding COVID,

390
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,860
and you can look at this across the U.S. or you can look at information by state.

391
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,030
So the other in the final data set I'm going to tell you about for those who are interested in air pollution.

392
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:13,340
I presented a study that we did about preterm birth in Ann Arbor and Detroit using data from the Environmental Protection Agency.

393
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:21,829
So if you are interested in air pollution data, there's the EPA website where they collect data on a regular basis,

394
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,510
and you can look at the data by different locations.

395
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,240
You can enter the zip code and you can get information for giving location.

396
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:39,319
They are collecting data on gases and particulate matter air pollutants, and those information are readily available for you to use.

397
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:45,260
You can download it. These are not individual level data per seat.

398
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,090
You're collecting data on a daily basis, but it's not attached to any individual.

399
00:49:50,510 --> 00:50:01,180
It's sometimes how you use this data set will be to link the data set for a given location to individuals in that location.

400
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:07,960
So you'll be focusing this more in terms of time versus matching it to an individual

401
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:12,770
because it's data collected for a given region related to air pollution.

402
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:28,580
Any question about air pollution or air quality data? And so with this being our last class, we had an opportunity to cover the U.S. Census.

403
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,300
We talked about how we are collecting data every ten years.

404
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:40,450
There are limitations associated with that because we're missing what's happening in between one data collection per year compared to the next.

405
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,470
But these data can be very useful for collecting epidemiologic measures while calculating those measures.

406
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:57,320
We can use this dataset for standardization, which we will then compare a standard population.

407
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,690
If we're looking at two locations that we're looking at Michigan and Maryland.

408
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:10,570
We want to use the U.S. as our standard population to compare and make the age groups similar between the two states.

409
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:16,210
We talked about the American Community Survey as a subset of the U.S. Census.

410
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,250
This is conducted on a yearly basis where a subset of the population,

411
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,880
around 3.5 million these individuals are surveyed, but it's different groups that are surveyed over time.

412
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:37,270
And this allows us to have comprehensive data on the population, income, housing, education and housing characteristics.

413
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:43,150
And we saw that when we did the exercise, how would we get one to certain data types from the census?

414
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,530
But we'll get more detailed information from the American Community Survey.

415
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,860
We talked about birthrates and energy, how they are both cross-sectional studies.

416
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,400
One is collected at the state level. Also birth is.

417
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:07,420
And then NHANES is more where of the sample is selected to be representative of the entire U.S. rather than a specific state.

418
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:14,829
We have NHANES where the data are collected by in-person interviews and physical exam.

419
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:22,990
Saw some major benefits with that, and you may see that once you select NHANES for your final project,

420
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:29,200
it becomes a little bit difficult to find, as is the alternative data set.

421
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:35,650
But I'm sure you guys are creative. Will come up with data sets to beat in Haines.

422
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,550
People eat in. These are compensated.

423
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:50,380
Whereas before us you have individuals who are not compensated and all of the data are collected by telephone interviews and self-reported data.

424
00:52:51,370 --> 00:53:00,280
The DHS program, we talked about places in the world where we don't have a system in place to collect data on an ongoing basis.

425
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:09,579
And so we have this DISH as program that's operated by an agency in the U.S. and they go to these different

426
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:18,690
locations and work with the teams there to collect information that might be comparable across certain regions.

427
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:27,220
And so we are able to have some information about births, deaths and then the status of health regarding women and children.

428
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:40,540
We talk about Medicare where we can use as this thing in a resource for cancer incidence and cancer survivor data and combine that

429
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:48,190
with an existing data set the Medicare program where in you have individuals 65 and older and individuals who have disability.

430
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:54,280
And to be able to use that to understand cancer is it is in a subgroup in the population.

431
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:04,380
So with that, I'll stop for a quick minute to see if anybody has any question about any of these data sets, what we cover today.

432
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:14,520
And if not, you are then able to work on your final group project or if your group has done is okay, you can.

433
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,299
And for those who will leave before,

434
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:33,810
I wish you the best with exams and finals and have a wonderful holiday break and then be ready to come back in the winter term to finish your degree.

435
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:54,750
So. I know.

436
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:05,960
You got to get. I got the recording.
