00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,850
Hi, and welcome to
Public Health 510,

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,620
Communication Fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,350
Topic for this course is
that we're going to look at

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,760
the basic skills that apply to

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,605
all kinds of communications.

6
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,330
Now I want to be clear.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,740
This course is not an intro

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,300
to health communication course.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
We're not going to
touch upon how to plan

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,445
broad health communications
interventions or strategies,

11
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:28,635
nor recovering health
behavior theories,

12
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:31,575
or specific message effects,
or things like that.

13
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,620
We are however, going to
be talking about skills,

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,170
skills related to all kinds of

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,260
situations that you might face
in your professional life.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,360
Now really, when you want
to design communications,

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,490
and we're going to go through
this in much more detail,

18
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,475
but there's really
four fundamental concepts.

19
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,845
Concept 1, you have to
think about your audience.

20
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:53,420
You have to know
who you're talking

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,580
to and why you're
talking to them,

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,710
and their characteristics
in order to be

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,530
able to be effective
as a communicator.

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,070
Second, you have to know
what you want to achieve,

25
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,735
what are your goals?

26
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,410
I don't mean goals in
the big broad sense of

27
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,105
your whole project or
broad intervention,

28
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,090
I mean your goals right now.

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,915
What do you want them
to think or feel or do

30
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:20,090
right after hearing or

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,015
listening or watching
your communication?

32
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:25,940
Put the audience and
the goals together,

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,380
and t hen you can
start to figure out,

34
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,925
what is your core message?

35
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:30,770
We're going to spend a lot
of time thinking about,

36
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,190
how do you find what
your core message is,

37
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,470
and shape it so that it
achieves your goals.

38
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,640
Lastly, we're going to talk
about the bigger picture.

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,220
You can't just throw
facts to people,

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,840
you have to craft
which you're going to

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,495
communicate into a story,
into a narrative.

42
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,730
There is a narrative of science.

43
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,710
There's a narrative
of this course.

44
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,110
We're going to talk
about how you do that,

45
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,180
how you think about
the macro structure

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,380
of your communication,

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,490
so that it all makes sense
and connects to each other.

48
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,540
We're also going to talk
about a few other key issues.

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,910
One, plain language.

50
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,360
Especially, academics
and scientists,

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,980
we love our jargon.

52
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,050
We love to show that we know

53
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,090
all these big words that are

54
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,340
special to our particular area.

55
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,425
But if you're trying to
communicate broadly,

56
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:19,850
you have to think about using

57
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,475
plain clear language
because otherwise,

58
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,310
you lose people just
because of the words you

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,900
used rather than about

60
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,945
the points you're
trying to get across.

61
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,130
We're also going to
talk about some of

62
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,080
the things that you
can do when you're

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
talking with people to

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
become somebody who
people want to listen to.

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,930
It's not just about the content,

66
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,520
you have to be somebody

67
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
that your audience
wants to listen

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,090
to because then they'll engage

69
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,790
with you and they'll want to
hear what you have to say.

70
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,950
We're also going to
spend a lot of time

71
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,690
talking about potential barriers,

72
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,430
because there are many ways

73
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,740
that communications can go wrong,

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,030
and the best way that I

75
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,340
know of to prevent
those problems is to

76
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,650
just be aware of what
can happen and to be

77
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,845
intentional about the way you
design your communications.

78
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,810
That means having strategies,

79
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,360
having clear processes that

80
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,045
you use each time you're
designing a communication.

81
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,955
No matter what it is, whether
it's a lecture like this,

82
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,415
whether it's a huge presentation,

83
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:18,890
whether it's just
writing out a paper.

84
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,990
Lastly, we're going to spend

85
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,420
at least a little bit
of time thinking about

86
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,680
a very specific kind of

87
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,845
communications,
communications about crises.

88
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:32,374
Situations where you have
to communicate right now,

89
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:36,625
and that crisis situation
you can't prepare for it.

90
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,440
Except you can,
you can prepare to

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,140
know what the key principles
are that you have

92
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,660
to follow in those kind of

93
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,885
crisis situations in
order to be effective.

94
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,480
Now the structure of this course

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,820
is guided by its need to address

96
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,055
some foundational competencies of

97
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,500
all masters of
public health programs.

98
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,660
Several of these
foundational competencies

99
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,445
deal with communications issues.

100
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:02,810
Specifically, there's

101
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,820
a foundational
competency related to

102
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,640
communicating audience
appropriate public health content

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,935
through written and
oral presentation.

104
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:13,040
As you can see, we're already
talking about audience as

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,540
the first step that
you have to think

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,795
about when designing
a communication.

107
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,654
Second competency,

108
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,780
selecting communication
strategies for

109
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,370
different audiences in sectors.

110
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,670
You don't do a communication
the same way for everybody.

111
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,275
You might write it for one group.

112
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,420
You might put it on
a video for another.

113
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,955
You might make it a
oral thing for another.

114
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,430
Lastly, we're going to
spend some time talking

115
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,055
about the importance
of cultural competence

116
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,380
into communicating
public health content

117
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,840
because you have to be aware and

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,225
respectful of cultural variations

119
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,370
in designing an
effective communication.

120
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,205
Now, we all need to continue
to refine the skills.

121
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,185
This is not a onetime thing you

122
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,495
check the box and
boom you're done.

123
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,915
I work on these topics
myself every day.

124
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,030
Every time I write a grant,

125
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,905
I have to pause
and think through,

126
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,055
who's my audience?
What are my goals?

127
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,450
What's my message? Every time

128
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,405
I write an article
for the public.

129
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,825
Every time I give a presentation.

130
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:16,640
So working on these skills
is what you need to do in

131
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,574
order to become
a better communicator

132
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,810
in all different kinds
of situations.

133
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,525
So remember,
key questions to ask,

134
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,015
who is my audience?

135
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,625
Who am I trying to reach?

136
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,455
What is the most appropriate
kind of content for them?

137
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,180
Not everything is going to be

138
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,415
appropriate for every audience.

139
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,800
What's the best way
to get it to them?

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,245
There are different
communication modalities.

141
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:40,880
We have to pick which one

142
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,740
we're going to use intentionally.

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,080
How can I be respectful of them?

144
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,960
Not just in terms of not
stereotyping people,

145
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,045
although that's
a big and important question,

146
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,370
but how can I be
respectful of their time,

147
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,060
of their attention,
and how can I do that

148
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,070
by perhaps making the content as

149
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,605
relatable and relevant
to them as possible?

150
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,480
When you make your content

151
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,850
relatable and relevant
to your audience,

152
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,280
people want to listen to you,

153
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,170
and hence they're going
to process it and use it.

154
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,100
So the more that I remain
aware of these fundamentals,

155
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,185
the more effective I am.

156
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,900
As a science communicator
in my professional life,

157
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,115
as an instructor when I'm
teaching you or other students,

158
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,380
and as a professional
colleague working

159
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,600
together in the teams
that I work with,

160
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,823
they are really that important.
