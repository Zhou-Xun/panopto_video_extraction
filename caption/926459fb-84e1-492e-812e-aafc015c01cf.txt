offer an organization for certain period of time and income statement

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is also called a statement of operations. I'm like the balance

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
sheet which is a snap shot off some organizations financial condition at

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
an organization over a period of time such as one year.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the income statement first prevents the revenues earned by an organization.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000

at the bottom of the income statement list the net income earned by an organization

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
