1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,860
rain and all I'll take out all this other stuff. so it's recording

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,940
and then I'm process back into this mode and you start at five oh. we didn't

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,680
test it with us. so you can count. don't forget himself.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,000
for that is

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,040
been used to complete strangers just not work

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,040
well. okay. so you can you know that's the one we

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,360
have. okay I got that idea that we usually have the like

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,580
yeah I don't set it says something like that.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,860
if you could do that.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,720
so we one of know those on those of. okay.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,840
pushed up in the corner. um you got some water for her you're good.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,880
yes mhm leave over the recommended I don't have lunch. okay.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,040
okay. they could add terrible

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,580
ones are open

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:36,800
but

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,380
I don't know why.

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,420
yeah you know they have these

18
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:57,600
surveys. yeah every morning that's really because I don't have rearranged

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:10,113
not I

20
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:15,553
think it was a drought these Texas. so

21
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:24,193
we we moved well I guess

22
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:29,493
there's what it is I have like

23
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:40,113
I thought

24
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:49,413
right now do maybe

25
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:54,433
maybe like fifteen thirty. yes

26
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:59,857
twenty minutes. okay

27
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:10,357
and you know like see how they have to run not my

28
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:18,637
I

29
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:24,057
mean I really really have

30
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:38,337
something ready yeah yeah I

31
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:44,297
mean

32
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:52,857
not

33
00:03:52,857 --> 00:04:12,243
you

34
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:18,363
yeah I used to be in Michigan everything

35
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:24,283
in our on the our

36
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:31,303
children and daughters like twenty minutes really really

37
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:37,343
really really nice evening they've been talking about I know.

38
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:42,823
yeah definitely Sunday

39
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:48,023
you usually come over to you know my watching that's when my my boys

40
00:04:48,023 --> 00:05:00,541
and we'd like

41
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:06,221
so the big debate of live in the stars now know you even if you before mentally towards

42
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:11,361
sister later. when using Perl dice on time and people

43
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:16,401
come in late right away. yeah I just start just okay.

44
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:21,581
I mean why don't I don't care you. alright. alright. it is my pleasure

45
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:29,021
to introduce our speakers today Doctor for the McCain Holiday Inn who joins us from University of Southern California

46
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:34,121
and Roberta and I go back to a very long way else I don't even have like a piece of paper for

47
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:39,561
the Internet options today. I was free dog when

48
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:45,021
Roberto was a postdoc so we started working together in nineteen ninety eight which

49
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:50,341
seeing as how we're both twenty two. this the is same

50
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:57,461
as everybody started out originally when she was.

51
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:03,805
working on the childhood cancer and then she moved into breast cancer

52
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:09,025
then she took a turn and started working on I disease

53
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:14,365
which is what she'll talk to us about today. but I also

54
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:20,045
how many of you in here to hook up at six oh one with home bargain store.

55
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:26,545
anybody left in that era whilst Roberta Chuck.

56
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:32,805
line up at six oh one with Tom. I did see.

57
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:38,207
she's able to tell all kinds of stories many of our citizens could relate to

58
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:43,347
as well so please join me in welcoming referred

59
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:48,487
to.

60
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:54,727
okay well I'm glad to be here with you today. um I am from Michigan the drunken can count you.

61
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:59,987
University of Michigan as an undergrad in biology neither of my sons

62
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:05,487
ended up here one of my sons just graduated at USC. um

63
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:10,687
where the degree in engineering and the other one's a freshman. we did to here and that was high

64
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:15,747
on the list but maybe the free tuition at USC was a

65
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:21,327
little influential but um so I'm gonna share today.

66
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:26,667
a little bit about the cohorts. my experience on course I've done a lot of cohort

67
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:31,727
research I worked with a back at USC in Los Angeles

68
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:36,807
originally on the multiethnic cohort which was focused on looking at cancer profit

69
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:41,952
from colorectal so I gained a lot of experiences on the issues in terms of how

70
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:46,992
do you collect coke or data how do you do follow up how do you write questionnaires all that kind

71
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:52,092
of thing and that's actually how I got moved from cancer job to mileage I still do cancer but a lot of my work

72
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:57,492
with mileage because I got asked by smalls you group I'm not an

73
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:02,552
ophthalmologist but I got asked to work with John because they wanted to initiate

74
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:07,612
these large covert studies and didn't know how to do that and so that's how I got brought into

75
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:12,612
that not because I knew anything about optimality when I started. but because I was

76
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:17,892
director and designer of how we collected I think. so we've done a lot of

77
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:23,392
different types of questions and hypotheses driven research

78
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:28,452
in these cohorts I have three adult cohorts and the talk that through them. we

79
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:33,472
have a childhood toe Court. um about two miles you mean free recruited twelve thousand kids

80
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:38,476
from Los Angeles um some talk about those things here today

81
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:43,796
I'm gonna talk about quality of life because I think working with a couple of my doctoral students

82
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:48,956
on these questions recently and so that's kind of what been we've thinking about but we've also done

83
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:54,016
characterization of how frequent the diseases are. how

84
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:59,876
how they progress we work at clinical and ocular measures. we look at genetics

85
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:06,616
and we look at a variety of lifestyle factors as well. but today I just gonna talk about um

86
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:13,696
issues of quality life and health care utilization.

87
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:18,696
so a little bit about visual impairment in time here. um

88
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:24,096
that a year ago we actually know you had have us twenty sixteen. we looked

89
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:29,556
at the expected trends in visual impairment blindness in the United States and

90
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:34,776
when we look that number is updated by raising twenty fifteen. we estimated

91
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:40,462
that there's about three million people who are visually impaired in

92
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:45,502
the United States but we project by twenty fifty. that there's going to be more than

93
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:50,742
doubled probably close to seven million and this is largely not because of changes

94
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:56,022
and risk factors but just due the fact that we have an aging population and so it's gonna become you know much

95
00:09:56,022 --> 00:10:01,342
more um um prevalent condition

96
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:06,422
and and what is currently in the US we have about a million people would be classified as

97
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:11,442
flying but their visual acuity score. and would expect us to double as well. when

98
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:16,502
we did estimates for different major racial racial ethnic groups in the United States very broad

99
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:21,942
routine. um the cruise that has the second highest level for the official visual term in line

100
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:26,962
behind times. wife is estimated to be African-American that we expect by

101
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:32,022
twenty fifty. with the increase our seal population. they

102
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:37,034
will have the second highest rated visual impairment and um. on color

103
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:42,694
blindness will stay largely would think.

104
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:48,334
so unkind as a rationale for why we were looking at questions of quality of and life

105
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:54,014
health care utilization our cohorts is that we know that through the vision screenings

106
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:59,074
for refractive error. um that and I disease that we can

107
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:04,854
reduce these numbers of people who are likely to be impaired or um how flying this

108
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:09,874
and in fact when you look at people who are visually impaired based on data from our studies or

109
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:14,894
population based studies. we see that up to seventy percent of people who are classified as visually

110
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:20,514
impaired. would not be so if they had proper refraction classes or contact.

111
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:26,354
and so there's a lot of people walking around driving. who are visually impaired you don't need to be

112
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:31,714
um and we want to understand um what is the contribution

113
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:36,894
of um the different racial ethnic groups in our country we had a lot of date

114
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:42,134
about half Hispanic whites but when we started doing these cupboards there was a very minimal data what

115
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:48,494
were the numbers of these different conditions and the patterns from um people who are not

116
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:54,134
and win claim to understand um what are the needs for education screening and intervention

117
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:59,214
into different subgroups in our population. so we can maximize efforts to minimize

118
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:04,434
um disability

119
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:09,554
and just an idea of the cost United States. the annual cost um.

120
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:14,774
really I just sort vision loss. it looks um projected around a hundred and thirty

121
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:20,194
nine billion and which is about four hundred and fifty dollars per person

122
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:26,538
a nice day. um

123
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:31,538
um and when we started doing this work and they said there was other than

124
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:37,238
and Hanes there was limited information on the frequency of the different major causes. I

125
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:42,258
vision impairment blindness United States which are open all angles in Tacoma. either

126
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:48,278
and proceed. age related macular degeneration. um and

127
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,538
if you look at um what we do know about individuals or Latina

128
00:12:53,538 --> 00:13:00,038
and my studies with you know main people who are largely Mexican ancestry

129
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:05,118
and African-Americans they has greater problems in opening comments and diabetic

130
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:10,398
rest not for season non- Hispanic whites. you can see here quite substantially higher at

131
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:15,458
each age groups. um a non- Hispanic whites have higher rates of

132
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:21,108
age related macular degeneration what's really interesting what we found by looking at Latinos

133
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:26,228
and our cohorts is not only do whites have much more. age related

134
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:31,668
macular degeneration but all of the Hispanics that get it they don't progress

135
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:36,788
so they stay mild and vision loss implying this comes from the advancement of that disease

136
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:42,888
and so weights for grass and Hispanic steps or beginning to try to understand

137
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:50,788
why non- Hispanic whites progress and let you know so.

138
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:56,688
okay. so um we have three large adult cohorts in LA

139
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:01,728
and we did collections. um. differently than

140
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:06,968
what I've done other multi ethnic sorts we did some in overtime and I'm sure you'll see some enough but we did

141
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:12,288
those targeting certain groups and we couldn't do this on ten years ago in LA because

142
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:17,683
they still tended to live um in high concentration in certain

143
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:23,083
neighborhoods and so we originally targeted um.

144
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:28,223
love like that for him. wells Los Angeles

145
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:33,363
which and I studied. we targeted Monterey Park for Chinese American I study

146
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:38,743
in Inglewood. um for African-Americans. so

147
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:44,183
um for both wells and chess. the majority of households you would go to.

148
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:49,323
would be individuals and those racial ethnic groups and so this is important

149
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:54,463
because there's design was we would pick certain census tracks. we would identify every residential

150
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,963
address in that neighborhood and we would send our survey teens and knock on every single door

151
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:05,223
and we would survey every residence in those tracks. so

152
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:10,803
we would go repeated until we spoke to everybody and rolled them out is eligible or is ineligible eligible.

153
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:16,103
so it's very labor intensive recruitment and so it truly truly was population

154
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:21,317
base and in all of our studies are response rates for eligible 's was about eighty

155
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:26,677
percent and that was intensive effort so we had team meetings twice a week

156
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:31,777
focusing on the treatment. so um and then but

157
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:37,097
by the time we got the Inglewood. I would say you could see that this design wasn't

158
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:43,017
going to work anymore when we recruited lee and I for the multi ethics report. um

159
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:48,437
this was mainly well it - force impact American or black. um but now it's

160
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:53,577
probably sixty percent which for the percent African-American. so if

161
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:58,697
you're going to Jordan and you're only taking eligibility is one racial or ethnic group it becomes

162
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:03,937
very costly. so I would say that's probably not a reasonable design anymore because

163
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:09,217
people are now very much more integrated across neighborhoods. but that's

164
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:20,443
what we did at the time and it was successful. um what else they want

165
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:25,483
okay and you can see here's the

166
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:30,523
time. line our wealth was our first study that we conducted. we are the first study

167
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:35,643
to do population based research on large group um um Latin Americans

168
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:40,783
which again in LA since March Mexican Americans and we were created individuals

169
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:45,783
in two thousand and three two thousand and three. um and

170
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:51,203
fortune this we started in twenty ten to recruit for some twenty fourteen and

171
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:58,423
then African-American study went from twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen.

172
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:03,483
okay. so what we would do once we identified them. we would invite them to do

173
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:08,563
a home interview and our survey team would do the interview in the

174
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:14,129
person 's home. so you just friendly little conversation you say because I come into your house and give you an energy

175
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:19,149
and so we had very well trained interviewers because I don't know about you but if someone came up to

176
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:24,229
my door and wanted to do a survey I'd be kind of hesitant about that and then I said can I come sit in your living room

177
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:30,329
for an hour leave you. I'd even you know like why no but we were really successful

178
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:35,709
and so we have this home questionnaire which we had on Fridays for demographic factors

179
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:40,989
about their family history of disease. we asked him about or will really is one of health insurance.

180
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:46,149
yeah about how much money they make um and then when they finish that we asked him to

181
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:51,589
come and schedule a three hour comprehensive eye exam in our clinic.

182
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:56,709
I we got eighty percent of the people who agreed to do it. so um that's critical

183
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:01,849
we would do a short survey health for the quality of life we do that before we do the eye exam because

184
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:07,329
we want them to get information before they know if they have an eye condition

185
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:12,369
and we would do a very easy to leave him an individual to individual fields. we

186
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:17,789
would do retinal scan we do the off food coherence demography would look at that sickness

187
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:23,209
of the different layers of the retina and other optic nerve health. we would have possibly

188
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:28,749
measures was very very conference that we take the blood so we could do genetic studies

189
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:34,069
um. so very very detailed. how did they get people to do that. well for each

190
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:39,169
community was different. so far Latino community we um

191
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:44,229
did an huge community outreach before we started going door to door. so we would go to

192
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:49,489
the churches and get toxic coffee hour after we gave we went to every single time a tree

193
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:54,709
ophthalmologist office in the city. we went to the police officer gave a presentation because

194
00:18:54,709 --> 00:19:00,069
when people would start calling that someone that's door we want the police to know who we work.

195
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:05,129
we went to barber shop. we went to beauty parlors. um we went to health fairs

196
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:10,189
in the community we went to the mayor 's office and gave presentations we put up yard signs. we had

197
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:15,665
our logo on the yard sign across the city um in fact during the last study

198
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:21,265
they had the elections local elections and we were the writing candidate for the mayor we got third place.

199
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:26,965
wow yeah everybody knew who we work

200
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:32,405
um. so that's how we got it was intensive oh every week twice a week we met an strategy

201
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:37,905
we'd look who's doing well talk to that interview. what are you doing why do people like you for

202
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:42,985
the Hispanic community was very important to have a Spanish-speaking interviewers

203
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:48,025
of course and they it was high Ashley was high immigration. a first

204
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:53,225
generation immigrant population and so they like to have um Hispanic interviewers.

205
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:58,297
they're responsible for that you know Chinese study completely different

206
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:03,917
we didn't go through the church we went to political system. we talked to the mayor and they had a network.

207
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:09,097
if you got into the political system the e-mail went out and if the local government

208
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:15,217
gave the okay and then they were in and then they flooded it with very high participation

209
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:20,357
African-American completely different. we couldn't do churches because people didn't go to their local church they travel

210
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:27,617
farther. um we essentially was that was a good experience.

211
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:32,717
their neighbor said they had a good experience you should do it. so we had to really it took a while to get

212
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:37,757
that bill talked to get community trust but we tried to make sure every participant

213
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:42,857
had a good experience and he asked them to tell their friends and neighbors and fighting and we

214
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:48,037
were so sorry that you know we ran out of funding at the end because it was really snowballing we had people

215
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:53,057
calling us ask when they could come in. so each community we've

216
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:58,388
really had to figure out what made it work for that group but because we're saying this is population

217
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:03,868
based and we really wanted a representative sample and we were some of the only African-American only Latino

218
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:08,908
and the only Chinese-American data that's feeding into the National Institutes of Health on

219
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:13,988
these conditions the rates of these conditions and the features of those diseases in these

220
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:23,008
populations we want to make sure it was his representative it but

221
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:28,108
and so we had a clinic in each of the centers we had a clinic that we located in the center

222
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:33,108
of that community that we thought was a safe environment that people easy parking that

223
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:38,328
they would be willing to come to. we also have the lovely I found for each study we had a tree

224
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:43,588
shrink wrapped to represent the studies um and so this was

225
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:48,588
what it looks like for the African-American I said he would just pull it off like we had a gated community. we would

226
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:54,298
have a day they put I know in their community. um front

227
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:59,538
hi this is Mina Torres she was the project specialist for all of them she's really someone who makes

228
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:04,698
everything correct she's like the goddess of research

229
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:10,638
and she would go give talks all the community members again and make that work.

230
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:15,758
so we didn't do a lot of eye exams and the van we preferred and they came to the clinic because

231
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:20,858
there was some examinations that you really can only do in the clinic that we could do

232
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:27,238
maybe eighty ninety percent of the items in the fast.

233
00:22:27,238 --> 00:22:32,798
so um for quality of life I'd looked at disease specific influences

234
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,898
on probably of like visual acuity in visual fields. we've done cross sectional so it baseline

235
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:43,178
what are the relationships between pupils and visions as a measure of functional measure visual

236
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:48,478
acuity of functional national fish on their perceived quality of life

237
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:54,330
and how they think their mission is um. so not huh talk to much about the security today

238
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,490
because you ever talked to him. I'm talk more about the visual field because I've been working on

239
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:05,410
that with my student on. so and so with that we had a um

240
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,530
I'm free field analyzer which if you remember from your doctors office if you go in and you

241
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:15,750
look and you have a little clip. and just stare straight ahead and they flashlights and it measures

242
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,390
your ability to set different places tend to see intensities and your central and peripheral

243
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,430
field and so we make the patience to do that a minimum of three times in a

244
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,570
row and some of our patients are eighty five years old and so it's it's challenging to get

245
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,750
them to be able to do that because it's hard to do at one time and focus. um but from that

246
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,010
we get a detailed output on the time their ability to see both Central

247
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,190
proof real fields and the measures that we get from ask on the mediation and it's measured

248
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,570
in decibels and you'll see that coming up and it essentially tells how different

249
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,848
that person station is from the standard normal population of approximately

250
00:23:57,848 --> 00:24:03,368
the same age. and it tells how sensitive they are contacting

251
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:08,848
life in the different areas of the field

252
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:13,908
and so for to be recruited sixty three hundred adults the majority

253
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:19,048
of those scores are born in United States and the Chinese-American study. the majority of the

254
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:24,068
terms of just depends we have forty five hundred. were from mainland china. um and most of

255
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:29,168
them had been born out of the country. 's or first generation and had all

256
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:34,808
the living in the united states most of the multiple decades um and the

257
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:40,328
finer Latino study and they said the majority Mexican ancestry

258
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:45,608
movies are individuals were born in Mexico and then we had several. we're in up next our large proportion

259
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:51,790
we're second generation. and we had

260
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,910
and ah I know um since we recruited sixteen hundred button in else assumes actually like sixty one hundred.

261
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,070
that had complete data for inclusion on and

262
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,210
you can see the age distribution was a little bit older and they said that you need

263
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,230
closer to sixty and shed it was also older because our recruiting age

264
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,330
was fifty and up. it has I don't know why it was assigned that way other than we have left

265
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,330
funding we so are strict in today's age groups where there was more I and then

266
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,710
we only had four years off and so that's when we were younger.

267
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,970
okay. 's and I was gonna talk to him about some of the recent work that job

268
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,970
and I have been doing on the African Americans. I was the study and would call that if

269
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,770
it okay. so um

270
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,990
this is the actual participate in our study and we published our message paper on

271
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,630
that back in twenty eighteen. so if you're interested in how we collected the data details

272
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,960
there and this is Carl Lester who did most

273
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,280
of our examinations and um well our participation

274
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,320
didn't get any direct benefit. they didn't get when they finished they

275
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,660
had images of their retina and I they had all lived their blood glucose measures

276
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,980
at policy measures they had a complete eye examination results both in late and

277
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,980
for their own doctor and we has numerous patients Carl had found

278
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,360
that was a life changing I would say he had one patient where the optic

279
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,932
nerve was nearly detached and he put her in a fabulous and had goes to

280
00:26:36,932 --> 00:26:42,152
emergency services immediately and she had surgery that same afternoon. um

281
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:47,512
we've identified. oh I think twenty percent of our population was diabetic

282
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:53,752
and a large proportion of those did not know that they were diabetic

283
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:59,132
and most of our people didn't know they had diabetic right now the VA D glaucoma.

284
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:04,312
so a lot of the stuff of people that was new information and we just send them off with her information

285
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:09,352
sheet to get solitaire and we would some information if they had a doctor to their

286
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:14,992
preferred doctor and if they couldn't afford care. then we had services set up for people who didn't have insurance

287
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:20,512
but most people did um and I'll show you that. okay.

288
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:25,732
so this first date I want to tell you tell you about we looked at. I dare use and

289
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:30,952
this is a name that got dropped and then our data or external

290
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:36,363
advisory group. we had to go. we just glad and get reviewed once a year and we have to give an update

291
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:41,603
and they asked for the aim to be put in so they gave us the supplement to go back and get that 's data and

292
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:47,383
so what we did was when after of the individuals in the study had their examination

293
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:52,883
twelve to eighteen months later we start contacting them to find out if they got the follow up here. and essentially

294
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:58,143
anyone who came up to twelve eighteen months we followed up on us because they had eye condition

295
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:03,403
that was suspected which he actually knew fairly certainly did but we

296
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:09,223
we just tell them suspected and give information for confirmation from their own doctor. um

297
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:14,323
then they would be referred. but also if they they should have us.

298
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:19,783
I just Daniel screamed within any year so we also followed up on on those people who had no obvious. I movies

299
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:25,343
but should get a natural exams with him so we wanted to see

300
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:30,523
what was the fall of race in our African African-American population because the data

301
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:35,983
was not in the literature um and there was some evidence in publications

302
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:41,227
this is just that he wouldn't get follow up by I care that they were I had intended to but

303
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:46,307
we didn't have the date on what was actual usage of my care

304
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:51,487
and then we wanted to look at not only the basic demographic

305
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:56,567
standards insurance questions on whether what influences whether people cared but

306
00:28:56,567 --> 00:29:02,647
we also wanted to say stuff the on look at the psychosocial predictors of

307
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:08,867
what makes people receive care after they're referred for care. okay.

308
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:14,027
so um this we only did Nathan. we didn't do in wales chess and

309
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:19,767
we ended up recruiting people from thirty census tracks so that means we've reviewed and

310
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:24,867
signed off on every person in that presents whether or not track find whether they were

311
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:30,487
eligible or not the case on the conference uprising and they agreed

312
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:35,627
and did the interviews um and then one here. well actually at the same

313
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:41,291
time in Phoenix clinic we gave them the psychosocial questionnaire which had I think about forty questions

314
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:46,591
and then we um fold up years later to see whether they had received care where they had received

315
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:53,191
care and then we were administered the psychosocial questionnaire to see if there was a change in opinions

316
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:58,271
and then um so we started in April. actually

317
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:06,671
was living in twenty the fifteen because the supplement we didn't get into a year a

318
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,711
year of the initial study on so you know what in case you're not familiar

319
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:17,571
here in the United States in California or southern California. would take thirty census tracts

320
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:22,711
and um. if you haven't been to LA. if you know where

321
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:27,871
Los Angeles international airport is. here's the census track in Inglewood here's the Air Force

322
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:32,891
right by the ocean. so it's right across the freeway from

323
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:37,971
that and so we we called it and that was the

324
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:43,337
most effective we also did mail questionnaires. you know questionnaire was the second return the return

325
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:48,377
envelope he also did a website but we I got almost nobody who use the website because our people

326
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:55,437
were sixty plus I thought that they might but knows.

327
00:30:55,437 --> 00:31:00,497
so we had three thousand eight hundred people as well

328
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:05,597
as the days that I looked at the status and we had about a seventy four

329
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:10,597
percent response rate. we're at side the very end we got that up to about eighty percent

330
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:16,017
but I haven't updated the analysis through that additional data

331
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:21,477
and we started out with forty two items and questions like a social questionnaire was designed

332
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:26,777
with the help of one of our faculty and health behavior and she used existing

333
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:31,857
questionnaires for other diseases others and I am we adopted him to

334
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:36,937
him what we thought would be relevant ideas and we had pile the and then included it in

335
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:42,221
the study and from that those questions informed seven

336
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:47,301
different constructs so these are constructs that we couldn't directly measure that we are trying to get outside

337
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:52,921
measuring other directly measurable items and so he's original

338
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:58,061
um attitude. so emotional and illogical. um thoughts

339
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:03,081
about getting I cared for disease control. do they feel that they can't get him here

340
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:08,641
in Fargo strengths like your transportation insurance. can you forward it.

341
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:14,701
um perceived norm. what do you think that we shouldn't do what people do about the I care

342
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:19,741
things. knowledge and skills you know how to get carried you know how to find the doctors office and

343
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:25,141
the seems what you should do and and sellers have you gotten messages from your doctor

344
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:32,381
or from social media from the general media and that I care support

345
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:37,481
and um after we completed the interview. we only had about

346
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:43,023
twenty of the original question that had variability some of them everyone just

347
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:48,343
thought of course the other thing we thought about is we we asked about the content

348
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:53,443
and you'll see that intent is important when you're predicting whether somebody will

349
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:58,523
get care. but because we just finished a three hour exam with them and had gotten all this

350
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:03,623
information from the eye doctor at the end of that if you ask them do you intend to get care they all say

351
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:08,743
yes. we know very ability for problem probably in a population based. you're

352
00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:13,837
just out at their home they might have said something different but after they've been there with you and invested are

353
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:18,917
gonna say yes. so they did okay. and so the

354
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:24,437
analysis that we did for this um. we did save hundred and else's latent variables

355
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:29,737
where we did structural modeling. so we look at the relationship

356
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:35,377
between which items loaded on to different constructs and how those constructs

357
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:40,517
protected whether people would go get care when they were referred for care or whether

358
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:45,817
they would not and so we were able estimate to was reissued from us

359
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:51,097
and correlations I think my flies is much ratios and then we adjusted for a variety

360
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:56,717
of factors that could also be related to getting cats

361
00:33:56,717 --> 00:34:01,777
and um really quickly the people who didn't get follow care we

362
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:07,037
had um almost fourteen hundred people who reports that they did and uh

363
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:12,115
the proportion that said increased with older age women we're more likely

364
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:17,375
to get care the then followed her. they're also more likely participate to in the study really.

365
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:22,395
consistently sixty percent of for. you um they slightly

366
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:27,455
more had a harder time and um higher education. what

367
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:32,455
was interesting about this population. it was a very highly educated population

368
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:37,594
a large proportion of our population were college-educated they had higher income

369
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:42,755
and ninety percent of our population Inglewood had health insurance.

370
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:47,995
so this was like and when you talk to them like they're coming clinic and would speak to them.

371
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:53,235
sometimes we go out on the go over the interviewers just get the experience and they

372
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:58,695
had very very detailed and informed questions like they understood

373
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:03,975
the risks and benefits of research that very pointed questions and he understood what they wanted

374
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:09,195
from their health care um. okay. so here you can see

375
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:14,262
the number of cases of people by disease conditions so we were for them to go get care

376
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:19,282
and as I said some people had a condition or I disease and some just had for toll because you

377
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:24,462
should get an annual exam so other the people who got paid. we had over a thousand

378
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:29,562
who are going for follow up because they were told they had to live in past the.

379
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:34,602
we had a two hundred thirty. were we told they had either written off of the hundred

380
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:39,722
and seventy three who had glaucoma and a hundred and eleven who is suitable

381
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:44,762
here and probably because they need glasses or it

382
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:50,362
could've been distant cousins however. okay. and then all of those.

383
00:35:50,362 --> 00:35:56,282
we looked at what proportion reported a year later that they had gotten follow up here and

384
00:35:56,282 --> 00:36:02,442
the group that was most likely to get follow care what people like on off switch

385
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:07,442
people 's population are very concerned like when they would speak to you that immediately start talking about

386
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:12,522
glaucoma and so eight percent of the people we send to go. we go get

387
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:17,658
solitaire and I will say that at the end when you got the when you give them

388
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:22,759
the sheet of information about the results. so the doctor sit would with them

389
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:27,858
for quite some time and go through all the results explain it to them and say you need to get this kind

390
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:32,878
of care and this is the timeline that you need to get it. sometimes it's today sometimes within the next two

391
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:38,098
weeks sometimes in the next couple of months but he would tell them when to guess.

392
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:43,198
so if he tells over the results and action and where to get it.

393
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:48,458
okay so I don't like right now sixty three percent of those a diabetic right now because he

394
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:53,499
wouldn't do a follow care and cataract sixty percent and even

395
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:58,938
with visual impairments which could be a simple meeting last few percent reported

396
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:04,039
that they did. okay. so we just did

397
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,039
a really simple model based on the healthier model. looking at pre-

398
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,039
supposing and they really need verbal so we had done this in Wales. um. so we looked

399
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,406
at since just see what the basic demographic and economic variables

400
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:24,626
were significant and those in the multi variable model that were

401
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:29,927
important for ages older age and individuals who had health

402
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:35,306
insurance and vision insurance we're more likely to have gotten followed Karen and not

403
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:40,786
although in this study. it could have been less important because that we provided

404
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:47,187
care for anyone who needed us

405
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:52,546
right. so then we went on to our second psychosocial model and

406
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:57,546
when we originally billed this this was based on the integrated health behavior model which was based

407
00:37:57,546 --> 00:38:02,866
on um um integration of multiple models

408
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:08,766
from the behavior specialist and the main um

409
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:13,826
idea of this model is that the primary protector of whether someone will take a behavior

410
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:18,942
is what they had to and you can just directly asked them if they do you intend to do this

411
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:24,062
and that's usually the most productive but as I said everyone in my study said they intended

412
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:29,502
to because of this. so um that wasn't

413
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:34,583
wasn't useful. there's no. um. so

414
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:40,442
other factors indirectly that includes intentions our attitudes or season or personal agency

415
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:46,162
and they said on I attitude have experiential unit and I don't I don't is the logic you think through

416
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:51,242
um. what is my attitude is what do I know about the benefits or the risks of having

417
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:56,422
to go to the doctors office and get care. we're just very initial is like I feel

418
00:38:56,422 --> 00:39:01,562
fear about identities for feels fear about going. I doctor or

419
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:06,762
I'm worried how I'm lazy

420
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:12,102
so um. okay. so I'll skip ahead and so we where

421
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:17,143
malls on the twenty questions or items and what we saw was that

422
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:22,282
both in um an agnostic and in a confirmatory

423
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:27,442
factor in houses we found and I did little times the expected constructs as we've labeled in here

424
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:32,482
and that the correlation between was them low which we wanted him because

425
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:38,843
we want you to use to have him separate input into the protection.

426
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:43,863
um and so also one that we had um. I do

427
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:49,262
quit very really see here and the ones that were influential in

428
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:55,032
predicting Philip Karen was experiential attitude environmental constraints um.

429
00:39:55,032 --> 00:40:02,232
so if you have the more you were less likely deals with marginal and the seller.

430
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:07,532
so this just shows that here visually and so again. attitude experiential

431
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:13,673
was. are you worried about the effects of eye disease. are you. you have any fear about

432
00:40:13,673 --> 00:40:19,052
getting the services. so how those way um. selling is listed your doctor

433
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:24,113
tell you that it's important to go to care and environmental

434
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:29,133
concerns and you know the with insurance and transportation and

435
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:35,213
that um and so what we found from this analysis that

436
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:40,292
I'm a high proportion of African-American else did receive follow up. I care which may seem kinda simple

437
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:45,532
but that date is just not out there. um and that I have follow up.

438
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:50,593
um it's highest for the more severe diseases glaucoma and glaucoma is the disease

439
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:56,416
that this population was most worried about when you talked um

440
00:40:56,416 --> 00:41:02,795
and it was lowest for visual impairments without association with a specific disease

441
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:08,736
um and so we talk about why we think a high proportion with follow up here and

442
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:14,375
the first of all I think is because we had a very detailed description of what

443
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:19,535
a doctor and you personally went through the results with him. he plays what care they need is they swear

444
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:24,716
to go and went to get it and provided him

445
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:29,795
a person to go to. if they didn't you have somebody um I had a

446
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:35,456
doctor challenge me on that and said well of course if you do all of the service and you drive in there.

447
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:40,656
um they're gonna get solitaire. but why we didn't actually drive people to

448
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:45,736
our initial study. if they needed transportation like the eighty five euros. we

449
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:50,855
did provide transportation or thing but for the follow up that was up to that and so essentially this

450
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:55,878
doesn't be what it could be in a standard clinical I'm quite exempt because

451
00:41:55,878 --> 00:42:01,218
your doctor gives you your results get your recommendation and then it's up to you

452
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:06,338
to go back at it and that's exactly what happened this um and so

453
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:11,558
the big protectors were selling us with the doctor listens Hughes that's important. what

454
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:21,638
is the level of concern if they already have worry about it and then inform constraints

455
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:28,218
on that just go to

456
00:42:28,218 --> 00:42:33,258
him quickly quality of life. so unless the quality of life

457
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:38,298
deals with how you feel and proceed so the patient reported outcome how you

458
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:44,118
perceive your health to be and your well-being and your ability to do tasks

459
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:49,258
and within if months our city we suppose. sometimes so in a specific quality of life and we

460
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:54,358
used an instrument that was specifically designed to look at tasks and emotional well being

461
00:42:54,358 --> 00:43:00,078
related to your vision and some the of talked briefly about

462
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:05,318
daily tasks and emotional social well-being of

463
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,358
an estimate we used is called the national eye institute vision function questionnaire as

464
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:16,138
a twenty five questions. os which one is general and

465
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:21,298
um he's twenty five. I don't am had been used to come up with eleven different

466
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:27,157
gales measure different aspects of quality of life. um and so

467
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:32,157
they're very short questions with similar responses and so for example one

468
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:37,278
is how much you do worry about your eyesight and then the person can say something bother

469
00:43:37,278 --> 00:43:42,538
me at all. two dollars now.

470
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:47,677
um next slide the study side and hang him

471
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:52,778
group and they said they use any idea if you and they would

472
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:59,375
say if it was greater than two call the that having fun.

473
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:04,716
and pass on the way. so they can like this and this just shows that and then Haines

474
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:09,956
they found that people who had severe visual field loss for many of the different items

475
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:17,535
of questions and instruments which were much more likely to report difficult

476
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,756
and so traditionally we've done many different studies both on disease specific visual acuity visual

477
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:27,795
fields and all of our cohorts those cross sectional and longitudinal he and

478
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:32,835
we um under the direction of a um run Hayes who

479
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:38,115
was the original at least one of the lead developers of the any idea too. we

480
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:43,375
use the scoring method and then else's message that she supports and validated which is called possible

481
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:48,656
to have carry um and so essentially you preschool or from zero

482
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:53,815
to one hundred for the one hundred works would represent perfect quality of life in the road be the worst quality

483
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:58,815
of life and for each question I don't know if you simply average of the points and get an average

484
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:04,295
score from pockets less. so if you have a baby that represents pretty good quality of life on average.

485
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:09,375
and if you had a twenty that would represent very low quality of life. so classical test is

486
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:15,715
basically a very simple averaging up the scores either overall for the composite

487
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:20,835
or for one of the eleven some skills we have two or three questions and form were average and

488
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:25,995
she does sub scales pay so that's been the traditional approach and

489
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:31,455
African-Americans where this is actually African Barbados I studied African-American.

490
00:45:31,455 --> 00:45:37,396
um. so was I limited data but they just look at the end I guess you am

491
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:42,416
in the far of the population and they did look at visual field luck but they looked at people who had

492
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:47,495
been diagnosed with glaucoma and they found a significant difference in the overall composite score

493
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:52,640
but you can see the actual difference in the small so it's probably not clinically significant

494
00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:00,440
the ones that we're we're for driving and for peripheral vision

495
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,640
and then um this is data from my students to see how you you know she's that and not

496
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,900
fact him and she published on longitudinal changes and visual field

497
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,360
loss and our Latino population. I look at how it impacts the quality of life

498
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,540
and she found that its vision improved over time that for every about three

499
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,740
decibels other improvements in visual field that um

500
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,778
that was associated with about a clinically significant improvement in what people seed quality of

501
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:36,798
life and for the guy swears it was

502
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:41,958
a little bit larger difference that was required about a five decibel change and we said

503
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:47,078
that this is because when your vision of and usually from treatment and so treatment you go when you got

504
00:46:47,078 --> 00:46:52,158
surgery. or you got some have treatment and if you got a very acute change in your vision and so people

505
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:57,598
noticed that and so we see that in the reporting that there probably of like that section.

506
00:46:57,598 --> 00:47:02,677
but when people lose vision often it's kind of slow progressive. maybe not always but Boston

507
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:09,198
and so they attacked and whatnot not in little bit less extreme one

508
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:14,258
and then what she shows here is that that particular ratio overall can very depending on

509
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:19,438
what else you have going on. so if it baseline you or you had visual field and then you add onto that

510
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:24,458
more severe visual field loss. you complain more. if you had normal vision I just get a little

511
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:29,558
bit of fish and watch you complain same with visual acuity if your central vision is

512
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:35,551
fine. if you complain less when you lose your peripheral you only had some and now you're both you can play more.

513
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:40,551
okay. um so one of the problems now is the

514
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:46,190
field is moving away from fossil taxes because there's a lot of assumptions and um

515
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:51,410
while um

516
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,470
I'm gonna get cover goes to the side at the field has moved away from the inside spot

517
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:01,670
stare and I don't sponsor. we're estimating the probability of

518
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,690
selecting the different levels of responses to each question given that you

519
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:12,690
have visual field locking a certain severity. so we can translate these probabilities

520
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:18,811
in to translate them into one to underscore them like we did for class.

521
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:24,390
but it addresses a lot of the assumptions that are not met in class will pass

522
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,410
and essentially what we're trying to do is we considered the first fish ability so that

523
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,723
you can function. we waste that was didn't I difficulty and then the right people along the

524
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:40,243
spectrum of you know so for example um for people who

525
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:45,743
have the top half. good vision. maybe I did send agent an but it's distinguishing

526
00:48:45,743 --> 00:48:50,763
quality of life elements between people with very good vision like a normal population where

527
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:56,023
maybe these are very low vision uh individuals and

528
00:48:56,023 --> 00:49:01,062
these two questions are good at distinguishing qualities like differences between that level of and

529
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:06,243
then after that she brings people along the spectrum based on

530
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:11,603
their vision ability and the difficulty of that item in terms of separating the mouse and then we translate

531
00:49:11,603 --> 00:49:16,883
those back in six quarters like we did for classical.

532
00:49:16,883 --> 00:49:23,023
um the only strong assumption is I didn't response. for the room. you know dimensionality

533
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:28,174
and when we look at the characteristics. um um

534
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:33,234
of the of the models for single composite versus multiple we found

535
00:49:33,234 --> 00:49:38,514
that in fact there seems to be two different constructs not you know dimensionality but um that

536
00:49:38,514 --> 00:49:43,914
these questions tend to inform this construct which is about their emotional social well-being and

537
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:49,034
the other um I don't inform their ability to do and so we've moved

538
00:49:49,034 --> 00:49:54,214
away from doing a single composite into these two different constructs and

539
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:59,854
they still present some of the single composite because we had so much publications just to have

540
00:49:59,854 --> 00:50:06,554
a comparison across and then this is just explain the model and the script that

541
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:11,655
um this is my student Thomas diagram a visual field lab. this is very

542
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:17,375
this is our symbols for him. are even study and so this is large. I

543
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:22,774
was screaming to go. so that's a normal life. okay. and um

544
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:28,551
smaller I we yellow or red meat there's

545
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:33,551
and so the first thing he said he my older African-American data. um to look

546
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:38,591
at the relationship between him everyone of studies and completed the visual field so it was

547
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:43,831
individual feels measure and compare that to what we need for that to the composite score is based

548
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:48,891
on modeling and we did that for task and we did that for well-being and so if

549
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:53,951
you can see is your uh this is weird people have matching additional fields compared to

550
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:59,091
the normative data base for their age and we can see that normal.

551
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:04,331
um the task work with hieroglyphics making nice compared to wealthy

552
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:09,750
people were complaining about their vision or saying some just out of the satisfaction based

553
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,871
on your emotional social old and even when their visual field functions measure says that

554
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:20,250
they're fine and normal normal. yeah

555
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,651
yeah I thought I just was out well we did our model account for little cuties

556
00:51:25,651 --> 00:51:30,948
but it's not doesn't come from how come everything probably doesn't account for the conference and

557
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:36,168
neither vision specific questions and so um

558
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:41,348
you know they still complain about it but they don't say that it impact their ability to do the vision

559
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:46,568
related task until the fish market for more severe um

560
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:51,928
and so they've comes up the slope these models. you can see that the slope is slightly

561
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:56,928
stronger for the past. so even though score the starts Friday. it's it's a slightly

562
00:51:56,928 --> 00:52:01,928
stronger relationship between visual field loss and the composite square.

563
00:52:01,928 --> 00:52:06,969
and if you translate these we would say that provision have that

564
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:12,128
on average these people had to lose seven decibels of visual field before

565
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:17,228
they had a clinically meaningful change probably less and for the well-being. they had to have about

566
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:22,788
eight decibels a change in visual field before they were expressing dissatisfaction and a

567
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:27,802
clinically meaningful way on the fully licensed and I'll show you a like list but

568
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:32,823
this was slightly more extreme than Latinos and our Latino population. they had

569
00:52:32,823 --> 00:52:37,903
this was only three or five decibels a change before they're folding like scores

570
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:43,083
went down and so for African-American population had to be more severe.

571
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:48,343
okay. the skill if you go back to classical tests we can look at the scales. it's strong

572
00:52:48,343 --> 00:52:53,443
as lurch consistently and stronger every population strike. so if you lose part of your peripheral

573
00:52:53,443 --> 00:53:00,062
vision. you can't drive house well. adequately

574
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:05,103
and so we had to have only about a four decibels off to get an impact on that and then here

575
00:53:05,103 --> 00:53:10,115
just shows between existing Latinos that the fax was more pronounced

576
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:15,254
Latinos before parents but this was compared it was abuse mortgage running

577
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:20,254
the data together so now my student partners analysis is going back and running means and

578
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:25,354
models doing the exact same analysis and so see gonna that if holds

579
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:30,415
up when he does the cracks. um and then just

580
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:35,655
quickly and start initially for nobody else will

581
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:41,094
smile visual feel lost and moderate to severe. there's also diagrams

582
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:46,274
um for the task composite. we really only see in

583
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:51,375
packs in past in terms of exercise. once we have bilateral water so

584
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:56,375
both sides have a pretty severe visual field off

585
00:53:56,375 --> 00:54:01,635
blood from well-being. again when they has us at least one of mine who is moderate for both

586
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:06,834
size I'll start to see small and the scene fact when you have

587
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:11,958
close I more spare and

588
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:17,278
then here he just diagram that and again you can see driving conclude bilateral ties

589
00:54:17,278 --> 00:54:22,438
with your friends are I don't think it's a large effect and that

590
00:54:22,438 --> 00:54:27,498
was consistently driving and then

591
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:32,538
just and they'll just say like the stupid about their population under study area

592
00:54:32,538 --> 00:54:39,738
was very similar county California and the US overall

593
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:44,958
um so just take away um. we we found similar conclusions

594
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:50,338
when we use classical test version item response I didn't responses much more. it's the direction

595
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:55,838
that everyone is now publishing and so place that um. moving we're for that because

596
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,857
you is currently at him. we

597
00:55:00,857 --> 00:55:09,932
found that well-being with more sense and early changes in visual field and vision specific um

598
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:14,932
it may reflect the true difference in the patient able to send a problem and

599
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:24,792
their vision before we can functionally tested him

600
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:29,912
and then African-Americans had um have a greater change in visual field before they

601
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:34,972
reported him critical.

602
00:55:34,972 --> 00:55:40,612
okay so uh and then just quickly I like to acknowledge

603
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:45,672
um. my collaborators from farm who was a cornet commission

604
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:50,832
that I worked with I mean a tour of who is the project else of and has many many people who my

605
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:56,192
um students. their arms and he was this is Casey renovated on stuff her

606
00:55:56,192 --> 00:56:01,492
he's finishing his PhD this coming spring and then from there.

607
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:09,092
finishing. thank you.

608
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:15,704
sometimes once

609
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:31,262
here everybody
