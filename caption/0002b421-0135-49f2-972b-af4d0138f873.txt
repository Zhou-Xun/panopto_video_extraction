1
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,320
2 p.m. we start lots of environmental news.

2
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:05,170
COP 27 still going on, right? Looks like the 1.5 degree target is inched up to maybe two degrees by the end of the century.

3
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,960
Looks like $100 billion of relief for countries at risk from developing countries is still up in the air.

4
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,460
A very different story. Take us on.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,930
Who's the biggest beer exporter? Like Countrywide's Countrywide.

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,670
Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, Germany, Ireland, Ireland, the U.S.

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,609
What's an Irish beer? Yes. Well, that's true. Yeah, of course.

8
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,170
It's not like a big. Yeah, no, no, I just don't that I don't drink it.

9
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,110
I don't think about that. Yeah. Okay. What else? Nobody's right.

10
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,310
Yes and no. Mexico?

11
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,430
Yes, Mexico. Okay. So.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,070
And apparently they have a huge water shortage as well.

13
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:12,760
And so in northern Mexico, I guess there's a lot of Heineken facilities as well as, you know, Corona and Osakis and things like that.

14
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,560
So they've been relying on groundwater. Okay.

15
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,640
But the town that they're in relies on surface water, which is just about dried up.

16
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,600
So it's quite interesting that that I would have to copy that article was more relevant for the class.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:36,460
But, you know, I just thought it was kind of fun. Anyway, on this quiz, this is the one that you wanted me to go over the last one.

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:46,930
Okay. So an industrial site releases bunch of stuff down, pages, PCBs.

19
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,209
Those don't move very quickly because they're very sticky, oily, even solid type of thing.

20
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,370
They tend to swerve onto mineral surfaces and and carbon surfaces.

21
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:10,000
And in the soil soluble compounds like ketones means it's going to dissolve flow with the ground water, speed, aromatics and metals.

22
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,879
What's plausible? Yes.

23
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,800
Everybody got first one pages. Yes, they have large affinity.

24
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,550
Okay. And so they're going to migrate much more slowly.

25
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,450
Correct. Contains not actress phase liquids correct.

26
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,830
For cleanup of pump and treat strategy. We'll talk a little bit about that.

27
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,010
Today will be effective.

28
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:44,050
And folks said a 79, 71% said no.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,710
And that's not going to be enough. Okay. And why is that?

30
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:58,650
Well, pump and treat is only going to get started in the groundwater and it's only going to get mainly stuff that is soluble.

31
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay. And we know we have a lot of material here which is not even going to make it to the

32
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,690
groundwater because those pages and PCBs are going to be stuck in the unsaturated soils above.

33
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:19,170
And then even the things that do make it there, that have a high affinity to sticking on surfaces aren't going to be cleaned up.

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,899
And there's also that residual contamination.

35
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,720
Remember I talked about that when an oily slug goes through the soil after it drains, there's still a lot of it left.

36
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:40,409
Okay. That's going to be hard to get a pump entry. D'Arcy's law empirical law describes water flows in confined unconfined aquifers.

37
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,880
That's correct. I should ask you, what are your questions with this question sort of going over to that I can do either way.

38
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:56,280
It applies to saturated media. Okay, unsaturated media or partially saturated media.

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,870
It doesn't work. And there's a number of reasons for that.

40
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,150
But it has the properties. The properties change as the soil gets wet.

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,770
And you guys, if you ever, for example, have houseplants, okay, and I let mine dry out,

42
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,290
okay, then I water them and when it dries out, I pour water on top and it ponds on top.

43
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,680
It doesn't move in because it has to develop a wedding surface.

44
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,670
Once it's moist, I can pour more water on and it goes through faster.

45
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,290
The hydraulic properties actually change as a function of what ability.

46
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,800
And so in the groundwater in the unsaturated zone, it would be the same thing.

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,220
It can't be modeled with RCP, so that makes sense.

48
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,260
This notion of what ability, okay, it's written mathematically.

49
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,820
K And that's correct. Porosity and tortuously and the fluid.

50
00:05:51,330 --> 00:06:05,760
This K involves a lot of different things. And so media specific property and D'Arcy's law applies to vertical flows to any direction, right?

51
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,700
Michigan has many shallow water table aquifers. This is the one that I think probably gave folks problems.

52
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,010
Hydraulic conductivity is ten to the minus fourth meters per second borehole data.

53
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,010
The porosity is point four. You're going to make you do some math.

54
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,249
I'm not ready to do that. Okay.

55
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,800
So, look, when you have something like this, always draw a picture, okay?

56
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,620
So we have a northern borehole, so, okay, this is the northern one.

57
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,300
It has elevation 200 feet. The feet are meters, meters above sea level.

58
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,540
And the depth from groundwater to the surface is five meters.

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,680
So that means that my water table height is 195 meters above sea level.

60
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,700
Okay, so this is the groundwater, all right?

61
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:23,100
Because it's five meters below southern. Well, height is, what, 2 to 10 and the water level is two over six.

62
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,040
So it's two four. So the groundwater height is two over four meters of that was and see that.

63
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Okay, so we have a gradient. Here's my two or four line.

64
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,820
I don't know, here's my 200 line, here's my 195 line, which was water flowing.

65
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,500
Sure. Okay. So that's the first one.

66
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,260
The bulk velocity is likely to be between blah blah. This is just a plug and play.

67
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,920
Go back to the York. How did we get to. Look at this location.

68
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,530
It started ten meters above sea level. The ground water is down in the, well, six meters.

69
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,790
So I subtract 210 minus six, I get to four.

70
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,110
That tells me the height of the ground water above means sea level.

71
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,630
So how did you get to the north water level?

72
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,370
Here's tool four at the northern. Well. It's 195.

73
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,270
So there's a gradient and it's going downhill in that direction.

74
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay. Good resources law tells me that Q is equal to minus to the HDL.

75
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,460
Right. And A to make sure.

76
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,600
Otherwise, it's the velocity. This question is asking actually for the velocity.

77
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,410
So. Let's do that instead.

78
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:10,970
All right, now you just plug and shoot. What's the change in height between my two wells?

79
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,140
Two or four. So that's nine meters, right?

80
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,600
And what's the distance apart that they are 200 meters apart.

81
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
That's my gradient. 200 meters. That's in the problem statement.

82
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,470
Oh. Oh. Oh. Yep. Okay. Got it. Hmm.

83
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:50,540
And then K was ten to the minus four. And whatever it is, it is, it's.

84
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,590
You can do the math. Okay. You know, one thing I had never talked about was why there's a negative in here.

85
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:07,310
And this is a great problem to show that. And the gradient is getting smaller as I go north.

86
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:20,840
The groundwater is declining. So my gradient that I actually would calculate, you know, this minus this would be positive number.

87
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,920
But I do not know.

88
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,230
Think of it this way. The slope is going down because I'm going to the north, okay?

89
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,910
Because the water table is getting lower, but the groundwater is moving in that direction.

90
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,310
North We always think of north as a positive direction based on our sign.

91
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,960
So we put a negative in front of Darcy. So it's just a sign convention.

92
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,389
Yeah. Since the K values in years per second.

93
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,680
And the question's asking for meters per day. Mm hmm. Absolutely.

94
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,760
So we're gonna have to multiply this by the appropriate conversion.

95
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,540
8000, 86000 seconds or whatever it is. Okay.

96
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,560
And then a well located. I'm sorry I didn't work it out, so.

97
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,730
Um. No, I. I see what I. Okay. I'm in a well located between the northern and southern border holes.

98
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,440
Has a screen and lit at ten meters into the aquifer.

99
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,690
So I don't know what to say about this.

100
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,720
Well, but we have another. Well, somewhere in the middle. The screen reaches down into the aquifer.

101
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:46,250
Why would this be an artesian well? Is there.

102
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,340
This is a water table aquifer by definition in the problem statement.

103
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,090
Okay. So, in other words, cross sectional view of the north.

104
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:07,759
Let's go from south to north. The groundwater is 195 feet at this point, or meters, rather, at the north and at the southern.

105
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,810
Well, it's 204. So we're assuming the groundwater table drops off like this.

106
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,080
I put a well somewhere in the middle. The ground surface is somewhat above this.

107
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,590
This can't be an artesian. Well, it's a water table aquifer. You need a pressurized aquifer.

108
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,260
It's got to be a confined aquifer. Okay.

109
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:41,600
By the way, how many kinds of aquifers are there to you could find an article about water table and confine.

110
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,960
They just have so many different names. Yeah, same thing. Yeah, that's true.

111
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,080
Okay, good. Yeah, fine.

112
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:56,970
Artesian. Well. Yeah. It's best to show you a picture of the slides, so I'll come back to that.

113
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:06,840
And, uh, groundwater contamination can be come for the data lacking.

114
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:17,520
Most groundwater models are numerical. Correct. I really do want you guys to think about the available data when you consider how good a model is.

115
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,899
So the second one is use it. Use the data that exists to evaluate the model conceptual models.

116
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,820
How can you go wrong? Thinking and diffusion is the most important process.

117
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,600
No. Remember I talked about fingering. Groundwater will move in path of least resistance.

118
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:44,010
So if you have like a utility conduit with sand and gravel where if you have a window

119
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:53,370
with a or you have a lens of sand cobbles gravel from old streambeds in a clay matrix,

120
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,770
that's where the water is going to move. Okay.

121
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:04,380
Friction diffusion is a very small scale process, important at the poor scale, but not at the macro scale.

122
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,340
This is a long quiz. Napoles.

123
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,850
Everybody got the first one. El Napoles.

124
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,910
Andy Napoles can have a dissolve phase as well as a vapor phase.

125
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,230
Absolutely. Okay. That's really important. Both of them have papers.

126
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,170
Okay. You guys have smelled aromatics, right? You know what gasoline smells like.

127
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,020
You smell dry cleaning fluid. When you get your homes, your clothes back from the dry cleaners.

128
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:45,979
That's an apple if you're smelling it or DNA or other tetrachloride ethylene and then residual saturation.

129
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,670
We already talked about that. Okay.

130
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,250
And then, yeah, this is a good movie because you go see a civil action.

131
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,420
We'll take a look at it. Okay. That Meryl Streep, that's sort of who's in it.

132
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:09,300
Would you Google or can't resist?

133
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Yes. One last question about Benghazi.

134
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,460
Yeah. I think it's a misunderstanding on my part, so I'll make sure that I'm clear.

135
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,180
I guess I'm getting confused on the fact of like it describes water flow in both confined and unconfined.

136
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,460
When I think of an unconfined aquifer, I think of unsaturated.

137
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:39,390
No, no, that's not correct. Okay, so the unconfined water table aquifer, the top one.

138
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:51,150
Okay. Has this water table, which we define as the location that we market with this triangle, some bars under it under this is completely saturated.

139
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,369
That's the aquifer. So that's an unconfined aquifer.

140
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,730
That is completely. It's completely an aquifer is saturated.

141
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,640
Okay. The structure of what's above this may be exactly the same, but only it's saturated below that.

142
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,090
And you could say it's the same geologic structure.

143
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,390
But technically, an aquifer is where the water is. What would you call that?

144
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,570
That's the veto. So that's okay. I just read these things together.

145
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,110
Okay. Okay. Or the unsaturated God.

146
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,170
Or the soil horizons that are unsaturated or whatever.

147
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm sorry for all the different words. All right, so a civil action I'm sorry.

148
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,580
Is John Travolta and all these other stars, if you like lawyer type movies, that's fine.

149
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:56,880
All right. And actually I have some personal experiences in both of these.

150
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,010
Because in the Civil Action one, it was a three dimensional plume that actually contaminated people.

151
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:12,570
And I believe it was a lawyer who's Robert Pindar, I believe is his name, who I know at Princeton,

152
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,080
who was the expert for the defense who said, no, it's not possible, but he was wrong.

153
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,700
In this Toms River. I know folks from there. And it's quite a good story to.

154
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,730
That's the question. Okay, another question. Right.

155
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:45,640
I had wanted to talk about saturated on saturated aquifers as well as artesian wells.

156
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,520
Again, and then briefly talk about clean up and then talk about air quality today.

157
00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:00,340
And that's still the plan. So quite a lot to get to. Also, in terms of logistics, you're about to for your second and final homework.

158
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:11,740
Okay. So I hope to get that out this week. And while I like the way the homeworks looked, I think it's fair to break you up into new teams.

159
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,560
So if you want to do a team assignment, which I think worked out for most of you guys,

160
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,550
so that's what I'll do, is I'll set up some new teams this week as well, so you get to meet somebody else.

161
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:38,670
Now here's a simple example with an artesian well, it doesn't have all the complexity of the other one here.

162
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,320
The recharge for this aquifers occurring at this level much higher elevation.

163
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:58,410
And so to some extent, if you think of this as one giant pipe and the of this pipers here, the water level should be about the same at both sides.

164
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,050
And since the land slopes down, this one is flowing out.

165
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,370
Okay. That's the simple explanation. Okay.

166
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:18,470
Technically, we have a piece of metric surface which is accounting for the energy loss as the water flows through a restricted area.

167
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,380
It's not a big pipe. It's got to go around the soil, the obstacle.

168
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:32,049
So it's going to lose some of its energy, some somewhat. And the water will not quite flow out at the same level.

169
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,730
But it may still feel like that's all artesian well.

170
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,850
So subtle. Yeah. Maybe can contrast it with a non earth.

171
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,470
Absolutely. And so let's go to the better picture of them.

172
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,470
Yeah. There are several types of whales.

173
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,660
Here's a whale in a unsaturated aquifer, right?

174
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,330
Not unsaturated. It's a water table aquifer. Okay.

175
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,290
Unconfined aquifer. You're going to need you're going to be so confused.

176
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,980
Okay. Okay. So. So you agree? Here's the symbol.

177
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,390
Okay. The water level in a well, in an unconfined aquifer doesn't rise above the aquifer at all.

178
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:25,880
Okay. Here's a well in a confined aquifer.

179
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,640
Okay. How how does this one rise? It rises to this point.

180
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,040
Here's the recharge. This dash line is the piece of metric surface.

181
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,160
It's almost horizontal. It's going to rise almost to the point of where the recharge occurs.

182
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,900
Okay. But it's not a flowing well, it's not an artesian well because it's still below the ground surface.

183
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,660
And then here is a well screen for another.

184
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,810
Well, the same aquifer, the piece of metric surface supply is above the ground.

185
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,950
So this water would rise to this point. So it's going to flow out.

186
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,540
And that's not energy. That's an artesian. The third one is artesian three types of wells.

187
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,310
So an artesian well can be flowing or non flowing?

188
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,430
No, artesian well, by definition is a flowing rock. Okay.

189
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:29,690
And is it is a characteristic that. We try to take that above the surface of the ground.

190
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,570
Recharge is where the water goes. One of the locations where the water will enter the aquifer.

191
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:45,800
And in this case, you can think of this as kind of the hydrostatic head or the pressure that's exerted would be the highest level of that aquifer.

192
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,100
And that's where the piece of electric line starts off. Okay.

193
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,990
And please, a metric just means the height where the recharge is.

194
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:06,700
It's the pressure in the well or in the aquifer, at whatever location, at the recharge area, as shown here.

195
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,260
It's the same as I move away from the recharge area.

196
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,580
This line will decrease a little bit, accounting for the fact that there's frictional loss as the water flows through the aquifer.

197
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:25,700
Right. Good that you don't run into so many artesian wells?

198
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,800
Well, I wouldn't think too much about them, but, you know, it's good to know what they're.

199
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,780
Okay. Good. All right.

200
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,230
So zipping towards the end here, I wanted to briefly talk about.

201
00:22:50,840 --> 00:23:02,420
Clean up a little bit. Typical well construction and you'll see these things if you guys work around waste sites or landfills or whatever,

202
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,480
typically all you'll see is a concrete cap and a pipe with a cap on top of it and a lock.

203
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:20,750
And underneath there's typically a PVC pipe that goes down and it has certain slots in the pipe and that's where the water would enter that well.

204
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,590
And this shows a cluster where we have two pipes potentially, except I'm sorry, this is one.

205
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,850
It's just that I'm looking at it. This is just for the borehole.

206
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,040
We're taking the center of the smartphone.

207
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:45,670
The pipe cluster wells are sometimes used to save expensive drilling, so many holes and still being able to sample the different depths.

208
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,800
So long as I talked about this with you guys. Okay.

209
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,149
You know, there are different strategies depending on the contaminant.

210
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:14,559
This slide breaks them down into ones that might be used for organics versus metals bioremediation, where we depend on bacteria to break things down,

211
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:25,810
typically phyto remediation where we actually plant and the roots will gather up some extent of the contamination.

212
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:36,610
These two techniques are partials. They're they're helpful sometimes for certain cases, but they're not going to get rid of everything.

213
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,480
Incineration is where you would actually dig up the soil and burn it.

214
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,330
This is used also very expensive and very disruptive, obviously.

215
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,920
Where would you incinerate?

216
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,230
Well, for example, if you knew you had a spill of PCBs on some surface oils and maybe you only had a couple of dozen cubic meters,

217
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,550
I can fit it into a truck and cart it all, typically to Texas and burn.

218
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:17,720
Steam injection could be used to try to migrate recalcitrant compounds or sticky and asphalt weight compounds and collect them.

219
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,100
Rarely used flushing. I'll show you a picture of that.

220
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,360
Rarely used as well. We're stuck. We don't have a lot of good strategies basically.

221
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,710
Okay. For metals, you can try to immobilize them, precipitate them out.

222
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,480
You can incinerate the soils as well. Of course, burning metals doesn't make a lot of sense, but you know, at least you reduce the volume.

223
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,209
You could try for reactive barriers, some electrochemical types of techniques.

224
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,820
Phyto remediation sometimes works as well and excavate and store it.

225
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:06,220
As an example for EPA of Soil Flushing, I might take leachate, clean it off, pump it back into a reservoir,

226
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,140
dispersed it on the soil, try to get the stuff out is hardly makes any sense because you're just spreading the contamination around.

227
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:25,060
So it's not really a viable technique typically for ill Napoles on the other hand, things that float on top, this is a great technique.

228
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,080
You basically have a larger well, you put in a float the skimmer,

229
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,590
and since the oil or the gasoline or whatever it is is going to float on top, you can pull that in.

230
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:41,499
The well will drop. This is the cone of depression, right?

231
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:51,520
The more it pump, the lower it will fall. And you have the ability to have a floater in here, offloading skimmer, basically, to to capture the oil.

232
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:09,250
Okay. Yeah, this is my question. No, this is a just a pumping technique, and these can be optimized to try to deal with the spread.

233
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,980
So here is an underground tank that is really a plume spread in this direction.

234
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,910
In this case, we made three wells using those skimmers to try to capture most of the product.

235
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:31,930
You can also think about putting in barrier shrimp, backfill with bentonite expanded clay.

236
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,790
So you're not pumping in water from out here, which is clean.

237
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,530
So you're optimizing the collection of contaminants.

238
00:27:47,660 --> 00:28:00,370
Lots of folks have played with adding nutrients and bacteria to increase the matter.

239
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:13,490
The removal by biological means. Here's an example where we're adding a nutrients and oxygen typically to try to increase the degradation rate.

240
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:26,660
This can be used and it is used. The issue is that each system has to be optimized for the specifics.

241
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:35,660
So you need to do some tests beforehand to figure out whether you need oxygen, whether you need nutrients, what you need the bugs themselves.

242
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:46,010
You run some risks where you may in fact have very active growth of your microbial community.

243
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:52,670
In which case you could even plug up the groundwater, which means nothing's going to flow or degrade.

244
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,580
So it has to be monitored as well.

245
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:07,970
And finally, the bugs that are down there have probably adapted to the conditions and are probably metabolizing the material anyway.

246
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,240
And so what you're doing is just sort of speeding up, up a little bit.

247
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:19,850
So, you know, if you need to speed them up, then this might be the strategy of if you're more patient, you don't have a well at risk.

248
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,690
It might be best just to leave the system all. Are those like more?

249
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:32,870
Is it site specific where like they will sample the soil, see what bacteria and microbes are in the soil?

250
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:41,150
Yes. Right now, you would have a microcosm experiment or do a field experiment to see how it's going to react.

251
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,799
And typically, you're adding nutrients or oxygen.

252
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,890
You're not actually adding bugs because there's not bugs. Probably don't.

253
00:29:53,430 --> 00:30:02,130
Another approach which is used quite extensively in the event of soil vapor getting into basements

254
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:10,290
or killing trees or just going where you don't want it is to use SBP soil vapor extraction.

255
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,350
And this strategy is very simple. You're basically you have a vacuum and you just suck out the vapors.

256
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:28,050
And this works pretty well. For example, landfills, Michigan has quite a few landfills that are large.

257
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,740
So you put a well suck out the vapor.

258
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:42,390
That vapor goes into like a Ford engine or regular car engine and it powers it because it's got enough methane in there to actually run the engine.

259
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:53,370
And that engine runs the vacuum pump. So it's kind of a closed system and then they actually produce electricity with the additional power as well.

260
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,420
And this is used in all the larger and many of the larger landfills.

261
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,640
Question What do they sell? Yeah or no?

262
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:13,950
They typically use it onsite, so it's a good way to capture the methane and then they run it through the catalytic converter.

263
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:24,610
They clean up the exhaust gases as well. But often you'll see a home right here.

264
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:35,050
And if the gas has a potential of getting into that home, then they will sink wells around the basement or try to ventilate underneath the slab.

265
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,190
If you're familiar with radon mitigation, it's exactly the same.

266
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,820
You try to suck out and create a low pressure area so that vapor doesn't go into the house.

267
00:31:44,830 --> 00:32:02,280
Instead, it goes into the collection system. This is a strategy using permeable, reactive barriers to degrade or oxidize or immobilize the plume.

268
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:13,000
And the idea is that plume is going to move in this case into the stream or something like that, and you're going to intercept it before that.

269
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:23,520
You have a trench, fill it with potassium permanganate or some other chemical that was going to accelerate the decomposition or the immobilization.

270
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:30,960
And these are sometimes used. And in fact, we used one in Ann Arbor, by the way,

271
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:38,730
departments that are still underway because there was a plume from a dry cleaner making its way into the Huron River.

272
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:45,540
And they have a series of reactive barriers to intercept that before it gets into the the river.

273
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:58,520
The question is, is essentially how the diagram versus once the plume runs into that barrier, it treats it because it's permeable to water.

274
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,330
The water goes through treated water. Exactly.

275
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,279
Okay. An engineer friend of mine put this together.

276
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,150
If you're remediate an average Superfund site, how much would it cost?

277
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,750
Let's say of an 80 acre site. Soils contaminated to ten feet, pretty large site.

278
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:27,440
If you treated 100 to 1000 bucks per cubic yard burning the soil, probably still about a thousand bucks.

279
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,390
Run the numbers. Acres be ten feet.

280
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,070
35 cubic 35 million cubic feet.

281
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,600
Multiply that by these cost numbers. That's the real money answer.

282
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,850
Okay. 130 million to $1.3 billion.

283
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,290
This is kind of astounding, right?

284
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,850
Typical comfortable Superfund cleanup site, probably 50 to 100 million.

285
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:11,640
They're only treating part of it. Much of the waste is just left in place if it doesn't provide an imminent risk.

286
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:21,990
And the way that's done is to put a cap on top, to keep the rainfall precipitation from coming in, put enough wells around it.

287
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,440
So whatever does make through, you can pump it out maybe.

288
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,880
And that's a typical remedy, not waste removal.

289
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:34,560
It's not volume reduction. It's keep it in place and limit the migration.

290
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:43,440
And why? Because you can't afford to spend $1,000,000,000 on the 1500 Superfund sites that we have in the country.

291
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:56,790
All right. How we doing on time? Bad, bad questions.

292
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,870
We're doing okay. Right.

293
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:20,310
Shifting gears a little bit. We'll talk about your calling for the next couple of weeks.

294
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:34,050
You know, I mentioned the COP 27 going on. Another story today is the fastest growing segment of car purchases is electric vehicles.

295
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,780
This year, they accounted for 6% of new vehicles.

296
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,450
I don't know if that. Or new cars. I don't know if that includes light trucks.

297
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:56,730
Okay. Because light trucks are half of the market. But anyway, 6% of new cars last year was half of that.

298
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:09,070
So that's pretty impressive. What's driving that? Yeah, I think that's a really key thing.

299
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:18,040
And you can fill up your electric car for about $6 compared to 50, 75, whatever it is at the gas pump.

300
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,980
Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,120
Uh, humbly speaking, you would be Elon Musk.

302
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,730
He is very near some of the greatest technology and is dominating some of the market share.

303
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:47,100
And the big three and among others, have been shocked and trapped in cells, being shocked on how fast they're losing new car market share,

304
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,940
like the basis of like in least 100 years and they're going to be taking over.

305
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,689
So, yeah, definitely. They're all in line to compete.

306
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,120
And that's why you see the Hummer e come out of nowhere. And that's why the Mustang Mach-e came out of nowhere.

307
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,420
Like it's only because of their existence. Yeah. No cars, human beings.

308
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah. I think that the big three or four or whatever are very much at risk because they haven't kept up with the new technology,

309
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,140
even rumors going around in some of the merging like Ford and Honda.

310
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,670
That was when I worked at Ford. There was a huge rumor going around, executives saying that that might happen.

311
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,779
That hasn't happened yet, but there might be a lot of well, you know, there's a lot of other things, too.

312
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,830
And I have to say that the big three or four did see this coming, but they didn't act.

313
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,690
And, you know, it was about five years ago that some of my friends at corporate at Ford's said to me, you know,

314
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:51,920
we really stopped innovating in our ACI engines, the spark ignition engines, the gasoline engines, because they saw no future, you know.

315
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,670
So it's quite interesting, the big market shift. What about air quality?

316
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,340
Isn't that a motivator for most people?

317
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,490
Probably not, no. Yeah. I would assume at this point that they've already have like 2 to 3 trucks.

318
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:17,640
They only have one truck. Yes. They already have like many trucks to choose from and they already probably put all the three gadgets.

319
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,980
Well, there is certainly a lot of issues in just taking our conventional fleet and electrifying it.

320
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:32,160
Okay. Because you're you know, there's a huge battery demand that's involved in this.

321
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,790
And most people do very small trips most of the time.

322
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:41,280
And simply reconfiguring it to be electric is not the really the right solution in my mind either.

323
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,000
But it's interesting, you say air quality is not part of it. But, you know, that's why maybe.

324
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,750
Maybe it should be. I don't know. Yeah.

325
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:00,570
Um, I'm just wondering if, you know, if you drill for the big ones or small ones.

326
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,810
I don't know. Well, there is the lightning that's being produced right now in Dearborn.

327
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,460
Okay. Which is a pickup truck. And I think you can get it now.

328
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:22,530
Okay. And they are gearing up and that's a big facility. I don't know how many they produce, but, you know, there's supply chain issues, too.

329
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,720
Yeah, Rivian already has their electric truck.

330
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:32,350
This Tesla cybertruck should be produced in the next year, but they will eventually make electric semis.

331
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:46,540
Yeah. Or hydrogen semis too is further down the road that hydrogen there would be better hydrogen for more manufacturing.

332
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,070
I'm not sure. Toyota. I don't know if Tesla is making it.

333
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:57,160
Well, you make lithium. Yeah. So I say that, you know, it's a very dynamic marketplace.

334
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,480
I listened to some nice presentations about hydrogen.

335
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:09,580
I wasn't a believer. I'm not sure if I am, but the power demand for these big trucks is quite high.

336
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,919
So. Well, okay. It's interesting you don't talk about air pollution here.

337
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:27,730
I'm trying to segway into that slowly here. One of the studies that I've been involved with is this e-waste study that we've been doing in Ghana.

338
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:34,480
And basically you don't think so much, but when you toss out your cell phone, where does it go?

339
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:43,960
Well, consumer electronics and durables and things like this hopefully get recycled to some extent.

340
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,700
But none of this stuff is designed to be recycled, which is a big issue.

341
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,860
The situation's probably, you know, an order of magnitude worse in a place like this in Ghana.

342
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,459
This is in the center of Ghana, Accra, the capital city.

343
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,520
It's literally a mile from downtown.

344
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:11,889
Okay. And what they're doing here and I don't know if I put in my best pictures here or not, but have you visited?

345
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:20,110
Is this true? Yeah. These are shots I took. Yeah. They're taking durables and electronics and pulling out the metals.

346
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:26,260
And if you take apart most of your electronics,

347
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,840
you have a circuit board and you have stuff soldered to the circuit board, often with lead containing solder.

348
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:42,909
But the circuit board itself is got copper traces in it, and that's a material that's worth recycling to get to it.

349
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:50,920
They just burn it off. And anyway, it's all very primitive approach.

350
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:57,160
And we did some air quality monitoring and occupational exposure and air quality work there,

351
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:07,960
and we used sort of industrial hygiene style equipment to monitor particulate matter and other chemicals.

352
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:21,730
And this is one of our students. But the amazing thing here is these PPM measurement techniques use virtual impactors.

353
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,180
Do you know what those are to do?

354
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,390
Size, separation and basically.

355
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:43,250
I'm going to see if I go over here. Basically, you're taking air and you're sampling it.

356
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:52,360
So you have a high velocity there and. The thing looks something like this, and this is a filter.

357
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,340
And then you have a pump that tries to exalt fear.

358
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:05,470
You're stuck in your room for a small, too. This contains a lot of particles.

359
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,040
The particles will hit this impaction surface, okay?

360
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,440
And the smaller particles escape and are caught on your filter.

361
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:20,650
And this is called a virtual impactor. The idea is we aren't interested in those big particles.

362
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:29,410
Interested in why? PM to five less than two and a half microns that you can breathe all the way down into your every older region and your lungs.

363
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,130
This is the way we get rid of those big particles.

364
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:40,390
And what's simple down here then is just the small particles, because they don't have all the inertia mass.

365
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,310
Those big particles are just going to keep going straight. The small ones will go with the airflow.

366
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:56,200
So this virtual impactor in this particular device has seven or eight of those jets.

367
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,840
Okay. And then when we took it apart, underneath it are all these big particles.

368
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:09,430
And I've never seen this before to this extent, just showing you how high the concentration levels are for those big particles.

369
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:18,230
Look at this site. And of course, the device doesn't work properly when you have this problem, because this distance from here to here,

370
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,440
the velocity have to be controlled very precisely to get the size, scope point that you want.

371
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:34,810
In any event, that's what this picture is about. Did you ever come up with, like the composition of what those large composites that are on there?

372
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah. Well, what was like the main bulk made bulk of its soil and dust.

373
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:49,270
And then you have ash and carbon and metals and organics.

374
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,960
So we did particle composition analysis. This, of course, we're not interested in these particles are interested in the small ones.

375
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,850
Right. Right. Yeah. Just great. So they also have water quality problems here as well.

376
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:15,070
There's actually a monitoring site that we put in this little cage up here and putting up a weather station with one of my colleagues there,

377
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:27,520
and she made us dinner. So that's not relevant. But anyway, so I wanted to start with the air quality stuff again.

378
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:38,740
So anyway, this site, Agbogbloshie is still got a couple thousand people on site doing this waste recycling.

379
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,900
Okay. It's an informal business economy.

380
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:50,080
It's fairly essential to the employment of those folks.

381
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,790
And it's a tough, tough place to live. Okay.

382
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,260
So in this unit, like the others, I want to try to give you an overview.

383
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:09,160
Talk about some indicators, talk about some of the processes and regulations and then groundwater.

384
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:16,190
We didn't talk very much about the hydrologic cycle, the external forces, because it's not quite as dynamic as it is in the air pollution case.

385
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,250
So I need to talk a little bit about air pollution meteorology so I understand what drives the system.

386
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,010
And then we'll talk about modeling and some case studies.

387
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:34,010
So my background here, I'll present to you today something about air pollutants that forces impacts of classification.

388
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:42,950
We'll talk a lot about air quality regulations and then move into some of the physical concepts needed to understand emissions, transport and freight.

389
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,350
Some readings. Please take a look. And lots of websites.

390
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,470
Okay, start off. This is an old, old, old, old, old problem.

391
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,790
Okay. Documentation goes back to the 12th century. Edward One The king banned the use of sea coal.

392
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,740
Why? What's the problem with sea coal? Anybody know?

393
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:27,140
I don't even know what's he plans? Kind of like a Pete almost, but a little bit drier.

394
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:36,899
It's like a you know, it's like there's anthracite coal, there's bituminous coal.

395
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,230
This is like not quite even there. It's still soft coal.

396
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,960
Yeah. Well, if you say Pete, then it might be sulfuric.

397
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,730
Yes. Lots of sulfur. Okay. And lots of air.

398
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,690
In other words, stuff that doesn't burn. Okay.

399
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:00,650
So when you burn this stuff and you can imagine.

400
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,880
12th Century posters weren't exactly high tech.

401
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,310
Right? So the temperatures didn't get that high. There's certainly no emission control system.

402
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,820
You got a lot of sulfur gases and you got a lot of ash, a lot of smoke.

403
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:26,700
So he stated, Whoever hears my voice burning these calls suffer the loss of his head and he actually hunger me.

404
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:37,010
Okay. So, you know, it worked. But because they weren't allowed to burn coal, they burned wood.

405
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,030
And soon all the trees and Britain were cut down.

406
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,890
And so they went back to burning coal for sustainability.

407
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:56,330
So even the 12th century in the terms of public health, John Avlon wrote to me.

408
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:02,690
You know, John, forgive my pronunciation or the inconvenience of air and smoke of London anticipated.

409
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:06,980
And so this actually proposed things like green belts.

410
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:15,680
Okay. To reduce the impact of sources. So this is a sort of public health law that goes way back as well.

411
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:26,840
Kind of interesting. My timeline here takes us through English committees in the 19th century,

412
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:37,190
through studies about air pollution deaths and so forth, car pollution in the fifties, 1950s.

413
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:48,050
But it's also peppered with air pollution episodes in London, in Belgium, in Pennsylvania, again in London.

414
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,650
And these were massive episodes. We're going to talk about them.

415
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:58,250
And that led to the first US legislation national level in 1970.

416
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:08,480
And really we can talk about the Clean Air Act, the modern world after 1970.

417
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,260
Now there had been local laws and state laws prior to that, but nothing at the federal level.

418
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:23,510
Okay. And most of the local laws were kind of negotiations between companies and the overseeing office.

419
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,470
They weren't that effective. Bringing us up a little bit.

420
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,790
The Clean Air Act was amended in 1979.

421
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:39,940
We had a number of international conventions, and I only go to 2015 here with the Paris Accord.

422
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,870
But some of these are really important. All right. We're going to talk about the Clean Air Act and its amendments.

423
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:54,490
But the Montreal Protocol in 87 was on substances that deplete the ozone layer.

424
00:50:54,970 --> 00:51:06,580
Things like CFC use that are using your air conditioner, chlorofluorocarbons and of course, Kyoto and Paris dealing with greenhouse gases.

425
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:17,500
So a very, very long history of air quality, relevant legislation at both local and national international level.

426
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:28,240
You guys can hardly imagine what it was like, say, in the thirties, forties, fifties, and even beginning of the sixties.

427
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:36,700
This is a new time picture in London during one of the air pollution episodes.

428
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,260
The smoke was so dark, it obscured the sun.

429
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:50,310
You couldn't see anything. And again, you know, these are daytime pictures.

430
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:57,750
And this is from coal. From coal. This is in Pennsylvania and in Oregon.

431
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,730
Okay. Which is not that far from Pittsburgh.

432
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:18,310
In the London Great Smog disaster of 1952 was originally estimated killed 4000 people over a period of about a week.

433
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:27,310
And this is a trace of the timeline in 1952.

434
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,310
And I'm showing on here a number of different things.

435
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:39,940
The Brits measured smoke using a smoke measure, which is called smoke, and that is shown with the red line red dots.

436
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:49,420
And it reached this level, which we estimated to be about 600 micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter.

437
00:52:49,630 --> 00:53:01,170
What's our current standard? Does anyone know? 4 p.m. to five, which is this is not PM to fly.

438
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,259
This is probably PM ten. Something like. 4 p.m. to five.

439
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:15,220
We have an annual average standard of 12 food in a 24 hour standard of 35 compared to.

440
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,840
1600 in London on that day. Okay.

441
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:30,760
So it's way hot. We have also shown on the left scale and that's with the blue triangles.

442
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,219
And then we're up to about 700 people being in.

443
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:46,210
My current standard is I think 80 in the US. Okay, so we're ten times higher on sulfur and maybe 100 times higher on PM.

444
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,370
And then finally, the other line here are deaths.

445
00:53:52,240 --> 00:54:00,130
The normal death rate in London was about 300 deaths per day. In this Time series analysis, you start seeing the death rate increase, well,

446
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:06,970
three times higher and then it tails off and folks integrate under that curve.

447
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:13,150
And that's where we get about 4000 deaths, excess deaths due to this air pollution episode.

448
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:24,780
Now reanalysis of this shows that many people have secondary infections and this still went on for months afterwards.

449
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,320
And when you account for that, there's about an additional 8000 deaths.

450
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,750
So that brings the excess number of deaths related to this to about 12,000.

451
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:45,830
Okay. Lots of examples.

452
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,100
I mentioned Belgium, the Nora, London and other places.

453
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,150
These all had several common themes. One theme was lots of coal use, right?

454
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:06,070
With old technology. The second theme was wintertime occurrence.

455
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:14,430
Why is that? What is it have to do with, like, hot air rising?

456
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,950
Not exactly, but you're on to something still.

457
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,260
Is it cold air and dry air? Not exactly.

458
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,760
How about the trackers? Yes. So all you are saying the third factor, which is an inversion.

459
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,870
Okay. And so that's all correct. And we're going to talk about that potentially.

460
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:42,810
You have air that's cold air with a warm air layer on top of it.

461
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,360
Normally it gets colder. Okay. But the winter time, that is because you need to heat the home.

462
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,410
You need to hit the businesses so you have even more coal use than usual.

463
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:59,190
Okay. So those are the three factors that go together and the inversion.

464
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:06,660
We're going to talk about that. But it's typically a persistent inversion, which is due to a stationary high pressure system.

465
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,170
So if you look at the weather map, you have h is for high pressure.

466
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:17,010
L for low pressure that H is just hovering above the normal or whatever London for a couple of days.

467
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,620
And that keeps a cap on the dispersion, allowing levels to build up underneath that layer.

468
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,860
And in the seventies we started air pollution epidemiology studies.

469
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,430
The most famous study being the Harvard succeeding study.

470
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:46,650
And they essentially did a very simple analysis, looked at six cities with different levels of particulate matter,

471
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:52,260
looked at long term concentrations, and came up with risks.

472
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,690
And Doug Dockery ended up fitting those six cities.

473
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:05,970
The closest one to us here is probably Saint Louis and saw relative increase in death rates.

474
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,460
And this really was a formative study to think about air quality.

475
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:20,010
Actually, maybe Steubenville is closer. And of course, now we have zillions of air pollution studies.

476
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:29,190
In fact, this is the lowest hanging fruit for any of you who want to publish a paper or get a Ph.D. or write a master's thesis.

477
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,710
There's so much air quality data available now.

478
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:42,480
And, you know, when I went to the EPI meeting, the environmental epidemiology meeting earlier this fall,

479
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:48,720
more than half of the papers were on air pollution. So lots of people are have been doing this for a long time.

480
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,860
And this is just showing you a bunch of different studies from 90 different study sites.

481
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:06,000
So, again, the common themes that air pollution episodes, high coal use, typically in industrialized area in the wintertime,

482
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,780
prolonged inversion and all of this results in excess number of deaths for typically

483
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:18,390
individuals with preexisting diseases like emphysema or asthma or heart trouble or bronchitis.

484
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:31,920
Do we still have air pollution episodes? Yes.

485
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:43,370
Tell me about it. Oh, I think that my friends out West, it'll be pretty awful things to happen pretty recently due to smoke from a fire.

486
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:53,610
First place. Yes, I would imagine that some of the more crowded places over in Southeast Asia, probably in China, for example.

487
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,850
China. Yeah. So China's still burning a lot of coal.

488
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,110
But Seattle, in the northwest, it's forest fires.

489
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:06,420
Typically there are not industrialized areas, so it's quite different.

490
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,890
Typically it's not a prolonged inversion, it's just that so much is burning and you're downwind of.

491
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,990
Is it an episode? I guess if it lasts for three or four days, it could be for sure.

492
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,480
Good. Any other types of episodes? Yeah.

493
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:29,060
We have the forest fires that even have the smoke billowing across the entire nation.

494
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,210
Absolutely. So. Absolutely.

495
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:41,299
In fact, when we have smoke from a really large fire, it makes a huge impact locally and it produces,

496
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,460
in fact, the highest PPM concentrations that we see higher than from local sources.

497
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:54,860
So it's interesting. It's a little different versions happen a lot in the valley areas or do they have them in the camp?

498
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:59,960
They can. But not limited to inversions. So we'll talk more about inversions in a second.

499
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,230
Yeah, the other type of air pollution problem is now a summertime air pollution episode.

500
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,020
It's very different. It is a result of a high pressure system again.

501
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:23,750
But this time we're capping with dispersion of pollutants, with lots of nitrogen oxides, lots of viruses, and this forms ozone.

502
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,950
So it's an ozone air pollution episode, and you've all seen ozone alerts and things like that.

503
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:37,600
If they last for several days, it could be an air pollution episode. So that's kind of the modern case now.

504
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:45,530
So we got rid of most of those classical themes right here with coal, and now we're into new the nouveau.

505
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,380
Something new. Okay. Is it coming from like automobiles or agriculture?

506
01:00:51,830 --> 01:01:01,880
Yeah, great question. Mostly cars and trucks, but any kind of combustion source will produce NOx nitrogen oxides in volatile organics.

507
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,459
But when you have a lot of refineries and hydrocarbon use, that is a controlled very well.

508
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,790
You have lots of viruses present and that will form ozone.

509
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,290
So an inversion is defined on this slide.

510
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:26,930
Basically, it's an increase in air temperature with hope. And what this does is beneath the layer,

511
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:34,940
which is starting to increase in temperature and it can often be the base of the clouds will have decreased vertical horizontal movement,

512
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,290
decreased vertical movement, less dilution. And it just lasts for several days.

513
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:49,999
It can form an episode and there are several types of inversions.

514
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,360
And we'll talk about this more in the air pollution meteorology part.

515
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,390
But we have subsidence inversions which cause these air pollution episodes.

516
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:09,860
You can have a front frontal episode or a cold front and a hub from the cold front slides under the control.

517
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:15,530
And that causes low temperatures and high temperatures. And we can have one that's called a nocturnal.

518
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,460
And I'll explain that in a few minutes. Break time.

519
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:26,720
I've gone over my one hour every 5 minutes.

520
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:30,680
So it's a substantive subsidence.

521
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:37,880
Yeah, subsidence is, you know, on the weather map, sometimes you'll see a h a high pressure system.

522
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:42,530
Basically, you have an air mass which is coming down towards the surface of the earth.

523
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,700
And you just think of that as flowing down and it's compressing the air underneath it.

524
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:54,259
Okay. What happens is air compresses and gets colder, heats up, heats up.

525
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,590
When you compress gas, it heats up. When you expand it, it cools.

526
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:03,710
Okay. So that air is getting compressed. So you have heating happening above the ground layer.

527
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:31,360
And so then it goes from cold. Too hot. Okay. The.

528
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:29,290
On their. Take us out this, by the way, by any chance.

529
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,270
She's calling me. He was.

530
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:06,910
Some action today. You guys seen these maps from purple air sensors and things like this?

531
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:12,130
No. Purple areas like $100 or $200 air quality monitor.

532
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:20,709
It measures PM to five more or less, and it is on the wi fi if you have a place.

533
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:31,120
And then Purple Air is a company that has sold thousands of these things and you can see their locations and across the globe with them.

534
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,669
But here we have some fire events happening producing PM in the red zone.

535
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:43,719
I guess the highest that I see is about 150 here and it's a ten minute average.

536
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,670
There's the trend in the air quality index,

537
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:59,050
which is basically like a grade from 0 to 100 would be 100 would be like the air quality standard, but bad 200 would be twice that level.

538
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:08,920
Okay. And so this is approximately the air quality standard 4 p.m. to five on a 24 hour basis, it's 35 micrograms.

539
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:19,300
So it's not crazy high. Okay. It's actually still pretty low, but it's enough to move it to the right area, which is based on five monitors they have.

540
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:27,280
Yeah. This is live right now. Okay. And yeah, they've done a great job with this.

541
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:33,310
There's a couple of other similar networks like this. In fact, they have indoor now.

542
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:36,930
This is new. There's there in Vermont. They're just selling it there.

543
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:42,549
So the outdoor monitor just looks it's a piece of PVC.

544
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:47,160
It's a four inch pipe cap, and then they put a few electronics inside of it.

545
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:55,330
But the real beauty is when you get a lot of these things, when you can do things like track pollution really effectively.

546
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:59,019
Is that five, nine, nine? Yeah. Yeah.

547
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:08,180
So what's going on there? So I'm a user of this stuff, but also a great cynic.

548
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:17,480
What do you think is happening with that? 599. Its internal function could be.

549
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:22,760
Somebody could be grilling right underneath it. Who knows?

550
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,670
Okay. There's absolutely no way on this stuff. All right.

551
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:32,660
Purple Air. People are pretty smart. They if you buy the $200 monitor, they have 2 p.m. sensors.

552
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:36,410
And when they diverge, they know something's wrong. Okay.

553
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,070
The $100 only has one, but you can put it wherever you want.

554
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:51,200
Okay. In contrast, if we look at EPA's air quality monitoring data, there's lots of sites for that.

555
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:55,110
This is live. Also, this is ozone re.

556
01:10:55,130 --> 01:11:02,870
We're looking at ppm here across the country and they're seeing some yellow areas as well.

557
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:11,150
But you can see there's a whole lot fewer monitors. And this is looking at one hour averages as compared to ten minute.

558
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:19,910
So it's going to be moderated. And also, it's using what we call a far and federal reference method.

559
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,840
So it's a much better measurement. It's much more reproducible.

560
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:29,720
Okay. And the instrument costs $20,000 instead of 100 or $200.

561
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:38,930
And EPA has made some attempts to try to give you real time information.

562
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:43,400
But I don't think I can produce a map from here or a trend line.

563
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:50,060
And the state does do something like that.

564
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:56,570
And then a better EPA site is this EPA maps are GISS.

565
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:06,300
And here I can go into, say, Detroit and look at the monitoring sites here.

566
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:11,269
And for example, this one is at Dearborn.

567
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:16,210
And I can download data that actually goes back to 1970 or so for that.

568
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,540
So there's just a ton of data available for this kind of stuff.

569
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:27,710
Okay. All right. Let's talk about how to interpret it, but there's an increasing amount of that as well.

570
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:35,570
So where does that bring us?

571
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:41,290
Back to my PowerPoint. Okay. So we've talked about air pollution.

572
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,400
There are a number of different definitions of this.

573
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:51,970
It can be simply the presence of contaminant that causes harm or interfere with your enjoyment of life or welfare.

574
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,390
Using sort of a nuisance law framework for this.

575
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:01,300
Okay. Hard way to go legally in most states like Michigan.

576
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,550
If I smell something really bad from a wastewater treatment plant or a chemical company,

577
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,040
that's not enough for me to actually win a lawsuit against them.

578
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:17,320
Okay. I cannot do that if the levels exceed a standard.

579
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:29,830
Different game. Okay. But not for odor. Most folks from industry would assume air pollution is when you have a violation of an air quality standard.

580
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:33,880
Okay. Or guideline. And we've already talked about air pollution episodes.

581
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:43,510
Okay. So if I look at gas or the air outdoors, typical composition is shown here.

582
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:50,320
Some 78%, of course, is nitrogen. Almost 21% is oxygen.

583
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:59,320
We need oxygen. And if I look at this small layer, this small sliver here, I'll have CO2.

584
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,670
The number here has to be updated. It's about point oh, 4% now.

585
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:12,610
And we have some noble gases. If we look at the bigger table, at the right ribs, there are three gases here.

586
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:17,410
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, which are greenhouse gases.

587
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:25,350
Okay. So they're important because they absorb infrared and the heat, the air.

588
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:29,230
And so they're radioactively important gases.

589
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:38,140
The concentration of CO2 currently about 408 parts per million, increasing about five parts per million a year.

590
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:47,850
Okay. Who's the biggest emitter? CO2 country wise.

591
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:53,550
Which country is responsible to the consumer in China, India, the US?

592
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:59,700
Yeah. By volume or per capita mass?

593
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:04,080
Per country. China. Yeah. It's way bigger than the US at this point.

594
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,010
However, the US historically has put out more CO2 than China.

595
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:19,020
Okay. Methane. The concentration is way lower, only about two parts per million, but it's also increasing quite fast,

596
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:27,450
faster than CO2, and it absorbs 20 to 40 times more infrared per molecule than CO2.

597
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,929
So it's getting to be really important as well. Okay.

598
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:35,000
It's almost as important as CO2. It doesn't last as long in the atmosphere.

599
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:41,880
That's a good thing, though. Nitrous oxide still below one part per million.

600
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:48,960
Then we have carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide.

601
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:57,630
These gases are below 0.1 parts per million, but they're very important because they are toxicants.

602
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:02,160
Okay. And they're also been regulated by the Fair Act as well.

603
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:12,460
And we're going to talk about each of these in turn. Those three form half of what we call the criteria air pollutants.

604
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,770
These are the ones that have been regulated since 1970 with the Clean Air Act

605
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:22,150
under what we call the National Ambient Air Quality Standards or the NACS.

606
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:31,150
If nothing else, today learned an x ray because this is sort of the heart and soul of the Clean Air Act.

607
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,690
Standard uniform, prescriptive regulations.

608
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:41,110
Okay. To achieve air quality, to protect everybody. That's the goal.

609
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:51,210
So we have a couple of different types of balloons. One definition is conventional balloons affect the boundary layer.

610
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,870
This is typically within about 1000 meters of the Earth's surface.

611
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:59,160
Here we have the atmosphere basically diluting these balloons.

612
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,290
Globally, distributed pollutants are global. Balloons have long residence times.

613
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:08,370
They last in the atmosphere for years and they become windblown.

614
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:12,750
They get dispersed everywhere they can get into the stratosphere as well.

615
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:25,350
This is where we have the good ozone in the stratosphere, which forms by the decomposition of oxygen and water vapor up there.

616
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:33,450
But the bad ozone is at the troposphere and the boundary layer where we all live and work and breathe.

617
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:39,330
And that's the bad ozone. Okay. Why is that good ozone?

618
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,690
Because it absorbs U.V. ultraviolet radiation.

619
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,540
I think that was what the Montreal Protocol was all about.

620
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:56,400
Try to keep that good ozone up there by not flying your STIs through the stratosphere where the NOx would destroy the ozone.

621
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,379
And then finally, at the bottom, we have these six pollutants ozone, carbon dioxide,

622
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,600
particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and O2, nitrogen dioxide and lead.

623
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:13,080
Those are the six criteria pollutants. Those are the only ones we have standards for.

624
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,440
Okay. We have some guidelines for the others, but we don't have national standards.

625
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:25,410
Okay. We used to have VOCs, but now we don't have VOCs anymore.

626
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:36,190
Okay. Here's another schema for classifying pollutants.

627
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:41,650
First, a very broad definition of air pollutants, foul of liquids or gases in outdoor air.

628
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:48,100
We have a conventional pollutant. So the criteria pollutants, like I just mentioned, those six,

629
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:56,290
we have toxic pollutants which formally are known as haps hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

630
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,360
These can be at local, regional or global scale.

631
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:10,480
Perhaps in the Clean Air Act amendments, we have 189 additional pollutants,

632
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:20,200
things like benzene, for example, if we have greenhouse gases radiated the important ones.

633
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,890
These can be broken down into long lived, medium lived and short lived.

634
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:30,350
And you'll note that, for example, short lived includes carbon monoxide.

635
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:34,860
But this is also one of the conventional plumes. Okay.

636
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:41,870
Carbon monoxide is one of the criteria. And then I've added a fourth category.

637
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:47,250
We have indoor plants can be any of those as well.

638
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,640
All right. So we talk about indicators.

639
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:55,920
How do we know if things are getting better, how we're getting things worse?

640
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,940
How do we track stuff?

641
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:05,580
Typically in the air quality context, we look at emissions, we look at air quality concentrations and exposures and we look at risk.

642
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:23,130
Okay. And. There are secondary indicators like proximity to a source or residence location, maybe some disease related outcomes.

643
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:29,580
So I'm only going to talk about the top three emissions first.

644
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,710
In many ways, the Clean Air Act has been a success story. Okay.

645
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,230
Emissions of the criteria, pollutants. The six conventional blooms in general have decreased.

646
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:46,590
This is showing you, what, 30 years apart? Carbon monoxide is down 19%.

647
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:53,070
NOx is up a little bit. Actually, VOCs is down, CO2 is down, PM10 is down.

648
01:20:53,490 --> 01:21:02,220
LED is way, way down. And if I had a slight update as to 2022, CO2 would be far lower.

649
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:11,259
CO2 would be far lower as well. Okay. So we need to talk about these pollutants.

650
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:17,410
And this slide shows up on EPA's website a lot.

651
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:24,460
They're showing here, again, trends of the air pollutants in the blue line.

652
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:33,040
They just aggregated them by tonnage together. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but still it's a downward trend.

653
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,050
And if you look at energy consumption and the red or the gross domestic product,

654
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:44,800
we have achieved a reduction in air pollution emissions without a major drag on the economy.

655
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:56,060
That's the point. Okay. The economy still growth. In 2021, we had.

656
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:10,240
102 million people in the US live in areas where at least one of the nacs for those six conventional pollutants is exceeded.

657
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:20,320
Okay. That includes you guys, by the way, because we live in an area where we exceed the ozone standard.

658
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:32,560
Okay. And so in southeast Michigan, we add the three or so million people living in the seven counties around Detroit as being a non achievement.

659
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:38,950
Okay. And that would be for ozone, 4 p.m. to five.

660
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:45,400
About 36 million people live in areas where it's exceeded PM10, 17 million.

661
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:55,200
So to less than 1 million people. So two includes three areas of Michigan that exceed the SO2 standard.

662
01:22:57,370 --> 01:23:06,280
Southwest Detroit. A little further north in Detroit and around Lafarge Cement facility.

663
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:11,410
Okay. Led 4.4 million people.

664
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,590
There's one site in Michigan, I believe carbon monoxide.

665
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:18,190
Very few people in oh two. Nobody. Okay.

666
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,400
And if you look at the Institute for Health Metrics.

667
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:27,730
Are you guys familiar with the site? Some of you are right.

668
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:35,000
Good. So they put together essentially the top risk factors for health.

669
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:42,190
And this is a slide showing environmentally related risks or includes environmentally related risks.

670
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:50,890
And PPM comes in as the eighth highest risk factor causing on the order of 3.2 million deaths per year globally.

671
01:23:51,820 --> 01:24:01,240
Okay. And then if we look at indoor air pollution, add another 2 million deaths to that and then you drop down to,

672
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:05,020
I don't know here, ozone, about a half million deaths.

673
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:09,190
How did they turn this? Same way they do the rest.

674
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:18,249
It's a bunch of risk analysis based on epidemiology, based on demographics,

675
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:25,240
based on monitoring and modeling of what the exposures are, and trying to tease apart all of the factors that affect health.

676
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:29,499
It's not a trivial exercise. Great site.

677
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,360
You should take a look at it if you've never seen it,

678
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,880
because you can drill down to the state level and see lots of information about health statistics.

679
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:41,710
Okay, not just environment, but all kinds of things. It's really quite impressive what they've done.

680
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:49,730
This particular picture also brings out the cause of the death.

681
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:57,290
And if we look at the air pollution we have, the largest is light blue and that is cardiovascular disease.

682
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:03,290
Okay. This pink is respiratory infections. And so we can see the cause of death as well.

683
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:14,830
Okay. Of course, this slide was showing you just deaths.

684
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:25,450
But if you start looking at all the other aspects that can affect your health, you have this kind of health impacts pyramid,

685
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:36,610
and it can start off with subclinical effects or small changes in your breathing leading up to all kinds of things as you proceed up the pyramid.

686
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:43,960
Your. So the death picture here is just really the tip of the iceberg.

687
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:50,320
What I prefer to show, which I'm not going to do in this slide, is disability adjusted life years.

688
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:58,570
When I look at the impact because the death is just like will be predominantly older people who are quite sick.

689
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:06,460
But if you look at a child or something and they get sick, then that stays with us through their lifetime and that deserves more weight.

690
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:10,060
And this deaths discounts that impact entirely.

691
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:16,570
Okay, so this notion of values or disability adjusted life years is an alternative presentation.

692
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:26,410
Anyway, looking at the criteria, here's a sum to the standard is 30 parts per billion.

693
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:38,680
Typical monitoring level is a fifth of that or lower even near an ISO to site, which is typically a Coke buster without much of the way of scrubbers.

694
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:43,000
And so as so too, we're working our way out of burning coal.

695
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:47,020
And if we do burn it, we typically have scrubbers that remove it.

696
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:55,870
The exception would be our friends at DC who only have one coal fired power plant that has a scrubber at the Monterey facility.

697
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:01,600
The others are scrubber lists and in process of being phased out.

698
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:10,520
And coal fired power plants are the largest emitters.

699
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,570
It's almost impossible to imagine how large these facilities are.

700
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,780
Have any of you done a tour of the power plant before?

701
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:25,160
Where'd you go? The one that's already retired off of the Detroit as the one club in Detroit.

702
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:34,340
The Rouge River? Yeah. Yeah. I was worked in the Oak Co-op and we had, like, a little tour that went through that whole plan.

703
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:37,730
Okay. And even if it was shut down. Okay.

704
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:45,499
Just cover the heights and. Okay. So that. That's a 358 megawatt facility these days.

705
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:52,960
That small, there are two or three or four times that now that that's still being built.

706
01:27:53,570 --> 01:28:03,160
And the stacks for those things you could imagine a ten meter larger than this room stack that just rises up to a thousand feet, 1200 feet.

707
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:04,750
That's what they typically are like.

708
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:18,219
And the boiler where they actually inject the coal, they pulverize the coal, typically shoot it into the the boiler of combustion.

709
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:24,530
And you have pipes above that. It's about in large facilities, roughly the size of this building.

710
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:41,249
So it's big, big stuff. Anyway, electric utilities, most of it, and probably even more now because we've gotten into low sulfur fuels for a long time,

711
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:47,400
because the sulfur produces particulate matter and we have pretty strict standards on PPM as well.

712
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:55,590
This one is using a proximity measure, looking at the population living within one mile of a coal fired power plant.

713
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:00,600
After we do the modeling bit next week, you'll see that this criteria makes very little sense.

714
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:08,480
Most of the plume is going to be well above people's heads or breathing zone if you're within a mile or so.

715
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:15,540
We'll talk about the pictures of Michigan with 30 mile radius around the power

716
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:21,030
plants before they have closed and the River Rouge and Trenton have closed.

717
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,050
Monroe Beachy doesn't want to close. It's their largest facility.

718
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,960
They have actually have four boilers there, each of them trying.

719
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:37,520
Oh, the sulfur also produces acid rain.

720
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:46,400
And in the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, this was a major challenge to figure out how to reduce the acid rain problem.

721
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:59,000
What's the challenge with acid rain, high altitude or alpine lakes with little buffering get acidified easily and the sulfur

722
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:04,130
converts to sulfate which converts to hydro sulfur hydrous sulfuric acid rather.

723
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,890
And that would acidify these ecosystems.

724
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:19,260
The compromise in the Clean Air Act amendments was to take the states, 25 states east of the Mississippi River,

725
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:28,050
allow them to trade sulfur credits among themselves and bring the target down 80%.

726
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:39,329
That was the goal. And that compromise meant that in Florida, you could buy some of these allowances,

727
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:46,860
really reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions in Florida, because maybe my Indiana or Michigan power plant can't do that.

728
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:54,780
So I basically buy those credits from Florida. Does it make any sense environmentally?

729
01:30:54,810 --> 01:31:03,150
Florida's emissions are not going to affect where acid rain problems are, which is New York State, for example, the Adirondacks.

730
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:08,130
But it made sense because it allowed this political compromise to go through.

731
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:21,210
And if any of you are, after last week, followers of politics, that was John Dingell's crowning success as a negotiator with the Clean Air Act.

732
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:32,800
Okay. Switching gears to carbon monoxide. Look at these trends way, way down and land way, way down.

733
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:36,640
What's responsible for this? Yeah.

734
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:42,190
Taking a lot of gasoline. Exactly. Why was it in there?

735
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:52,620
Sure there's an economic benefit to an enterprise. Well, it's an old story, but it's nothing booster.

736
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:58,770
Okay. So it makes your engine that's a high compression engine run.

737
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:06,149
Okay. Without having a knock. And that was actually added going back to the car companies because General Motors

738
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:10,889
wanted to have a competitive advantage over Ford with high compression engines,

739
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:14,530
but they wouldn't work unless they were able to boost the octane and adding petrol.

740
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:22,610
That was the cheapest way to do that. And carbon monoxide.

741
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:31,640
What explains that? Also car related catalytic converters.

742
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:42,020
Yes. And all the other emission controls on cars, computers, oxygen sensors, improved combustion technologies and catalytic converter,

743
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:52,879
which we call after combustion treatment group of back to the previous three or so.

744
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,460
For what? See on this. Are you having a hard time losing the negatives?

745
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:08,460
Yeah. So what this is doing is showing you the difference between the sort of nineties and the early 2000s or the late nineties.

746
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:16,800
And basically, I think it's showing you that we had large reductions in this area here of sulfate.

747
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:36,440
So the blues good. The blue is good in this case. Yeah. Although a different story here is the ozone standard at 70 parts per billion.

748
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:46,130
And the trend was, oh, I don't know, nationally, maybe about 80 2000s, maybe about 70.

749
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:55,940
Ten years later, pretty flat overall. So over this period, about a 17% decrease,

750
01:33:56,210 --> 01:34:06,860
but nothing like the success that we saw with the other pollutants and ozone is controlled by clamping down on precursors.

751
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:14,480
The precursors are NOx and hydrocarbons and it's really, really tough to do that.

752
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:24,740
Looking at ozone levels. It's regulated as the maximum eight hour average within a day.

753
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:34,220
And we can see areas where we exceed the standard in the Bay Area, on the East Coast, in the Midwest,

754
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:41,630
buried beneath these others and most of the urban areas, many of the urban areas continue to have problems with ozone.

755
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:50,420
And we are obligated under the Clean Air Act to designate whether an area achieves the standard or not.

756
01:34:50,990 --> 01:35:00,230
If it does not. It's called a non attainment area and then states are required to come up with what we call CIPS State implementation plans,

757
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:06,110
which is a legal document to say we're going to meet the standard in five years and this is how we're going to do it.

758
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:14,330
And if you look at a story of a place like Houston or Los Angeles or New York City,

759
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:20,690
they're on their fifth or sixth state implementation plan and they still don't achieve the standard.

760
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,870
Okay. It's just really, really hard.

761
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:37,280
And the economics of controlling NOx and VOCs is such that the marginal costs may be thousands of dollars per ton of you see reduced.

762
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:44,030
This is a lot of money and there's not a lot that folks think they can do.

763
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:50,810
And then with climate change, hotter temperatures and drier weather, this is also a problem.

764
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,520
It promotes the photochemistry that forms ozone.

765
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:05,140
Yeah. Her not a diva. Is it anywhere in the state that exceeds the standard or is there like an average?

766
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:11,640
This many sites, even at one site, exceeded one site's enough to do it.

767
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:19,710
But if there's not a site, then we don't know and you might not exceed it.

768
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:26,390
So here's a picture of O-zone trends updated a little bit to 2021.

769
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:32,070
Again, pretty flat. We look at the NOx emissions highway vehicles are definitely being cleaned up.

770
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:38,160
Okay. Cars and trucks, less so with some of the other sources.

771
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:48,050
And then for Voces and again, mobile sources have been cleaned up by industrial processes like refinery fuel distribution,

772
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:58,440
things like that been very hard to clamp down further. One big issue is what's controlling ozone formation.

773
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:11,400
We had believed in Southeast Michigan that it was limited by NOx and so controlling VOCs wouldn't make any difference, kind of like limiting nutrient.

774
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:22,860
Okay, we did some studies this past summer and last summer which indicate that might be wrong and in fact, it might be limited by viruses.

775
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:30,420
We're not quite sure right now. Last year was a bad ozone year.

776
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:35,719
That may push Michigan to not moderate, not attainment with moderate.

777
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:43,500
And on attainment, we might see your vehicles requiring annual or biannual inspection, which we don't have now.

778
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:50,580
And then they might focus on viruses if, in fact, this study stands up very complicated.

779
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,340
Obviously nobody wants to be and not a team.

780
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:04,270
And because of the cost, the inconvenience that's involved and I don't know if any of you are from someone from California.

781
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:06,920
Right? No. Down here. Okay.

782
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:15,200
I mean, you know, when I grew up, you just had to take your car to the inspection station to insure you still have a catalytic converter yourself.

783
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,680
Something up the tailpipe, you rev up the engine, you see that it's working properly.

784
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:21,740
We just the gas is actually as it comes out.

785
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:34,540
The American Lung Association and other organizations will rank cities based on the air pollution level, older population and so forth.

786
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:38,470
Number one, ranked worst for ozone is L.A. Long Beach.

787
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:52,720
And they're predicting lots of asthma and other aspects, other health symptoms and disease associated with ozone.

788
01:38:56,870 --> 01:39:05,910
But it's not just California, because here we have Arizona, here we have Texas, here we have the East Coast, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin.

789
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:12,510
We don't make it onto the list or for particulate matter.

790
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,800
This is again an EPA slide.

791
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:20,930
Hmm. Drives me nuts to show this. But this is a human hair.

792
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:28,040
This is a beach. Green sand. PM10 is this perfect blue sphere.

793
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:34,400
Okay. And PM to five are these little pink spheres around the otherwise perfect blue sphere?

794
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:41,420
Obviously, it's extremely heterogeneous. It doesn't look anything like a sphere, but at least it shows you how small it is.

795
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:47,690
The human hair is roughly 50 or so microns in diameter.

796
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:57,800
Okay. Or more. And the smaller PM 2.5 particles are small enough that they're going to stay suspended for a very long time.

797
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,300
So they'll stay in here, just blow around for hours or days before they settle.

798
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,890
The to five concentrations on an annual average basis are depicted here.

799
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:20,520
Relatively few places exceed the standard of 12. However, EPA is in a revision to the national air quality standards right now,

800
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:28,410
and numbers that are being discussed range from about 8 to 10 to lower the standard.

801
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:33,660
Meanwhile, the W.H.O. standard really guideline is at five.

802
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:45,180
Okay. And we're currently at 12. So if we do move down to ten or we move down to eight or five, basically everything will be another ten.

803
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:58,840
I showed you maps from Purple Air. This is a picture of some of the fires in the West.

804
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:04,270
This is a picture of a better system that we put up at in Detroit.

805
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,960
This has got the PPM sensors.

806
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:15,940
There's three of the units we're testing right now next to one of the federal reference method sites operated by the state.

807
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:22,990
And these particular sensors get assigned to ozone, carbon monoxide, NOx ppm.

808
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:33,720
And I think that's a. They just gave me a quote for 1200 dollars for one of those, I think.

809
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:40,050
So if we look at PGM levels, levels are declining as well.

810
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:47,220
The standard again at national level is 12. We're probably nationwide at around eight.

811
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:51,270
The different sources are identified here.

812
01:41:51,630 --> 01:42:00,390
Probably the biggest decrease in both stationary fuel combustion, things like boilers and power plants and then highway vehicles.

813
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:03,750
You can see this green thing is squared out there.

814
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:12,090
And the reason is because starting around 2015, 2017, actually starting earlier,

815
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:17,460
we reduced the sulfur content in the fuel around this point, which formed particles.

816
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:26,700
And then in 2017, we required diesel particulate traps or equivalent to reduce emissions from diesel vehicles.

817
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:34,590
And so that has reduced the impact of those on both highway vehicles and what we call non road and mobile sources,

818
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,720
which could be anything from tree shredders to construction equipment.

819
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:40,590
Okay.

820
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:54,840
And then again, American lung rates, the worst cities and Bakersfield, California, comes up probably in part because of a lot of windblown material.

821
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:01,080
And some of these are interesting, like Missoula could be wood smoke.

822
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:08,580
And what is very interesting with particles is how complicated it is.

823
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:25,270
I'm going to skip that. Well, maybe this is interesting. This is a e j an analysis I did or we did some years ago looking at Camden, New Jersey,

824
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:30,670
across the river from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, separated by the Delaware River.

825
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:41,139
These are lines that are showing the increase in PM concentrations associated with some point sources,

826
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:45,580
some power plants or similar types of facilities.

827
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:50,290
And you can see a couple of micrograms per cubic meter increase.

828
01:43:51,520 --> 01:44:00,790
This can be modeled by a census track and looking at truck rails and diesel and looking at buffers along

829
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:07,990
the port that would serve that particular facility to get a sense of the population that's affected.

830
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:12,760
And this being an e j analysis, we separated that by race, ethnicity.

831
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:24,190
So you could see the number of people and children living in proximity to the trucking ground or other types of geographic areas of interest.

832
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:35,270
Okay. Switching to video seas, this is showing you benzene concentrations nationwide.

833
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:53,380
Also on the decline, what's responsible for this? This is a complicated one.

834
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,700
Okay. First of all, we have lots of controls on the boxes.

835
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:06,430
And so those controls are largely to reduce levels for inhalation because many boxes like benzene are toxic.

836
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:18,010
Benzene is a carcinogen. Most of the benzene in the nineties, a thousand, the 2000 or so forth, was probably associated with gasoline.

837
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:25,060
And gasoline at that point had a roughly three or 4% benzene area because of the toxicity.

838
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:30,400
It's been reduced to less than 2% typically. So that's another piece of the story.

839
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:41,230
Have you guys heard of National Air Toxics Assessment or Data?

840
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:48,909
So this is an EPA analysis that maps risk from carcinogens under the Clean Air Act

841
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:55,630
that are haps the hazardous air pollutants and does this at census tract level.

842
01:45:56,140 --> 01:46:04,000
And so we can produce maps like this showing you where the risk is for something like benzene,

843
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,620
which causes cancer and the other hazardous air pollutants.

844
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:16,630
There's no standard. Instead, we look at the predicted lifetime excess cancer risk.

845
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:24,370
And what do we compare that to? Typically a number like one in a million or one in 100,000.

846
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:33,550
Okay. So if that predicted excess cancer risk is below that threshold, then it's de minimis risk.

847
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:37,720
Okay. If it's above that, then maybe we should be doing something about it.

848
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:48,140
That's the way the thinking goes. Okay.

849
01:46:49,130 --> 01:46:55,130
I'm going to bring it back to my boxes and arrows and linkages and things like this.

850
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,959
You can conceptualize the air pollution control system, something like this.

851
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,860
You have the sources, power plants, cars, so forth.

852
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:09,200
They produce emissions depending on their numbers, their control, technology.

853
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,920
In the atmosphere, we disperse.

854
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:19,440
There are chemical and physical transformations that occur, forming secondary pollutants like ozone.

855
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:27,739
We get concentrations in ambient air. We can measure these at discrete locations using EPA type monitors increases.

856
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:32,240
We can use sensors like the purple air. In other cases, we can use satellites.

857
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:42,050
We have those pollutants with a fate that they either come to the ground as acid rain or particle deposition,

858
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:46,910
or they may react to form ozone or other secondary plumes.

859
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:52,360
And these. At this point, we have impacts and we broadly call receptors.

860
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:56,630
This could be people. It could be plants. It could be animals.

861
01:47:56,930 --> 01:48:00,530
It could be air quality standards. It could be visibility.

862
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:04,850
How far you can see air pollutants can diminish the distance that you can see.

863
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:16,280
We take a look at these impacts and we might develop control strategies to improve health.

864
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:20,570
Reduce those impacts. Codify that legislation.

865
01:48:20,930 --> 01:48:25,490
Require the imposition of control measures on these different sources.

866
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:29,390
And then we reduce emissions as we go through this cycle again.

867
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:36,540
Okay. So this is kind of a systems approach to thinking about how to evaluate control pollutants.

868
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:42,020
The problem is this is a gigantic system, okay?

869
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:45,620
And it takes ten or 20 years to proceed through this loop.

870
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:51,260
Okay. So we're always behind the eight ball, if you will.

871
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:59,750
We're always trying to do a catch up. But it's important to recognize how how the system is quite complex as well.

872
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:09,120
Okay. So the best part of this lecture is yet to come.

873
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:14,610
Right. Which is just classification systems. I'm going to take you through this and double speed.

874
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:19,649
Okay. Because I want to get through this. We have point sources, smokestacks, things like that.

875
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:23,460
We have area sources, typically collection of smaller sources.

876
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,479
We have mobile or vehicular sources and we have fugitive sources.

877
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:36,540
These are like valves and flanges and leaks. So point source, cement facility refineries, point source.

878
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:41,309
Right. But then we have all these leaks and the SEALs gaskets.

879
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:45,240
So it's also fugitive source. And then we have diesel trucks coming up.

880
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,080
So we have a mobile source as well. Okay. Electric busses.

881
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:53,849
What kind of source is this? It's a mobile source and so on road mobile source.

882
01:49:53,850 --> 01:50:00,570
But there are electric. So I have upstream emissions from where I generated that power potentially.

883
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:06,990
And then locally I'm going to have tire wear, brake wear and so forth and I still do have emissions.

884
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:17,280
Skip this one off and I have very large sources like this upgrader operated by

885
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:22,320
Shell that takes the Canadian tar sands and sends it to Detroit and other places.

886
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:27,060
What kind of source is this? Well, it's got smokestacks, so it's point.

887
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:32,850
It's got lots of valves and flanges, although this really is a modern facility, very clamp down.

888
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:42,420
So that's small. We have mobile sources still because this is served by trains as well as trucks.

889
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:50,910
We have pipelines that lead to this and they require compressor stations and things like this periodically or intermittently along the line.

890
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:58,920
And we have routine and non-routine emissions potentially if there is an upset or an emergency.

891
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:04,980
And then we have emissions during construction start up and operating and closure phases that are going to look at it lifecycle.

892
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:12,260
You guys just want to go, you know, want to stay in your mind.

893
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:17,180
Flash Player. Sir, you go over here this far?

894
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:21,590
Yeah. I'm going to slow down and just let you go after this, okay.

895
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:32,210
Fugitive sauces are typically things that are quite small individually, that are not point or mobile.

896
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:42,530
It's pretty much other stuff. And good examples would be leaks that occur at valves or flanges or connections where pipes or.

897
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:50,770
All right. Time to go. I'll catch up with you guys next week.

898
01:51:50,900 --> 01:52:00,450
You have a good week. Rough estimation of one of those first assignments.

899
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,040
Yeah, I'm looking at them. I just need to get them all done.

900
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:13,020
My goal is next week. Okay. There's a chance it'll be sooner, but I wake fields up sometimes and.

901
01:52:13,410 --> 01:52:18,250
Yeah. It's not that good, but I need to spend a bit of time on it.

902
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:22,490
I was just hoping to. Definitely.

903
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,560
That's my goal. Thank you. Thanks for reminding me. Yeah.

904
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:35,610
Yeah. Monologues. Monologues, you know. Yeah, you're right.

905
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,940
Yeah. It is a kind of very sharp air concentration.

906
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:49,610
Okay. Which means it's a greenhouse gas, but they track it.

907
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:55,290
Why do they track it? I didn't see on the site where?

908
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:06,870
Well. So it's a really interesting situation because, as I said, as a tracer for many different purposes.

909
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:14,820
And so. It's manufactured and deliberately released.

910
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:22,770
And then it is probably an industrial byproduct from some other sources as well,

911
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:36,870
which continue to be used and I'm thinking it might be associated by product with some of the escalation facilities, but I don't know that for sure.

912
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:42,240
But it's a wonderful guest worker because it's considered nontoxic.

913
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:54,600
Okay. And so a classical thing to do is to release it in a building, for example, and then we can see how the air moves around in the building.

914
01:53:54,790 --> 01:54:08,699
Oh, okay. Yeah. And I believe it was also utilized in a very large experiment that EPA did maybe ten or 15 years ago,

915
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:12,779
where they actually added it to some power plants because they wanted to see where

916
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:17,370
the plumes were and confirm the modeling that they use so that they track it.

917
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:21,030
You said it has that very specific absorption. Yeah, it was arbitrary.

918
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,540
Yeah. So it's easy to measure relatively.

919
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:30,270
It's just, you know, it's a very sharp spectroscopic feature if you're familiar with anything like that.

920
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:36,870
Basically most molecules have like an awful spectra, you know, absorb a little bit here, a little bit there.

921
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:39,600
But this has like a really sharp line. Yeah.

922
01:54:39,690 --> 01:54:45,750
I was frustrated a lot within the last job that I was at, trying to do a full hour delay, trying to find out what the absorption was.

923
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:54,810
Yeah, the levels working at different places. So yeah, it'd be very nice at all to examine one exact point.

924
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:58,380
So that's, that's what's going on with this one.

925
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:21,420
And it is very easy to measure because it's a unique point typically when it's actually a in this environment and then calculate it with an indicator.

926
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:27,940
Yeah. I would say well I think the difference away from actually I know.

927
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:48,360
Doesn't hurt me. You know, I should have gone back to when I was last there the year before pandemic, I think.

928
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:58,620
Yeah. So I was curious if there's like, if a lot of people are independently recycling or if there's like a company in their contract.

929
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:03,180
That's a great question. Yeah, that's a really good question.

930
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:13,830
The this this facility that has like six or 7000 workers and they are amazingly organized.

931
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:24,150
Yeah. Informal. But there are chieftains kind of and and we met with some of them to be able to go on to the site and stuff like that.

932
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:28,740
And it's also very interesting because.
