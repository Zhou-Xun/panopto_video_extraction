1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,249
All right, everyone, let's get started. It's just a little bit after ten.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,100
I mean, I'm sure some people will still trickle in.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:20,040
But I just want to welcome everyone back to a new semester and welcome to nutrition in the Life Cycle.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,170
I'm really excited. I love this class. There's a lot of fun content to go through and learn about.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,630
My name is Liv Anderson. I am the lead faculty instructor for this course.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,150
I am faculty in Nutritional Sciences Department here in the School of Public Health.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,760
And like I said, I'm just excited to be here and get the course started.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,430
And so what we're going to do today, of course, is a course overview.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,059
We'll just have to have some announcements and talk about the course assignments.

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,970
There are two guys in the course.

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,680
I'll have them introduce themselves in just a second and then we're going to jump right into some lecture material, right?

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:13,799
That's what we're going to do today. And with two gases, like you just said, Zach and Rahim, and they're here today down in the front.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,900
They'll be here every day for lecture, but I'll just have them stand up and give a very brief introduction.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,520
I don't want any of that. I'm going to be back in the square and I have the Friday, the second elections.

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm a candidate. And if you're not trying to work on sustainable food.

16
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,840
In Gaza, in particular, an international interest in or difficulty.

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm happy to talk to you. I decided to leave those.

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,629
Right. Hello everyone.

19
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,370
So I am in second year here in the Department of Egyptian Sciences.

20
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,949
I will be doing the Thursday afternoon section and sensible in and some research

21
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,970
that I do is focusing on the microbiome specifically probiotics do that.

22
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:13,910
Also think U.S. Raheem Raheem will be just excellent resources for you guys throughout the semester, so lean into them whenever you need to.

23
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,659
I also want to point out this is a large class. We have almost 100 students.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,370
So we also do have a greater to help them get back assignments in a timely manner.

25
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,000
Cecelia Schmidt You won't see her, but you'll see her name on canvas.

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,639
She is a dietetic intern. She just graduated with her MPH, but she's been my grader in the past, so she does an excellent job.

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,040
She gets constructive feedback. Social just be really helpful in terms of part of the teaching.

28
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay. So I just want to go through a couple announcements while we're all here and I can articulate these to everyone out loud.

29
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:57,960
For the canvas site, we're only going to be using the section one just to streamline assignments and communication and things like that.

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,140
And then discussion section this week I did send out an announcement on Tuesday.

31
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,950
Some of you who enrolled late may not have gotten that announcement.

32
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:17,399
So I just want to make sure everyone knows that there is a case study due tomorrow at 9 a.m. It really should be a quick one.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,350
It consists of a reading and then you can either choose a reading or a podcast and then a worksheet with some questions.

34
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,830
Two of the questions are just reflection questions. You don't even have to provide an answer, a written answer if you don't want to.

35
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,900
But the purpose of this is really just to get us really thinking about a topic that will come back to you.

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:49,860
Almost every life stage, important public health issue of environmental exposures and how that affects metabolism and our nutritional status.

37
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,279
So it's due tomorrow at 9 a.m. All of the case studies you'll see in a couple of slides,

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,140
all case studies are due at 9 a.m. Thursday before the discussion section starts.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,410
So it's the same case for this. Any questions about that case study?

40
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,380
Okay. All right. So this is a public health nutrition course with the life cycle being its basis.

41
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:29,500
So we're going to talk about all the life stages starting before a human is even a human at the preconception stage.

42
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,340
So what I mean by that is thinking of those people who are of reproductive age and what does

43
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,170
their nutritional status look like and how does that affect their ability to conceive?

44
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,609
Okay, so we'll go through pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy, all the stages of childhood,

45
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,850
adolescence, adulthood, and we'll end in geriatrics, which is the older adulthood, life stage.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:05,350
And through each life stage we touch upon the general nutritional needs, nutrition related conditions, and then any relevant public health topics.

47
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,909
So many. And Wednesday are the lectures. I'll be doing the majority of the lectures,

48
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:20,430
but every month we do have a couple of guest lectures we've taken to talk about some special topics related to the life stages.

49
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,240
And then Thursday, Friday are the discussion sections.

50
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:34,980
So a typical discussion section will be a brief overview of the lectures that week and then discussion of a of a case study.

51
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,840
Right. I'm not every week has a case study, though. One of your main assignments is to develop an evidence based blog.

52
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:52,440
There'll be some sessions dedicated to working on that, and then the session right before the exams will be dedicated to a review session.

53
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,879
All right. In just term, in terms of being prepared for class, I will post lecture slides about 24 hours before the class.

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,150
So I know some of you will still like to do written notes so you can print them or they'll be available electronically.

55
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,990
And then every year I do get questions about the readings, whether they're required or not.

56
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,420
I have a couple of different types of ratings. One comes from from a textbook that's edited by Judith Brown.

57
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,270
So on canvas you'll see Brown reading. These ones are not required.

58
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,290
They're more just like supplemental knowledge for you guys.

59
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,570
But I do you know, this textbook is a really awesome foundational nutrition textbook.

60
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,480
If you're interested in nutrition, I'm just having those readings as a resource might be helpful.

61
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,870
Occasionally I'll post podcast videos, a manuscript or like a governmental report or something like that.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,150
And those are highly recommended.

63
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:02,250
They'll be like application towards the lecture material or just useful in terms of learning on top of what we learn.

64
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,780
But again, they're not required. Just highly recommended for you guys.

65
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,350
If there's one I really like, I'll mention it in class. Encourage you guys to read it.

66
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,980
All right. In terms, of course, assignments, we have a variety of types of assignments.

67
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,070
I know we all don't excel on exams the same way.

68
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,290
So there are three in-class exams that the exams are worth 30% of your grade.

69
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,660
So you have you know, you have weighted grades in other ways that you can earn earn your points.

70
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,780
But the exams are not cumulative. They're usually two or three short answers, multiple choice.

71
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,320
Then you have seven case studies throughout the semester.

72
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,850
Again, like I mentioned for this week's case study, the other case studies are all due Thursday at 9 a.m.

73
00:07:52,890 --> 00:08:03,760
Before the discussion section start. And then participation in terms of this class, I know participation post-COVID feels a little different.

74
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:14,920
So in terms of participation for this class, what I do is post a weekly reflection there called Weekly Reflections on Campus on Campus.

75
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:22,420
And they're basically a question or a prompt to either apply some of the knowledge we learned in class

76
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,140
or use as a reflection to help just retain some of the significant information that we learned in class.

77
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,660
So these are posted each week and they're due Sunday at midnight.

78
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,530
They should take like 5 to 10 minutes every week.

79
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,640
It's really just to keep you engaged with some of the material.

80
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,469
And then of course lecture and discussion section and just being in attendance and being present is really highly valued there.

81
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,230
I know everyone is not comfortable, you know, raising your hand and speaking in front of a large audience,

82
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,740
even if it's in your discussion section and just, you know, in front of 20 people.

83
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,910
So there's different ways you can be engaged. There's a lot of talk to your neighbor type of work or work in a small group, things like that.

84
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,480
All of this is really highly valued in terms of the participation.

85
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,819
All right. And then lastly is your blog post. You guys will all be writing an evidence based blog post.

86
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,940
You'll choose a topic of your own choice.

87
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,650
Of course, it has to be related to public health, nutrition and a life stage.

88
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,560
But we have several topic or several assignments you'll work on throughout the semester.

89
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:45,120
In a couple weeks there is a discussion section that's dedicated to just talking about the purpose behind the this assignment,

90
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,290
this blog post, and you know why you're doing it and what you will get out of it.

91
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:58,170
Any questions? Right.

92
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,019
Okay. This class is it's an undergrad class primarily. It's cross listed as a graduate class.

93
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,190
Though for the graduate students in here, you do have an extra assignment.

94
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,550
It's a research paper with an Associated Lightning talk.

95
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,270
You can find the details on campus and, you know, just email me with any questions that.

96
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:30,150
One less thing is that I'm in this course and as the instructor I just want to acknowledge and value that gender is not binary,

97
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:40,319
it's not female male women, man. And so I have provided a statement in the syllabus on inclusive language for this course,

98
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
and I really encourage you all to read, take some time and read through it.

99
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:54,210
And also on the canvas site, I have provided some resources available to you to read through.

100
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:05,970
These resources are just a nice starting point for health care providers or health care trainees like you guys, or trainers like me as an instructor.

101
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,470
Just to start thinking about more inclusive language we can use that represent all people.

102
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,790
So moving towards more health equity. So I really encourage you to read through that statement and some of those resources on campus.

103
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,540
Okay. Any questions? Or comments.

104
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,879
Oh, right. All right.

105
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,330
So now what I want to do is just start thinking about the term nutrition or the term food,

106
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:53,139
because nutrition and food mean a lot of different things to different people, to everyone.

107
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,830
Right. So for some, it might be part of your culture. It's really important.

108
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,499
It could be really important in terms of fitness to some.

109
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,100
It's an arts like we see here on the slide.

110
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,150
For some it's a science. For many of you, the reason why you're probably here is because you want to incorporate it into your career.

111
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,750
So what I want to start off with is thinking about this prompt.

112
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,840
Just take like 30 or 60 seconds to think about the terms food and nutrition and just

113
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,970
jotting down or just think in your head 1 to 3 things that first come to mind.

114
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,690
I want you to do this alone again, just like 30 seconds.

115
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,780
And I'm going to ask for some volunteers of what you come up with.

116
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,180
All right. I don't think we need much more time than this. Can I get a couple of volunteers?

117
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,740
What? What you came up with, what first came to mind?

118
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:55,260
Yeah, absolutely. Diet. You've had diet. First thing I thought it really was like the nutrients such as vitamins or carbohydrates that.

119
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,930
Yeah, absolutely. Nutrients make up all the food that we eat.

120
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,770
Talk about that in just a few minutes and thinking about how they affect our body.

121
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,860
Absolutely. Nutrients provide energy.

122
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,130
I want one. Yes.

123
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:36,060
Absolutely. On food access. So what kind of access to individuals are populations have to different types of food,

124
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,210
whether they're healthy or culturally appropriate types of foods.

125
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:49,870
Thank you. Hopefully, you know, these are all excellent ideas on nutrients, fad diets, energy, food, access.

126
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,100
These are all different things that can come to mind when thinking of food and nutrition.

127
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:02,110
You know, in terms of this course, we really want to think about food and nutrition and all those things play into this, right?

128
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,360
But we think about nutrition because we want to grow and we want to develop in a healthful manner.

129
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,730
But once we're grown, we need to maintain our health.

130
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,050
And so nutrition and food play a big role in terms of maintaining our health and aging in a healthy way.

131
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:27,020
Okay. Thank you guys for doing that. I like that exercise. It just kind of gets you to think about why why you're here in the first place.

132
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,689
This is a nice quote. It's really a brief quote from a former USDA director really just stating that nutrition, you know,

133
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:42,590
if we modified nutrition, it could affect our health either in a positive or a negative way.

134
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:50,870
And not only thinking about that, but a term social determinants of health.

135
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,809
You know, some of your public health students may be familiar with that, but some are not public health students.

136
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:05,270
But social determinants of health are basically these social factors that can really affect your health and your health outcomes.

137
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:13,730
And so there's social factors, you know, related to nutrition, like thinking about access to food.

138
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,540
So where do you live or what's your income and how does that play a role in access to healthy food?

139
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm thinking another social determinant of health could be your knowledge base.

140
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,330
You know what type of knowledge you have and about food and healthy food or how to how to eat well to support your health.

141
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:43,180
And I guess I already said that's your income. Thinking about affordability, not only access, what affordability is a type of access to food as well.

142
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,190
So those are just examples. We'll keep coming back to this term social determinants of health and how it's related to nutrition.

143
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,719
Okay. So today we have a couple of objectives.

144
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,459
We're just going to define healthy diet. Very briefly, we'll talk about nutrients.

145
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,890
There's six classes of them I want to touch upon. And then again, not everyone is a public health student.

146
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,020
So we are just going to talk about what the field of public health is, what it stands for,

147
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:23,460
and then we'll get into an example of a public health issue that in terms of over nutrition or and under nutrition and how it can affect health.

148
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,920
All right. So this slide is really like a good basis or foundation for this course.

149
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,080
When you think about eating and why you eat, it's not just because food tastes good.

150
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,870
There's a lot of physiological reasoning behind eating food and thinking about nutrients.

151
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,499
And so we really eat to support the life cycle. Right.

152
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,180
We aim to support healthy reproduction, growth and development.

153
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,440
Our cells need nutrients to be healthy. And just to support bodily processes.

154
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,150
So like metabolism, we're all sitting here and we're able to function and seem to sit up straight.

155
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,130
Right. Because of the nutrients and the energy that we have.

156
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,450
All right. So this is just a definition, a very broad definition of what a healthy diet is.

157
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:27,800
So if you read through this and I ask you to define a healthy diet on your own, you could probably come up with something very similar to this.

158
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,110
I do want to point out, though,

159
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:41,690
that there are specific tools and metrics designed by researchers or the government that can help measure the quality of diet up a diet.

160
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,550
So, for example, say you fill out a questionnaire of what you eat and it turns out you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.

161
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:56,050
So that would be that would be more indicative of a healthier diet.

162
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:09,130
Okay. So bolded on this slide. Our six classes of nutrients.

163
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,790
So the first three carbs, lipids and proteins, these are called macronutrients.

164
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,840
So Macronutrients, you need to take in in larger amounts.

165
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,700
So usually grams per day. And they provide energy so they have calories in basically.

166
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:39,959
Right. And then micronutrients, vitamins and minerals, they play a big role in supporting metabolism, healthy.

167
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,860
So cellular environments, just different bodily processes.

168
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,860
And then water.

169
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:55,770
So water makes up about 60% of the adult body weight because it makes up so much of the body weight and does have a quite a few important roles.

170
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:03,040
I'll talk about these in just a couple of slides. This next slide is basically the same slide as last.

171
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,540
It just has a depiction of the different percent of the body weight that these different nutrients make up.

172
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,600
And I'll just point out, this is an adult male.

173
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:24,310
So very slightly, these percentages go up and down a little bit, just depending if we're talking about like a child or a female body, for example.

174
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,049
Okay. Any questions? Because I'm going to go through each of these nutrients in just a teeny bit more detail

175
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,420
because I just want to make sure we all have like a basic understanding of these.

176
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,530
Okay. All right. So we'll start with carbohydrates.

177
00:20:52,610 --> 00:21:00,110
Carbohydrates are. So here is a very simplified molecular structure of a carbohydrate.

178
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,580
They're actually made of single sugar units, bonded together.

179
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,700
And so there are these long chains of single sugar units. So, for example, this is a single sugar unit.

180
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,290
This is a single sugar unit. And right here, there's bonded together.

181
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:25,400
Right. So glucose, for example, is a single sugar unit, oftentimes bonded together to make these carbohydrates.

182
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,830
Carbohydrates are the prominent source of energy in our body.

183
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:40,210
There are some organs, for example, that prefer or need carbohydrates for its use.

184
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:48,579
So, for example, the fetus that we'll talk much about in just a couple of weeks really prefers

185
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,300
carbohydrates as its main energy source from the parent that is carrying that child.

186
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,820
We can define different types of car based foods in many different ways.

187
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,329
One example I want to go through is unrefined versus refined, and I have an example in the next slide.

188
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:13,120
But when I say unrefined, we can almost think of it as like untouched, unrefined equals untouched.

189
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,520
Right. So this is a carbohydrate based food that's really in a natural state.

190
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:27,990
And then refined means that a carbohydrate based food has gone through some sort of refinement process.

191
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,140
And the purpose of doing that is typically to either give it a longer shelf life.

192
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:43,010
Or to change its palatability. So what I mean by that is make it like a more tasty type of product.

193
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,440
Okay. And an example of this that I have here is a whole.

194
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:58,910
So in its unrefined form, it have these three layers of brand endosperm and germ.

195
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,570
And as you read through this slide, you can see in each of these layers there's different nutrients, right?

196
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:14,840
Like iron and zinc, good fats like poly unsaturated fats, different B vitamins, protein.

197
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,080
Okay. But when it goes through a refinement process, we strip away some of these layers.

198
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,489
And what you're left with is just the endosperm, which still has nutrients.

199
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,820
Right. But not as many nutrients of the brand.

200
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,010
And the germ were still there. Right. So it's a much less nutrient dense product.

201
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,470
Okay. So this is just an example. There's you know, there's a lot of different types of carbohydrate foods,

202
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,110
lots of different types of carbohydrates that can have different effects on your body.

203
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,470
Any questions on that? Okay.

204
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:08,570
The next one I want to talk about are proteins and just like carbohydrates that are made up of the single sugar units.

205
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,590
Proteins are made up of these single amino acids.

206
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,600
Again, this dotted line here would be representative of where they are bonded together.

207
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,980
Okay. And so I want to talk through this here.

208
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,210
Actually, I think I'll just go to the next slide because it's a little bit bigger.

209
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,840
So we have proteins in the food that we eat.

210
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,950
Right. And so these proteins are made of these single amino acids bonded together.

211
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:47,100
So here these dietary proteins and these little blocks are representative of the amino acids.

212
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:54,480
Once we eat those proteins in our food and our diet, when these proteins are in our digestive tract,

213
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,139
we actually start to break these proteins down in the stomach,

214
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:05,430
in the small intestine, and we break them down to these single amino acid units that we can see here.

215
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,670
Okay. So they're either single amino acid units or they're very small proteins, like two amino acids bonded together.

216
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:21,260
But once they're broken down in that state, in our small intestine or in our digestive tract, we actually absorb them into our blood.

217
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,310
And so in our blood, we have what we call this amino acid pool.

218
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,920
Right. And then in our body, our body actually makes its own proteins.

219
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,980
And these proteins are in the form of hormones, transporters, enzymes, immune factors.

220
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:45,200
And they have structural support like being our skin, having our skin structurally sound.

221
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,880
So they have a lot of different functions in our bodies. Okay.

222
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:58,430
So this might be a new concept for some. Does anyone have any questions or need me to repeat anything?

223
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:08,620
Clarify anything. All right.

224
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:16,330
And then the last macronutrient are lipids. I think the only thing I really want to point out here is this third bullet point

225
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,010
is that there's just a lot of different types of weapons that we find in our diet.

226
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,120
And I know you guys are familiar with these saturated fatty acids,

227
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:31,750
unsaturated fatty acids like mono unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol.

228
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:41,120
Again, they all have different effects on our body. Okay.

229
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:49,360
So then the micronutrients, the vitamins and minerals, again, help in terms of different body processes like metabolism.

230
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,389
And there's some vitamins and minerals we're going to keep coming back to again and again to pretty much each life stage.

231
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:03,920
So like calcium and phosphorus play such an important role in bone mass accumulation and then the maintenance of our bones,

232
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,589
which is important in every single life stage. So we'll really hone in on calcium.

233
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:16,070
We talk about iron a lot, very important in terms of our body functioning.

234
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,989
And then I really like this. You can just Google mineral different minerals in your body or something like that.

235
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:31,990
And this thing, this figure will come up and there's just a lot of things and just a lot of like trace minerals that you never even think about,

236
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,830
right, that are in in our body and have different functions.

237
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:42,660
So you can just look at that and review it. Okay.

238
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:50,550
And then the last nutrient, which is water, again, makes up a big portion of our body weight.

239
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:57,540
We do not store water. We have to replenish what we excrete on a daily basis, but it has a lot of functions.

240
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,610
It's a lubricant. So like sort of like a cushion for our joints.

241
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,049
The majority of the make up of the blood is water.

242
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,670
So it plays a big role in transporting nutrients, for example, throughout our body.

243
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,350
Water holds heat. So it helps in terms of regulating body temperature.

244
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:26,590
So when you think about when we exercise and we sweat and we release water, we're releasing heat to try to cool off our body.

245
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,790
It's part of cells and of course, it's part of feces and urine.

246
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,420
So it helps in terms of getting rid of waste in our body.

247
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:47,260
And then I put this picture on here just as a reminder that, of course, the majority of the water we get is through liquids that we drink.

248
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,920
But water is also found in a lot of different food sources as well, especially like fruits and vegetables.

249
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:07,780
Okay. Any questions? Because I am going to switch gears from talking about nutrients to starting to talk about public health.

250
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:16,420
And public health issues. Okay.

251
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:26,120
Oh, great. So this is a big slide with a lot of text on it.

252
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,540
And I'm actually going to read through this slide just to articulate it.

253
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,220
This is the definition of public health and the School of Public Health's website.

254
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,230
But public health basically is just concerned with the health of populations.

255
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:48,410
And these can be as small as neighborhoods, local communities to a whole region of the world, right to as large as that.

256
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,799
And so I'm just going to breeze through this definition, but simply define public health.

257
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,820
It's about promoting health, preventing disease, protecting populations.

258
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,790
It addresses core issues of the human condition.

259
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:11,530
So disparities, global community, access to health care, human behavior policies, cultural determinants of disease, genetics, nutrition, environment.

260
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,769
Okay. So we see that nutrition is on there, but of course,

261
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:22,550
nutrition is interleaved with a lot of these things like policy, human behavior, cultural determinants of health.

262
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,980
So you can see how nutrition just plays a big role in terms of public health or population health.

263
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,180
Okay. So throughout the semester we're going to discuss nutrition related conditions in the context of a public health issue.

264
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:46,139
And so some of you may have been introduced to this to this before, but when we think through a public health issue,

265
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,440
we we have to ask ourselves three questions which are on this slide.

266
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,580
The first is asking, is it prevalent? Right. So is this public health issue?

267
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,080
What's the frequency of it? Is it widespread? Is it increasing?

268
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,460
Is it serious? Okay. So do people die from it?

269
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,740
Is there a daily loss of just activities of daily living?

270
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,270
Does it affect society too? So in terms of seriousness, it can be related to health, but also economic consequences as well.

271
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,160
And then less thinking of whether it's preventable or treatable.

272
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:35,860
So policies, programs, education, how could they play a role in terms of prevention or treating, whatever a public health issue may be?

273
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:46,190
Okay. So I want to pose the question to you guys just so we can all get some examples of what a public health issue means.

274
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,210
Many examples. But the flood water crisis.

275
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,010
The Flint water crisis. Absolutely. Yup.

276
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,210
I put insulin. Cost of insulin?

277
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,010
Absolutely. Yes. And that's related to things like type two diabetes, a chronic condition.

278
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,670
Yeah. Opioid epidemic.

279
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,980
It was a really good variety of answers. What about what?

280
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:43,070
Where we all were in math or science or. COVID.

281
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,600
Right. COVID is an example. Excellent.

282
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:53,240
So there's you know, there's a variety of things that we consider public health issues,

283
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:59,090
whether it's like chronic disease, but also like gun control or car accidents.

284
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,120
Right. These are all issues that affect the health of our population.

285
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:16,219
And I'm going to go through an example of the increasing rates of individuals

286
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,690
having obesity in our country as a public health issue on the next slide.

287
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:30,250
But first, I just want to sort of come back to this this thinking about nutrients and having the

288
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,850
the balance of the right amount of nutrients in our body is important for our health.

289
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:46,280
Right. And of course, we all have these minimal are these little imbalances on a daily basis,

290
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,020
but our body can do a really good job at counteracting these small imbalances.

291
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:57,830
So, for example, if you're not taking enough of a certain nutrient like cholesterol, I'll give this example.

292
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:05,690
If you're not getting enough cholesterol through your diet, your body can actually internally make enough cholesterol to make up for that imbalance.

293
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,260
Okay. That's not the case for every nutrient. For some nutrients.

294
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,730
That's how our body can deal with that.

295
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:22,250
So it's when an imbalance of nutrients becomes really severe, either an excess or a deficiency is when we start to see health problems arise.

296
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:29,690
So this nutrient homeostasis is just thinking of having, you know, the right balance of nutrients to support our health.

297
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,389
Now when they become imbalanced, things can get affected in our body.

298
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:40,490
And these are just some examples here. Like blood pressure, blood sugar levels.

299
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,420
Right. That can lead to something called type two diabetes.

300
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:52,370
Body temperature, hormone status. And then energy stores, which is actually what we're going to to Hank,

301
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,580
we're going to hang on to this idea of an imbalance in energy stores and use that as an example of a public health issue.

302
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:12,300
Hey. And we're first go to think of it in terms of overnutrition leading to an overweight or obesity status.

303
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:25,470
Okay. So this is a map, a heat map of the United States showing the different percentage of U.S. adults having obesity in the different states.

304
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:35,639
And so as you look at the map closer, you'll see that except for D.C., all states are yellow,

305
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:46,650
the yellow or above or get into the red zone, meaning that there's no state that has less than 25% of their adult population.

306
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:57,560
Let's see. How am I saying this? None. All states have 25% or more of their adult population have obesity.

307
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:04,190
Right. So when we go back to ask ourselves these three questions about is this a public health issue?

308
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,060
Is it prevalent? Yes. And is it increasing?

309
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,870
Yes, we'll see that it's increasing. Is it serious?

310
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:19,010
Of course so. Not for everyone, but for many people who have excess body fat.

311
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:26,170
This can lead to conditions like chronic disease, conditions like type two diabetes or hypertension, high blood pressure.

312
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,550
Preventable or and there's economic consequences as well.

313
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:36,690
So like the direct consequences of having to take care of some of these conditions, like blood pressure or type two diabetes.

314
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:47,250
Over there, someone stated that the cost of insulin is a public health issue and then prevented prevention or treatable.

315
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:55,230
There are definitely ways in which we can prevent or treat under or overnutrition.

316
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:04,809
Sorry, getting ahead of myself over nutrition, physical activity, thinking about our diets and things like that.

317
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:13,210
And then knowledge, just knowledge, education about healthy foods and and things like that and physical activity.

318
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,940
Policies like school lunch programs to help children.

319
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:27,540
Different targeted audiences. To keep an eye on the time that clock is not working.

320
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:36,030
Okay. So this this figure here is showing on the x axis is year.

321
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,710
And we see and then the y axis is the percent prevalence of adults who have obesity in the US.

322
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:51,270
And so what we're seeing here where I have this arrow is that around 1980 there's a extreme

323
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,720
to see a really sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity status in the United States.

324
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:10,200
So I just want to ask you guys around 1980. What do you think was starting to happen in the US to see this shift in the prevalence of this?

325
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,260
Yeah. Absolutely surpass fast food could be a contributor.

326
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,790
Before 1980, the only option really was McDonald's.

327
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,450
And then after that, you know, there's a whole bunch of different chains opening up.

328
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,530
Nowadays, you know, we have access to any type of not only fast food, but regular restaurants as.

329
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,640
Any other ideas? Yeah.

330
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:54,309
Yeah, absolutely. Portion sizes, the size of like fast food restaurants, the size of drink cups, things like that.

331
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,750
But just in general, in restaurants, the portion sizes. I can say more positive.

332
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,210
Yeah, absolutely. The processing of foods.

333
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:21,550
So there is a correlation to high fructose corn sirup being incorporated into foods as an example and this increase in prevalence.

334
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:34,100
Anything else? Any other ideas? No breaking news.

335
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,110
Good question. Either you want to look that up, we'll look that up and we'll get back to you.

336
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:56,520
I don't know. Who question them. Yeah. Um, maybe like, lifestyle choices or, like the way, like, one interacts with.

337
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:03,460
They're a community. Living in an urban environment, it is more industrialized added to.

338
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,960
Ideas of working. Yeah.

339
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,870
I mean, so many thoughts came to my mind when you when when you gave that answer.

340
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,030
But one thing that really I'm connecting with there is the environment that you live in,

341
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:30,870
because this is part of the case study and what you're exposed to in a more industrialized environment like pollution or chemical,

342
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,190
different types of chemicals.

343
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:39,719
And that's what you'll be reading about, you know, having these exposures and how they interact with adequate genesis, right?

344
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:51,840
So that the development of your fat cells or the accumulation of your fat cells and how they just affect metabolism can affect metabolism in general.

345
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,720
But also other things that came to mind is just how you interact with the environment.

346
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:06,600
So things like being more sedentary, commute time, having longer commutes,

347
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:16,950
starting to working parents in the household versus one right, adding to more sedentary jobs, more sedentary time throughout the day.

348
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:24,270
Another thing I want to add here. I just lost it.

349
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:33,670
The other thing I want to add is our TVs. Around 1980, we're starting to see TVs in absolutely every household, basically.

350
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,670
Right. Video games, the invention of the Internet in 1998.

351
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,580
These are all things contributing to the increase in prevalence.

352
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,890
So you find any answer? Yeah. So around 1980,

353
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,200
then President Reagan wanted to change the way that food stamps were delivered to

354
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:01,150
households by increasing the amount of income that was allowable or not allowable.

355
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,870
So let's say like a household made like $30,000 a year.

356
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,860
And they would originally be eligible for food stamps or.

357
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,870
President Reagan wanted to increase that threshold to like, say,

358
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:23,260
$40,000 or fewer households to be able to qualify and then be able to have access to different foods that would be supplemented.

359
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,390
You think you get. Is the program. Okay? I think I went through.

360
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:35,060
Yeah. Yep. So I think related to that income level and food stamps provide it to that.

361
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,229
Great. Awesome. Thank you, guys. I really just wanted to get sort of a more in-depth understanding of contributors to this increase in prevalence.

362
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:52,750
But studies after studies, what they show in terms of association, the increase in overweight status is, of course, your dietary intake,

363
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:01,060
lack of physical activity, lack of sleep, environmental exposures, which is a newer field in probably the past decade or so.

364
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,720
But really thinking about these chemicals are exposed to and how they can interact with our body,

365
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:14,530
our bodily processes and then the the more sedentary type jobs and commute times.

366
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:25,580
All right. One last thing. We have about five more minutes. I just want to talk on the other end of the spectrum, which is undernutrition.

367
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,010
And so this is a really powerful example. It's a condition called quasi orca.

368
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,160
It's a really powerful example to see how important certain nutrients are in our body.

369
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:46,700
And so what quasi worker is, we typically find it in populations where a staple food is like a vegetable.

370
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:55,940
When you're exposed to mainly like vegetables, for example, you actually will miss out on getting.

371
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:06,440
All the amino acids that you need to support the to the the development of your own proteins in your body.

372
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,460
Okay. So kwashiorkor is a protein deficiency.

373
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,780
Even though these people might be getting adequate calorie intake.

374
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:25,190
So what happens then? You're missing amino acids in this amino acid pool and your body can't build a certain proteins.

375
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:31,760
Okay. In this case, the classic sign is this descended distended abdomen here.

376
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:38,360
And it's due to the lack of transporters, transporter proteins in our body.

377
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:46,520
Okay, so one thing is that fats actually start to build up in your liver and the appropriate

378
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,690
transporters to get those fats out of the liver to move them throughout the body.

379
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,800
Those transporters are missing. So fats accumulating in your liver.

380
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:02,500
That's one contribution to this distended abdomen. Another is the build up of water in the abdomen as well.

381
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,990
Again, it's a lack of transporter of water, a transporter that transports water.

382
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,950
We also see water accumulation in the cheeks, the ankles, wrists as well.

383
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:22,240
And then you'll oftentimes people experiencing kwashiorkor also have flaky skin.

384
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,830
So there's lack of these structural proteins as well. Okay.

385
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:43,970
Any questions? Yeah, absolutely.

386
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,240
So two reasonings for this.

387
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:58,540
The the main reason is because they don't have the appropriate amino acids to make certain transporters that can transport water in certain places.

388
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:04,689
So that's one. The other is that fagots start in your liver and certain transporters and

389
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:10,870
transport them out so that actually fat gets stuck in the liver and that fat.

390
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:19,120
That contributes to the system that. Yup.

391
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,810
How you treat the condition. It would have to be through the diet. So the amino acids.

392
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Would have to be provided to those individuals. Any other questions?

393
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,629
All right, guys, we'll say welcome back. Thank you. I have a key point slide.

394
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:51,050
And then just reminder, the case studies do and then there is a weekly participation this week as well, due Sunday at midnight.

395
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,770
I'll see you guys on Monday and have fun in your discussion sections.
