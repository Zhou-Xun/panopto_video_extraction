1
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:11,649
I love the ABC and then it's the war, but it's all it is.

2
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:17,749
Just like living in Santa monica between Inara.

3
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,289
Yeah. Are you guys from Michigan? North Carolina.

4
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,539
North Carolina. How do you spell that? Super Hornets.

5
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,339
Oh, even better. God, you.

6
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,429
I am from Oklahoma. Yeah, I'm grad school.

7
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:39,109
Yeah, very critical. Michigan is so small and top ten school.

8
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,069
You know what I was like? I mean, I applied to a lot, especially, you know,

9
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:52,188
but it was like I immediately cut out for California and New York because of the cost of living room and cell phone is nice,

10
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:55,879
but oh yeah, I plan to like other places.

11
00:00:56,419 --> 00:01:00,169
And just so I got it and I was very fortunate.

12
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:04,729
I got some, you know, good offers and loans. You know, I think the schools can get loans again.

13
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,139
Michigan has a good cost of living compared to other places.

14
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,079
And, you know, they have a good program here and they have the same tuition as like public university.

15
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,469
Right. You know, everything that's going on for everyone.

16
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:25,039
Right. We'll get started shortly.

17
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,039
I do want to preface this one thing. Um. Sorry.

18
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:35,219
I was trying hard. Oh, my apologies for being late.

19
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,239
I'm a commuting student, so I live our way. Plus, I just circled around this campus for 30 minutes from a park.

20
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,649
So I promise you, I'm here.

21
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:51,689
You know, I was here at 935. You're on time. But again, that's.

22
00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:00,689
That's right on time. Just the. My to do what's right and what's wrong.

23
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:14,089
You actually actually, it's important cause I mean, I'm I'm just like I'm just like, jumping and, of course, introductions over here.

24
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,659
You see what you mean? Alicia Oh, yes. Oh, my God. I do that all of our country and everything.

25
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:26,449
And I, of course, I mean, remains in the in industry.

26
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:36,379
I guess I try I try to memorize lines that they cross and I think Rosa Parks or or which of my programs, general events.

27
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:47,308
So this is my second chance. Certainly, I would say there's key is what we had in my last year.

28
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:50,809
Yeah. Which is fine.

29
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,699
But yeah that was something so much good. I like new people.

30
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:06,079
First year since I'm happy, which was exciting and I don't do anything for all.

31
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:11,749
Yeah. So some serious to see.

32
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:17,749
Like in my professional development class. I get to ask them like, oh, this work.

33
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:24,719
Oh, okay. Yeah. Internships are very flexible.

34
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:30,489
Okay. Especially since you're doing. You're the general. Yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,969
I'm excited to make a person. That's what you do, that you're very close.

36
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:43,429
Everything. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right?

37
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,289
No. It's a turning point, right?

38
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,749
So I've been a student. I've never been a teacher in person. So you try the smaller screen.

39
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,089
This is too much for a Friday night.

40
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:22,689
It's maybe similar to the classroom. Oh, I'm just going to pray and spread it.

41
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,439
Oh, it meant a noise that didn't sound like it happened.

42
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:35,599
It's. Oh, no, you ow!

43
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:49,049
Doing the things I love. And this is where I step away from the fact that I got it.

44
00:04:49,469 --> 00:05:01,369
You start to think. You here. But yeah, this is just one step by a that works.

45
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:06,937
So that was true. How many.

46
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,327
How many epidemiologists does it take to turn on a computer?

47
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:29,967
Thank you so much. I'm going to edit this up. To know.

48
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:53,547
All right. So, good morning, everyone. Sorry about the first 5 minutes of class, but my name is Brian Higgs.

49
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,927
I'll be your GSI.

50
00:05:55,347 --> 00:06:02,817
For those of you who have to hear this again, I'm so sorry, but as I told the students who were here earlier, I am a community student.

51
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:07,707
I live an hour away. Um, what? I, you know, the parking situation.

52
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:11,217
So if I'm ever running a little bit behind, I do apologize in advance.

53
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,727
Um, I'll try to make an announcement if that's the case. Also, um, cover so far away.

54
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:29,787
Please kind of stand by one of those things that you anticipate snow because we might go virtual, but you'll know that soon in advance.

55
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:36,747
Welcome to Public Health. 513 We go on Policy Section seven.

56
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:41,397
I believe I have nine of you. Last time I checked for five.

57
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:45,777
Perfect. Everybody's here. So for today.

58
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:55,887
So this is your professor. Dr. Kennedy sent me here to say hi.

59
00:06:56,217 --> 00:07:02,217
I have office hours right after you are not five. 50% of the exam has to be intense.

60
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:08,937
And greetings. My most experienced instructor.

61
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:12,037
But they wouldn't believe that if you just saw. No, no, no, no.

62
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:25,167
We got it working, so we're very excited. You can barely know your friend, but enjoy your nice little comfy classroom from this experience and.

63
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:29,606
All right, take care. Have a great weekend. All right.

64
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:34,257
So today's agenda will be GSI before introduction.

65
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:40,767
So the introduction, overview of class policy, lab, group assignments, questions, all that fun stuff.

66
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:50,947
So I go back and forth between the slides. So for those of you who were not here on Monday, if you are sorry, this is repetitive.

67
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:57,157
But as previously mentioned, my name is Grant Hicks. I would be the DCI for section four and seven.

68
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:01,537
Quick background about me. Born and raised here in Michigan.

69
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,727
If you're familiar with the area from southeast Michigan,

70
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:10,387
graduated from Howard University undergrad with my bachelor's of sports medicine, something I'm not using.

71
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:17,137
And currently I am a dual agent and major three candidate in my last and final year.

72
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:24,147
Getting my master's in health behavior and health education, as well as health management and policy.

73
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:32,907
Previously, during my internship, I spent time as a health care consultant at Deloitte as well as this past summer.

74
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:38,817
I interned at UnitedHealth Group, specifically UnitedHealthcare in the Medicaid department.

75
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:47,037
Quick little fun fact about me is that I've taken this class three times or encountered this class three times.

76
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:56,907
First one as my time as an AT&T student in your shoes trying to understand this class and last year teaching it for the first time.

77
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,997
So please, any concerns? Confusion from a student perspective.

78
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:08,666
I did it. And I'm here to be the voice of reason between you to make sure that you get the best learning experience out of this,

79
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:18,537
but also to make it easier for students to grasp the material that you're going to be learning during this time and have so many interests.

80
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:25,017
But I'm primarily interested in solutions that drive equitable and sustainable health care in underserved communities,

81
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:30,387
both domestically and internationally. So background about these pictures.

82
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:36,987
I was an undergrad and I got to study like traditional Chinese medicine in China.

83
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:42,867
I'm in there and that kind of really opened my eyes to, you know, being American.

84
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:48,387
We think about what is the best. And when I was over there, I was like, What?

85
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:52,707
You operate completely different than anything I've ever seen, you know?

86
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:59,787
So I'm from that get that kind of why did a fire in me, you know, understand the health care system,

87
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:11,817
but also look at other international health care systems that kind of compare to using that utilize the American system, but maybe to a better degree.

88
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:16,647
So I always like valuable learning opportunities and that also there are some health

89
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:19,947
care classes if you're interested in global health abroad that you can take.

90
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:21,657
I can talk about that later.

91
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:31,747
But regarding introductions, um, I know you bit like a soft introduction, but for my sake, please state your name pronouns, um,

92
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:40,827
and briefly what you're hoping to learn from this class topics you're interested in, career you intend to pursue post-graduation or internship.

93
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:46,497
One thing I forgot to mention is during those two times that I had the class in virtual,

94
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:52,677
so being in person is a little bit new to me in terms of teaching this style.

95
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:57,297
But, um, just bear with me. But hey, cold calling.

96
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:02,067
So if anyone would like to start off first with introductions, by all means.

97
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:11,557
My name is Nicholas Hoult. Sure, he m Department of General Epidemiology.

98
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:20,577
I'm hoping to learn what goes into making health policy in this class, and I intend to pursue a career in epidemiology.

99
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:31,377
I'm Eric. I'm in general AP hoping to get from this class just kind of be more well-rounded because I don't know anything about health policy, really.

100
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:40,466
And then after this, I have health department experience. So just something that related in the health department and she and she,

101
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:48,846
her hers and the general epidemiology and have no systematic background in policy with health care systems.

102
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:54,957
So I want to know more and should lay some ecclesiology and those expenditures on quality.

103
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:01,437
And let's move on from the nutrition sciences.

104
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:11,277
And I also don't have any knowledge about obviously in this country after graduation.

105
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:15,227
I am happy to look into it.

106
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:24,917
Hi, my name is Allison. She her pronouns and I to go back to the origin.

107
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:37,586
So in terms of my experience, most my experience, especially with systemic systems, is there are places abroad over to Madagascar.

108
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:42,867
For two years I've written Tanzania and Zanzibar, and this summer I did my internship in Ghana.

109
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:50,267
So yeah, I really empathize with everything you said and what you did was so cool.

110
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:58,877
That's amazing. I want to hear more about that. I did work in Tulsa and social services with public housing for a year and yeah,

111
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:05,607
so I worked adjacent with how systems work and how that can really impact people's lives.

112
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,327
And so I'm really interested to learn more about systems in that way as well.

113
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:16,587
My career intentions are that currently is to graduate and to work in the field.

114
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:24,207
Yeah I'm actually she her pronouns general epidemiology.

115
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:33,656
I'm hoping to just learn more about policy from this class because I currently don't know that much about it and the career I tend to pursue.

116
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:43,497
So I currently work as a project manager at Henry for Health, so I'm hoping to move into epidemiology and a few so more of like the science of it.

117
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,637
But yeah. My name is Lisa.

118
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:52,407
I'm a first year student. My pronouns are sheepherders.

119
00:13:54,237 --> 00:14:03,717
When it comes to my experience with policy, I really don't have much a health care like health care systems class in undergrad,

120
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:08,337
but it's like that was just all like above me. It kind of just like, survived in that course.

121
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:15,627
So excited to learn more about policy when it comes to what I want to pursue after graduation.

122
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,017
Um, I love environmental health sciences.

123
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:30,297
Like epidemiology will just kind of like assist me to go more of that role, but I'm truly not sure where I want to go with my degree.

124
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:40,516
So looking forward to working with that person. I'm an investor, a shareholder, and I have an allegiance.

125
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:46,487
While I don't have a very strong background in policy like a lot of other people look at it.

126
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:54,347
So I'm looking to sort of understand that a little bit more and how we can translate scientific knowledge to policy guidelines.

127
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:59,417
I'm interested in one health and occupational health,

128
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:06,297
and those are kind of like disparate sometimes goals that I'm not entirely sure what career I want to intend.

129
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:14,447
I want to pursue if it changes quickly. And I feel like I know things like government work or consulting or a whole bunch of different options.

130
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:21,647
Hi, my name is Courtney Monroe. I'm up for another exam is I am also an early student.

131
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:26,897
Um, I really want to learn more about advocacy through policy and this course.

132
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:34,617
We don't have much experience also, and I really look forward to research and the career.

133
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:42,447
I really like his regime. I'd rather see her as a member of the department.

134
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,167
I just want to learn more about foreign policy as well as do my internship in Nicaragua.

135
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:52,167
And like you said, like the health system down there was like completely different than how they do things here.

136
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:57,777
After my degree, I hope to pursue a fellowship or just start.

137
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:07,337
Nice to meet you all. It's really different because before I could see your names on Zoom and learn on commitment.

138
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:12,657
So bear with me as I try to memorize those over the course of time.

139
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:18,777
But I really want to go beyond the aspect of just being your neophyte instructor.

140
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:24,057
I've been here for a minute trying to wrap it up, but nonetheless been here for three years,

141
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:29,516
has a lot of knowledge that I've accumulated or internship postings,

142
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:35,187
anything that I've come across that you might not have necessarily seen advertised in your department.

143
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:42,487
And maybe you came through in my department, and I would love to share those with you as you embark on your career journey.

144
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:45,877
So leave anything. Don't hesitate to ask.

145
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:59,907
Getting into more class, specific specifics and general expectations, or when you're emailing me to get a faster response.

146
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:04,337
Public Health 513. Section 7007.

147
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:10,317
Put that in that subject line and expect 24 to 48 hours for response also.

148
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:17,427
Um. No, I do have kind of full reign of class some that I do have to run by Professor Kennedy.

149
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:26,097
So if you want to go ahead and see her in that email as well, I respond or should respond based on whatever request,

150
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:32,397
request or clarification you need via email related to class.

151
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:36,177
We're going to use the discussion board for general questions.

152
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:42,477
And as far as policy lab, please come to policy lab prepared and on time.

153
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:50,357
So. Dollar General discussion policy lab expectations.

154
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:54,387
How will be respectful for you to each other during our discussions?

155
00:17:55,227 --> 00:18:01,527
Really giving some background about what policy that is. It's your chance.

156
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:06,867
As you said, many of you come from occupational health, environmental sciences, nutrition, epidemiology, so forth.

157
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:20,487
This is your chance to really step outside that epidemiologist hat and channel your inner public health official decision policy maker.

158
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:22,647
That's what you'll be stepping into.

159
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:30,687
More specifically in the policy lab, as we go over the cases that you're going to assign to read that are going to happen.

160
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,347
That I'm going to talk about later during the class.

161
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:39,717
So with that being said and just kind of like a general overview of class, it's not set in stone,

162
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:48,057
but to give you some understanding of what will happen, that starts at 10 a.m. We go to 1120 because in Michigan we're not 1130.

163
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:53,187
Sometimes we're in a little bit early. Don't count on it. Some cases start.

164
00:18:53,547 --> 00:19:01,497
Some cases take longer than others. So ideally, class starts at ten and it will make more sense as I progressed through the sides.

165
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:07,847
But classes start at ten between ten, uh, 10:00 and 1020.

166
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:17,307
This is where I will go over the slide kind of recap anything or frequently asked questions that came up in Monday's discussion.

167
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:21,777
I'll go over that and prep you for the next case. For your case.

168
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,847
You'll have between 40 to 50 minutes.

169
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:31,167
So basically if you're quantifying it 1022 1105, you're going to have that time to work in your groups on your case.

170
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:37,737
And then 1105 to 1124 or however long it takes, that'll be your discussion and they will come through.

171
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:45,177
So with that being said, because this is very discussion based, some cases are controversial, some cases are sensitive.

172
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:51,657
But I personally feel like you don't necessarily excuse me.

173
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:56,307
You learn the best when sometimes you learn from others perspective.

174
00:19:57,057 --> 00:20:01,517
And just understanding that others perspective might not be something you would agree with.

175
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:08,907
It's still a learning opportunity to see it from a different angle. So that means that we talked about this probably numerous times in public health.

176
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:17,217
Just some things to keep in mind during these discussion sessions when we're sharing out word or just in between breakout groups is that you notice,

177
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:24,776
listen, when open mind gives people the opportunity to speak, what's an environment of cooperation, so on and so forth.

178
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:30,057
Not getting too deep into that. Overview of Canvas.

179
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:34,467
Um, and I'll probably show it later in the class if I don't forget.

180
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:38,457
So when you go on campus, there's gonna be a course though.

181
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:42,897
There is no syllabus, official syllabus. It's kind of embedded into that campus page.

182
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:47,967
It's going to show you the topics covered during the semester pre course assessment.

183
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:55,197
If you don't know what I'm talking about, I mean, you can take the free course segment if I give you access to the campus page.

184
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:58,347
There's a unit one that is from now until spring break.

185
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:06,627
There's unit two, um, which is post spring break into in a class and then overall individual assignments.

186
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:11,246
So as I mentioned earlier for the case analysis,

187
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:21,447
this is what the policy lab is for 40 to 50 minutes to create a case presentation so that with your groups different ways to approach a case.

188
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:27,927
These slides are due at the end of class. So as I said, this class runs from 10:00 to 1120.

189
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:36,237
Your cases do as well. Don't take it home. The only thing that you should do before class is to read the case material.

190
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:41,397
But everything should be done in this class so you don't have to worry about homework.

191
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:48,687
And then, like I said, some cases are longer. So if you have extra time, as long as the room is not directly booked,

192
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:53,907
you can stay here and finish your case and go ahead and submit that on canvas as well.

193
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:59,067
Now, the central research, if you do not communicate that, you're going to be.

194
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:05,797
Absent Prior. To that question.

195
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:13,507
Let's admit that if you are going to miss class, which I will clarify later at the end what that looks like,

196
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:21,997
you're required to turn in this individual submission. The way it's set up with grading your group is still going to submit,

197
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:28,387
and you're going to be able to see that that the goal is if you're missing and you weren't here to participate in that class,

198
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:33,307
you need to create a case completely different than that of what your peers submit.

199
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:38,857
And when you do submit your email, your email me separately to make that up.

200
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:46,777
And regarding to get more credit, you have to be present in class to receive discussion credit.

201
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:55,297
Like I said, let me know if you can't, then I'll go over into formalities of work absences and make up look like towards the end of class.

202
00:22:55,837 --> 00:23:04,477
So many of you said that you want to get familiar with case analysis for the sake of this class.

203
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:08,787
This is how we will be approaching cases. You're required to turn in the slide deck.

204
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:14,137
By all means, please. In that same 1215 slides, your slides should be no more than six.

205
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:21,727
And that's going to be your title page with When I break, when I let you choose groups at the end of class,

206
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:31,867
it might say Group four or Group seven, or you're always going to put on a title page group for a or seminary, sadly, go to.

207
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:36,027
Because that's going to here Stanley Jones.

208
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,777
I mean, if Joe is not here, then you just put savvy into it.

209
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:47,857
That'll be your first page. The second page will be your situation page, third page with the questions and brainstorming,

210
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:50,857
hypothesis, group and action, alternative, so on and so forth.

211
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:57,667
By all means, I do not give you extra points. If you want to be creative, you can give me the bare bones template.

212
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:04,837
You will not receive any less credit than those who decide to do the fancy slides off the slides go.

213
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:12,457
Not something we're rating on, but if you want to be creative in this process, by all means you have the opportunity to do so.

214
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,927
So as I mentioned, this is case analysis.

215
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:26,347
Many of you may have mentioned that you want to do consulting how Deloitte, McKinsey bang in the BCG approach cases do not use this framework.

216
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:32,797
Don't do it. I'm not saying that. It's not saying that is inaccurate.

217
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:37,877
It's just a different type of framework for those interested in policy.

218
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:40,477
And this is a very soft introduction into policy.

219
00:24:42,937 --> 00:24:50,736
As an MP major, we do have to take into account the policy they are going to their policy approach to see their policy.

220
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,897
And how does this approach is different?

221
00:24:53,197 --> 00:25:00,277
What you're learning here, very introductory and start to just kind of get your mind thinking of how do you approach?

222
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:08,957
Cases from a different policy angle or outside that equity like epidemiological nutritional.

223
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:13,637
So on line for those who want deeper policy experience,

224
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:23,987
be happy to recommend some classes as soon as the semester wraps up for next semester or one class when registration occurs.

225
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:28,937
But getting into the basis of what?

226
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:36,137
Your experience will be during this policy, that first thing you're going to do is identify whatever case that you read.

227
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,697
You're going to understand the situation.

228
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:46,947
So when you're doing that each and every time, each and every week, you always going to start by saying, Hey, it is a problem.

229
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:51,387
Is a decision. Is this an evaluation?

230
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:58,977
And during this process, you're going to describe any ideas about the framework or criteria that describe the situation and provide evidence.

231
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:04,107
So we'll touch on deeper. Towards the end of class.

232
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:09,537
But there's an assignment that would really be in your best interest. Three for like how to analyze a case.

233
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:14,907
I'm going to give some greater context of what case analysis is going to say to this class.

234
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:23,427
Reasons why you might prove the problem is there's a problem with the situation in which something has happened, but we don't know why it happened.

235
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:32,927
A decision is a case for going around. We're going to. Organize around an explosive decision and an evaluation assessment excuse me?

236
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:37,037
An evaluation is an assessment of the value or effectiveness of the intervention.

237
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:44,447
This is a five minute or less process. Out of that 40 to 50 minutes that you're given.

238
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:49,666
Don't spend too much time here. Students in the past have asked me, is it a problem?

239
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:56,507
Is it a decision? There is no right or wrong answer. Many people don't believe me when I say it's not right or wrong answer.

240
00:26:56,777 --> 00:27:02,807
But to give you an example, if I say the sky is blue because it looks blue to me and I can prove it,

241
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:08,087
which you're saying the sky is purple because the sun hits the concrete in a way that makes it purple.

242
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:13,177
Your opinion is correct. If, however you see it, as long as you can support.

243
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:24,847
So bear with me as they no longer offer this case, which is called the opioid epidemic.

244
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:30,157
They no longer operate in that Harvard Business course pet.

245
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:34,057
So I'm going to give as much context as I can from what I've read.

246
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:40,307
But. Understanding that gap since you haven't read it, this is what it will look like.

247
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:51,557
So for example, you are read the opioid epidemic and based off the context that were presented in the case, we decided that it was a problem.

248
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:57,587
So in deciding it was, the problems and crisis that come to mind are what is the problem?

249
00:27:57,857 --> 00:28:03,917
What is the magnitude of this problem? Are we trying to account for failure or success, or is it more ambiguous?

250
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:06,557
These are not the go to questions to answer,

251
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:11,507
but this is what will probably pop up in your brain as you're trying to understand and work your way through the case.

252
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:25,007
So in this scenario, this is a problem because the cases that between 1999 and 2017, over 400,000 Americans died from opioid overdose.

253
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:32,027
This led many scholars to talk about the opioid epidemic and describe increasing knowledge of the problem.

254
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:38,927
The last decade has seen an increase in overdose deaths from synthetic opioid, such as fentanyl.

255
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:44,837
Though this is explicitly stated as a problem. Some people say why.

256
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:52,227
Some people might argue during your case analysis that although it seems that it is a problem,

257
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:57,177
it was really a decision or situation that led to the problem.

258
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,137
Those are some examples. I'm trying not to get too complicated too fast,

259
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:07,647
but that's another way that you can approach the context of this policy that it all makes sense all the time.

260
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:17,406
So the required questions that you are mandated to answer to get your four points are more.

261
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:27,037
So what is the problem and what are the questions that I need to adequately assess the situation being that if it is a problem,

262
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:35,437
what is the problem that I'm trying to address and who is responsible or if there's nobody responsible, what are the line factors?

263
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:40,027
And I go through the decision process as well as the evaluation process of understanding what are

264
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:46,236
the underlying factors that contribute to the reason why this is a decision and what is at stake,

265
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:52,627
what this decision or why this is an evaluation and who is responsible for that evaluation and what are the criteria?

266
00:29:53,137 --> 00:30:01,867
Contrary to many, I think. The pandemic kind of shed light that health equity is present.

267
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:08,947
Systemic racism is present. It's always been present. Some people are just learning that it has always existed.

268
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:17,707
I mean, some people are just learning that it exists, be it a pandemic in this last question is mandatory in the aspect of are there

269
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:21,307
issues related to health equity and systemic racism that need to be addressed?

270
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:27,637
Depending on what your beliefs are. In the case of this, in the case of this class,

271
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:37,447
there's always going to be a health equity or systemic racism opponent component that needs to be addressed, and it may not be explicitly stated.

272
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:45,817
But as your public health decision, policymakers that you will be in this class, it is your job to think of anything and articulate that as such.

273
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:55,177
On that policy last slide, really in this process, you really want to focus on those underlying mechanisms and policy and management decisions.

274
00:30:56,817 --> 00:31:02,907
Once you get your situation and your questions together or sorry, I'm jumping ahead here.

275
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:08,426
So to understand what that means as an example, what is the problem?

276
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:11,937
You're trying to address the problem in the opioid epidemic?

277
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:23,457
Opioid epidemic that we're trying to address is an increase in overdose deaths from that opioid and other contributing factors over the last decade.

278
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:30,927
That's the first problem. If you're going to give an example in context to on that question slide, who is responsible for the problem?

279
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:39,497
No. Right or wrong answer. Reading this case, there were a number of different routes that you could have gone or felt that were responsible.

280
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:45,677
List them all. I will say a minimum to a maximum of five.

281
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:50,357
Here we have five. So who is responsible for this opioid epidemic?

282
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:58,037
The changing in attitudes towards pain management was something that was responsible for for the opioid epidemic,

283
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:05,476
the deceptive marketing campaigns and complicit in the deceptive marketing campaigns and complicit

284
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:10,337
and in a sufficiently trained physician were responsible for the escalation of this problem.

285
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:15,077
The permits, which dispense high volumes of opioids in some part of the U.S.,

286
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:22,487
were responsible for this problem, as well as intense lobbying from drug manufacturers and Puritan dominance.

287
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:30,646
If you in this case were to just provide pill mills, lobbying and curative dominance, and that's the way we wanted to focus on by all means,

288
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:35,927
do that if you want us that really drive home the fact that it was the insufficiently

289
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:41,957
trained physicians that really like to know who I am in the opioid epidemic,

290
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:50,507
by all means. But this is kind of get you to see that there's different angles to approach what the problem is.

291
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:55,577
And like I said, there is no right or wrong answer. And then, as I said earlier,

292
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:01,246
understanding that there's always arguably health equity and systemic racism considerations

293
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:06,947
that need to be brought to the table in any situation regarding public health concerns,

294
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:14,987
some health equity questions or situations to address in this case would be how can we reach marginalized communities,

295
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:17,267
racial minorities or rural areas?

296
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:26,627
And in the in the case in the context of this case, um, maybe they didn't have access to the necessary prescription medication,

297
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:35,477
or maybe it was the marginalized communities that were impacted more by the opioid epidemic than the non marginalized.

298
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:42,526
Um, just different ways to approach that question as well as how do we ensure that the opioid

299
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:47,027
epidemic doesn't disproportionately affect marginalized communities and moving forward?

300
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:53,657
These are not the go to solutions, but these are just some examples of some health equity considerations that.

301
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,097
We came up with my answer your hypothesis.

302
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:03,247
Once you have a situation in questions, you were then going to hypothesize.

303
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:08,707
What? Like I said, you're policy makers,

304
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:16,867
so you're going to hypothesize what can be done to make sure this never happens or to minimize the chances of this ever happening again.

305
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:21,187
Traditionally, with that research background, I don't know if they're still doing this,

306
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:28,087
but from my elementary encounters with research, you know, if such and such, then such and such for that hypothesis.

307
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:32,317
No, we we do not need the format for the hypothesis.

308
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:38,917
In this case, the hypothesis is a potential explanation that can explain the set of facts shown in the case.

309
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:44,767
A good hypothesis is one that can be tested empirically.

310
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:53,707
But here you articulate the direction that you need to move in as you were kind of like prompting that future policy decision.

311
00:34:54,427 --> 00:35:01,357
But as a part of your recommendation, be sure to include how you address any issues related to health equity.

312
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:11,077
Insist insisted. Systemic racism. So for simplicity purposes, the hypothesis is articulate, articulate it in this format.

313
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:17,317
But what I really want to drive home is that your hypotheses to be a hypothesis and it should not be a statement.

314
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:24,156
So where I'm going is an example of a direction you can go with hypothesis.

315
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:30,397
One is improve position management pain, improve position of pain management training.

316
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:40,176
That gives me nothing. What I'm looking for is more along the lines of we believe that if state mandated

317
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:46,597
states to take all of the financial burden of physician pain management training or

318
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:53,076
mandating that physicians get continual pain management training regarding opioid

319
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:58,057
prescriptions will further increase the chances or likelihood of the next opioid pandemic.

320
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,917
That's what I'm looking for in terms of that practice, not necessarily.

321
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:07,677
If we improve physician pain management training men will decrease the next opioid.

322
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:09,637
Continuing doesn't have to be like that,

323
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:16,957
but just give kind of context that what you're hypothesizing will work better than what was previously done in the past,

324
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:27,157
and then you're going to provide some supporting content. So one supporting context would be physicians should be trained to recognize addiction.

325
00:36:27,457 --> 00:36:34,447
Opioid recognize addiction to opioids and help pain help patients manage withdrawal symptoms.

326
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:40,086
Like I said, it's not necessarily a three supporting minimum, but at minimum,

327
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:45,367
please have two like supporting reasons as to why that this hypothesis is the best

328
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:52,267
direction to go in when addressing when trying to resolve the issue that happened.

329
00:36:53,137 --> 00:37:00,156
A different angle that you can go is that in this case there were numerous issues of transparency between

330
00:37:00,157 --> 00:37:07,117
physicians and their incentives to push more prescriptions because of the reimbursement and fee for service,

331
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:16,497
things of that sort. So if you believe that transparency was the main issue that led to the opioid epidemic, um,

332
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:22,357
you can say that increasing price transfer, increasing transparency between physicians.

333
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:30,876
Opioid no opioid meant that increasing transparency between physicians,

334
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:38,827
pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as consumers is a way that we can prevent the next opioid epidemic.

335
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:44,647
That would be our practices. And then you would support you would provide supporting context as to why.

336
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:57,427
And then another hypothesis is, like I said, um, in this case, many physicians received incentives to push more prescription medications,

337
00:37:57,427 --> 00:38:06,067
which led to maybe some misuse or kind of resale because many of them didn't finish their contract and so on and so forth.

338
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,217
So as you saw, that is not like I said,

339
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:14,497
the first hypothesis could have been like something that screamed at you like, Yeah, this is what we need to fix.

340
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:20,347
This type of a practices direction is probably not something that's going to scream at you when you read these cases.

341
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:26,487
But it's also. Just as accurate as the first hypothesis.

342
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:31,557
So if you're looking deep in between leaves and you see and draw connections, that is.

343
00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:38,787
Sorry. I just said don't use it. Through modification of payment and reimbursement or.

344
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:45,896
Restructuring how physicians and pharmaceuticals and insurance companies reimburse

345
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:52,317
for opioid prescriptions will further decrease the likelihood of an opioid epidemic.

346
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:59,907
That's a direction you can go on with this hypothesis and like always provide that supporting context of physician.

347
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:04,676
Physician payments should not be linked to the number of opioids they prescribe,

348
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:10,437
as well as reimbursement should not be linked to patient satisfaction with pain treatment.

349
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:16,437
So once you have that hypothesize about the thing, that's what I think.

350
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:20,997
Sorry. Once you have our practices, you're going to need some proof.

351
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:28,417
And this proof is the evidence that you have support, that the evidence that you have to support genotoxicity.

352
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:33,687
So if you're going to consider the additional evidence that's needed to support it and during your action,

353
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:39,777
you're going to talk about how you implement this this vision that you are recommending for your hypothesis.

354
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:45,807
So proof. I can get into like.

355
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:50,907
I'll save that for your or your practices.

356
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:58,817
Sorry, but for proof, your proof is the statistics on opioid consumptions, overdoses, deaths by race and economic status.

357
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:03,207
For me, that's a general statement.

358
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:14,907
If the proof in the court, if the person in case is 47% of the population died, you could always use I'll be like, that's what I want for the proof.

359
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:20,487
Not necessarily generalizable stats on opioid overdoses, but we can get into that later.

360
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:26,637
Non-approved data on the financial ties between opioid manufacturers, physicians or advocacy groups.

361
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:29,877
It's simple in this case, something I'm looking for.

362
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:38,007
When you do your proof in action, native physicians and related manufacturers profited 20 million.

363
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:46,807
Because of. Their financial system to prescribe more opioids.

364
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:58,587
I would like just more specificity during this during this during a brief section regarding actions you can take to address your hypothesis.

365
00:40:58,597 --> 00:41:03,726
Like I said, we covered over three different angles that you can go when you suggest a

366
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:08,407
hypothesis and these bullet points kind of support based on the hypothesis made.

367
00:41:08,737 --> 00:41:14,667
So one action you can do is that opioid prescriptions and pain management will follow revised revised

368
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:21,547
guidelines drafted by professional societies or in terms of the Transparency State Health Department.

369
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:31,416
And the FDA should have one central shared system which allows them to collect data and monitor opioid prescription consumption and overdoses.

370
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:38,737
And federal health agencies will work with state and county health officials and community leaders to create consistent and effective messaging,

371
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:43,146
to communicate risk. These are some of those actionable aspects.

372
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:50,377
If, for example, in this case, if you said that we need to improve transparency, excuse me,

373
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:59,167
if you if we need to improve transparency to our market between pharmacies, communities, whoever, these are some actionable ways to do so.

374
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:06,007
Then for your last slide, you're going to give a weakness to your hypotheses.

375
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:17,076
Identify two ways that you identify two alternatives to what you're recommending, and describe how these alternatives might be stronger or weaker.

376
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,107
Responses to the case. So.

377
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:28,967
Is a technicality. It's out of order. But propose the weakness first and then do the alternative.

378
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:33,017
So the weakness in your hypothesis, whichever one you propose,

379
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:38,267
is that political and private sector pushback against measures seeking to improve transparency.

380
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:43,067
Your hypothesis is you want to improve transparency to decrease this from happening.

381
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:51,767
But a weakness in that hypothesis is that like is it political and private sector pushback against measures to seeking to improve transparency,

382
00:42:52,487 --> 00:43:01,497
but also. Another reason is if you went in the direction of pain management or improving physician training,

383
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:07,217
that revising pain management guidelines and changing attitudes about pain management takes time.

384
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:11,617
So, yes, it's great. But. Might take 20 years.

385
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:15,487
How do you want to solve it? Do you want to solve this from the long term?

386
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:23,587
Do you want to start with a 30 day, 60, 90 day resolution, or is this to prevent the next opioid?

387
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:29,397
Epidemic. This is what it would take back to you and how you want to solve it.

388
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:35,217
Short term, long term, that's not. A mandatory thing to address.

389
00:43:35,217 --> 00:43:42,687
But whenever you are kind of establishing your supporting evidence, make sure it's consistent.

390
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:47,727
Once they have your weaknesses, you're going to give to alternatives.

391
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:54,577
I apologize that I or we did not fix alternative one.

392
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:59,187
I think it can be written better but restrict the use of opioid.

393
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:05,207
Opioids to patients who need it the most medically.

394
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:08,267
Whatever they have, whatever medical need they have,

395
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:13,247
it should be restricted to the use of which should be restricted to the use of people with medical needs.

396
00:44:13,637 --> 00:44:20,597
That could be alternative. One or alternative to is strengthened regulatory oversight for opioid manufacturing.

397
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:25,846
Since Jim describes opioids, if they're not manufactured by opioids,

398
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:32,387
maybe we want to target them and kind of regulate what they do versus what the physicians do.

399
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:40,757
Um, but with this alternative, the FDA may not have the capacity and the resources to closely monitor drug manufacturers.

400
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,417
That kind of gets into the cost and the gray area. As much as we love, uh, health care.

401
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:52,107
Everything's a business. We live in a capitalistic, arguably, society.

402
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:57,587
So as much as it makes sense ethically, it may not make sense fiscally.

403
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:03,827
Um, so those are some things that you kind of understand that may not be explicitly stated in this class.

404
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:09,677
Um, but those are some directions that you can go in with your alternative.

405
00:45:10,037 --> 00:45:19,096
So for final submission, that covers like names of who's pregnant to get full credit, as well as attending in class situations.

406
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:22,787
Questions, hypotheses, proven action alternatives.

407
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:26,597
Six Slides. There is no external research.

408
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:30,547
You do not need to pull anything from you.

409
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:39,826
See that? The banks. No need to bring anything from Cbcp World or World Health Organization.

410
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:46,567
Everything I need is in that case. Regarding light work.

411
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:50,827
Um, we encourage you to submit assignments one time.

412
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:55,117
We do understand that circumstances arise. Please communicate.

413
00:45:56,417 --> 00:46:03,227
Sooner than later. Um, if you need an extension, each student is eligible for an extension for any reason.

414
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:08,567
For three days. Among the final following assignments, please contact your DCI to advance.

415
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:13,067
This is the student in me speaking at the GSA.

416
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:18,316
Please do not wait till the last minute because I waited for the last minute on the health system.

417
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,517
Assignment is right before spring break. Get it done.

418
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:27,677
We're going to we're going to we're going to start kind of talking about that more February.

419
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:31,156
I understand things happen, but it's no fun.

420
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:36,827
I think I asked for the extension on it. It should is a fine assignment.

421
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,277
But when a spring break, you just just get it in as soon as possible.

422
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:44,597
Budgeting, exercise. Negotiation, team exercise. They're not too bad.

423
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,307
That advocacy assignment.

424
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:57,557
I would refrain if you can from getting extension on that just because if you're graduating if you're graduating this term, we graduate April 27.

425
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:01,777
So I would hate for you to be working on a paper until graduation.

426
00:47:01,787 --> 00:47:06,677
You need to be celebrating. But like I said, I understand that cases happen.

427
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:15,047
I want to work with you on a case by case basis of whatever you need clarity on with these assignments,

428
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:21,077
as well as any additional extensions will be available only in emergency situations.

429
00:47:22,397 --> 00:47:35,867
Attendance is mandatory. And I said, you're going to miss you get to free make up policy labs without without penalty.

430
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:39,647
So what that means is, hey, I'm not going to be here.

431
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:45,107
Hey, I'm snowed in. Hey, I called it, which I want to pause here.

432
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:49,667
Masks are not mandatory for this class. It's at your comfort ability.

433
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:53,207
But if you want to wear a mask, by all means more than welcome to you.

434
00:47:54,087 --> 00:47:58,397
I just want to say that because we are in-person and not necessarily virtual.

435
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:03,317
So concerns about that regarding when you have to work closely in groups, we understand.

436
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:11,476
Um, but yeah, those are any of the reasons that you're missing prior to at least tell me in advance that you're going to miss not oh,

437
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:19,697
I just don't feel like coming today. I will miss. Um, and with that being said, this class is Friday 10 a.m. too.

438
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:24,347
Well, technically, that's when your lab submission is there.

439
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:30,017
So you're going to miss today, which is a 13 and you're saying like, hey, I'm not going to be here.

440
00:48:30,587 --> 00:48:34,007
I'm going to use one of my posse lab make up.

441
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:41,957
That policy lab is due Friday, January 28, by 12 p.m. you will not submit that on campus.

442
00:48:42,107 --> 00:48:48,697
Will email me that will be your time that you have to do that last that's.

443
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:52,907
Um. I do want to confirm that office hours will be virtual.

444
00:48:53,267 --> 00:49:02,687
However, I'm flexible. We are in person. So if you want to walk and talk as you're moving to another class, we can do it that way.

445
00:49:02,777 --> 00:49:06,447
Um, we don't have any obstructions in the room. Frogs.

446
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:11,207
I can hold them here. I do want to make sure that you don't have any last hands.

447
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:19,047
Class conflicts Wednesday or Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

448
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:27,487
No. Netflix? No. Okay, but I'm still debating on which one that I'm gonna keep.

449
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:34,867
More than likely. It'll be the Friday 11 3012. Um, but you'll sign up in advance or make an appointment with me.

450
00:49:36,037 --> 00:49:40,267
Moving on to some things that I mentioned earlier, I promise you, we are almost in.

451
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:49,527
This is your public health. It'll look different because I have the non-student new student.

452
00:49:49,547 --> 00:49:52,637
You. This is how your course looks.

453
00:49:54,047 --> 00:50:01,907
As I mentioned, there's no exact syllabus, but this is kind of an overview of what's necessary.

454
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:07,857
You're going to click home here. Here's where complete that request assessment.

455
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:11,486
Here is where you have access to everything you need to do.

456
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:19,767
Look at between when class started January night, all the way up until the last week of class and what's expected.

457
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,667
This is what we meant by there's no syllabus, but it's kind of broken down here.

458
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:29,217
There's a lot of asynchronous work that needs to be done to give you some further

459
00:50:29,937 --> 00:50:34,437
learning content of how to understand and get the best out of this course.

460
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:39,127
Some general advice. Do what is best for you in terms of your learning style.

461
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:45,347
But what I would say is that I would kick it off with the recorded lectures always.

462
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:51,387
You're going to need that to prepare for what Professor Kennedy is going to talk to you about on Monday.

463
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:58,087
Sometimes the case is aligned with what we talked about on a lecture on Monday.

464
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:04,767
Sometimes they don't. But that's why I say I really drive home priority of the recorded lectures.

465
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:12,146
And then my second priority opinion. This is a flexible priority one correction.

466
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:19,857
This is not flexible. My second priority would be for you to read the case just because you're going to work on that in class.

467
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:24,867
Now, some people prioritize the readings. They are mandatory.

468
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:32,337
These readings are listed here. Some of them are really good.

469
00:51:32,337 --> 00:51:41,577
If you have leisure time and want to kind of understand what you need to know to prepare to be the next public health practitioner.

470
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:48,537
Others are not necessarily related to the course material that week, but they are helpful.

471
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:59,217
So if you want to supplement that, you can. But my advice is lectures and case analysis before anything and then the readings as necessary.

472
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:09,587
So that's that. I'll say it at the end, but just because I'm on campus, you do have to purchase that Harvard course business pack.

473
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:13,737
I think it's like $50. Any financial concerns about that?

474
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:20,997
Please email me separately or comments me after class and we can discuss how to navigate that.

475
00:52:20,997 --> 00:52:34,467
But that is mandatory to have for this class and how you'll purchase that is you'll go to home syllabus and then click here to Access Course Pack.

476
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:43,227
So you need to register. Some really good readings or cases to have access to.

477
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:51,647
So I highly recommend purchasing and that is the core structure also with the GSEs.

478
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:57,326
If my Friday, 1130 or Wednesday, which every time I decide to set doesn't work for you,

479
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:03,387
you can always go to the other guys to get additional information as well.

480
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:07,977
Um. What else is there regarding policy?

481
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:12,747
Note just for Guy. So we're going to take a quick second.

482
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:20,157
Unfortunately, you don't really have much of a choice, but for your policy lab groups, you're going to be in groups.

483
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:27,977
Uh, this is the student view. You're going to be in groups of 4 to 5.

484
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:32,397
So you're going to go to your section.

485
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:42,417
The Friday. In this case, one group or another group will be a group of five.

486
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:44,417
I'm going to ask that you drag and drop.

487
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:53,437
Your names just so I can make sure there's no technical errors on your in for the next minute and we'll get that done.

488
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:58,257
Um, I would say too, if you don't know each other already, please start out.

489
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:01,566
What's that? I know, I know. We hate the WhatsApp. I know we hate the group.

490
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:05,377
Me more. Whatever you're comfortable with. Please.

491
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:10,147
Um. Go ahead and make that group just because.

492
00:54:11,597 --> 00:54:16,717
Like I said, things happen. Taking a back track momentarily.

493
00:54:16,717 --> 00:54:19,957
Did you all get my announcement late at night? I'm sorry.

494
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:24,577
I'm so sorry. If I do respond late and I do not feel compelled to respond.

495
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:31,297
I don't know how much that late. But like I said, this would be a case scenario of like.

496
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:37,787
Granted, I was pregnant, but, like, how I was running late, trying to park or whatever.

497
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:44,196
I would use the announcements to be like, Hey, class, running a like walking from parking lot or whatever.

498
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:50,166
See you soon. Somebody here who's here early might think, Oh, class is canceled.

499
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:55,387
I was hoping that somebody might be classes canceled, so it would be great to have that group,

500
00:54:55,387 --> 00:55:01,297
me or whatever message to be like, Hey, she's running a little late, you're fine or you're not missing class.

501
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:05,767
I think it's helpful, but by all means, use your own discretion.

502
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:13,277
Yeah. I'm going to flip to see if you are.

503
00:55:14,027 --> 00:55:18,147
Major groups. Once you make these roots, these are permanent.

504
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,167
There's no switching after this class.

505
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:27,057
So for I think once it locks was it was very obvious.

506
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:35,897
So, yeah, I'll give you some time, like 2 minutes to kind of work that out and then we'll be bringing it home.

507
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:40,777
Yeah. Yeah. Or maybe we're not and I'm not.

508
00:55:41,117 --> 00:55:44,237
I'm like, oh, sorry.

509
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:48,257
I'm. We're in some way are to that thing that we have.

510
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:55,587
Yeah. So what you'll do is, you know. If you don't like the contract, maybe you're right.

511
00:55:57,207 --> 00:56:03,997
What do we do? Wait. I have 11 students. You should probably take this and given that.

512
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:07,476
Okay, wait. If I call your name, please say here. Alyssa.

513
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,967
Here. My mesa of Mesa. Mesa.

514
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,267
Mesa. Corey. Eric.

515
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:26,847
Ching ching dee. Nicholas, Ashley, Taz, Luba, Anna.

516
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:33,477
Rashi. Rohini, just go with.

517
00:56:33,987 --> 00:56:38,277
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

518
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:47,237
Let's get somebody in there.

519
00:56:48,887 --> 00:56:52,697
This is for. For Rocky.

520
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:59,657
Oh, well, I'll figure it out. Tim.

521
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:06,307
Sorry, I can't. No, that's it. So here, you should be able to drag and drop.

522
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:10,907
Um, I think you have to drag and drop them into this.

523
00:57:10,957 --> 00:57:15,217
What? So I kind of just like Ed something.

524
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:18,607
You. This is my student. I just click join.

525
00:57:18,797 --> 00:57:21,257
Yeah. Yeah. Then there you go.

526
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:37,017
I'm just confirming that I did seven because that was like this is like the number of your given message that, you know, serves during lecture.

527
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:43,717
I don't know why it is that at the time it said seven or eight sounds plausible.

528
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:54,917
I may have written it down, but I'd forgotten. So like memory, you know, some things like that stuck for reason.

529
00:57:56,287 --> 00:58:04,727
All right. We got one group that's full and then other that needs rate on it, so.

530
00:58:05,137 --> 00:58:08,467
Can I have whoever is in group seven C join seven B?

531
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:14,157
Can I do it? Sorry. I can switch to it.

532
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:19,047
Okay. Yeah. Change this to zero.

533
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:27,637
You're making that man work. It's not necessary to do this now.

534
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:39,017
I've been seven. Seven. All right, cool.

535
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:49,756
Great. All right, last couple things. So for next week, it's Friday.

536
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:52,817
I I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Practice lab.

537
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:59,797
Next week, I'm prepared to conduct a case analysis and purchase your course back from the HVAD.

538
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:08,017
So you're required readings for next week are going to be how Geisinger Health System reduce opioid prescription and as mentioned earlier,

539
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:14,617
read how to analyze a case which is attached on that course syllabus.

540
00:59:16,197 --> 00:59:23,667
And that is it. Any questions? You are free to go.

541
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:28,857
We ended early today. Do we have access to the slides?

542
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:33,297
We are still trying to figure out the best way to pose.

543
00:59:33,447 --> 00:59:38,037
In the past we use Slack and we had individual groups and I would just drop them in the slack.

544
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:43,797
Um, but once we figure out where we're going to post them, then they'll be posted, not make an announcement.

545
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:55,017
But regarding next class with what we have to talk through is that when you come in class, I will give you an overview.

546
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:59,367
And then once I'm done giving my overview and I put you in the breakout rooms,

547
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:06,417
that's when I would normally like post, post the post the PowerPoint in the slack.

548
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:12,507
So maybe I can time it to release at like 1020 or something and post on campus or however we decide to do that.

549
01:00:14,217 --> 01:00:19,377
Any other questions? Well, happy Friday.

550
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:26,037
Looking forward to working with you all and excited for what the semester has in store.

551
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:29,487
Hopefully minimal snow for me in those commuting cases.

552
01:00:30,057 --> 01:00:35,667
But you are. You all are all set on my end and have a wonderful weekend.

553
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:50,437
You know, I just want to talk to you about show, and I think you covered.

554
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:54,207
Yeah, you're starting to change, as you said.

555
01:00:54,337 --> 01:01:05,897
So, you know, I know it's been a really tough 830.
