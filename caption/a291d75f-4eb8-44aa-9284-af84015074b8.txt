1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:17,800
In this presentation, I'll be reviewing the metabolic changes that influence carbohydrate and fat metabolism of the pregnant person.

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,060
I will touch upon protein metabolism, but this is largely about carbohydrate and fat metabolism.

3
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:35,710
And the significance of these metabolic adaptations or changes is that they ensure adequate nutrient delivery to the fetus for energy needs,

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,860
as well as ensuring adequate energy storage for the pregnant person.

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,230
After this presentation, you'll be able to describe the metabolic changes that occur in pregnancy.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,480
You can explain how these metabolic adaptations result in altered glucose and fat utilization in the pregnant person.

7
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,540
You'll also be able to discuss how the changes support pregnancy and fetal energy needs.

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,490
And lastly, you'll be able to explain how obesity in pregnancy can lead to fetal overgrowth and a high birth weight.

9
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:23,240
This slide is provides an overview of why metabolic adaptations in pregnancy are essential.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,660
So they provide adequate energy and macronutrients, macronutrients simply being carbohydrates, protein and fats for the fetus.

11
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,820
These metabolic changes are also necessary to meet energy and nutrient requirements in pregnancy,

12
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,520
and they also provide energy stores for the pregnant and lactating person.

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,640
I want to introduce two terms. Anabolic and catabolic of the find them shortly.

14
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,350
But metabolic adaptations in general are either described as an anabolic state or a catabolic.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:17,610
And so you'll see that in early pregnancy the adaptations are largely anabolic, whereas during late pregnancy the adaptations are catabolic.

16
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:31,230
So before I discuss the figure in the slide, I want to briefly review the role of insulin in human metabolism.

17
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:39,540
So insulin is a hormone that's produced and secreted from the pancreas in response to elevated blood glucose levels.

18
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:50,700
So after we eat a meal, carbohydrate containing foods are digested, producing glucose which results in elevated glucose levels in our blood.

19
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:01,960
Insulin's role is to normalize blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake in the cells such as skeletal muscle and fat,

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,830
to be used as energy stored or converted to fat in the case of glucose.

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,810
Insulin also reduces fat release from our fat stores or also called adipose tissue.

22
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:32,320
So referring to the figure in the side note that the left side of the figure reflects metabolism of glucose and fat in the pregnant person in early,

23
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,220
which is the top half of the figure in late pregnancy, which is the lower half of the figure.

24
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:48,310
And then the right side of the figure reflects the embryo or the fetus, depending on the stage of pregnancy, either early or late.

25
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,300
So referring to the top left of the figure, top left side.

26
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,230
Early pregnancy is characterized as an anabolic state.

27
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,310
So anabolic simply means to build up.

28
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:13,870
So after a meal, insulin levels are elevated, promoting glucose uptake in the cells in all the different tissues of our body.

29
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:25,450
So glucose from the pregnant person's diet will be taken up in the cells such as skeletal muscle and used is energy stored as glycogen.

30
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,420
Glycogen is simply the storage form of glucose in muscle or converted to fat.

31
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,270
Likewise fat from the diet, which in this figure is TGF a triglycerides.

32
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,610
So fat from the pregnant person's diet is stored in adipose tissue.

33
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,740
Note that only a small amount of glucose is utilized by the embryo.

34
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,350
So it's just a very small dashed line from glucose across the figure to the embryo.

35
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,019
So this phase of pregnancy is an energy storing phase and we'll see how the metabolic

36
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,450
adaptations in early pregnancy promote fuel storage in the pregnant person.

37
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:32,760
Now, in contrast to early pregnancy, late pregnancy is characterized by a catabolic, state, and catabolic simply means to break down.

38
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,309
So referring to the lower left segment of the figure in late pregnancy,

39
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:49,160
a smaller amount of glucose is utilized for energy stored as glycogen in muscle or stored as fat in adipose tissue.

40
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:59,680
And this is in the pregnant person. Instead, more of the pregnant person's blood glucose is taken up by the developing fetus.

41
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:11,830
So you'll note that the arrow going from glucose, which simply is the glucose in the blood circulating in the pregnant person,

42
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,459
but that arrow from glucose to the fetus is much larger when you compare it to early pregnancy.

43
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:29,140
And that's because the glucose is more of the pregnant person's blood glucose is taken up by the fetus for energy needs.

44
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:43,959
Likewise, fat is mobilized or release from adipose tissue or fat stores to be used as fuel by the pregnant person and to a lesser degree,

45
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:54,100
by the fetus. So you'll note there's an arrow leaving adipose tissue and this is simply fat that's being released from the adipose tissue.

46
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:06,310
Fat will be used as an energy source by the pregnant person, again sparing more of their glucose to be taken up by the fetus for energy needs.

47
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,780
So to summarize, late pregnancy is characterized by less glucose utilization for energy.

48
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,050
Rather there's greater reliance on fat for energy.

49
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,300
From the pregnant person's diet as well as fat released from fat stores or the adipose tissue.

50
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:42,610
So these metabolic changes in late pregnancy are critical to ensure adequate glucose for the energy needs of the rapidly growing fetus.

51
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,520
So this presentation will provide an overview of the metabolic adaptations in

52
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,080
early and late pregnancy that are essential for healthy fetal development.

53
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,550
So one of the first metabolic adaptations in pregnancy begins around 1214 weeks gestation,

54
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:21,310
and in the pregnant person, an early adaptation is increased insulin secretion in response to a meal.

55
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,710
So in early pregnancy, insulin secretion is higher.

56
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,430
In the pregnant person when compared to the non-pregnant person.

57
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,960
So referring to the figure in the slide. On the Y axis, we have first phase insulin response.

58
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:55,590
This is simply insulin secretion. And on the x axis we have pre gravett or the nonpregnant state and then we have early pregnancy and late pregnancy.

59
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,390
And I just want to point out that insulin secretion from the pancreas occurs in two phases.

60
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,350
I'm only presenting the first phase,

61
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:16,630
but I just wanted to point out that the second phase response is very similar to the response that we see in this figure.

62
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,760
So you'll note that insulin secretion in the nonpregnant state.

63
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,980
Here on the left, the left bar of the figure.

64
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,450
And then insulin secretion in early pregnancy is almost two fold higher.

65
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:46,950
Relative to the Nonpregnant state. Likewise, in late pregnancy we see even higher insulin secretion from the pancreas.

66
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,700
And again, this is insulin secreted in response to a meal.

67
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:06,110
So pregnancy hormones that are secreted during early pregnancy promote this enhanced insulin secretion from the pancreas.

68
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:14,300
You don't need to know the specific hormones, but just know that pregnancy hormones mediate this metabolic change.

69
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:30,620
And again, I just want to point out that enhanced insulin secretion occurs across pregnancy with the highest levels in late pregnancy.

70
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,760
And we'll circle back to why high levels of insulin secretion in late pregnancy are essential.

71
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,339
So to review a metabolic change that begins early in pregnancy is increased insulin secretion,

72
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:54,560
which promotes glucose uptake into the pregnant person's cells and reduces fat release from the fat stores.

73
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,980
So a question to consider is what do you think is the purpose of this adaptation in early pregnancy?

74
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:22,980
I also want to point out that in early pregnancy, the pregnant person's tissues, such as muscle and fat, remain insulin sensitive.

75
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,360
That is, tissues respond normally to insulin.

76
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:43,279
Thus in early pregnancy enhance insulin secretion from the pancreas coupled with tissue insulin sensitivity promotes glucose uptake

77
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,860
into the pregnant person's tissues where glucose can be utilized for energy stored as glycogen or converted to fat and stored.

78
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,669
Likewise enhance insulin secretion and tissue.

79
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:06,500
Insulin sensitivity also promotes fat storage by reducing fat release from the adipose tissue.

80
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:20,120
So in this figure on the right, on the Y axis, we have insulin sensitivity of what we call peripheral tissues and peripheral tissues.

81
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,360
In this case, I'm referring to muscle and fat.

82
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:34,400
You'll note in the pre gravity state, this is a we see the level of tissue sensitivity that we would see in a non-pregnant person.

83
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,520
And in early pregnancy we see very similar insulin sensitivity.

84
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,069
There's essentially not much of a change. And I just want to point out that research has shown that in early pregnancy,

85
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,990
relative to the non-pregnant person, insulin sensitivity can be the same.

86
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,000
It might be slightly higher, it might be slightly lower, but it's similar.

87
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:11,740
So collectively these metabolic changes in early pregnancy promote fuel storage in the pregnant person.

88
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:23,710
Specifically, expansion of fat stores or adipose tissue that can be used later in pregnancy for energy needs or during lactation for energy needs.

89
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:41,450
And this slide just sort of summarizes what I discovered, that beginning in early pregnancy, insulin secretion is markedly enhanced.

90
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,190
We see almost twofold higher insulin secretion.

91
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,280
Obviously, there's going to be variability from individual to individual.

92
00:13:51,290 --> 00:14:00,440
But the important point, it's that insulin secretion increases beginning in early pregnancy when compared to the non-pregnant stay.

93
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:09,430
Peripheral tissue uptake of glucose readily occurs due to insulin availability,

94
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,920
as well as the fact that the peripheral tissues are still insulin sensitive.

95
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,240
That is, they respond to insulin and this leads to fat storage.

96
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,820
It's often referred to as adipocyte hypertrophy.

97
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,530
Adipocytes or simply fat cells. Hypertrophy simply means enlarged.

98
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:43,000
So early pregnancy is characterized by fat storage and there's also increase in glycogen synthesis in muscle.

99
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,710
Though. That's a short term form of. Glucose storage.

100
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,700
Overall, glucose and fat metabolism of the pregnant person is anabolic.

101
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,690
In early pregnancy that is build up and increasing fuel storage.

102
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:21,270
In contrast, early pregnancy, in late pregnancy, insulin sensitivity of a pregnant person's tissues is decreased,

103
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,980
which means the peripheral tissues are less responsive to insulin in promoting glucose uptake in the cells.

104
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,030
So this results in elevated plasma or blood glucose levels after the consumption of a meal.

105
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:45,900
This is a normal metabolic adaptation that occurs in pregnancy to ensure sufficient glucose for fetal needs.

106
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:55,180
So pregnancy hormones play a key role in mediating or facilitating this metabolic adaptation.

107
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:04,990
So again, this reduction in insulin sensitivity of a pregnant person's tissues in late pregnancy is normal.

108
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:16,450
Okay. And again, the purpose of this is to ensure that more of the pregnant person's glucose can be taken up by the fetus for energy needs.

109
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,890
So in this figure, it's the same figure that I showed you in the previous slide that you'll note here.

110
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,050
So again, we see insulin sensitivity in the non-pregnant and early pregnancy.

111
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,990
The levels are similar, but note the insulin sensitivity of the peripheral tissues such as muscle and fat.

112
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,370
There's decreased insulin sensitivity that is those tissues.

113
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:57,110
The less responsive to insulin, which means less glucose is being taken up by those tissues, which results in higher blood glucose levels.

114
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:06,710
Okay. And again, this adaptation appears to be essential for assure ensuring adequate glucose for the fetus.

115
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,780
So in this slide, we're going to review the plasma of blood glucose levels of pregnant individuals.

116
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,480
In late pregnancy. So referring to the figure on the Y axis is plasma or blood glucose levels.

117
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,340
And on the x axis are meal times indicated by arrows.

118
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,510
So 8 a.m. breakfast, 1 p.m. lunch, 6 p.m. dinner and so forth.

119
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:53,530
So in late pregnancy, in response to decrease insulin sensitivity of the peripheral tissues,

120
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,210
blood glucose levels are elevated after the consumption of a meal.

121
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,780
So in this figure, the plasma glucose levels of pregnant individuals is indicated by blue.

122
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,090
And you'll note that the line with the blue.

123
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:22,050
Estimates here of glucose levels. So again, these are estimates or measurements of blood glucose in the pregnant person.

124
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,340
You'll see that after the breakfast meal. So I'm looking at 8 a.m.

125
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:36,330
You can see that blood glucose levels shoot up, you know, fairly high, but then they do come back down.

126
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:45,719
But it's this considerable increase in plasma or blood glucose that occurs

127
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,900
after a meal because of decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues.

128
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,360
The other line is the nonpregnant person.

129
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,610
So you can see that blood glucose levels are considerably elevated when compared to the non-pregnant person.

130
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:22,200
And again, the purpose of this increase in glucose elevation is to enable more of that blood glucose to be taken up by the placenta for the fetus.

131
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,430
And I just want to highlight that even though the blood glucose levels shoot up quite high, they do come back down.

132
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,800
So the blood glucose doesn't support the glucose levels, do not stay elevated in the pregnant person's blood for long,

133
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:46,720
but just long enough so that that glucose can be taken up by the placenta for the fetus.

134
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:09,950
So this slide just reviews the metabolic adaptations that are specific to fat metabolism.

135
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,680
So in an early pregnancy,

136
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:26,990
there's increased fat synthesis and storage in adipose tissue and fat release or fat lipolysis is suppressed by the elevated insulin.

137
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,089
So again, in early pregnancy,

138
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:40,040
we see increased insulin secretion and insulin decreases the amount of fat that's released from our adipose tissue or fat lipolysis.

139
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,090
So fat release from adipose tissue is suppressed.

140
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:58,480
And instead, early pregnancy is characterized by fat storage or fuel storage that will be used later in pregnancy or during lactation.

141
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,170
In contrast, in late pregnancy, there's decreased peripheral tissue, insulin sensitivity.

142
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:18,770
And this can lead. This leads to increased fat release from adipose tissue or increased fat lipolysis and hyperlipidemia.

143
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:31,370
I don't have a slide that shows it, but there are this research that shows that triglyceride levels are higher in

144
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,860
late pregnancy when compared to early pregnancy or the non-pregnant person.

145
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:46,760
So again, the importance of these metabolic adaptations is that in late pregnancy,

146
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:56,839
fat is released from the adipose tissue or fat coming in from the diet is utilized by the pregnant

147
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:05,360
person as an energy source so that it let preserves more glucose for the fetus to take up.

148
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,879
And again, it's important to remember that by late pregnancy, the fetus is growing rapidly.

149
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,780
And so there's very high energy needs by the fetus.

150
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:26,570
So the net effect of fat metabolism in late pregnancy has been referred to as a floating energy source for the pregnant person and to a lesser degree,

151
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:37,130
the fetus. So the fetus can also take up fat and utilize it for energy and and other needs.

152
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,970
I just wanted to touch upon protein metabolism.

153
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:04,710
I want to just say at the onset that the adaptations of protein metabolism are less understood when compared to carbohydrate and fat metabolism.

154
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:14,370
But what is known is that amino acids are utilized by just in general amino acids, which are the building block of protein,

155
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,070
are utilized by the pregnant person and the fetus for protein synthesis and energy.

156
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,890
Okay. And we can certainly imagine that the fetus in particular during rapid growth,

157
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:39,400
particularly during late pregnancy, that protein synthesis is very rapid or important.

158
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,260
With all the developing tissue.

159
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,300
Circulating amino acid and protein levels in the blood are lower during pregnancy when compared to the Nonpregnant state.

160
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,729
So again, in the non-pregnant person,

161
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:05,110
it has been observed that circulating amino acids and protein levels in blood are lower in pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state.

162
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,440
And it is likely due to the increased need for the development of the pregnant person's tissues.

163
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:22,270
So this development of placental as well as the fetus, as well as the use of for glucose synthesis or gluconeogenesis.

164
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:31,059
So is this it's assumed that the lower circulating amino acid and protein levels in a pregnant person's

165
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:42,129
blood is lower simply because there's a great demand for amino acids and proteins due to tissue formation,

166
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,410
both pregnant tissue formation as well as for the fetus.

167
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,920
I also want to point out that during pregnancy, oxidation of amino acids for energy appears to be reduce.

168
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:07,729
So evidence to date suggests preservation of the amino acids for protein synthesis that is reduced oxidation of amino acids for energy production.

169
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:16,820
Instead preserving those amino acids for protein synthesis for tissue formation by both the pregnant person and the fetus.

170
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:37,800
So in this slide, we're going to review how obesity in pregnancy may impact or can impact the metabolic changes in pregnancy.

171
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,100
So I want to note that in non-pregnant adults,

172
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:50,320
obesity is associated with decreased tissue insulin sensitivity and often referred to as insulin resistant.

173
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,440
That is, the peripheral tissues are resistant to insulin.

174
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,050
And so that means you're going to have less glucose taken up into the tissues.

175
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:12,720
So referring to the figure in the slide. Research has shown that tissue insulin sensitivity is decreased in pregnant people with

176
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,250
obesity when compared to pregnant people without obesity in both early and late pregnancy.

177
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:32,540
So note that in the pre gravity or the nonpregnant state tissue, insulin sensitivity is lower in the obese people when compared to non obese people.

178
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:49,149
Likewise decreased tissue insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy due to normal adaptation of pregnancy coupled with reduced tissue.

179
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:58,570
Insulin sensitivity due to obesity can lead to even higher blood glucose levels when compared to pregnant people without obesity.

180
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:12,250
And so the significance of higher blood glucose levels in pregnant people with obesity is that the fetus is exposed to higher levels of glucose,

181
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,030
which can lead to fetal overgrowth and high birth weight.

182
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:30,979
So if you look at the figure here, you'll note that in the pre gravity or the non pregnant state, the rust color bar is individuals who are non-obese.

183
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,600
And so the greenish blue bar are those individuals who are obese.

184
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,610
And in the nonpregnant state, you can see that obesity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity.

185
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:55,350
Likewise in early pregnancy as well as late pregnancy, we can see the insulin sensitivity of the of.

186
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,310
An individual or a pregnant individual who lives with obesity,

187
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:10,020
you'll see that insulin sensitivity is lower when compared to a non obese pregnant individual.

188
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:18,660
And so, again, the concern is that decreased tissue insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy

189
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,610
due to the normal adaptation of pregnancy as well as the presence of obesity,

190
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,810
can result in higher blood glucose levels in the pregnant person.

191
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:39,340
So you have low. Lower insulin sensitivity due to the adaptation of pregnancy plus.

192
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,320
Lower tissue insulin sensitivity due to obesity,

193
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:54,420
and that's going to result in higher blood glucose levels in the pregnant person who lives with obesity,

194
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:01,860
which means it exposes the fetus to high glucose levels that can lead to overgrowth and high birth weight.

195
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,839
So to summarize the presentation during pregnancy,

196
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,559
there are changes in the pregnant person's metabolism that influence glucose and fat and less

197
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:23,590
understood it's the protein metabolism and these changes are important for utilization for energy.

198
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,850
So metabolic changes in early pregnancy promote fuel storage in the pregnant person,

199
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:39,040
whereas metabolic changes later in pregnancy are essential to provide adequate energy for fetal growth and development.

200
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:46,649
Obesity and pregnancy can result in modified metabolic adaptations that can

201
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:53,010
result in excess excess fetal growth and adversely impacting offspring outcomes.
