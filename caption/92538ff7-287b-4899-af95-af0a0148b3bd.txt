1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:20,540
I was like, Yeah, because I wasn't feeling like I was going to be like the average Hawaiian.

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:36,270
Why is it that I'm just like, you know, I had no way to know.

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,590
I was just curious about the. Very long to get started.

4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,290
So I'm okay that it's my office hours.

5
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:56,009
It's 3 to 4. And Thursday it happened. I have actually I have talked to my dad or so I can still make actually the earlier part of it.

6
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,950
3 to 334, I believe I can answer me earlier in that time slot,

7
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:15,030
so email me and happy again doing either in-person or zoom and again happy to meet with you in other times if that doesn't work for you.

8
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,640
Also seems like some of you are emailing me if you're going to be absent and some of you emailing oddly and it's to it'll be easier.

9
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,120
Maybe the easiest way is the, you know,

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:37,550
me and CC Audrey that way it's we don't we don't get our signals crossed as far as if you're going to miss lecture, you know we get away.

11
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,530
So I went this time I went over the questions and listed ones that seemed to be reoccurring.

12
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,710
So if I go over these are the questions that you submitted for that from last lecture,

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,870
not to go over these before starting the next lecture on immunity.

14
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:09,160
So first question was about I had the curve on phases of the epidemic curve.

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,410
There's the establishment phase where I talked about cases being sporadic or random,

16
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:27,310
the exponential phase, and then the phase in which the epidemic curve starts dropping due to exhaustion.

17
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,990
Susceptibles And the increased number of people that are have conferred immunity.

18
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,920
So there was a question about what that sporadic random establishment phase was about,

19
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:48,760
and that's about the fact that really we talk about an exponential increase and we talk about are not equaling four.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,760
It's really this large population average in reality that a couple, you know,

21
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:03,040
one person introduce is is introduced into a population and that person may not transmit to anybody.

22
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,620
Another person is introduced that's infected. That person may not transmit antibody.

23
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,140
A third person may transmit to 20 people.

24
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:19,410
It's a very there's a lot of what we call stochastic listening because we don't really understand what that that person,

25
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,420
again, may be a super spreader that transmit this.

26
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,080
By definition, they are a superspreader. They transmit the 20 people.

27
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,309
But so it's not as if everybody, if it are not, is for every infectious person is transmitted to four people.

28
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,710
It's very stochastic and random.

29
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:47,800
And so when the number of cases is low, it's very you do see this random stochastic effect where, oh, you see an introduction.

30
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,450
You saw a COVID case in Washington. I saw one in Utah and one in New York City, and they disappeared.

31
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,880
Or maybe there was two or three cases in each case.

32
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,890
And so it's it's only until the cases start building up D then you start seeing this exponential phase.

33
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:14,830
And that's why that sporadic that that random effects phase we call the establishment

34
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:22,240
phase is really where you can actually intervene quickly and and decisively.

35
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,930
You can actually do a lot to prevent going in to prevent as to going into that exponential phase.

36
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,410
So that's more clear on what type of cases epidemic.

37
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:44,600
There is a question about herd immunity and what waning immunity means with respect to.

38
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,760
That's the threshold that we need to get you to get at herd immunity.

39
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,880
So waning immunity means that there's basically more susceptibles in the population and that's obviously dynamic.

40
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,929
So as as as people's immunity wane, they move from that infectious state.

41
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:15,220
When we looked at that SARS model or I'm sorry, the remove state, because they're actually recovered and they move back into the central state.

42
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,810
So it likes to do actually an area that goes from the state back to state.

43
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,390
But it's important to realize that this herd immunity concept is theoretical.

44
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:34,860
It's not as if we're going to eradicate. It's pretty much here to stay, and it's very hard to actually eradicate.

45
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,090
But we use this idea of herd immunity where are not going below one.

46
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,690
To get a sense of how what it takes to actually control the disease and the infection process.

47
00:05:49,140 --> 00:06:03,060
And so if the greater are not is greater, that herd immunity threshold is, as we talked about in the last slide, said on Wednesday.

48
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:12,209
On Monday. So. We use herd immunity as this guide, but not we don't want to think about it.

49
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,710
I think there is a lot of misconception in the public that, oh, we get herd immunity,

50
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:25,260
we're going to have it's going to disappear and really stars disappear in 2000.

51
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,670
We don't really know exactly why it disappeared, but it did disappearing.

52
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,700
We can't assume and assume that.

53
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,660
And our assumption is that COVID is going to be here to stay and albeit a disease that's in the background and how it's going to be,

54
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:50,639
if it's going to mutate and become less and less virulent and give more upper respiratory, common cold type of pathogen,

55
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:58,860
or be much more like a flu type pathogen, where we are concerned about mortality every year remains to be seen,

56
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:08,460
but the herd immunity concept is useful in what is our goal in vaccine coverage in order to be controlling the disease.

57
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:19,660
There is a somewhat similar questions about this, about spikes in COVID and what that actually means.

58
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:32,110
Does that mean that we've lost this this we've got this waning immunity and all of a sudden the population writ large is at risk.

59
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:40,690
And when we get a spike and then when it when the spike disappears, then we have that.

60
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:50,620
Immunity. And again, I think it's important to realize that this concept of herd immunity is very geographically specific.

61
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:57,460
So when we talk about spikes in clusters, we say, oh, we've got this huge spike in Michigan now.

62
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,460
And then, you know, two months later it's in the south and it's often in small communities.

63
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,479
So what's happening is you've got a lot of either unvaccinated or susceptible people,

64
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:21,400
people that that and it hits a threshold and there's some sort of introduction that causes this this cluster of clusters occurred and it will occur.

65
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,830
And often until you get enough people that are at protection,

66
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:34,870
either by having the disease or by getting vaccinated, and then there might be sporadic cases.

67
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:45,339
And where a spike or a surge happens will be the at the next place where there is low vaccine coverage.

68
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,169
For instance, anywhere there's a low vaccine coverage, there's a risk for a spike, but a spike might not occur.

69
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,080
It still needs other aspects, such as the introduction of the strain and.

70
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,379
Other high risk events that might occur. So there's a lot of things,

71
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:09,050
and that's why where spikes occur and how often spikes occur is also what we call a stochastic event and not really predictable.

72
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,950
We just don't have enough.

73
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,160
And what it why it's not predictable is we just don't have enough information about where the pathogen is and what all the factors are.

74
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:25,410
To really say definitively what's happening. Question about latency versus generation time.

75
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,680
So the latency is from time to exposure to time.

76
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,009
When you are a person is infectious in generation is time would be the time that

77
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,540
you are exposed to the time in which you actually do transmit it to somebody else.

78
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:53,610
The generation time is more is the term that's used often in calculating or not.

79
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,100
Latency is an indicator of when we obviously should be concerned about people being infectious.

80
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:12,060
And there is a lot of questions about average age infection with the fact that this I just bring up the whole slide here.

81
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,930
Questions about this graph, just to be clear on what this graph is.

82
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,890
So Seropositivity So basically you do an experiment.

83
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,260
You run a study where you're getting a cross-section of the population and you're taking

84
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,530
their blood and seeing whether or not the person has antibodies or in this case,

85
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:47,530
hepatitis A or not. And then for each age group that you have, the age means you then calculate, well,

86
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:55,690
what is the percent of the those people that are positive have positive IgG specific for hepatitis C?

87
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,110
And so you do that for for eight for all the age groups that are in your sample here from zero to, let's say around 70 years of age.

88
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,970
And you can basically plot this curve.

89
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,870
And so if you in reality, they're being ages.

90
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,830
So you could really see a histogram rate of each bin.

91
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,320
What is the percent positive for IG IDG throughout that day?

92
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:33,970
And so that's what this is. These curves then represent the different countries within Europe where these cross-sectional studies.

93
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:46,849
Zero surveys were conducted. And since the average age infection, which you can estimate from these curves, you can basically look,

94
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:55,700
since you have the age of kind of zero positivity, you can actually get the average age of infection from each of these curves.

95
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,009
And the sharper the curve, the lower the average age of infection.

96
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:07,040
So this curve, again, for Greece is the the sharpest has the sharpest increase.

97
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:16,040
It means the average age in the population that someone's getting infected is is fairly young, which means there's old in that country.

98
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,430
There's a lot of hepatitis. There's more hepatitis A circulating.

99
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:29,020
So the chances that a younger person gets infected is higher than in Sweden when this curve is much shallower as it's,

100
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,089
you know, and so there's a lot less that means there's a lot less hepatitis A circulating.

101
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:35,209
Ah,

102
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:46,510
there was a lot less hepatitis A circulating during the last seven years because you're looking because this is have you had hepatitis in your life.

103
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,790
Right. Of your positive appetite say that means you've had it in your life.

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,690
If you're a ten year old, that means you've had it in the last ten years.

105
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,950
But if you're if you're a 70 year old, that means you've had it in the last seven years.

106
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:06,890
So again, what this is what this is indicating,

107
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:13,970
the sharpness of this curve indicates how much hepatitis A's insert has been circulating in the communities.

108
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,229
And the sharper the curve it means, the greater the force of infection,

109
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:26,420
the more that there is more the greater amount of hepatitis A is being transmitted in the communities.

110
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:38,140
Because that's clear. There's a lot of math behind all this that I'm glancing over in the papers and so forth over time.

111
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,690
A lot of that math. But I just want you to understand conceptually what this is giving.

112
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,220
So because you can really just look at a curve and just kind of say talk about qualitatively the force of infection.

113
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:02,770
Because if in fact, if you look at the Sweden curve, the fact that there's no seropositivity between 0 to 20 years of age,

114
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,490
what is what does that actually mean about hepatitis A circulating in the community?

115
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,020
But nobody from 0 to 20 years of age has had hepatitis A in their lifetime.

116
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:39,339
What is that? What else might that be? So likely means that hepatitis A has not been circulating.

117
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,360
And so what when the study was done in 1979, in the seventies,

118
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:51,190
was it has not wasn't circulating in the community for the past 20 years as a 0 to 20 year olds.

119
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,270
That's a fact. They've only been living for that those 20 years of age.

120
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:05,140
And then the fact that's increasing means, okay, these people that are greater than 20 years that were infected more than 20 years ago.

121
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,480
There's a lot of qualitative information we can get out of just looking at these curves, which is.

122
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay. Any questions on any of these things that at any point they went over?

123
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,350
Okay. So the topic for today is immunity.

124
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:40,520
So this this topic is a little different than what we've been dealing with or looking at in the past.

125
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,290
In this course, there's a lot more biology here on immunity.

126
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:53,270
Some of you who have undergraduate degrees in microbiology or biology, probably this might be a little boring to you.

127
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:01,730
It's going to be very, very, very basic kind of overview of the immune process and how it works.

128
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,010
We're going to talk about and these are the kind of key points that we're going to talk about.

129
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,869
What is the difference between South and Non South from the perspective of the immune system?

130
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,830
The immune system needs to know this. The cell is, yes,

131
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,709
part of your body and the cell is a foreign something foreign to your body in order for it

132
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:32,660
to know what to how to attack and kill pathogens that are you that you're infected with,

133
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,700
sometimes the immune system doesn't work and it starts attacking self cells.

134
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,970
And that's that those are a lot of autoimmune diseases.

135
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,310
There's often that talk about the difference being innate versus acquired immunity.

136
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:54,080
And in that the difference in active and passive, natural and artificial, we talk about immune memory and specificity.

137
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:02,810
That's really a power of our immune system. Is is the fact that it has a long memory and it's very specific to specific pathogens.

138
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,890
And then we'll talk about general functions of different cells that play a role in both your innate and acquired.

139
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,770
And we'll talk about those in a very general way. So the three most.

140
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:26,590
Redefining Kendrick's that system. Again, we just talked about the immune system can discriminate between self and non-self.

141
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,970
That's a very key part of a well-functioning immune system.

142
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,910
And we, as we take the immune system, remembers what it's encountered.

143
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:45,940
Another huge piece of that means that if you got exposed to measles today and years from now,

144
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:54,400
your immune system remembers that measles pathogen and can protect you from future infections.

145
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:03,790
So memory, another big aspect and then specificity is another huge, huge property of the immune system.

146
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:10,750
And that's the fact that it recognizes that measles pathogen and measles is an example of a very stable pathogen.

147
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,460
And that's why the vaccine is so effective as opposed to and we'll talk about this more as opposed to influenza.

148
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,750
It's not a stable pathogen and that's why we need to get a vaccine every year.

149
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:32,950
Though there have been working hard pre-COVID and now because of COVID and COVID.

150
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:45,190
Working on a universal vaccine for influenza, you can identify and can a stable part of that influenza virus that makes it influenza.

151
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,350
That doesn't change all the time so that it can be more effective.

152
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,060
You know, you don't need to get the vaccine every year.

153
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:00,360
Ideally lifelong, but even if it was something that lasted for years or a decade would be a huge advancement.

154
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,690
So there are different levels in which the immune system operates.

155
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:19,110
And as we're going to talk about, there's trade offs between these different levels with respect to speed versus specificity.

156
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,980
So you've got what we're going to call the innate intrinsic barriers to infection.

157
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,520
And most of those a lot of those are physical barriers like your skin.

158
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,550
A lot of them are physiological barriers like that acid in your stomach, saliva, tears.

159
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,840
And then there's some cellular barriers in addition.

160
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,730
So these are quick, but not not very specific.

161
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,900
Still, within the innate immune system, there are these other cellular barriers that are induced.

162
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,030
That is, they they are they take a little bit more time to establish.

163
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:08,819
They're still pretty broad with respect to their sensitivity, but they're able to identify pathogens.

164
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,750
They're not non-South. And so that's what we call the induced innate immune system.

165
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:23,990
And finally, we have the adaptive immune system, which has great, great specificity.

166
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,090
And it's through the production of these antibodies.

167
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:33,750
And these antibodies are quite specific to a very specific antigen or pathogen.

168
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:46,860
And then again, the remembering and the memory about that allows for subsequent responses to be quicker and more intense and the primary infection.

169
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,730
So we call the first tier humoral and a second T cell or cellular.

170
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,790
So we're going to go over each one of these right now in more detail.

171
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,430
But yeah, as I mentioned, these last two require induction.

172
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,330
That means a you know it's they need time to identify this specific pathogen here infected

173
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,460
with and there's increasing specificity as you move along these three processes.

174
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:31,270
So I mentioned the time piece. So this this slide here introduces the time piece of this for this intrinsic innate immunity.

175
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,940
It's very quick, if not immediate, like we're expecting.

176
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:46,419
So obviously things like the physical barriers are immediate, that they're pre formed at no specificity.

177
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,810
They're just trying to prevent anything from outside the environment coming into your body.

178
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:05,430
The innate. Immune system that's induced takes a little bit longer to establish, you know,

179
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,549
up to four days where it's actually they're recruiting effector cells and these different there's

180
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:18,520
a lot of acronyms in the entity so I'm trying to I'll try and specify what these acronyms are.

181
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,729
So perhaps pathogen associated molecular patterns.

182
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:30,400
So these are pathogens have these molecular patterns that these effector cells in

183
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,809
your body are able to identify and once they identify them are able to attack them,

184
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,190
kill them, inactivate them.

185
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:50,920
And so this have this is the induced innate immune system after four days and then your acquired adaptive immune system greater than four days,

186
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,870
there's a lot that's going on there. We'll talk about a little bit more detail where your T cells and B cells, which are naive, become activated.

187
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,249
They start producing. They need they need time to produce these antibodies in order for them to be effective.

188
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:15,910
So greater than four days to actually actually have your adaptive immune system respond.

189
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,880
And again, that response the second time, as we'll see in a graph later on, is much quicker than the first time.

190
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,830
So another way to kind of categorize these three.

191
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:46,860
Characteristics of the immune system. So. A little bit more on comparing intrinsic versus induced where you are the innate immune system.

192
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,460
So with respect to the intrinsic, you know, there's certain properties like it's inherent to some degree in all cells.

193
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,260
We've got these proteins called the complement system.

194
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,980
It's Oh, they're always circulating.

195
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:12,160
And they've got these, you know, built in cell death mechanisms, again, therefore integrate with this ability to identify so non-self versus self.

196
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,300
So these things are kind of happening all the time.

197
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,930
You know, you're not waiting for a pathogen to be introduced into the body as opposed

198
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:27,149
to the induced where there is these what they would call and we'll talk more

199
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:33,420
about these toll like receptors better from these immune if what they call it

200
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:42,360
factor cells that actually cause result in activation and often inflammation.

201
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,820
So the whole point in the intrinsic is to kind of no there's no symptoms no

202
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,840
matter resulting from no inflammation resulting from its ability to protect.

203
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,999
Whereas in the induced is when you start seeing some symptoms like inflammation,

204
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,710
which is one way in which the body is trying to contain any kind of introduction of a foreign object or a passive pathogen.

205
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:21,550
So we you know, now, if we now if we compare the innate system than what the acquired immunity innate immunity with acquired immunity.

206
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,250
We think of innate immunity as genetically predetermined.

207
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,660
So and I mentioned that before, you know, why does one person get sick when they're exposed to a pathogen and the other

208
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,770
person right next to them are exposed to the same thing are not getting sick.

209
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:46,020
A lot of that might have to do with differences in their innate immunity, which has which which which is genetically predetermined.

210
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,100
So. I suppose the acquired immune system, which is not genetically.

211
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,879
Predetermined and it's acquired either naturally because you're exposed to a pathogen artificially,

212
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:18,200
because you haven't got a vaccine, you see the vaccine. So a little bit more about comparing how these these processes are complementary.

213
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,050
We've got the innate immune system here with this different effector cells.

214
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,310
Macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils.

215
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,640
They're always present, waiting to eliminate past any kind of antigens.

216
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,520
That means they're fast, but that also means they're not specific and they're short lived.

217
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,750
So here we have our team and B cells.

218
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,570
They're producing specific response to a specific antigen.

219
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,170
And that's slower, more specific, but it's long lived.

220
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:04,730
So we've got these nicely complimentary systems out there in your body trying to address any kind of infection that you may get.

221
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,000
So let's look in a little more detail with respect to innate immunity.

222
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,600
We've talked about the fact here you hear the different components.

223
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,610
We talked about the physical barriers,

224
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:30,730
which is your skin or mucosal linings specifically in your your GI tract has that because there's a lot of pathogens in your GI tract,

225
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:42,790
respiratory tract, also genital tract, all of these have that causal barriers that are your kind of first line of defense.

226
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,490
Second line of defense is information that stimulated by different chemical factors like the cytokines that

227
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:59,240
we're looking at a little bit more detail later and it tries to contain and then again eliminate pathogens.

228
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,680
The complement system is a set of.

229
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:17,510
Cells that get released due to this again, takes a little more time due to the identification of these pathogens and helps.

230
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:25,290
Move the system more towards elimination of microbial removal, which is the white ball,

231
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,570
what the white blood cells are recruiting recruited to actually move these microbes.

232
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,460
We got these four.

233
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:43,710
How important is that innate immunity that are working again to try and at different stages to try and address any kind of infection?

234
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,570
So we talked a little and so what we talk about this first line of defense are physical barriers.

235
00:28:50,580 --> 00:29:00,870
There's the skin. Again, there's ways to, you know, through either breaks in the skin, lesions, cuts, scratches.

236
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,230
You can, you know, create a portal entry.

237
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:19,680
See, mosquito bites is another way to penetrate that that barrier and the GI tract as a you know a lot of first line of defense including

238
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:34,560
mucosal it's mucosal barrier that peristalsis there's the movement of every anything through your GI tract and through elimination.

239
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:48,100
And your IGA, that's one antibody that actually can block extra infection or that that's actually IGA is in your GI tract, resides in your GI tract.

240
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,990
It's an immunoglobulin. And so and then so the respiratory tract very similar.

241
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:06,600
You've got mucus, you've got cilia, you've got hairs, nose hairs, all sorts of things to try and trap microbes from from infecting in your body.

242
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
And then your eyes and your mouth and saliva.

243
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:17,780
Tears are another flushing mechanism. So these are all your different kinds of physical barriers.

244
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:28,650
Kind of a summary, schematic summary of your different physical barriers with respect to what how your system

245
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:37,920
is operating to try and evade or try and prevent a pathogen from entering into your body.

246
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,120
And then there's this is also showing sort of like the second line of defense when there's entry to different kinds of

247
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:55,920
cells that are there to try and immediately remove those pathogens that actually maybe make it through this barrier.

248
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:10,970
So the mucosal system consists of this barrier that kind of rings. So there's the physical environment, air, water that you're being exposed to,

249
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,160
and then there's the mucosal cellular defenses that are right on the other side of the mucus.

250
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,580
And so this physical barrier is trying to prevent, you know,

251
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:27,470
is the prevention of the or the barrier between the physical environment and these mucosal cellular events.

252
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:37,390
So the goal of the first line of defense is to prevent invasion without mounting an inflammatory response.

253
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,780
Which is sort of the next. So here we see another schematic of.

254
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,460
Bacteria and pathogens that are in your key, in your gut microbiota,

255
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,299
and then your kind of second line of defense conservative talk about that is ready

256
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,360
to try and address any kind of infection that occurs that occurs after that.

257
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:15,680
So inflammation is the next line, which so if bacteria do make it through this barrier into this mucosal layer here,

258
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,520
it's got a lot of there's mobilization of a lot of.

259
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,540
These what we're calling these affect your cells, too, through things like lysis or fagot, fagot, civic action.

260
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:40,500
So basically bringing in these bacteria into the cell and inactivating them as well as a lysis and just killing the cells.

261
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:52,110
These bacteria, you know, at this stage play here and all this resolves and usually this is an example of where inflammation

262
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:59,460
occurs and what if what what that information is doing in protecting you from this infection.

263
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,270
So this is a little bit more detail about what's happening in that first inflammation stage.

264
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:16,710
Where you've got these, there's very different kinds of cell types, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells.

265
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:25,000
They're all set up to recognize non-self. And so they add another acronym, PRR.

266
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,970
They have pattern recognition receptors.

267
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:34,180
All of these cells have these pattern recognition receptors that recognizes pathogen associated molecular patterns.

268
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,210
Pam Better on the pattern itself.

269
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,150
So then this the cells that releases inflammatory mediators,

270
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:54,400
but this is where the cytokines come into play and they're basically helping this whole process move along.

271
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,380
And also, again, their cytokines are really are good indicators of inflammation.

272
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,390
So we are finding in studies of. Childhood.

273
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:13,530
You know that studies that we do for childhood viral disease and it's a cytokine

274
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,070
presence a cytokines some good markers indicate that there is some inflammation.

275
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:32,290
So then there is that complement system amplifies this immune response that's building by releasing these different proteins that are signaling.

276
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,800
That something needs to happen.

277
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:48,429
And so here are the things that, you know, that that immune, innate immune system can do lysis so it can basically inactivate a cell or the virus.

278
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,520
So pathogen it can you know,

279
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,640
the recruitment of inflammatory cells can also be these this complement system

280
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:05,170
operates can mobilize all these effector cells to try and contain the infection.

281
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:20,139
And then uptake by phagocytic cells can also eliminate pathogens and to clear and so they'll link lymphoid lymphoid organ and kidneys are the

282
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:30,280
ones that kind of assist in the clearance of all the all the inactivated cells that are that the immune system is attacking during this process.

283
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,860
And these are different just different ways of eliminating microbes.

284
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,640
So these are also all of these cells, white blood cells that are removing microbes.

285
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,090
They're doing it through phagocytosis by bringing them in.

286
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:00,190
That's what the macrophages and degrading cells do. They bring the pathogen into the cell, their cell, and then they inactivated.

287
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,300
And also the natural killer cells are waste.

288
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,410
That's how the lysis is working, and that's through the cytokine action.

289
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:18,050
But the two different ways. That root microbe removal is possible in the immune system.

290
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,860
And so these are all, you know, a fact of.

291
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:33,299
Extracellular so way when the the lot of pathogens move into the cell to evade all of this, then all of a sudden,

292
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:43,470
all this activity we're talking about now is attacking the antigens that are and pathogens that are out extracellular.

293
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,290
So a little bit more on cytokines because they play a key role in processing

294
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:58,799
and getting these effector cells activated and they're antigen independent.

295
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:09,180
Again, we're still talking about a very nonspecific response to antigen cytokines can work intracellular lead

296
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,600
and this is just the list from a table of different kinds of cytokines and what their function is.

297
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,139
So there's different cytokines for, you know, whether or not you want a cytokine,

298
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:31,020
wants to activate or is there to activate the macrophage as opposed to mediating local inflammation.

299
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,280
So not something that you need to know the details of, memorize the details of each of these that I just noted.

300
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,040
There are different cytokines or different functions in this whole process.

301
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,160
And then there's the,

302
00:37:49,480 --> 00:38:01,559
the intracellular immune effector mechanism that that brings in a few other processes like this MHC class one complex which actually which

303
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:13,500
is there to kind of identify which cells have actually are pathogens moving into and basically hiding from the innate immune system.

304
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,500
And that's where the T cells come into play,

305
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,010
which we'll talk about a little bit later to destroy those cells that were then were, in fact, infected by pathogens.

306
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,049
The last thing is that the innate immune system primed the adaptive immune system.

307
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:41,640
So that's another complementary aspect. Again, the innate immune system is the first line of defense that happens quickly, your first seven days.

308
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,959
But it also produced another role of cytokines is to activate T cells.

309
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,610
So T cells are just sitting there. They're in a naive state.

310
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:12,150
The cytokines can activate them so that they are now poised to work in the adaptive immune system to basically ultimately produce antibodies.

311
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:22,700
Which then gets us to our last category for last part of the immune system, which is the acquired and acquired immune system.

312
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,559
And so we talked about the fact that I think the acquired immune system can be active or

313
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,310
passive or acquired immunity can be active or passive and could be natural or artificial.

314
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,830
And so these next two slides distinguish the two.

315
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:49,280
So what we mean by an active acquired immunity is that antigens or pathogens entered the body naturally,

316
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,000
and then the body responds through producing specific antibodies.

317
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:07,710
And that tends to be something that's lifelong or can't be lifelong or temporary, but it's more it's a it's a stronger response, a passive.

318
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,060
Acquired immunity is one in which the antibodies just kind of are.

319
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,129
Entered into the body. And this in one when it's natural it's usually the example is mother from fetus to

320
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:27,550
be a placenta so the mother or breastfeeding so the mother's providing antibodies.

321
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:33,980
So you often talk about how children from 0 to 6 months, as long as breastfeeding is happening,

322
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,730
they are actually protected from through the antibodies that the maternal antibodies,

323
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:52,130
they're protected even though their immune system hasn't quite developed and is not ready itself to actually respond with an active immune response.

324
00:40:52,520 --> 00:41:02,300
It has this passive immunity. So that's that the value of breastfeeding over that period of time, even you have to,

325
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:09,680
you know, one year or longer provides a good, solid protection for the child.

326
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,540
But this protection is short lived and there's no immune response from the child.

327
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:28,200
So here we have natural active immunity and passive and natural passive immunity.

328
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,980
The other category is artificially acquired immunity, and that is through vaccines.

329
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,500
So here in the 4 to 4, the active in the active immunity group, if a vaccine basically.

330
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:56,499
Introduces. An antigen, either an attenuated virus or even with the mRNA, it's it's introducing proteins or it's introducing then the RNA,

331
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:07,450
which then the cells that the host and produces the different kinds of antigens which allows the body to actively respond and build its immunity.

332
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:18,640
We can also provide you with immunoglobulin types of vaccines, which is producing passive immunity.

333
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,470
So it's basically just, you know, introducing the antibody into the body.

334
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,360
The body hasn't actively produced an immune response.

335
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:37,840
So it's again, short lived and the immune system doesn't have the opportunity to respond to an antigen.

336
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:45,450
And so you don't have you need to give that passive immunity often in order to maintain protection.

337
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:53,350
So that often so before we developed hepatitis A vaccine that was produced, active immunity,

338
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,780
people were getting this immunoglobulin treatment if they were going to go to a high risk area,

339
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,450
so easy to develop, but not as strong the immune system.

340
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:19,880
So the act, the acquired immune system has two pieces the humoral response focused on antibody production and the cell mediated response,

341
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,900
and that's focused on T cells, T cells. So there are two purposes.

342
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:32,270
One, it can actually kill cells, kill pathogens directly.

343
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:43,010
It also helps, as we'll see in the humoral response of developing an antibody response to an infection.

344
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,190
So we just talk about the cell mediated.

345
00:43:50,460 --> 00:44:04,840
He response? We see that. What has to happen is that immature T cell is needs to be activated and so we've got you know some of these cells

346
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:14,140
the macrophages dendritic cells that are were part of that important part of the the innate immune system are also

347
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:26,380
producing these have these co like receptors that are indicating that there is a pathogen that someone's infected with

348
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:34,089
and therefore these naive T cells are then activated by these they cause they're called antigen presenting cells,

349
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,390
but which are basically are macrophages intended Excel's.

350
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:49,270
And then there's two things that can happen. And then there's some of these cytokines are also being released to help with activating these T cells.

351
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:56,510
So if you got one set of T cells that are. They're to kill intracellular pathogens.

352
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,230
They release cytokines that promote t cell activity.

353
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:06,200
And then there's the other set of T cells that are important in antibody production, the humoral part.

354
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:14,360
So with respect to the T cells, the killer T cells.

355
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:28,690
They're being activated and we have these immature CD8 cells, t cells that are there to kill invading pathogens.

356
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:47,750
Cytokines. So with respect to the humoral response and that's how it revolves around these B cells, B cells mature in the bone marrow.

357
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,120
That's where they start off. They're pretty highly variable.

358
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,440
So they can actually recognize possible pathogens. They're not very specific at this point.

359
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,290
But then the next phase is that they're activated.

360
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:15,730
They're activated when antigens bind to them, they're activated when the CD4 helper cells actually help stimulate these B cells and.

361
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,700
And so they become activated and more specific.

362
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,000
They also migrate to the lymphoid, lymphoid organs.

363
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,890
And then the next phase is proliferation. Proliferation. So now all these,

364
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:39,190
what we call plasma cells bear all of these antibodies that are that are produced

365
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:44,500
that are specific to that antigen that cause the activation to even actually occur.

366
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:54,100
They release, they circulate. And then those that of the last phase here is production of memory cells.

367
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,090
And this is really the power of the immune system is that.

368
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:10,030
They produce these memory cells that remember this specific antigen and have specific antibodies for it, for future infection.

369
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:17,520
So that these are the so we got maturation activation when, when there's a present,

370
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:24,490
they're presented with an infection proliferation which provides the specific antibodies and production,

371
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,830
these memory cells that provide protection for a subsequent infection.

372
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,420
This is the antibody structure. You've got two things that are, you know,

373
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:50,110
key to two important parts of our properties of the and an antibody which is these green light chains that are that basically provide this specific.

374
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,000
Target interceptors for a specific antigen.

375
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:06,309
And then these this red which is classifies the type of immunoglobulin and three types we've we've that we'll talk

376
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:15,190
about one the idea which we've already talked about that mucosal and secretory and this is actually what the mom.

377
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,280
Provides the child in black breast milk.

378
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,560
Then we have the IGT and IBM, which we'll see later.

379
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,590
So the IBM is this primary response that happens right at infection.

380
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:39,650
ECG is what takes longer to build that, but it gives us that long term protection.

381
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,490
This gives a timeline that we see and we got an antigen introduced.

382
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:54,640
You know, the presence of IBM for a specific pathogen, let's say, like dengue, is diagnostic of a recent infection.

383
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:07,130
The presence of the ECG for gain gait is diagnostic of a past infection so high IG means you've been infected at some point in your life.

384
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,300
IDM means that you are currently infected.

385
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:21,040
And then this gives us a schematic of the difference between that primary spots that I was talking about and the secondary spots.

386
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:30,640
So the primary responses. Okay. This ECG builds up at this, you know, a certain level, antibody level,

387
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:44,500
but it builds up more slowly and less at a lower level than what happens in a secondary response to do those memory.

388
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,540
Remember those memory cells which are in there ready for a second response?

389
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,830
The response of the IgG is much more rapid and much higher.

390
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:00,850
And so this is shown schematically showing you that the power of these memory cells is that

391
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:07,060
they can reply to a quicker response the second time around and a much stronger response.

392
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:22,720
And then lastly, just so basically what happens after that primary response is that we may see antibody levels decrease.

393
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:34,090
And we see these memory cells, B and T cells are maintained for quick activation for a subsequent response.

394
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,850
And really,

395
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:45,350
this is the power of that of our adaptive immune response and really why it was a little misleading when we were seeing COVID and where people are

396
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:54,379
reporting out there everybody's antibodies level or decreasing and therefore they need another booster because they don't have the antibodies.

397
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:03,770
But they that those tests which are only testing for IGG in the blood, aren't testing for this part of the immune system.

398
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:12,950
And so antibody levels decreasing, it's kind of a natural phenomena, but that's not necessarily a correlate of whether or not you are protected,

399
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,819
whereas the presence of these memory cells is what's critical, much harder to test for and much more expensive to test for.

400
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,130
It's something we can do at a population level,

401
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:29,330
but we don't want to be misled by thinking just because antibody levels are decreasing, the person isn't protected.

402
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:42,729
So. That's a kind of a quick, broad overview of the immune system again.

403
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:49,210
And I'm sure some of you have taken classes in undergraduate and probably a lot more detail than this,

404
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,660
but hopefully this gives a F or those that you haven't had that give you a sense of how the immune system works.

405
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,280
What I put together was some questions a little bit.

406
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:16,310
Different in nature than prior questions. And so that's the first line.

407
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,570
So basically in your groups, there's four questions I want you to talk about.

408
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Why does the human body need more than its skin to function as a barrier to infected pathogens?

409
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,720
Basic question of the importance of the adaptive immune system.

410
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,650
Why might an ECG test not provide information on the level of protection?

411
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,680
We talked about that briefly compare and contrast the adaptive immune system with the innate immune system.

412
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:54,360
And then the last question is, let's compare and contrast two factors associated with being susceptible to reinfection, waning immunity.

413
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:02,750
Property of the host and immune evasion property of the pathogen.

414
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,610
And so apply these concepts to COVID 19.

415
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:18,920
Distinguish influenza less stable viruses versus childhood diseases like measles, pertussis, more stable viruses.

416
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,030
And also talk about how proximity made. Address the mute evasion.

417
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,380
Night out, how the host might address communication through cross-community.

418
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:33,870
And then just in case we didn't address all the questions,

419
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:40,110
this is something that you can do ahead of time because it's basically the question you're asked to do an evaluation.

420
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:48,660
Right. One question about the immune system and one question about the adaptive immune system that you might have during your discussion.

421
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,570
Any questions about the presentation on these questions?

422
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,870
Okay. Give maybe 50 minutes or so.

423
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:14,250
You're in a group that was in the.

424
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,720
And it's Sunday morning.

425
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,730
We've got a lot of.

426
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:42,550
You should definitely find work on something like this that you're using.

427
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:47,740
Yeah, yeah, I know that.

428
00:54:48,160 --> 00:55:00,840
That's a lot of the time as you can pretty definitely be broken down.

429
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,200
In other words, she says,

430
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:23,050
and the discussion starts and focusing on the role that that is reinforcing much of the reading as something that's just totally all right.

431
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:42,910
You know, like this game is not here to elaborate on something that is.

432
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,260
Oh, that's okay. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah.

433
00:55:49,030 --> 00:56:01,749
So he said that there's different agencies based on the interview that he was basically

434
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:18,340
saying it's more about just having a person that was more than explicitly presented to you.

435
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:37,280
Yeah, I don't know if just got a lot of like parochial like things of that, you know, like just thinking about like how much you could actually do.

436
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,570
You really, really, really like hyperfocus on it.

437
00:56:41,240 --> 00:57:00,220
I mean, I think that always makes me feel better because, like, you know, that's why they're here because I, my sister and I teach her not to write.

438
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:17,900
My great question, if anybody, again, is not in a group, I know right now all of us are kids and it's just not who we find.

439
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:42,290
She was that about like she just doesn't you know, she came around last time like asking, you know, so I hear something last year when she was,

440
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:57,750
you know, just like very specific only experience and there was an orange y 1980 class provide information on people are like turn it over to 32.

441
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:07,210
That's what they said to us. But I think she was like, Oh, you guys are ten things.

442
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:21,070
But yeah, like, I guess like it doesn't surprise me.

443
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:34,240
So just, you know, and then you have to be very, very sensitive.

444
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:46,050
I would not be a middle professor because I don't know.

445
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:53,100
So I don't really have a memory for this.

446
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:05,320
Everyone has a trans person don't remember because when you didn't want to write that she said that,

447
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,740
I felt like I was like I kind of like how you know.

448
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:25,150
Yeah, I didn't. I didn't like. I appreciate you being here.

449
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:48,100
I would like to thank you so much for your support.

450
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:01,170
But what are you doing?

451
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,290
Let me ask you something.

452
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:25,950
I mean, what are the reasons? Like every other person involved, you know, you just want paragraph.

453
01:00:26,460 --> 01:01:02,010
I don't know why I said that was of like, oh, I had my campaign and now I just kind of here I suppose it represents insurance pricing.

454
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,180
You're going to say, well, not interrupting me.

455
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:40,390
But it did say once again, it's like in high school I was I lost a similar message, so I had to use it.

456
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:55,170
So it's like being slightly like you're just not what that is in terms of what they're saying.

457
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:04,860
So it's been a very difficult time for the prosecution of my client.

458
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,880
I feel like I'm to something that's not right.

459
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:19,730
And we would like for you to come on.

460
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:34,559
This is a great idea because as you just mentioned,

461
01:02:34,560 --> 01:03:03,030
that story about how to join the sex slavery people in our family and I don't

462
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:25,280
know what genetic information they are exposed to or monkeypox in particular.

463
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:41,610
He's not the answer. That's just not right.

464
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:53,510
Yeah, there goes number three. Yeah, I would agree. Yeah, I'm gonna be like 30 pages, but that's okay.

465
01:03:53,580 --> 01:04:07,290
And there was like, in certain cases, like, community, like, you should be around.

466
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:18,150
Yeah, I don't think it should matter. Eventually have to be like, you know, classic one.

467
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:42,690
But there are many other things. Like it's just like I think you can be like you just didn't know that, you know, it's going to be sort of like.

468
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:57,780
Yeah, that's what I thought. So then they say there's genetic differences and how, you know,

469
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:18,060
nudity is more like the host problem take place in the sense of having that immune leading immunity and, you know, things like that.

470
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,830
That's right. That's right. That's right.

471
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:42,300
If it's not for that point.

472
01:05:44,070 --> 01:06:03,870
So I guess, you know, I don't want me to be isn't really trying to figure out why you know, it's going to be not even really.

473
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:23,550
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Is this something that you don't have anything to do with, you think?

474
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,520
I think that is when you talk about this. Okay.

475
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,580
Let's start the reporting back with Group.

476
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:41,890
A 37 was.

477
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:54,559
You start with the first question. So when we talked about more bears than the skin.

478
01:06:54,560 --> 01:07:02,740
So if there's a penetration or there is some sort of pathogen that is ingested, then if there's only the barrier,

479
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:10,380
you're not really going to have a fighting chance against it among must some sort of memory or any response to it.

480
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,090
Right. So it's both the fact that your skin can be compromised and the fact you have all

481
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:20,010
these other portable injuries like your mouth and your eyes that the skin that can't.

482
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:28,820
Right. Did you, by any chance have any come up with any questions?

483
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:40,800
Yeah, kind of like that. So I guess in terms of like autoimmune diseases, is the adaptive immune system the.

484
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:47,310
That and that exposure to a certain virus or whatever pathogen is that response,

485
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:54,760
the one that's going to cause the autoimmune disease or is it going to be like a breakdown event

486
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:03,669
in response to my my understanding of it is and actually this is not my area of expertize,

487
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:11,740
but it's the adaptive immune system that's overreacting and not it's it,

488
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:19,180
but it's basically this idea that the immune system's not distinguishing between self and non-self.

489
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:27,910
You know, the other question you have for the innate immune system,

490
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:43,959
do you know from your background and work type of research is out there for like the genetic differences that affect innate immunity?

491
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:51,160
Like I know there's different exposures such as like what you're exposed to remembering mental but actual genetics in between.

492
01:08:51,160 --> 01:09:01,850
Like the only thing, the thing that I am aware about and there's a lot in this area is in my area which is we target antigens.

493
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:11,980
An example is norovirus. They've identified a gene that if that gene is expressed that there's 20% of the population has

494
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:19,510
expressed this gene and 20% of people the population is not susceptible to infection of norovirus.

495
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:26,430
So they've turned in a lot of work to be actually down to identify which means make product type.

496
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:34,720
So I have a question based off of that. So what if you have that gene, will it automatically be expressed?

497
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:45,060
Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's to get it fixed, but it but it obviously it's the expression the gene that is needed.

498
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:58,910
To actually make you actually resistant to action beyond that, you know, that was identified not I mean, not that long ago being the last ten years.

499
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:06,290
The actual detail mechanism of that is I'm not aware of that's probably known right now.

500
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:18,000
Good. Good to hear about the second question about why am I not provided information or protection.

501
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:29,010
So we spoke about how IG antibodies give more information about your memories, response and past infection.

502
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,540
And I did you and I do you test.

503
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:38,519
Can I tell you about the current level of protection and how you mentioned during

504
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,629
lecture to test those you would need to collect information about T and B cells,

505
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:48,120
which is like, like you said, difficult and expensive to do. Yeah.

506
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:59,530
So I think the big, big concept there is that, you know, IG, your IG levels are not necessarily a correlate of protection and understanding.

507
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:03,550
The correlate of protection is a lot more involved in understanding.

508
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:13,030
The IG may be, you know, a good target for the car, the protection for some diseases, but for others it might not be so.

509
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:23,900
Any other questions that you came up with? Yeah, we came up with one kind of like the group before us.

510
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:31,300
We were wondering what kind of role, if any, of the innate immune system plays in immunodeficiency.

511
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:44,150
What kind of role? I think again, I'm treading in areas is not my expertize, but certainly the first levels are not,

512
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:51,739
you know, that, you know, there's the barriers and such are not about immunodeficiencies.

513
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:58,370
I think once you start getting into the ability for your effector cells to actually identify antigens,

514
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:03,290
you start getting more into potentially immunodeficiencies.

515
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:12,770
But again, my understanding it's more about that fantastic immune response that you can't mount it with respect to Immunodeficiencies.

516
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,179
So and it's, you know, specifically with HIV targets,

517
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:29,800
the CD4 can CD4+ T cells and so it gets an immunodeficiency which your T cells are not able to stimulate the B cells.

518
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:38,690
And now you so you can't now it's an immune response, but a lot of immunodeficiencies can be taking get him in lower middle income countries.

519
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:47,350
Nutrition is a big you know, malnutrition can be a big cause of a child not to be able to eat response.

520
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:53,560
And that's often why for now, we're in the brink of eradicating polio.

521
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:58,060
They're finding that in a lot of places that kids are immune deficient.

522
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,379
They need to get that polio.

523
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:09,850
They need to give like literally 10 to 14 booster shots per child in order to get for the child to mount a good response to the vaccine.

524
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,820
That's happening also with rotavirus. Right.

525
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:25,040
That we tracked over time through three comparing and contrasting and after that eight.

526
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:36,710
One thing we said about that was that the innate immune system is less specific but more immediate,

527
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:41,780
whereas the adaptive immune system takes longer to build up to, but is more targeted.

528
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:48,170
And while your innate is broadly always there, even it can be more active during times of infection.

529
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,200
Adaptive protections can wait over time. So as we're brainstorming.

530
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,570
Yeah. Okay. Okay. I realize I just skipped Ivan for.

531
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:06,470
Right, so let's go into five and to address this fourth question,

532
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:13,130
which is the bigger question very interesting is two factors where immunity and immune evasion.

533
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:25,920
In the time that we have, we only touched on an innovation we haven't got yet or waning immunity,

534
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:33,870
but we are talking about the like antibodies maybe no longer being specific for

535
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:39,690
the targeted protein after some mutation has occurred and less stable viruses,

536
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:47,250
which often doesn't occur in childhood diseases. So just COVID and influenza.

537
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:54,329
And then talked about cross immunity from targeting like a family of pathogens

538
01:14:54,330 --> 01:15:00,750
rather than just one specific pathogen which could help in the event of a mutation.

539
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:10,280
Right. So cross-community is about the fact that and we've seen this with reports about the COVID vaccine that.

540
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:16,580
Even when a pathogen starts mutating.

541
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:27,150
So and so now the antibodies are aren't as effective, but they still are somewhat effective.

542
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:35,549
And so and we see this a lot with different serotypes, like dengue, which has four serotypes,

543
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:49,530
there is some level of across immunity so that even if you're infected with a novel serotype, you made your antibodies give you some protection.

544
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:56,790
And more importantly, it's why where we are, a lot of the reason why influenza is, you know,

545
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:06,570
the severity and the infection rate is not as little as severe as it was because even though there's new strains coming in every year,

546
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:15,990
you do have some level across immunity to those new strains because you've been exposed to different other strains over the past years.

547
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:25,210
And so. That so that depending on that, how that the strain is mutating,

548
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:31,450
you're probably they have their antibodies which are very specific to a specific strain may still be partially.

549
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:40,380
Protective for others other strains. So cross immunities important concept to.

550
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:51,880
You know, keep in mind with respect to. How well, you know, what kind of correlative protection you have, basically.

551
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:01,490
Yeah. Group seven, six, five forward.

552
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:09,730
Talk about the waning immunity piece of this. Oh, yes, we did.

553
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:19,690
We talked about what a team of producers and how even if people were vaccinated or maybe nowadays people aren't really getting vaccinated.

554
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:27,669
But, you know, those who have been vaccinated over time, there's been reigning immunity, like the vaccine has been losing its protective ability.

555
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:32,590
So whooping cough and everything is sort of coming back. But you can say that for a lot of reasons.

556
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:42,040
I'm starting to. Yeah whooping cough is a huge have been a huge issue and I think over the past ten years just sort of.

557
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:52,060
Not quite epidemic but yeah certainly increase in cases of whooping cough in older adults that got the vaccine.

558
01:17:52,210 --> 01:18:00,760
Decades and decades ago. And clearly there's waning it's occurring in a vaccine that we had thought was lifelong.

559
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:09,150
So did you have any additional questions in the last few minutes?

560
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:22,200
And you guys talked about. We're we're curious about if there's an age associated trend in which type of immunity is used or.

561
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:30,660
An age associated trend in the types of immunity that is, you know, younger.

562
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:41,519
So I would say that one thing for sure is clear is that younger kids and infants already, you know, have an innate immunity.

563
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,569
I mean, a lot of the barriers are there, but there is the adaptive immunity.

564
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:49,590
It takes some time to develop. So that develops over time.

565
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:56,310
And again, for immunodeficiency individuals, you may lose that and that can be done, you know,

566
01:18:56,730 --> 01:19:05,780
could be nutrition based, it could be chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, a lot of reasons that sense.

567
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:08,070
And then on the other spectrum, as you age,

568
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:17,970
you get older that those and those that acquired immunity and the ability to mount an immune response is going to be.

569
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:23,850
Decreased as well as that induced innate immunity.

570
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:35,210
Any other hacking group went on to any other questions and came up with different.

571
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:50,780
What are mechanisms and pathogens that like some mechanisms for them to evade the adaptive immune response?

572
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:58,240
Yeah. So clearly, you know, we talked mostly about we're talking.
