1
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:09,652
and I'm excited to be talking to you guys about supporting the mental health of the students in the future

2
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:19,572
public health leaders program. And so what we're gonna do over the time that we're in these modules is to talk about three major themes,

3
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:29,312
kind of what is your role in supporting their mental health? How to understand mental health in general and identify concerns that may come up.

4
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:40,102
And then lastly, kind of the meat of it, is what to do? What are the skills to support students through experiences of distress and of crisis?

5
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:43,142
So let's jump right in.

6
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:51,162
If you're anything like me, knowing what your role is and being able to wrap your mind around that, what it is and what it is not, it is really helpful.

7
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:52,292
It makes me think about

8
00:00:52,292 --> 00:01:00,402
when you're on an airplane and you're sitting in that aisle seat and they ask you, are you willing to do all of the duties of the emergency exit?

9
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:06,062
You want to know what those are. So you don't feel overwhelmed, so that you feel fully equipped.

10
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:13,592
Let's talk about a little bit of what that is when it comes to your role in supporting student mental health.

11
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:21,202
I think the first part is just thinking about your why. Like, what about being a preceptor, being a mentor, like

12
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:26,392
what make you sign up? What excites you about it? What do you hope

13
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:34,342
to accomplish in the role? And even just pause for a moment right now and think about what that was for you,

14
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:42,162
what you hoped to contribute, what you hoped would be the impacted.

15
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:53,712
And probably as we move through this, you'll see that whatever that impact is, is related to the overall mental health and well-being of the students.

16
00:01:53,712 --> 00:02:01,002
And so let's just check in and see how comfortable you are with talking about mental health.

17
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:09,402
This is a really important part of being able to engage and connect with students and understand what's happening with them.

18
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:14,692
So when you think about your own mental health. How do you assess where you're at?

19
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:20,932
How do you know if you're doing really well or if you're having a hard time? How do you take care of your mental health?

20
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:28,612
What are the practices that you use that help on an everyday level or when things are difficult?

21
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:32,352
And who do you talk to when you're stressed or overwhelmed?

22
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:40,072
Often, if we don't know some of those things for ourselves and if we don't have people that we comfortably talk to when we're having a hard time,

23
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:45,402
it can make it harder for us to support others.

24
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:51,222
Another thing to think about is what you've learned in your family and professional environments about mental health.

25
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:57,102
So, for example, a lot of times when we think about mental health, we have images that pop up.

26
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:01,062
Like what does it mean to be crazy or lazy?

27
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:07,682
Or are people unsafe? Are they a danger to themselves or to others?

28
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:15,132
And even when we're stressed out, we're overwhelmed. What does it mean to be professional and show up in your work environments?

29
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:18,792
And if you're anything like me, a lot of people learn that you just hide it,

30
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:32,212
you pretend, you keep going. And that there's something not okay about admitting that we're having difficulties and talking about these difficulties.

31
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:38,392
But notice what you learned, what you saw modeled.

32
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:43,022
That's going to affect how you model,

33
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:54,972
what it means to be a professional. Also, think about based on those things, do you have fears or reservations in talking about mental health?

34
00:03:54,972 --> 00:04:01,442
So what are the things that you worry may come up? What are the things that you worry you might not be able to address well?

35
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:10,542
And those are things that are really important to know for yourself and for us to be talking about as you prepare, so that you feel calm,

36
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:15,382
relaxed, equipped. And you'll see his tip on the bottom of this screen.

37
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:21,062
This is kind of your invitation to get comfy in uncomfortable conversations, to start asking yourself

38
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:27,782
some of these questions and also hopefully to start having more conversations with family and friends.

39
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:36,562
Where talking about mental health just becomes a part of everyday conversations.

40
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:41,902
Another important part of this is how comfortable are you talking about race, culture,

41
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:50,512
privilege, sexual orientation, gender identity, poverty, religion, oppression, discrimination?

42
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:57,792
Just like emotions in mental health, a lot of these things we don't talk about and we don't always feel really equipped and comfortable to talk about,

43
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:03,822
all of these things directly impact how much people feel like they belong in their environments,

44
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:13,452
stressors that they're dealing with in their environments. And think about these things for you, how much they affect your well-being and your everyday life.

45
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:20,392
It's important because, as you're looking at students and how they're doing, all of these things may be affecting it, all of these things

46
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:27,072
may be things they want to be able to bring into the discussion in terms of their professional identity.

47
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:32,522
And so just checking in with yourself and seeing how comfortable you feel and if there are areas of

48
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:39,212
discomfort, where you might be able to start having more of those conversations and get more comfortable.

49
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:44,082
Think about things like what emotions do you feel the most comfortable with?

50
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:52,812
Which ones make you the most uncomfortable? How do you feel about showing weakness or expressing emotion?

51
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:58,052
What does it mean to be professional during difficult times?

52
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:06,972
What's okay to talk about, what's not okay to talk about? And lastly here, just think about when you're supporting other people,

53
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:13,442
what do your boundaries and limits look like? Because this is going to be a different thing for each of us.

54
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:17,072
And when we know what we feel equipped and comfortable with,

55
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:24,062
and what falls outside of that, we're better able to figure out how to navigate this. As you're interacting with students,

56
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:30,782
I'm going to give some some guidance, but it's really going to be up to you to determine

57
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,092
how much of what they're going through

58
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:47,022
you can hold and where the limits need to be so that you feel like you're working within your lane and within your area of comfort.

59
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:52,122
One of the myths, I think, is that when we show up at school and when we show up at work,

60
00:06:52,122 --> 00:07:00,042
that it's all about keeping it professional and that caring for people personally is a kind of separate endeavor.

61
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:04,452
And we've really seen, especially recently, that that's not true.

62
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:09,492
To a degree, we can show up in our learning environments, in our professional environments as whole

63
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:15,522
people actually function better, and we produce better work.

64
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:21,642
And so think about that for yourself. How much do you feel like you have personal and professional integration?

65
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:30,132
You can be your whole self in your work environments. How much was that the case in your education?

66
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:41,512
I love this quote by Kim Scott from the book Radical Candor. "We are all human beings with human feelings, and even at work, we need to be treated as such."

67
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:49,522
So think about as you hear this, what comes up?

68
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:53,362
There're often concerns that if we talk about personal things,

69
00:07:53,362 --> 00:08:00,952
it's going to somehow become unprofessional and that's actually not true. That people actually need to know that we care.

70
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:08,332
And so think about ways that you might, in your interactions with students, give them the invitation to show up as a whole person,

71
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:16,812
to be able, within boundaries, to talk about some of the things that are coming up in their everyday life that are impacting their education,

72
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:24,892
they're impacting your well-being. And the thing about it is, whether we know it or not, we're modeling all the time.

73
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:31,912
The students don't just want information about their professional lives, they want to find out things like, do I belong?

74
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:37,882
If I'm having doubts or defeats, does that make me different?

75
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:45,122
Can I bring those things in? Can I talk about them? Is it safe? And if you've read books like,

76
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:48,202
Dare to Lead, or any of Brene Brown's work,

77
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:55,732
you know that being vulnerable, in a way that makes sense in a professional environment, is actually a really courageous thing to do.

78
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:59,392
It actually makes us healthier. It actually makes us perform better.

79
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:14,242
And so think about how comfortable you are with that and how you can kind of set the stage in your interactions to show that that's okay.

80
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:17,332
As you're doing this, I think it's important to know somethings

81
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:24,042
there's a fear that things will come up that are bigger than what you can deal with, that are outside of your training.

82
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,832
And so let's just get really clear about what's in your role, that

83
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:31,312
you have the opportunity to do, and what definitely isn't.

84
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:40,492
And then you can kind of figure out for yourself, especially within your role, what parts of this really feel like areas of strength for you.

85
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:44,572
So part of your role is to be a first responder.

86
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:50,962
You will probably hear and see things that are happening with the students, that other people might not.

87
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,292
And so in the same way that a lot of us have been trained in things like CPR,

88
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:59,062
we're not doctors, but we can show up in the moment and do some first aid.

89
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,132
It's very similar with mental health.

90
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:09,112
And hopefully in our communities at large, we're all learning kind of mental health first aid, and ways to show up as first responders,

91
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:15,952
and you'll definitely get more of that as we move through the modules. Another part of your role is just to be a role model,

92
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:21,772
to show what it's like to have everyday stressors or sometimes difficult times, to have all

93
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:27,952
of your various identities and to bring that to your work and still produce excellence,

94
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:39,102
but also have flexibility and compassion for yourself. Part of your role is to be a part of the students overall support system.

95
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:46,072
So as we'll talk about in a second, you're not the whole support system, but you're are really vital and important part of it.

96
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:53,062
As difficulties come up, one of the parts of your role is to just help students kind of think through it and problem solve,

97
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:59,932
especially when we're stressed, sometimes that can be hard to do. You can be an important source of information.

98
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:05,852
So as they're dealing with difficulties, we can point them in the direction of other resources,

99
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:12,362
or information that would be helpful for them to know as they're going through difficult times.

100
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:16,802
And then here are some of the things that are outside of the role. You don't have to be there only support,

101
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,202
that's actually not a really good setup for anyone.

102
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:28,622
I often will say that a tightrope, like one person, depending on one other person for all of their mental health needs, is not sustainable.

103
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:33,372
But a hammock is a really good way to function and have support.

104
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:41,032
So we want to help students develop hammocks, nets of care and support around them.

105
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:47,272
If you notice that you're dealing with challenges and stressors that are impeding your capacity,

106
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:51,502
that's an important thing. You may be having a really difficult mental health week,

107
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,222
and that may be a time where you need to tap somebody else on the shoulder to

108
00:11:55,222 --> 00:12:01,192
check in on the student. So noticing what your capacity is, and staying within that.

109
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:03,532
Knowing what your training is, and staying within.

110
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:12,712
So nobody's expected to be a mental health professional, but hopefully as we move through the rest of the modules, you'll have a sense of

111
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:18,722
what's within your role? What you feel comfortable with? And how to get really comfortable talking about all

112
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:24,322
of the things related to mental health and wellness in our professional lives.

113
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:27,692
So those are the things that we'll have coming up.
