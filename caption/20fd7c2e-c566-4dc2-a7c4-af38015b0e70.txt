1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,400
So today we're going to cover part. Um.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:15,060
Yeah. So it's never gonna cover most of homework number four, which is a big part of survival analysis.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:26,220
Um, we are today we're going to talk about how those ten on homework number four remember that homework for you is due November 9th.

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,860
I think I think.

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:42,510
Okay, so we are going to go through like, uh, feed the survivor model and then compare to serve our survival functions through different various test.

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,740
So, um, just a brief reminder of like, where are you at ST?

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,720
So I corresponds to the different individuals these times.

8
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,569
The II is a time for event. If the event of course C.I. is the censoring time and the s i the observe times.

9
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:12,149
Our time in the data set is the minimum between either we first observe an event in this case is then that or that.

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,049
It's a censoring time meaning that I think that's based on my cause, not have the event,

11
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,890
but I don't know because I couldn't follow up like after that point.

12
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,620
So it's either meaning one of these things and then there's side is an indicator variable that's going to take the value of one.

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:38,610
If the event of course refers then the censoring meaning in this case that that occurs first or zero if censoring occurs first.

14
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:49,620
Okay, we are using the KAPLAN-MEIER estimates to estimate the different survival functions and we are going to be with the following data set.

15
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,520
We have duration, which is our x variable here,

16
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,879
which is the timing base from the point of there are limitations to either that or censoring whichever.

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,260
Like of course, first is expressions, which is our data.

18
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,440
I it's one it is a value of 1% like data point or zero.

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,240
That's like a stop loss. And so you type three, which is like our randomization.

20
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,350
So we have two different drug groups, so one or two.

21
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,080
And then right now, which is some categorical variable that is telling was like the renal function of that patient.

22
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,100
We have 25 patients, we have survival data for 25 patients that were diagnosed with myeloma tosses.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,010
Okay, which is a type of cancer. So our data says, look, something like this.

24
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:51,150
So for example, for these are one, two, three, four, four, the first thing we need to well, we know we followed them until like 52 units of time.

25
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,640
And we know that at that point, the first one was that they were assigned to the first group and their real function was one.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:08,070
But for example, for these individuals, for the 42, meanwhile, we followed them for 852 units of time.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,809
And until that time the event has not happened, meaning that it's censoring time and they were assigned to draw number one on.

28
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,260
We have a renal function of zero, so on and so forth.

29
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,700
Is it clear how to read the dataset? Like what does it mean?

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,049
Okay, okay. So the first thing we're going to do is last log.

31
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,380
We were able to find different survival functions.

32
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,410
However, in this class we want something kind of different.

33
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:46,350
We want to fit two survival functions, one for each group, so one for people that were random randomized using drug one,

34
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,520
and then another one for people who were randomized using drug number two.

35
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,990
And then we want compare, right? Compare whether those things are the same.

36
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,510
So in size, the code is basically the same as we review last time.

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,820
So we have broke life best. This is the data.

38
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,790
This is to create the different blood survival or s create the survival plot.

39
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,190
And then this thing that I have after the common the log of logs is going to be

40
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,820
something that is useful to check for proportional hazards of hazard assumption.

41
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,120
So we have two different graphs here the survival function, the survival plot,

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:36,660
and then something that is going to be useful to check for the proportionality, proportional cause assumption we have.

43
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:45,390
We want responder errors because our equation so time because we are running us here by the model X duration times factors.

44
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,229
So like give me the survival function for each possible time between the observe time and the obstacles,

45
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,810
which is that once you know variable but we want these models for each group.

46
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,710
So that means that we're going to write. Can I get three? Which means that give me a survival function for each group.

47
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,950
Does that make sense? And then you run that and you should be getting a blood, something like this.

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,660
So he didn't have to survive. But what's so surprising, like, I'm sorry, one for each group.

49
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,190
So, for example, this blue line represents the survival for only the people who were treated with drug number one.

50
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,930
And then the red one is the survival for people who are treated with drug number.

51
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,750
What do we want to do now? We want to compare whether those two survival functions are the same.

52
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,880
There are a couple of we do a couple of way to like test for those things.

53
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:57,780
The first thing the first test that we are really the difference between these blood and these blood red you have here is the confidence intervals.

54
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,980
So is exactly the same code as I showed you before.

55
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,410
But instead of having survival part of it because you feel I just have survival of X,

56
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,030
that's just because it's like kind of easier to look it up without the confidence intervals, but is exactly the same.

57
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,090
Okay. So again, we want to compare those two survival lines.

58
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,590
Are they the same? Are they not the same? So there are a couple of ways to do is the first test is to use a low rank test.

59
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,320
This test is testing for the following. What is the survival function for the first group?

60
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,820
It's equal to the survival function of the second group and have said that the hypothesis

61
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,070
is that they are not equal and they might have to be equal for all possible times,

62
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,190
not for just one, but for all possible times.

63
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:01,450
When you run the coding skills on that, the code that I already gave you, it automatically is going to give you these plot.

64
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,270
You don't have to do anything else at this table. You don't need to do anything else in this table, which is called test of equality.

65
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,060
Already there is a test that is called the log root is going to give you the

66
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,410
score the that they statistic the degrees of freedom and of course the p bottom.

67
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,310
So for example, here we have a P value of 0.25.

68
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:30,210
This is greater than the significance alpha level that we usually use, which is 5%.

69
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:41,140
So we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Correct. Therefore, for now, for us we think that the ah the null hypothesis is the best, right.

70
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,800
Because we fail to reject what is the problem with this test.

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,400
But the long run test is very powerful.

72
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,290
If the proportional hazard assumption holds.

73
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:06,440
So in order to like make our conclusion about that hypothesis more robust, we should check for the proportional hazard assumption.

74
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,150
Remember the big love run test? It's a powerful test.

75
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,320
If the proportional hazard assumption holds.

76
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,860
If it does not help, we should try another test, which in this case they will put some Best Buy.

77
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,200
And it was before that. So we are going to check for the proportional hazards hazard assumption.

78
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:39,320
So in this case of the proportional hazard, sometimes we can check that assumption using a graph that is normally called the log of logs.

79
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,450
So normally in survival, we blood type and guess survival probability.

80
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:54,290
Right. We've looked kind of in survival probability. There's one mathematical reason behind it, but the check for the proportional hazard assumption,

81
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,330
which basically means that bin lines are parallel, the survival lines are parallel.

82
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,860
We are going to plot a different thing with it, which is the log of logs, the log of loss of the survival from any.

83
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:15,020
So instead of having survival in one axes, we're going to have the log of the love of the survival y.

84
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,140
It follows these pathological derivation.

85
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:28,280
The easy thing to do, like in trust, is very easy because at the same time that I'm asking for the survival plot,

86
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,030
I'm also asking for the log of log of the survival.

87
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:41,690
So this second argument here, it's already going to give me that log to check for the proportion plus our assumption.

88
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,250
So when you run the code in, SAS is going to give you a figure that looks something like this.

89
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,370
So here we have the log of love of this survival probability.

90
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,350
And here we have the log of the time. Same. It's kind of the same.

91
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,760
So normally in survival, we have time and survival probability.

92
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,120
Now I have log of time. Love of log of love of survival in this y axis.

93
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,120
And then this is a test that we do mainly visually.

94
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:29,620
If the two lines do not cross at all, it means that there is like a strong evidence that the proportional assumption works for my data.

95
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,000
Here, for example, in this case, we see that there is a lot of questions.

96
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,720
So there's one person here, another person here, another person here,

97
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:47,710
which means that we have evidence that the proportional assumption do not hold in this case because it does not hold.

98
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:56,559
We cannot use the inaugural test to test whether the two survival plots are the

99
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,000
same because that test only works or it's more powerful if the assumption hold.

100
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,290
However, the assumption does not help. So we should use another test.

101
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,090
That's one day wilcoxon test comes along.

102
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:25,730
So the thing is basically this. If I were to create a mental map of what I'm doing is that I have to start Bible blogs.

103
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,910
The first thing I should do is check for disproportional Hezbollah sanction is the proportional hazard assumption works.

104
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,219
So if the assumption hold. Use the log rank test because that's more powerful.

105
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:47,630
If that works. If it does not hold, which is like the case of this example that you use that would come from best.

106
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,330
Does that make sense? Then we'll go to some best practical insults.

107
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,010
You don't have to do anything because he's in the same table as the use of text is just another row.

108
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,290
Here you have a close quarter variable because quite a few things take the

109
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,260
vagaries of freedom and then the few of them we have the same conclusion here.

110
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,420
The P-value 0.61, which is greater than 5%.

111
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,750
So we have a strong evident.

112
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,540
Well, we have I mean, we failed to reject the hypothesis.

113
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:30,610
So for us to survive a lot of time like basically the same, if you look at the survival plot,

114
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,520
it seems it seems like these lines is growing, this little line, which is treatment one.

115
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,280
So patients who receive treatment one seem to have a better survival probability.

116
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,350
However, you see here at the beginning, they are very similar.

117
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:57,230
So that's what happening with the best. With the best. We are checking whether in the whole follow up period those things are the same,

118
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,900
unlike in the whole follow up period, like kind of because at the beginning they are very, very similar.

119
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,790
So that's what happening. Does that make sense? Okay.

120
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,260
So that's basically bad test that will come from for.

121
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,510
Okay. Now, another thing that we could do is compare.

122
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:37,830
Yes. So that's that's basically everything you need to know about like pest weed survival analysis.

123
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,900
So first of all, check for the proportional hazard assumption.

124
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,090
If it holds. Use the log rank pest. If it does not use, they will contact best.

125
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,820
However, we may want to like assess these survival plots in a different way.

126
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,340
This is like testing for something.

127
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:04,860
So last week we were talking about something that is very interesting in survival analysis and is to check for like sometimes.

128
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,630
So for example, we had something like we want to check our site.

129
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,700
This is 0.5, which is the median. We want to check to what like time corresponds to that 0.5.

130
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,090
Right. Which is something like. Mostly interesting for us.

131
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,370
So that's not testing or doing hypothesis test at all. That's just inferences about this thing.

132
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,370
So there's something very interesting related to that.

133
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,610
That is called the the restricted know how restrictive mean.

134
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,480
So power restricted mean. What we are going to do is that we are going to set up time.

135
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:49,920
That time we said the time ourselves. So for example, I will say how it's equal to 500.

136
00:14:51,110 --> 00:15:06,260
So 500 is like around here. Right. And what I want to do is fix this time that we do, I think this time 500 because I like the number.

137
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:16,940
And then what I want to do is like calculate the mean time, the mean survival time doing the first 500 like follow up units of time.

138
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,610
Does that make sense? Does the power restrict the mean in that we are going out again?

139
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,320
I'm going to fix up tile, which is like the follow up period.

140
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,590
In this case, I'm going to fix it to 500 because like, I don't know, I like that number.

141
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:37,880
And what I want to do is to calculate or estimate the mean survival time.

142
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:50,930
So, for example, for the right patient, if I calculate the value and that value is 457,

143
00:15:52,550 --> 00:16:03,230
this value would mean that in the first 500 units of follow up time, the average survival time for the patients in the treatment group.

144
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,070
The second treatment group is 457.

145
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,770
Does that make sense? That's what we want to do.

146
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:23,150
In the first 500 units of follow up time, the average survival time for the patients in the second group is 457.

147
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,750
That's what that's the number that we want to find. We want to find for a given.

148
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,390
Tao, what is this number? Okay, so that's called towel restricted means.

149
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:46,270
All right. So. And then check for something here.

150
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:01,950
Okay. So for the thoracic, that means in size the cold looks mostly the same.

151
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,910
So when we have our pro life, that is, we have data, we have our different plots.

152
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:15,570
And then here we are going to use something that is our SD and we are going to set in parentheses the Taliban.

153
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,740
In this case I'm using 200, but remember that that's up to you.

154
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,729
And then the code follows most of the same logic.

155
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:31,120
I defined my minor, which is fine duration time is that does give me that cervical function for each treatment route.

156
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,990
And then here these people all will compute like the difference between those two.

157
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,090
How means for the two groups. Okay so if we do not.

158
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,670
We will have something. If we do that, this is not the time.

159
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,370
If we do that, we will have something like this. We will have an output that looks something like this.

160
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
So for each stratum, which is one and two, we will have that estimate.

161
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:11,470
So these 132, for example, means that for the first 200 units of follow up time, the average.

162
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:20,920
Survival time is one half hour. They do for this part as a group and then as this is an estimate where of course,

163
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,390
we also have like this number error and we have the same for the second group.

164
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:33,820
Given those two values, something that is very interesting or appealing to us is to compute the following hypothesis.

165
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:41,860
So we are interested in the no hypothesis being that those two values are the same against the alternative hypothesis,

166
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,210
which means with this before, it means that those two values are not the same for the different groups.

167
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,580
So I want to confirm whether this time it's similar to this time or not to do that.

168
00:18:52,570 --> 00:19:04,600
This is the first statistic. So the first estimate minus the second estimate is divided over the square root of the variance.

169
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,380
So that's why we have this number error, a square.

170
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:18,940
So for example, in this case, this value here will one will be 132.8.

171
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,590
This value here will be 136.5.

172
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,930
The standard error of MU is 23 point will be 23.4.

173
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,300
And I need to square this.

174
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:49,690
And then the second guy here will be 21.72 and then I need to square this and then you can compute this value of like my most correct source.

175
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:56,860
If you do this equal all, you will have this table.

176
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,960
This table is computed that is comparing these best manually.

177
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:12,130
So you have the difference, which is like the thing that in many nominator you have based on that error, which is the think in the denominator.

178
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:24,340
You also have like these chi square variable detectors but basic I'm sorry, and the probability of and the p value here.

179
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,030
In this case we are we obtain a P-value of 0.9, which is really not 5% or so.

180
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:36,969
We failed to reject meaning that we do evidence that we have so far.

181
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,210
We believe that those Tao restricted means are missing.

182
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,030
Does that make sense? Any questions so far?

183
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,470
Okay. Okay.

184
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,580
So the last thing we are going to talk about, it's especially something that concerns us users.

185
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:16,770
So for example, if we go back to the data thread, we have three is a variable that we are using, but we also have, for example, rental.

186
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,640
So if I were to use this second variable,

187
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:27,809
I would also want like survival plot one for people who have like zero renal function and

188
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:33,390
another people who have like one renal function and then compute the same analysis that we did,

189
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,870
right? This is like a small example in the sense that we only have two covariates,

190
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,460
but we will have multiple covariance and that only we could have more than two covariance, but also more levels in each covariance.

191
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,450
So let's say, for example, that instead of having only zero one renal function, I can have zero one, two, three, four.

192
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,290
Then I like to do like all of those analyzes. Again, it can be like.

193
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,870
Kind of repetitive. So again, this is only concern for sassy users.

194
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:16,680
So in that case, I could create something that is called a source macro in my head as far as macro is like doing a loop in the same thing.

195
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:26,040
So running the code multiple times, that's what I'm like based on like running the same code multiple times, changing just a parameter in my code.

196
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:34,470
So for example, I could do something like this. So I, you know, I want to compare the life test, different life test.

197
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,780
But instead of coming here, this track will be one of the three, which is what I have before.

198
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,930
I want to change it to another covariant in my in my dataset.

199
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:55,650
So, for example, renal function. So what could I do is just like run a macro which is like, for example, benchmark and 1% touch.

200
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,280
And within the macro I have my proc life test.

201
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,210
And the only thing is going to change is that here in this stuff, I'm going to change these.

202
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,590
I don't want this to be arbitrary. I'm just want to leave it as a variable that I could change after that.

203
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:17,070
So it works like some some kind of function. So I have for the term name, which is something that I'm going to define.

204
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,889
And here I also have predictor name. If I run this, then I can run a code.

205
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,150
That is something like in this case, my macro is called test.

206
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:37,880
So I could I could call. Percent Bush passed, which is calling Democrats on important cause history.

207
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:46,790
What that is going to do is like is going to go here. This particular name is going to be mostly street and then here is going to be three.

208
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,170
So it's going to be code for the defense or by vote slots for three.

209
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,730
And I can do the same for the original function. So if I don't, if I run the second line, find this, he's right.

210
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,049
Now what he's going to do is like it's going to instead of predicting name is going to go right now here and then if

211
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:10,790
you had this thought I'd be now so that's how we do like ultimate price decode goes that makes sense a little bit.

212
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,180
You don't have to do it. Definitely. You can just copy the post and like change the name of the variable.

213
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,610
But I think you see a solid you have multiple, multiple variables and you don't want to do it by hand.

214
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,300
This is a very easy way to do it. Okay.

215
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,390
Now, that's everything in fresh from let's talk about how to do the same things you are

216
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:46,270
saying are we need we don't have it here which is kind of out is definitely my fault.

217
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,400
Remember that we need the survival package so if you don't have it installed package survival on the library supplies.

218
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,260
Once you have installed this survival package, just use the function sort of feet.

219
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,020
The function is going to receive a parameter which is like the formula for our.

220
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,700
For the survival function that we want. So sorry.

221
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Here I have time. I have my back, my indicator variable, and then I want the sample drop function by treat.

222
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,510
So I wanted these several function by treat.

223
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:40,460
So give me one survival for each of the levels of these five of these viable do I do using the kaplan-meier estimate?

224
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,410
These are my estimate errors and this is my data frame.

225
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:52,560
And then you can just do summary of survival function in just so I observe the survival function, you're going to have something like this.

226
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:03,870
So this is the table for the people in the first treatment group and this is the table for the people in the second treatment group, which is table.

227
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,309
But we can read the same as we did last time.

228
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,550
So for example for people in the second treatment group.

229
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:24,600
Mm. The probability of surviving, of survival after 20 to 23 units of time is 0.320.769.

230
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:34,050
Okay. So for people in the seconds remains open. The probability of surviving after 23 units of time is 0.769.

231
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,800
And then to create the plot, just use the plot function.

232
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:52,800
You have your survival data here. You can change the levels of the x axis on here at the Y one to unlock one.

233
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,370
What he's doing is creating two life lines, one for treatment, one and one from treatment.

234
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,560
And as you can see, it's basically the same plot as we put in using sex.

235
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:11,340
Does that make sense? Okay. So that's as far for the plot.

236
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,460
This is using only the survival package.

237
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,210
There is another package that you can use.

238
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,840
You can use whichever you think is like easier.

239
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:38,100
There's one which is called SA minor. I mean, so if minor instead of using lot of the thing, we are going to use the function jig sa plot.

240
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:47,610
And then the object here is like my SA beat sa ft model.

241
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,640
But just Ubisoft, like kind of different representation of love, of loving is exactly the same.

242
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,520
However, there are a couple friends, for example, that you can see that this is like a little cleaner,

243
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,740
less mind, like easy to, um, easy on the eyes, I say.

244
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:18,670
But you can use whatever you want. And if you want the confidence intervals, you can also audit using these here.

245
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
Of this line here.

246
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:33,870
You can also get the confidence intervals now for the different low grams test results of test type for the proportional hazards assumption.

247
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,960
For the low. Actually, for both this, we are going to use the Saab.

248
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,670
This function is going to receive the same model that we had before.

249
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,720
It is going to receive the data set. And the last part is the really important part.

250
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:07,070
Mm hmm. If we set the parameter role, equal to zero is going to give you the low log run test.

251
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,790
Okay. And then you use the print off.

252
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,820
My value here is the range of that.

253
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,830
The output is going to look something like this. So you have the first with mangrove, the second third mangrove.

254
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,130
And then here at the bottom of this table, you have the courage.

255
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,910
What about like does the best is the basic and you get the P value, which is 0.25.

256
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,810
But if you compare to the source output, it's exactly the same.

257
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,940
If we use a 5% significant level, we reject the null hypothesis.

258
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,070
We believe those survival functions are the same.

259
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,350
The only difference? Yeah. There's absolutely no defense witness.

260
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:04,260
Okay. So this test is powerful and we should use it if the proportional assumption holds.

261
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:15,230
So we should check for the how to check for not base r use the plug function this sort of data to.

262
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:24,960
Here is the function. So feed. So when I feed my model, I save it in something that is called source data.

263
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,540
So coming back to that, this is my model. The very important part is said the.

264
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,190
Function. Oops. Wait. Save.

265
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:52,530
So the important part is to include the following line function see normal, which is basically mean means.

266
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,760
Instead of giving me the survival function, give me the love of luck.

267
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,520
You know what? We have love of the ocean and then love of love of survival probability.

268
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,070
And then the rest of the code is basically the same as the other blood.

269
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:17,550
We have exactly the same conclusion as before because these lines are crossing in multiple places.

270
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:25,250
Here, here, here. You can see that those two lines are crossing the proportional hazard assumption.

271
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:31,499
We have a stronger evidence that is violated. Therefore, we should not use the log rank test.

272
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,969
We should use that wilcoxon test using the order package.

273
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:44,310
Remember that we have to package to plot using this sort of minor package.

274
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:55,800
You can also get the same plot. Just make sure you use functions c lug nut so you can do it using both packages.

275
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,440
And then the wilcoxon test is exactly the same as before.

276
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:08,970
This is exactly the same code. The only difference is that here I said raw, equal to one.

277
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:15,990
So if you want the log run, log run test set, grow equal to zero.

278
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,980
If you want the Wilkinson fixed, set equal to one.

279
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,780
On that site. Same code just changed that 2 to 1 for the Wolverhampton Fest.

280
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:35,410
We get the ten trains that same week at the same table we have the chi square variable, the p value.

281
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:48,669
These three value is kind of different, but the source output bus is going to be valid for like your converse difference is like we got we have seen

282
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:56,110
so far in this course that if you use SaaS you get like kind of some answer when you use you if you use R,

283
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:04,000
you can you can get like a different one. That's probably because of how our is coded, not less.

284
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,080
This is always for us, that's probably because of how our is coded.

285
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,330
But the difference is not too much. So like for the sake of the homework.

286
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,190
Examine 523. You can use both buttocks.

287
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,020
Hmm. Oh, no, that's not it.

288
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,730
I mean, these are things that are art.

289
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,700
We need to look at the powers that be. Oh, so that's very easy.

290
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:44,440
Brain function. My source data, which is defeated model for the survival plot.

291
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:50,210
And then this thing that I have in red, which is crystal methamphetamine.

292
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,590
And this is this how about you that you can change in this case, I'm displaying at 230.

293
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,070
If you do print, the output is going to look something like this.

294
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,820
So for example, for the first three men, this group.

295
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:16,510
For the first 200 units of follow off time of follow up time, the mean survival time is 132.

296
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:26,740
Same value as sex. And then here you can calculate the statistic by hand using the formula that we previously saw.

297
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:36,670
So your one minus need to. Which are these two values divided by the square root of the square of these laws?

298
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:42,530
These are square and the square root of that divide those two values, and then you get the fastest topics.

299
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:53,200
These follow a normal distribution so you can compare with the 95%, the 95 percentile of a normal distribution.

300
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,280
Okay. This is kind of sad to have to do it by hand.

301
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:12,210
You don't have to do it by hand. There's a package in the door set for you, but this has a defined one so you can use these library.

302
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:19,530
So our end tool, we are going to create a new variable.

303
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:29,900
So this is a variable for treatment one. This is my data friend, my dataframe, my symbol three equal to one.

304
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:36,150
So that means that I only want the individuals who are assigned to the first treatment.

305
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,460
And then I'm just going to times one which is just like, give me a one for those.

306
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,890
And that we have to do it because of the way these libraries code it.

307
00:35:52,130 --> 00:36:01,400
Right now, treatment for us is either one or two. However, the way this treatment, these library works, it cannot take volumes one and two.

308
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,940
It can only takes 2 to 1. So I have to record that.

309
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,450
That's why. But that's very easy. Just like those days.

310
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:19,220
That's very easy. Notice that these is nothing and then just use our SD to function.

311
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,010
This is the sort of. This is the observed time. This is my delta.

312
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:41,200
So my indicator by over whether that subject died or like it's a sensor time my new recorded variable here and then said the time for the top setting.

313
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,410
However, like the time to receive the means, said the Talabani.

314
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,200
And that's it. If you run this, the output is going to be something like this.

315
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:03,750
No, I'd like to. But he says that while all that you're looking for the last call and very closely,

316
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,080
this is a given, you know, it's very similar to whatever we had in size 0.9, bigger than 5%.

317
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,740
So I failed to reject 4200. I believe those means hard to see.

318
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:25,410
On that seat. Okay with that?

319
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,370
You can definitely start with homework number four.
