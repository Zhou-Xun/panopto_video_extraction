00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,500
This is 826. Chapter two Maximum Likelihood Estimation Part one.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:17,690
So I want to start by thinking about a simple problem where we have a coin, let's say one of the euro coins that is possibly fair or possibly unfair.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:28,010
And we want to test that with real data. So what's the probability that spinning of a coin has the probability of 50% of getting heads?

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,910
Let's say you spin the coin 100 times to get some data.

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,540
You get each number of heads. Then what's your best guess at the probability of heads?

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,900
Do you just go with 50%? Do you choose something else?

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:53,210
The intuition here is that if you get each heads out of 100 is that you would guess that the probability of heads is 80 divided by 100.

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:02,750
Hopefully you got that intuition just off the top of your head. If I spent a coin 100 times, you get 20 heads, you think, well, maybe it's 20%.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,659
And that is the fundamental idea of maximum likelihood estimation that out of all possible parameter values,

10
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,460
you choose the value that is most likely to produce the observed data.

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,870
And it's actually a much more profound thought than you give yourself credit for.

12
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,690
And we're going to explore this a little more with some math, with some graphs, with some examples.

13
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,270
So choosing an estimated value of the probability,

14
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:44,780
which I denote P hat as an estimate H divided by 100 is not the only possible answer because he's measured with some uncertainty,

15
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,969
but out of all possible values of p h over 100 is the most likely to produce the observed result.

16
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,560
So let's observe. Let's go through this a little more carefully with the simplest example I can think of.

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,930
We spent a coin twice. First we get heads, then we get tails.

18
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,340
Oh, okay. So what's the probability of that outcome?

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:18,380
Suppose that instead of a fair coin, the actual outcome, the actual probability of heads is 10% or 0.1.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,810
Let's look at the first column of the table. P is the probability of heads.

21
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,150
If the probability of heads is 10% 2.1, then the probability of tails.

22
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:39,050
The second outcome is 90% 4.9. So the probability of first getting heads and then getting tails is the product of 0.1 and point nine, which is 0.09.

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,620
On the other hand, if the probability of heads is 20%, it's actually much more likely to get the outcome of heads and then tails.

24
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,219
It's 20% than 80%. The product of this probability is .16.

25
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:59,510
Actually, 30% is is even more likely 0.3 times point seven is 0.21 and so forth.

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,210
If you go all the way up to point five, that is going to give you the highest value of P times one minus P,

27
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,970
which is the expression for what we actually observe the probability of heads and then the probability of tails.

28
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:24,520
If. If the true probability is a half, then 2.5 times 0.5 is 0.25.

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:32,270
That is the largest value of all of the expression that we observe p times one minus p.

30
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,680
Any other value that we guess of P is going to get us a smaller predicted probability of the outcome.

31
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,250
Let's do this for a slightly more interesting problem with the coin spins.

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,620
And let's say out of 100, we only get 45 heads, not 50.

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,980
So how does that work? Well, now let's think of got a couple of things to consider here.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,150
We've got the probability of heads. Probability of tails.

35
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,110
We also have many different ways that we can order those heads and tails out of one.

36
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:14,870
And we know how to do that now. So the the expression then for the observed probability of getting, say,

37
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:26,390
45 heads and 55 tails is 100, choose 45 times p raise to the 45 times one minus P raised to the 55.

38
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,159
The probability of getting 45 heads is P.

39
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,450
Each time you multiply all this together, you get p raised to the 45 and so forth,

40
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,670
and the choose part allows you to put them in all the possible combinations of orders,

41
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,740
first heads and then tails and back and forth in many different ways.

42
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:54,410
Okay. If you evaluate that expression for different values of P as as shown in the table,

43
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,950
you'll see that 0.45 gets you the largest value of that expression.

44
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:09,080
Any other value of P will get you a smaller number again of all possible values of

45
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:18,830
P from 0 to 1.45 is the value that makes it most likely to have the observed data,

46
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,370
which is 45 heads out of 100 for reasons that will be clear in a few slides.

47
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:35,750
I'm also going to take the natural logarithm of that whole expression, not not seemingly to make it harder,

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,200
but actually, as you'll find later, this actually is going to make the math easier.

49
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,309
Believe it or not, you'll see here that the natural logarithm is what's called a monotonic transformation,

50
00:05:49,310 --> 00:06:04,070
that as as the probability increases 2.45 and then beyond the expression in the second column goes up and then down in the same way,

51
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,240
the natural log of that expression goes up and then down the highest value.

52
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,500
Again, it peaks at 0.454 values -2.5258849.

53
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,920
Let's take a look at a graph of those two expressions.

54
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,480
The top graph, the bell shaped curve is the the graph corresponding to the second column.

55
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:36,120
And the lower graph, which is like an upside down bowl, corresponds to the natural logarithm of that.

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,070
You see that both of them peak out at p equals 0.45,

57
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:52,890
but they do have slightly different shapes and the nice concave curvature of the lower graph, it turns out, will be important mathematically.

58
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:05,310
Okay. So when I give you a simple coin problem, like, you know, 45 heads out of 100, guess the value of P, you can do that very easily in your head.

59
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,070
You don't need any math. It turns out, though, that for any problem of real interest, perhaps for your dissertation,

60
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:25,020
we're going to have a more complicated expression and we need a way to solve this for values of P or beta or any other parameter we're interested in.

61
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,429
So we're going to write up what I call a recipe for a solved problem.

62
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,490
That's how to write a likelihood function and then solve it.

63
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,679
And then we'll use this in several different examples. So here's the recipe.

64
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,600
We're going to write a likelihood function in terms of P or in terms of the parameter that we care about.

65
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,150
We're going to take the the natural logarithm of that likelihood function.

66
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:58,950
Then we'll take the derivative of of the logarithm of the likelihood function with respect to P will set the derivative equal to zero.

67
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,459
Now setting the derivative equal to zero means the slope is zero.

68
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,250
So going back to these graphs, it allows you to find the value of P where you're at the top.

69
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:18,400
And where you're finding the peak value of the likelihood function. In other words, find the maximum value of the likelihood function.

70
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:27,100
That's why it's called maximum likelihood estimation. And finally, the last step is to check for what are called second order conditions.

71
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:37,780
You probably remember from calculus that if you have these curves that perhaps go up and then down and then up again,

72
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:45,280
you might find when you take the derivative set equal to zero, you might find a local maximum or even a local minimum.

73
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:55,810
So we want a shape that's like the lower one where it's very clear that if you find a flat point, you're at the max.

74
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,870
It's called checking the second order conditions. You want to make sure that the value is negative, that means you're at a maximum.

75
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,620
So let's do this for a simple binomial problem.

76
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:18,370
Write down the probability or the likelihood function p raised to the h h is the number of heads.

77
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,309
One minus p is the probability of tails. Little T is the number of tails.

78
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,800
So heads plus tails are h, plus t is the total number of coin spins.

79
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:40,660
Take the natural logarithm of that. H comes down in front and log of p, t comes down front and log of one minus p takes the derivative of that.

80
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,240
When you take the derivative of log of p, that's one over p, so h times one over p.

81
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,260
For the second part, don't forget taking the derivative of what's inside the parentheses that gets you the minus sign.

82
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,070
When you solve that out, you get the final expression P hat is equal to H over H plus T.

83
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:09,410
In other words, how many heads did you get divided by the total number of coin spins, for example 45 divided by 100.

84
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,970
So all that work gets us back to the intuition that we had originally.

85
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,440
The fifth step is to take the second derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to p o.

86
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,720
So to go back to step three, take one more derivative.

87
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,530
Don't forget the minus sign. There's particularly the second term.

88
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,420
It turns out that there are three minus signs, two to keep track of.

89
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,140
You should end up with both terms, with minus signs in front of them being negative, the whole expression is negative.

90
00:10:45,620 --> 00:11:01,040
That tells you that for all values of P that the likelihood function is is nicely shaped and where you find the derivative equal to zero,

91
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,090
that will be a maximum value, not a minimum or point of inflection.

92
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,930
Okay. The choose from. Did you notice the choose function disappeared?

93
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,839
Let's go back to step one. Likelihood function P to the H one minus P.

94
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,360
The T is no choose function. There's nothing there about ordering.

95
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay, well, all right. Suppose that you didn't leave it out at the beginning, and you included the choose part.

96
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,060
Once you get to step three and take a derivative with respect to P.

97
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,250
It'll disappear. The cheese function does not have P in it anywhere.

98
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,879
So if you wanted to start with likelihood function with the choose part, take the log of that.

99
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,700
That makes it a separate term. Take the derivative of the log of the choose function with respect to P Snoopy and there it falls out.

100
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,820
It's gone. Okay.

101
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:08,870
And if you think about it, any time you've run a regression or logit model, you don't really care what order your data are in.

102
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,420
You don't care whether data on this patient comes before or after that patient ordering.

103
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,810
Rarely matters unless you have panel data. And that's a different issue.

104
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,770
So we don't need to choose part that actually is going to make our life simpler.

105
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:32,780
All right. Let's go through another simple example and and use this machinery that we've set up

106
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:41,180
so we have binomial Howells that is a an owl goes out to catch mice for its chicks.

107
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:49,780
We observe how often an owl is successful. What's the probability p that an owl successfully catches a mouse on any given attempt?

108
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,880
So suppose that the biologist observes 60 times the owl goes out and tries to catch a mouse.

109
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,260
Out of those 60 times the owl is successful.

110
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:10,760
15. Now you your brain hopefully is jumping immediately to well, my best guess of p hat is 15 divided by 60 or one fourth.

111
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,060
That is the right answer. Now, let's go through and do the math and make sure we get the right answer with the math.

112
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:27,400
So we write the likelihood function. The probability of a success which is catching a mouse is P that's observed 15 times

113
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:36,170
who it's p to the 15 one minus P unsuccessful probability that happens 45 times.

114
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:43,399
So take the natural logarithm of that. Take the derivative of that solve for p we get one fourth.

115
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll let you do the math on your own. It's important that you understand step by step how to do this.

116
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:01,490
So and then taking the second derivative of the third line with respect to P, you should get again a negative expression.

117
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,360
So now let's use the geometric function that we learned in the first chapter.

118
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:16,320
Let's say five people purchase instant lottery tickets, but this time they have.

119
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:25,140
They have an interesting algorithm. They'll keep buying a lottery ticket, an instant lottery ticket until they actually win.

120
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,210
So the first person buys six losing tickets and then finally on the seventh ticket, they finally win.

121
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,080
So they buy a total of seven. The last one is the winning ticket.

122
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,760
The next person buys 11 losing tickets. And on the 12th time they're successful.

123
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,660
The next person buys 11 tickets total, ten losing, one winning and so forth.

124
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,250
And so every person ends up with one winning lottery ticket.

125
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,570
The very last one. And they buy a bunch of losing tickets.

126
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,050
Up until then, we're trying to figure out the probability of winning. So let's write out the likelihood function now for each.

127
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:16,209
Let's take the first person. So in the second row of this expression, they buy six losing tickets.

128
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,720
So the probability of that is one minus P raised to the six times P,

129
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,979
the probability of winning on the seventh try the next person buys 11 losing tickets,

130
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,360
and then a winning next person buys ten losing and then one winning and so forth.

131
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:40,810
So we can write out this big expression in terms of one minus P and P, lots of super scripts and exponents.

132
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:53,290
And then if you simplify it down and collect terms, we end up with among the five of them, we have five winning tickets and 50 losing tickets.

133
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,400
So one minus P refers to the 50 P raise to the five.

134
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,140
Take the natural logarithm of that the derivative solve.

135
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:10,900
For P hat we get one over 11. So again, if you think about it, there were 55 total tickets, spot five winning tickets.

136
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:17,360
That's five over 55. All the math gets us back to our intuition.

137
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
And again, the second derivative gets us a negative quantity.

138
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,190
Let's go next to using the Poisson model.

139
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:35,390
Carl Sagan, the the astronomer, uses the Hubble telescope to look for life in other solar systems.

140
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,330
And so there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy.

141
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,469
And let's say he finds 14 that have life.

142
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:54,260
So it's a very small number. And so because we have a very small probability, we can use the person function.

143
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,070
Then he uses the Hubble Hubble telescope to search for life in solar systems beyond our galaxy,

144
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,210
five other galaxies of similar size so that they have 100 billion stars.

145
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,000
And he finds life in 221, zero six and five.

146
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,070
Okay, so what's the expected number of planets with life in the solar system?

147
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:24,290
Remember that for this setup we're going to have an extra parameter mu which equals N 100 billion times P.

148
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,240
That's the number we're looking for. It's the probability of life in the solar system.

149
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,900
Okay, so we're going to use the person because we can and the probability is really small.

150
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:44,970
And okay, this looks ugly, but if you break it down, it's a little easier.

151
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:54,980
We have observations on six galaxies, our own solar system, our own our own Milky Way galaxy, plus five others.

152
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:05,959
And the person expression remembers e to the minus mu mu res to the x,

153
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,130
which is the number of positive cases or solar systems with life all divided by x factorial.

154
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:24,440
So we can rewrite this as e to the minus six mu six because there are six galaxies.

155
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:34,670
MU refers to the sum of all the axes. So that would be 14 221, zero six and five.

156
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,240
And then and then in the denominator we have big x factorial.

157
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,460
Remember again that zero factorial is one, not zero.

158
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,450
If we then take the natural log of that, actually, in some ways this becomes a little easier.

159
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:03,740
We have minus six mu. We have sum of all the Xs times, log of new and minus the log of the x factorial.

160
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,590
Now we're trying to solve this expression in terms of music first and then we'll we'll back out from that.

161
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,450
So it turns out that out of those three expressions in the second row,

162
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,880
only two of them have immune at the last term that the denominator with X factorial.

163
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:35,500
That's irrelevant, as it turns out, that that expression has no mew in it, so it's not part of the optimization.

164
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,690
So when you take a derivative of minus six meu with respect to me, you just get minus six.

165
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,690
Derivative of log of meu gets you one over meu.

166
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:53,980
And then actually that isn't that hard to solve. It's, it's the sum of all the Xs divided by six and we get eight.

167
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,120
So that says on average a galaxy of,

168
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:10,000
of size of our galaxy has eight solar systems with life in it or eight out of 100 billion is, is the estimated probability.

169
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,550
And again, if you do the second derivative, you get a negative expression.

170
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,040
Finally, we'll do a negative binomial model.

171
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,790
So suppose you have a door to door salesman on commission and he works until he makes four sales in a day.

172
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,830
So he keeps going and selling. If he gets to the fourth sale and calls it a day and goes home,

173
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:42,040
what's the probability that t that the salesman makes a sale each visit and the here we have a data of

174
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,540
remember that the way we define things for the negative binomial is the number of extra visits each day.

175
00:20:49,990 --> 00:21:03,250
So the first salesperson has 14 extra attempts at making a sale, plus the four that actually work him where he or she makes a sale.

176
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:10,840
So we have a total of 18 attempts to make a sale for those are successful and so forth.

177
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,540
Second has 17 attempts that are unsuccessful and four successful.

178
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,650
The third person is the most successful. They only have 13 failed attempts making a sale.

179
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:33,429
Okay, so again, we can write this out first individual terms for each salesperson key to the fourth,

180
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,999
because every salesperson is successful four times, but they are unsuccessful for different numbers.

181
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,530
So one minus P to the 14 for the second person, that's one minus P to the 17.

182
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:55,840
If you collect terms, it turns out that collectively they make 20 sales and they are unsuccessful 80 times.

183
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,790
So think quickly, you know right away that it's going to be 20 out of 100.

184
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,040
And yes, if you do the math, you get exactly that. That's the end of the first part.
