1
00:00:24,420 --> 00:02:52,080
So my place. Good morning.

2
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,630
Good morning, everybody. Good to see you again.

3
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,090
We're almost to the weekend.

4
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:16,379
So today we're going to be talking about the second half of what conceptually is undergirding how we talk about evaluation in this class,

5
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:27,990
which is to act to evaluation approaches, cultural response or culturally responsive evaluation and equitable evaluation.

6
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:40,860
These are two different but related approaches, and typically there is some overlap in terms of practice so that an evaluator.

7
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,600
Who typically adapts. These are one approach in their practices, adapting another one.

8
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,650
So we'll be talking about that and how that speaks, if you will, to the CDC's framework.

9
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,560
Just a quick amount of quick view announcements.

10
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,690
So one. If you haven't got a chance to fill out the interest survey survey that I sent out last week on canvas.

11
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,950
Today is your last day because I will be going through the names today.

12
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,910
So if you haven't had a chance to express, you know,

13
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:33,160
an interest in working with somebody in particular or anything of that nature that I should know before we group, please fill it out today.

14
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,950
Second thing, office hours. So, Hanna, who?

15
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,230
The GSI for this course who you met on last week.

16
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:54,790
And by the way, she she has a conflict. The reason why she won't be here, every class period is that she has another class that's conflicting and.

17
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:05,260
So I'm okay with her watching lectures and being available otherwise for office hours.

18
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,380
And her office hours will be Thursday to the three over Zoom.

19
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,680
And we're going to send this and an announcement, too. So don't worry, there will be some canvas proof of what I'm saying.

20
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,120
And then just a reminder that mine are on Tuesdays from 1130 to 12 over or by appointment.

21
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:36,310
Those will be in-person. Once I reserve a room in this building, then I will send the announcement with both Hannah and I's information,

22
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:44,260
which will come in time because we're getting close to the first assignment, which I will be talking about next week.

23
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,110
Which is an email assignment I'm excited about. It's the first time I'm trying it out.

24
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,130
It's a way of practicing engagement. Believe it or not, a lot of engagement happens over e-mail.

25
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:09,370
And that's it for announcements. Before I get I'm obviously for the agenda today we're doing announcements

26
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,850
review and then we'll talk through CRE one through the cultural responsiveness.

27
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,130
Then that equitable approach. Then we'll talk about how those speak with the CBC's framework.

28
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,640
I'm going to give you a heads up that today is lecture.

29
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:38,410
It is kind of dense. So it's okay if you're like, I have no idea what this lady is talking about.

30
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,560
It is very dense material.

31
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:51,130
Even those of us who have been practicing in this way for a while still have, you know, you know, are still in the learning spirit.

32
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,620
So I've tried to make the slides a little bit more wordy than they usually are in their

33
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,280
effort to give you multiple ways of engaging back and looking back at the material.

34
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,180
In addition to the readings. Something.

35
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,120
And so I you know, I warn you something that my husband says when I'm talking too much.

36
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:22,670
He says, my waffle is full and I won't give you the long story why he says that, but it means that he's had enough.

37
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,470
Yet if your waffle feels full today. Feel free.

38
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,650
It's normal. It's to be expected.

39
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:39,440
Like I said, some of these concepts we've been going through, even as practicing evaluators, just continually thinking through them.

40
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:47,060
But I do want to give you a good, solid grounding. So, you know, the justification of why I say things that I say throughout the rest of the course.

41
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:57,020
So on to review. Tuesday we talked about our role first before I jump in, any questions.

42
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,550
There are logistical matters about anything.

43
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,600
Okay. So Tuesday we talked about the CDC program evaluation framework.

44
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:22,680
And remember, a framework is really just a structure of that known material and knowledge is placed on it.

45
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,050
And so this framework is not necessarily producing anything theoretically new.

46
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:35,130
What it's doing is taking what we have already established this practice and organizing

47
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:42,120
it in a way that gives you kind of a system or steps to work through six steps,

48
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:52,410
engage stakeholders, describe programs, focus, evaluate, design, gather credible evidence, justify conclusions,

49
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:59,280
and use and share lessons learned as we since we're going through the steps later on.

50
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:07,550
That's all I'll say about it. That, and it's a nonlinear framework, so you can skip from steps to step.

51
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,290
All right. Who's ready to jump in? Ooh.

52
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,309
Um, so I'll start by saying that, you know, in the beginning of a course,

53
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,160
I talked a little bit about the history of evaluation and how it emerged from social science research,

54
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:34,710
particularly education, and also as it emerged as a field of its own.

55
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:43,050
Saw a lot connected. Connected a lot to government accountability efforts.

56
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,780
And so evaluation is really part of our structural systems.

57
00:09:49,800 --> 00:10:01,620
You know, the particularly we've seen it used a lot in government in terms of resource allocation and program development.

58
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:11,940
And so because it is part of structural systems, it can either promote equity or it can promote equity.

59
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:21,540
And so the two approaches that we're talking about today are really responding to what some are seeing in the field,

60
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,400
which is that evaluation in many ways was promoting an equity.

61
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:43,820
In part because evaluation, like many things and our culture, were affected by a hegemonic white supremacy.

62
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:57,990
Approach to knowledge production. And so part of the challenge to this was about thinking about ways that we saw white supremacy,

63
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,960
white supremacy culture emerge into research and evaluation.

64
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,969
So, for example, for those who have spent some time and any research methods,

65
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,160
course you've learned that there's one valid way of looking at something.

66
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:33,240
And so that typically means that there's a supposed trained and objective eye that is able to mitigate all bias and able to.

67
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
From there, understand one truth.

68
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,550
And so some of that has manifested also in terms of evaluation production.

69
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:53,150
So for example, worship of the written word, you know, thinking about where.

70
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,960
Something is published to make it valid. For example, if it's on a peer reviewed journal, it's not valid.

71
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:08,600
If it's not written, it's valid. Which undermines cultural norms of other marginalized cultures,

72
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:19,940
such as indigenous cultures whose way of passing down information is not necessarily written but is oral.

73
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,890
Another way this idea of paternalism which leads to power hoarding.

74
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,990
You know, we talked about the idea of the expertize of the scientists.

75
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:41,810
When I first came, I remember when I first came here as a not as a master student, but as a grad student.

76
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,540
One of the first things that they have a cohort of us do is sit in a room.

77
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,690
And what I think. The leaders at best.

78
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,260
That's what it is. Right. Chant where the leaders and the best where the leaders and the best.

79
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:06,500
You know, that's a cult, you know, building a cultural norm around the idea that we are the smartest in the room.

80
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,760
Anyway, if you're shaking your head about that, it's crazy. It's like we're the leaders of the past.

81
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,350
It was kind of weird, but I still remember it.

82
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,780
You know, that leads to a sense of paternal paternalism, this idea that as we see it in public health all the time, we know everything.

83
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,050
We know what you should do. It made COVID response interesting.

84
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:47,830
But I'll stop there. So the prep approaches that I'm talking about today have actually emerged in the response

85
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,130
to that kind of evaluation culture and that about that mindset toward evaluation.

86
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,520
And so the two things that we're talking about are cultural responsiveness and equity.

87
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,020
Now, these two things are not the same. They're related, but they're not the same.

88
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,460
A cultural, responsive lens in the evaluation is really attuned to ensuring that the elements

89
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,920
of evaluation reflect the cultural group or groups that are subjects of the study.

90
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,780
So, for example, if I'm doing a presentation.

91
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:31,030
About evaluation results and the evaluation took place in the Somalian community.

92
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,210
We're going to make sure that our pictures reflect that.

93
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:43,030
We'll make sure that the language of any dissemination materials is one that is the language of the community.

94
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:52,720
And then an equity lens is more attuned for ensuring the evaluation process and outcomes are purposefully.

95
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,020
And that's a key. We're purposefully promoting equity.

96
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,880
So it's gone beyond the, you know, sense that a group is represented or groups are represented.

97
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,310
And it's really about aiming to dismantle structures that create inequity.

98
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:22,380
So when? What does it mean to say that something is dismantling in equity, in process and outcome?

99
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,860
So to first give you some kind of grounding and what I mean by that here, I offer some framing definitions.

100
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,750
And that the definitions that I'm sharing, they are particularly attuned to race.

101
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:51,190
And in many ways that's. Kind of a function of how discussions in this space started, which were centered on race.

102
00:15:51,610 --> 00:16:01,840
So it doesn't preclude this idea applying to other social inequities, such as ability or those related to sexual identity.

103
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,469
It's just that when these conversations began, they began thinking about race,

104
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:16,930
because race is a construct in the US where a lot of this work started in the US is very.

105
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,420
Tied to the structural systems that we see today that are promoting equity that they have been.

106
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,720
Structured and built around the idea of inequality by race.

107
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,700
You can also say by gender and etc., etc. and I'm happy to have discussions about why.

108
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:51,520
You know why many put race first. But I won't get into it today because your waffles are really going to be full.

109
00:16:52,690 --> 00:17:00,370
But suffice to say that some framing definitions when we talk about equity is an outcome.

110
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:07,810
What we're saying is that ultimately a social identity does not predict the course of a person's life.

111
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,360
Always. Godric, drink more water.

112
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:24,810
When we talk about it in terms of a process, what we're talking about is that those who are most impacted by structural inequity.

113
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:34,290
Are meaningfully involved in the creation and implementation of the institutional policies and practices that govern their lives.

114
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:46,050
So in the case of evaluation, what that means is that those who are most impacted by inequity are meaningfully involved in the evaluation process.

115
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:56,250
And that's something that is central to both culturally responsive evaluation as well as equitable evaluation.

116
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,580
So we'll get into culturally responsive evaluation first.

117
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:14,739
So, you know, keeping keeping in mind, I feel like my wish I kind of have started the class a little different because I

118
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,080
came right from the gate swinging this culturally responsive and equitable bat.

119
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,340
No. You know, apologize for the violent metaphor, but.

120
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,030
I came in showing you and talking with that lens.

121
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:42,980
But there are many in our field who practice in a more traditional way where, for example, we can walk in a room, consider ourselves the experts.

122
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,210
We do all the analysis, we do all the design of the data collection instruments.

123
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,710
We keep dissemination at the level of the written word, etcetera, etcetera.

124
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,040
But cultural responsive approaches go beyond that to really.

125
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Again, make sure that culture is a central part of the design of the work.

126
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,630
So one way that looks different, grant grantees or community members are seen as experts.

127
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:29,180
And in fact, the idea of some of us tend though from against the work grantee and.

128
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,050
And Lou, what kind of. Places a power dynamic in the relationship.

129
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,520
From the get go, the idea of one is giving another person money so that the person receiving money in

130
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,710
our money centric culture is the one that is dependent on the one who has the money.

131
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,940
So even that, like, you know, thoughtfulness about language is important.

132
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,350
There is a leaning on a rapport building and trust building.

133
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,030
Evaluators come in as facilitators.

134
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,160
And so the work that they're doing is done in partnership.

135
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:22,200
So, for example, designing data collection instruments with community versus outside of community input.

136
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,390
The main components of a CRE or just the the CRE without.

137
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:44,090
But equity are four and you've saw these four in your rating today the McBride reading one culture.

138
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:52,470
This idea of culture is these this idea of shared norms and underlying belief systems of a group.

139
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:59,820
And they can be a group that's defined by social identity, by the intersection of social identities.

140
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:10,350
And, you know, any other way that a community structures itself could be geography, for example.

141
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,400
Why does culture matter in the valuation? Because culture affects our perceptions.

142
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,730
So it's important to think about, well, from a cultural perspective,

143
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:30,020
what is my perception about this program or about this about this problem or about this construct?

144
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:49,470
The second component. Of this approach is context, and that includes historical, sociopolitical, community and organizational.

145
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:57,600
Why this context matter? It matters because conflict context influences the value of today.

146
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,710
Everything we see is shaped by what we've seen before.

147
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,970
And what we know, even if we don't necessarily know it to be true.

148
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,360
So for example, you know, I think about the building next door.

149
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,780
Most of you were not. I've been here so long. There was a whole nother building over there when I started.

150
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,630
And the building that's over there was built because of the Kellogg Foundation.

151
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,270
And so there were some, you know, obviously power dynamics with.

152
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:41,340
But not in a negative way, but. Power dynamics in relationship to the Kellogg Foundation and the School of Public Health.

153
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:49,680
It may shape what programs you have access to now, but you wouldn't necessarily know that if you don't know the history.

154
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,160
I also just like throwing in a little trivia about the school.

155
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,620
Secret passages to know.

156
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,260
Responsiveness is the third component, and responsiveness means a sense of critical consciousness, intentional action and flexibility.

157
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:21,489
So as I see, so I can come into a space and not have a static mindset about what is going on in that space that

158
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:31,240
I'm willing to learn and adjust based on what I'm seeing and observing and taking in and learning.

159
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:39,670
And why does it matter? Because it really allows us to attend to invested parties or our stakeholders.

160
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,930
Then finally, social justice is the fourth component. I use this definition from the U.N.

161
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,270
The right of all to have economic, political and social rights and opportunities.

162
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:01,070
And it matters because evaluation is, as I says, an opportunity to advocate for social change with the aim of justice.

163
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:12,310
So those are our four or four components culture, context, responsiveness and social justice.

164
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:22,950
So some brief action steps of how you would apply culturally responsive valuation in the valuation practice.

165
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:31,780
One. Learn the culture and environment. To engage people in the process from start to finish.

166
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,070
Three. Developing culturally relevant evaluation design tools.

167
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:46,770
I'll say a little bit about that and a little bit conducting evaluation with community as partners versus as.

168
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,020
You know, grantees or those unfortunate souls, vulnerable populations,

169
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:03,060
anything you want to throw in to the blank that would equate to not being an equitable partner in the process.

170
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,450
So you're working with community?

171
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,320
Not in the community. I was going to say not for.

172
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,920
Because you're also working for the community, but you get the idea.

173
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,200
And then finally disseminate and advocate.

174
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:32,470
So it is, in a way, taking a somewhat biased approach and that you're taking a position to advocate for social change and social justice.

175
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:50,770
As part of the dissemination process. Yeah.

176
00:25:50,800 --> 00:26:00,220
So. Question Does it align with CBP? Community based participatory research action research as another framing, similar frame?

177
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:08,230
Yes, very much so. I would say, again, one of the main differences is simply.

178
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:20,230
The end product of CPR action research is research that can be generalize potentially replicated.

179
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:33,700
Whereas with a valuation, the idea of replicating the study or generalizing to other populations is not a priority of ours.

180
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:45,620
Yeah, I can say I actually I learned about CPR before I learned about CRE and this felt very familiar to me.

181
00:26:46,290 --> 00:27:00,110
If. Yeah. So any questions about any other questions about culturally responsive evaluation before we go on to equitable evaluation?

182
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:20,630
All right. So the way that I'm framing equitable evaluation today is based heavily on the framing of the Equitable Evaluation Institute.

183
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,290
It's off your interest. And I need to make sure I want to give credit where credit is due.

184
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:42,380
This is a relatively new approach. In terms of it being officially documented.

185
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,920
In disgust in the same way that culturally responsiveness is.

186
00:27:49,300 --> 00:28:04,690
So. Got to give credit where credit is due. So there are three principles that I want to first present about what equitable evaluation does.

187
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:18,430
And why it exist. So the first is, is that this idea that a valuation and a value, a value of work should be in service of equity.

188
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,520
And what that means is changing and challenging who evaluation is conducted for.

189
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,579
You know, again, thinking about what I mentioned earlier, this idea that, you know,

190
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:43,510
the focus of evaluation product should be in terms of audience, should be funders, should be the clients in this framing.

191
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,890
Equal evaluation should be focused on the advancement of equity.

192
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:56,070
And so what it does is place program beneficiaries at the center of evaluation work.

193
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:04,350
I capitalize the this worker program beneficiary beneficiaries deliberately.

194
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:13,230
It is a change in language from participate program participant, program client, customer.

195
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,020
And it really places the fact that we're doing this work to benefit a particular group.

196
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:30,640
And so that language is deliberate in order to again, challenge power dynamics.

197
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,500
We're working on behalf. Of program beneficiaries.

198
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:46,200
We work for them. And for for the purposes of promoting equity for all.

199
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:13,860
For example. Getting from that kind of program or intervention is the family unit.

200
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,790
Including like children. So how would you just.

201
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:28,760
People who are actively. The program versus the rest of the family unit benefiting from it.

202
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:40,069
So the question is so she gave an example of a program that she has worked with that distinguishes between participants,

203
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,299
those who are directly receiving the education in the program.

204
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,780
Right. And then beneficiaries who.

205
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:59,280
Who are the family unit because everyone in that family unit benefits when young parents, the participants are able to.

206
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,340
You know, develop healthy cooking habits. How would you distinguish between those?

207
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,860
I. We would say that.

208
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,060
That they're all beneficiaries.

209
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:27,310
I actually think the idea of calling the young parents participants is helpful just in terms of distinguishing for the purposes of talking about it.

210
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,440
But conceptually, everyone would be beneficiaries.

211
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,460
And really, it's just about drawing attention to the fact that we're working on behalf, in this case, the family unit.

212
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,629
And so we're. Thinking about.

213
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:53,120
Okay. Well. How can we make it so that we're building a more equitable society for that family unit?

214
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:59,360
And that's really what the language changes about. So, well, think about it this way.

215
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,570
So the healthy eating, learning how to cook healthy foods is great.

216
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,890
How do we make sure people have access to healthy foods so they can cook healthy foods?

217
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,580
So the language is meant to kind of push, help us to remember, to push against that,

218
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,810
especially when we're thinking about program design or program measurement.

219
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:27,550
So but let's be real and realistic, since if we're like sitting in the meeting,

220
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,550
we keep calling everybody beneficiaries and we're all getting confused.

221
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:36,540
Somebody can pull a participant. It's something that you would.

222
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,610
I would definitely introduce this to my client. And in fact, I have like what?

223
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,100
The idea of language. I did a project with.

224
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,150
Come on, Ebony. Phil Gathers.

225
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:11,450
And we deliberately moved to the language beneficiaries far away from customers as we were working through the evaluation,

226
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:22,130
in part because we had talked about this framing. All right.

227
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,910
And it is much more than language. Again, I mean, it's not just saying, oh, we're going to change the word.

228
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,860
It's about we're changing the word. And the reason why we're changing the word.

229
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,530
If so, that we can emphasize this particular aspect of promoting equity.

230
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,640
So the second principle evaluate of work can and should answer critical questions.

231
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:54,240
And so what this is about is changing what evaluation is conducted for.

232
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:02,850
You know, in the past, I mean, even still now, you know, evaluation is often framed as.

233
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,820
Understanding how this program is effective and not going beyond that very much.

234
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:23,190
But in this framing and equitable evaluation, it's also about identifying strategies that challenge the systems that perpetuate inequities.

235
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,050
So again, do you mind if I use the cooking example?

236
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:40,490
Okay. So again, thinking about the cooking example. Can I ask in the valuation question that talks about access to healthy food?

237
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:48,740
You know, and again, thinking about the example that I just shared of the food gatherers evaluation.

238
00:34:49,190 --> 00:35:06,140
One question we asked is how can food gatherers better advocate for program beneficiaries in the Ann Arbor, Ypsi community and advocate to.

239
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,170
Mitigate trying to think of the exact wording we use social determinants of hunger.

240
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,780
So even though what we were really doing is just about. So even though part the kind of.

241
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:29,040
Prompt for the evaluation was focused on how can we better serve customers at pantries.

242
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:37,260
We chose to move together to move beyond that, to also include structural evaluation questions.

243
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,350
Third principle. Evaluative work should be designed and implemented.

244
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,640
Consumer writ with the values underlining equity work.

245
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,360
And so this is about changing how evaluation is conducted.

246
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:08,419
For example, multicultural validity. Validity for those who are new to research design I know I have a few in the room, will get more into it later.

247
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,820
But for the purposes of today, just understand it as.

248
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:24,190
Making sure that measurement accurately reflects the real world, real world conditions,

249
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,820
and that measurement accurately reflects the real world in terms of constructs that we measure.

250
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,780
So we just want we're trying what we're trying to do when we talk about validity is talking about the

251
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:46,060
extent to which any measurement we do is actually accurately measuring with real world constructs.

252
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,730
So for a totally nebulous example, if I say I'm measuring hope.

253
00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:01,580
With this particular survey instrument. I'm concerned about the validity isn't really measuring hope.

254
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:13,459
And so when I say multicultural validity, what I'm saying is, are we accurately measuring a real in the real world,

255
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,130
a construct that is meaningful and salient to that cultural group?

256
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:31,690
Or to other cultural groups. Another way that we think about how evaluation is conducted is and participant ownership.

257
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,560
Think about that continuum of engagement that I showed last week.

258
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:50,510
Or no? Tuesday. The weeks go by so slow, like it's not December, it's not Christmas time for Hallmark Hallmark movies.

259
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,340
But anyway, on Tuesday, participant ownership.

260
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,190
We want to get to that shared leadership end of the continuum.

261
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,470
So any questions? Well, let me get through the slide and then I'll ask any other questions about equitable evaluation.

262
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,230
So how can you apply? This evaluation practice.

263
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,290
So one way I just want to point out is that there are different dimensions of equity and equity work.

264
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:31,190
For example, there's comprehensive change. Building equity within an organization.

265
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,690
So I can work with a client who is interested in learning.

266
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:42,050
How can we make our organization more equitable from the perspective of our staff?

267
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:54,250
That would be an example of comprehensive change systems change, addressing systemic variables, you know, structural variables.

268
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:02,430
So for example. Policing might be a structural variable that I would measure.

269
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:11,190
I think that they actually came up with one or two examples of evaluation types earlier in the the class,

270
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,840
our favorite diversity and inclusion, which is focused on increasing representation.

271
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,040
So I might work with a client who is interested in knowing.

272
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,110
Okay. So our youth drop in services are.

273
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,810
Attracting a lot of youth that identify as heterosexual.

274
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:40,760
But those who identify as queer are not really taking us up on our drop in services.

275
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:46,950
What's going on? How do we increase that representation in our in our program?

276
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,460
So that would be an example of thinking about.

277
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,110
The dimension of diversity and inclusion.

278
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:07,350
And I share that just to say that there's there's different ways to make equity more tangible for measurement.

279
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,800
Any questions about equitable evaluation.

280
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:29,090
Okay. So if you are like me when you first heard this, you're like, Okay, that sounds super theoretical.

281
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:37,700
That was fun. How do we actually do it? This is why I'm an evaluator, because I said that to women's studies.

282
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,470
So this is way too theoretical. How do we apply this and work in the real world?

283
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:52,820
And then I became a public health evaluator. So then thinking about those steps that those six steps of the framework.

284
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:01,850
The first step engagement. So how can we apply both culturally responsive and equitable evaluation approaches and engagement?

285
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:10,819
One area is in position ality seeing community members as the experts and partners in this

286
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:17,810
work rather than a hindrance or people who just really won't fill out your awesome survey.

287
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,430
So taking that position of humility that is so important in this work.

288
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,030
Another way of thinking about our role in terms of engagement.

289
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:47,640
Is being a facilitator and. Specifically facilitating in a way that honors and lifts up power sharing in this space.

290
00:41:49,850 --> 00:42:01,159
On Saturday, you know, instead of sleeping in, I have the opportunity to facilitate a group of board members and a Community Development Council,

291
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:08,510
which is comprised of community members in a community development corporation.

292
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:17,840
One thing that they are particularly concerned about is how do we engage with each other and plan?

293
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:25,200
And plan strategy. For this neighborhood in a way that shares power.

294
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:38,060
So. We. And so this is part of my role as an evaluator, helping organizations, helping groups be able to work together.

295
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,830
And sometimes that takes up time. Right. We're not we're not doing any surveys.

296
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:49,220
We're not doing any needs assessment on Saturday. We're just going to spend time learning how to share power.

297
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,900
All of us together. Another way.

298
00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:02,779
Translator And again, mitigating the paternalistic impact of research culture by translating because

299
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,749
there's nothing more fun to a community member as hearing about correlations,

300
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,580
regressions, p values, statistical significance.

301
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,360
Let me throw some qualitative terms in there to theming coding with some other things.

302
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,210
Grounded theory. All these things that are part of our language of research.

303
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,480
He can have the the.

304
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,510
Outcome of creating separation and power differential power dynamic.

305
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,700
And so as a evaluator, when I'm engaging with these approaches,

306
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:49,070
I'm trying to break all that stuff down and not in a let me stupefied everything

307
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,080
way and make it so that it's your simple community member can understand it.

308
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:02,150
But it's really about taking the time to understand the meaning of the terms that I'm throwing out.

309
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:13,450
And sharing that and building the capacity of community partners to understand what it is we're talking about as researchers.

310
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,410
The responsibility is mine as the evaluator to do that.

311
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,150
Translation. So that we can have an equitable partnership.

312
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:33,810
Role as convener. And so I'm seeking representative representativeness across social identity.

313
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,070
If I see that some group is not in the room, why are they not in a room?

314
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,630
Maybe in a nicer way. Oh, it seems that so-and-so is missing.

315
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:53,910
What might they have to contribute to this conversation? Could we carve out a little bit of funding out of your massive grant?

316
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,930
To have some compensation for community members to attend this meeting.

317
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,820
Simple questions that help drive engagement.

318
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:15,080
And then finally, it's important to be reflective, and that's reflecting on your role in the research project and how your experiences,

319
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,470
assumptions and beliefs shape its process and outcome.

320
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,600
And this is a responsibility of all of us in the room.

321
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:34,350
I can assume that because and even if this is the case, even if I share a social identity, I don't assume that if I'm in a focus group,

322
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:40,530
I'm facilitating a focus group with a group of African-American women that we share the same experiences.

323
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,719
I have to think about that because yes, we might have that marginalized idea in common.

324
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:52,830
But then again, I'm a doctor, I have class privilege, I have geographic privilege.

325
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,250
Maybe I have academic educational privilege.

326
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:02,520
I have to be reflexive and thinking about all my different identities and how that comes to play.

327
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:10,530
And then the evaluation project and thinking about again how to dismantle some of those and equitable structures.

328
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:22,750
And how I might be perpetuating them. Step two, how do we apply this in describing the program?

329
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,500
Having an inclusive planning process. You know, I've already mentioned representation.

330
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:42,640
And that aim is really to have multiple worldviews in a space as part of the planning process.

331
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,820
It's important to know the context. That's ongoing learning.

332
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:54,640
So I'm not all I'm not going to ever know the complete context, the historical,

333
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:04,120
the sociopolitical community, organizational context of this neighborhood, this community, etc., etc.

334
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,570
But I can ask questions. Who holds the power in this room?

335
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,490
Who is affected by the program? Who's benefiting from our program?

336
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:25,830
One thing that I find in my role as a evaluator that I do well and that's important to the process is just asking questions.

337
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,420
Who's not here? Why are they not here? What do we need to know?

338
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,030
What do I not know? What do you not know? What we.

339
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,400
What are we doing? Where are we going? I don't know.

340
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,700
But question asking is so important. Again, that's a position of humility.

341
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,800
Clarifying apparent issues. So collecting background data.

342
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,940
You're doing some of that for the research, for the evaluation plan.

343
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:02,680
What's the problem? What's the scope of the problem? But again, expanding and not just in, you know, pulling out the epidemic,

344
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:09,810
the epidemiological data on the problem, but also what are some contextual issues around it.

345
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:18,890
Very helpful. Part of doing that can also include identifying root and causal factors of interest.

346
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,960
So for example. You know.

347
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,500
Okay. So people are not eating vegetables.

348
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,490
Why are not people not eating vegetables? Because they don't know how to cook them.

349
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:39,910
I keep writing that horse to the in the class. All right. Why are people not cooking them?

350
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:46,170
They don't know how to cook. Why don't they know how to cook them? Uh, because they don't have access to the vegetables.

351
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,620
Why don't they have access to the rest? Or because it's not a vegetable that culturally they learn how to cook.

352
00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:03,810
They don't have access to. Why don't they have access to them? Because there are structural factors at work as to where companies put grocery stores.

353
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:12,150
Why is that? Because we live in a capitalist society. You can keep going down and down until you understand rural and causal factors.

354
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:19,350
Because if rarely is it. And I still remember when I still remember this as a student.

355
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,010
Oh, my gosh. This had to be like ten, 20, ten, 20 years ago.

356
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,340
I sit in this room and somebody's sitting right over there.

357
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,950
We were talking about exercise in urban areas, and the student said, Well,

358
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,440
if they just go outside and exercise and take a walk on the sidewalk, then we would have these problems.

359
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,760
We. So part of some of us were just sitting here like, what?

360
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,740
But the mouse like facilitator in the room said she was over there.

361
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,120
She was like, well, you know, there's violence in communities that, you know,

362
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,510
they can't just go walking outside sometimes when there's shooting going on.

363
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,490
I mean, you know, like and that that was the public health setting in which I was trained.

364
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:15,470
So you are laughing. But no, my people weren't laughing when she said it back there because that was kind of part of the attitude.

365
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:22,130
And so you have to challenge yourself to think a little deeper than what you're seeing on the surface,

366
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,520
and then finally adopting an asset base or human centered approach.

367
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,520
Again, who's the beneficiaries of this work?

368
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:42,400
And so centering the work in a way that is building rapport and building relationship rather than creating division.

369
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,920
I offer a tool, a landscape assessment.

370
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,090
This is a more formal way of doing this work that can be helpful.

371
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,220
I just want to provide it. Just in case people were interested.

372
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:17,410
Yes. Yeah, you could do it in the report.

373
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:26,950
So the question was like, what part of this be like doing a literature review and submitting literature review as part of the reporting at the end?

374
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:32,640
Could do it at the beginning. Like, why not? And why just.

375
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,700
Literature review. That's written up. Why not? Why not a video?

376
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,710
Why not? Why not an art project?

377
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,460
Thank you. Again, how does the culture speak to how does this cultural group speak to each other?

378
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,950
And building on that?

379
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:04,690
I mean, obviously, we live in a written visual culture, infographics that's, you know, a visual way that makes visuals and words.

380
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,990
So there's different ways. But yes, the idea of, you know, having enough respect to know that.

381
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,400
Well, one. You know, just because somebody is sitting in this room doesn't mean they don't understand.

382
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,210
But too, that they probably already do understand.

383
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:29,199
It's us that don't understand the context of the of what's going on in their neighborhood that they don't understand.

384
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:37,030
They understand. I very rarely meet somebody who, for example, is African-American, who doesn't understand rooted cultural factors.

385
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,400
They may not say it that way. Right.

386
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:48,880
So it's about kind of having that humble, humble spirit and communicating in a way that is reachable to multiple people.

387
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,840
But I actually like that idea. I don't think I've ever done that, like, actually done like a visual of the context.

388
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:05,850
Oh, man, I'm excited. Context visual.

389
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,410
I'm so going to do that. I can't wait.

390
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:16,800
Oh. The third step three, focusing that evaluation.

391
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:28,500
So some things you can do to apply CRE in this stage identifying evaluate evaluation questions that advance equity in not just racial ethnic but.

392
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:36,570
Other social identities as well. So reflecting community and cultural norms and assumptions.

393
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:48,210
When you are thinking about designing the evaluation plan and the corresponding materials accounting for community history and context,

394
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:58,660
addressing the reality of structural and equity. As well as mitigating power differentials and co-creation of evaluation questions.

395
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:05,800
All of this. And I'm going to continue to say this. This takes time and investment of resources.

396
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:13,390
It's easy to just. It's easy to not do these things and it's cheaper to not do these things.

397
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:20,020
Every every meeting that I hold that's about planning costs money.

398
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,590
And so it's not as simple as saying, well, just do it.

399
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:29,320
It's also about advocating for the resources to be able to do it and understand the importance of it.

400
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,309
This is why, if you're familiar with QPR,

401
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:41,800
it took a very long time for it to build resonance with the National Institutes of Health and the CDC because they didn't want to pay for any of it.

402
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:47,660
When I first came here, they were willing to pay for any of it. Kellogg paid for it.

403
00:54:48,200 --> 00:55:04,819
And then they paid for that building across the street to. Another part of the step that you can do is I want to kind of bring some attention

404
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:10,460
to data collection instruments because this is kind of an area that is.

405
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,190
Not always capitalized on as much, but it is important.

406
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,490
This is an area where it's easy to default into like what you were trained into doing.

407
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,490
But it's important to be attuned to decisions about who's collecting data and how it's collected.

408
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:39,350
One thing I mentioned earlier, you know, not allowing people who have power over another do the data collection.

409
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:46,340
But, you know, maybe it makes sense to have somebody of a different social identity in the room,

410
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:53,030
especially when it comes to issues of privacy and confidentiality or some.

411
00:55:53,090 --> 00:56:02,240
If the issue that they're exploring requires a posture of kind of the new person, the new observer in the room.

412
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:10,730
So you have to think about those what those things when it comes to identifying who who should be the one doing this data collection?

413
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,040
Can it be somebody? Can it be a part of a program beneficiary?

414
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:23,210
Another invested party? When I did the project with food gatherers, we actually had.

415
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:31,780
Community members doing interviews with other community members about their experience of pantries.

416
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:42,479
And again, we're not having the staff do it where they were doing it to help build rapport and

417
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,250
to help that space be one in which they were comfortable disclosing their concerns.

418
00:56:48,780 --> 00:57:00,720
Selecting tools to measure specific measures are indicators of inequity, such as food purchasing behaviors not only by individuals but by stores.

419
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:06,300
Availability of walkable space. Having flashbacks again about that person.

420
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,240
So you can measure metrics at individual community and institutional levels.

421
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,670
And oftentimes I have you reading later on indicator booklet.

422
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,950
And I'll prime you. Don't be scared when you get to is like 100 pages.

423
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:33,250
You don't have to read the whole thing. But usually in any kind of content subfield, there's some type of indicator book that can be helpful,

424
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:39,190
especially if they're newer because they tend to include examples of indicators at these different levels.

425
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,420
You want instruments that are validated with diverse populations.

426
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:52,200
Instruments that measure root and causal factors. Instruments created through participatory methods.

427
00:57:52,230 --> 00:58:00,360
These are all ways to challenge this idea that as scientists, we are the experts in the room.

428
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,230
Oh, man, it didn't pick up on what I wanted. Sorry.

429
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,460
I just realized that something that. I added this morning, I'll just say it out loud.

430
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,660
I didn't. And. Or upload.

431
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:32,740
So step four Data Collection. So I've already mentioned the co-creation of instruments and protocols code implementation of data collection.

432
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:39,820
One thing I did add and I'll just write it because well, I can use this handy dandy pen.

433
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,130
Use of local. Language.

434
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:54,810
And terms. To aid in translation.

435
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,700
And so that can mean testing tools.

436
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:10,020
So that the constructs that are being measured with the tools.

437
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,300
Are again actually reflecting the real world.

438
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,660
How that construct is is exist in the real world.

439
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,050
Does that make sense? I stumbled over my words and out to make sure it makes sense.

440
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:34,940
Yeah. So. So. Using local language and terms to aid in translation.

441
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,990
So that. The constructs that you're trying to measure with the tools.

442
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:48,300
Are actually reflected accurately with in the language of the tool.

443
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:56,610
So if I say again, you know, going back to that hope example, if I'm measuring hope and.

444
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,670
West. Willow So that's a neighborhood. FC I'm measuring hope and West Willow.

445
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,330
It needs to be the way that people in West Willow actually think about hope.

446
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:19,500
Not the way that you all think about hope or the way that professors who are going up for ten think about hope,

447
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:30,360
but the way the residents of West will think about hope and then I can say I act, I more than likely accurately measured hope.

448
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:42,000
According to West Willow residents. So on to step five.

449
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:51,630
Step five, just to find conclusions. So some ways that you can apply and you'll see us applying CRE in this step.

450
01:00:52,590 --> 01:01:02,320
One. Making sure that you're lifting up metrics are indicators at an individual community or institutional level.

451
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:07,060
And just to remind you this step, because it's not the most self-explanatory one.

452
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:12,190
This is the step that's talking about analysis and interpretation.

453
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,760
So doing the straight analysis, like I'm looking at the data,

454
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:30,130
I'm running it through stator or are or I'm using in vivo or I'm doing some call analysis by hand.

455
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,760
I'm using Excel. Those are our results.

456
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,200
But then we take it another step, and that's interpretation.

457
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:46,270
What's the meaning of these results as they've kind of come out of the software or the analysis process?

458
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:59,180
So another thing that you can do at this step. Taking advantage of opportunities to confirm community desires about their presentation.

459
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,880
So how do people like that example? Just we just talked about about the lit review.

460
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:12,740
How can we present data in a way that is meaningful and understandable to the audience?

461
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,370
Um, another way is to do analysis through participatory methods.

462
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,860
So, for example, data parties. Has anybody ever heard of a de la party?

463
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:30,990
It's a party with data. No, but. But it's meant to be a fun get together.

464
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:38,640
But in the process, you are actually. No. Everybody's like, this sounds like the lamest party or.

465
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,809
Well it's not it's isn't that you certainly wouldn't do it on a Saturday night probably.

466
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:50,740
But it's meant to be a social space where you're also looking at data.

467
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:59,080
So you might, you know, and again, this is about not only building capacity, but talking about the meaning of the results.

468
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:09,100
So in that party, you might be looking at a sample of survey results and identifying the mean.

469
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:13,270
Okay. What does it mean? What does it mean to say that this is the mean?

470
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:19,120
Those are things that you would do during a day at a party. They are more fun than explaining.

471
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:25,749
Member checking. Member Checking is where one person or a team of people identify.

472
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:35,080
And this is especially what qualitative results are they themed data, which means to kind of identify the themes, what the qual data is saying.

473
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:47,250
And once I have those results. Reviewing them with a group of people who participated in the data collection.

474
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:54,990
So, for example, I worked with a group of people who sit on food policy councils.

475
01:03:55,590 --> 01:04:01,470
They participated in focus groups. I did the initial analysis.

476
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:07,740
Then we had another meeting that people were invited to and they were compensated at both stages.

477
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:14,460
So if they came to the member checking meeting, they were compensated again for that time.

478
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,070
So we went through the results, did some more, some some more interpretation, some more analysis.

479
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:31,430
That's an example of member checking. And then another thing you can do in this stage is doing the data interpretation in context.

480
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:36,620
So for example, well, why might we see that mask wearing?

481
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,380
It's a good example. Why might we see that mask wearing is going down in Michigan?

482
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,040
Well, if you know the context of Michigan, you know that Governor Whitmer, handsome.

483
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:59,610
Have some policies that people really didn't like and there was resistance that might be an example of trends in context.

484
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:12,520
I make I'm simplifying that a lot. And then finally a exploring stratification through the intersections of social identity categories.

485
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:22,570
So stratification is a way of parsing out data by different categories as well as intersections of different categories.

486
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,460
So I might look at gender. And so I'll take.

487
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:35,670
A population of or a sample of people who identify as female in the sample.

488
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,860
But then I can break it down further. What are the results look like?

489
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:49,440
When I look at. Those women broken down by race or by class or by education.

490
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,100
That stratification. And so in using social identity categories to stratify that.

491
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:01,370
We'll talk more. I told you, our waffle, our promise job is a waffle.

492
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:07,640
Don't worry. Everything I'm saying, we'll talk about it again. You get to have more fun with data later on.

493
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:16,309
And then finally, step six to using is sharing findings.

494
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:26,000
So this is not just reporting, but it's also disseminating and communicating the information and applying the information to different situations.

495
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:33,769
So when we're reporting, how can we we ask ourselves as CRE evaluators,

496
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:41,170
how can we disseminate to the broader community, not just who should it go to, but in what forms?

497
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:45,200
So that, again, it's something that people care about.

498
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,950
Use of findings, not just using the findings to tell our funders that we did a good job.

499
01:06:54,220 --> 01:07:00,490
Please give us more money. But also building the capacity of community and community organizations.

500
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:13,180
Another example, I worked. I'm finishing up a project with an organization that is building their capacity to do evaluation.

501
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,690
And why do they want to do evaluation? Because they need to be able to share results to get money.

502
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:26,950
So I've been working alongside with them to conduct the evaluation.

503
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:33,430
But in the process I've also been we've been working together so that they develop more skill in that area.

504
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:42,840
Disseminating in a way that can dismantle inequitable power structures.

505
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:54,030
So how can I disseminate, for example, to policymakers or disseminate to academics who might be able to have access to more funds?

506
01:07:54,270 --> 01:08:00,520
It's all about money. We live in a capitalist society. Those are just the examples.

507
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,920
Let me say something that promoting sustainability, a program or related services and businesses.

508
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:15,500
So that idea of capacity building is closely associated with that as well.

509
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:20,720
And then promoting equitable messaging, I wanted to point that out as well.

510
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:27,290
So making sure that, for example, that your language is not victim blaming or victim saving,

511
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:34,159
that the language is accessible and not just the language, but the forms of dissemination.

512
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:45,110
And this is an area where I still am challenging myself because, for example, if are the slides, even the slides I send out, are they readable by.

513
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:53,100
I forgotten the technology that that reads documents for those who are not sighted.

514
01:08:54,900 --> 01:09:04,440
So that's an example of equitable messaging is not just what I'm saying, but it's the forms and making sure that it's accessible even across ability.

515
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:13,260
So I'll pause and ask if there's any questions.

516
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,710
The waffles are full. The waffles are full.

517
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,940
So I wanted to end. Oh, okay.

518
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:37,700
Additional. So I wanted to and just to kind of give you a little bit of a breather by showing this video.

519
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:47,500
It is the intro to a half hour documentary on culture, humility and public health.

520
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,340
Has anybody seen this? I watch this for fun.

521
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:54,590
I'm so it's like it's older, but I really do like it.

522
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:00,260
But it introduces the concept of cultural humility by people familiar with it.

523
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:06,570
A little bit. Well, okay. So the videos I have all.

524
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,170
Come on. Are you serious?

525
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,799
Did I forget to add it? That's why I put these on here at the bottom.

526
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:27,420
Because I'm bad at technology. Building your business online.

527
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:32,090
Go to Wacom and get your site up and running with it too.

528
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:40,469
Hey, no. BLOCK One word to describe cultural humility for me is is love here that if I had to encapsulate cultural humility,

529
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:45,209
the whole concepts of cultural humility, it doesn't do it justice.

530
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:50,040
But the way that I think of it, that is essence is good at being you.

531
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:56,190
Opening Receive Compassion, love the principles of cultural humility.

532
01:10:56,370 --> 01:11:02,550
Offer one more framework to contribute to what has got to be our ultimate goal.

533
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:13,920
Yes, our ultimate goal is that there will be a sense of equity, a sense of equality and a kind of and a kind of respect that we are driving forward.

534
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:59,999
Cultural humility that is is a multi-dimensional concept.

535
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,620
And certainly Melanie Tourbillon and I.

536
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,990
Conceptualized three dimensions.

537
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:16,000
The first is lifelong learning and critical self-reflection.

538
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:20,890
And in that critical self-reflection, it is the understanding of how each of us,

539
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:27,190
every single one of us is a complicated, multidimensional human being.

540
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,810
Each of us comes with our own histories and stories, our heritage, our point of view.

541
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:35,350
You're looking at me now. I am very fair skinned.

542
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,950
When I was a little girl, my hair was blond. My eyes are blue.

543
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,730
People often tried to call me anything but African-American.

544
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:48,490
I have a history. My identity is rooted in that history.

545
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,680
My parents gave me the knowledge of my own social identity and my own experience.

546
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,090
And life is created that I get to say who I am. The second tenant.

547
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,780
After self-reflection and ongoing.

548
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:11,459
Lifelong learning and development is is this notion that we must mitigate the power imbalances to recognize and mitigate the

549
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:24,680
power imbalances that are inherent often in our clinician patient or clinician client or service provider community dynamics.

550
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:31,470
And then finally, the, the piece that I would offer that Jan and I feel people often either don't read or don't like,

551
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:36,090
which is and the institution has to model these principles as well.

552
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:13,240
Can. African-American nurse is caring for a middle aged Latino woman several hours after the patient had undergone surgery.

553
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:19,780
A Latino physician on a consults service approached the bedside and noting the moaning patient

554
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:25,210
commented to the nurse that the patient appeared to be in a great deal of post-operative pain.

555
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:30,489
The nurse summarily dismissed his perception, informing him that she took a course in.

556
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:36,850
Nurses call it cross-cultural medicine and knew that Hispanic patients overexpress the pain that they're feeling.

557
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:45,280
The Latino physician had a difficult time influencing the perspective of this nurse who focused on her self-proclaimed cultural expertize.

558
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:53,469
That was curious to this Latino physician who, first of all, was Latino, not like all in his case,

559
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:59,500
not like all Mexican-Americans, know everything there is to know about Mexican American patients.

560
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:08,889
That wasn't it. But he might have been a resource for that African-American nurse in that moment that she

561
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:14,320
didn't feel like she needed again because she had bought into this notion of competence,

562
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:22,330
of cultural competency. The distinction between cultural humility and cultural competence was that we were in a process

563
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:29,110
and a relationship that had many other layers to it and that we were less comfortable with this,

564
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:35,320
with even the term of competence in a way that I think people understand well, and that it implies,

565
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:41,680
especially for people who are providers and are trained in academia, that you are then all knowing and all powerful.

566
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:46,780
And we felt like that was not what was happening for us as we were learning from

567
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:53,530
community and understanding and in a very practical way how families were coming to the

568
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:58,269
hospital and feeling as if they really were not being heard from their own heritage

569
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:04,720
and history and how that impacted what they came to the hospital with that we could.

570
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:08,710
We didn't know anything about. Hadn't even a clue about.

571
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:13,510
For us, this is part of the humility piece of it. Getting to understand that.

572
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,680
Not trying to humiliate you. Not trying to make you feel bad.

573
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:27,100
Trying to help us all understand that there are that life is like that and to, in a certain sense, be really happy about not knowing.

574
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:37,890
In April of 1992, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots following the initial not guilty verdict of the police officers accused of beating Mr. King,

575
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,409
the Children's Hospital Oakland community was compelled to meet in a series of highly

576
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:48,420
charged sessions to expose and critique our own patterns of institutional racism,

577
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:57,030
injustice and inequity. My name is Dr. Melanie Tourbillon, and I am director of Multicultural Affairs here at Children's Hospital Oakland.

578
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:02,760
Well, I thank everybody for coming to what is a celebration for me this year.

579
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:08,760
Jan and I had the good fortune, really, to be together in the same place when this work was evolving.

580
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:19,530
Jan and I, while we are several years difference in age, are both African-American women and both raised by women who were teachers.

581
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:24,059
And we come out of that and fathers who are working,

582
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:32,400
men who come out of that Southern tradition and who participated fully in the civil rights

583
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,250
movement in the way that meant that they made sacrifices and their children made sacrifices,

584
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:44,430
and they taught us about those sacrifices and raised us each and ways to understand that we were here to serve.

585
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,710
All right? Oh, yeah. All right.

586
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:55,430
So I want you to just take that away that this is an ongoing process.

587
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,940
So, again. For you as well. This is an ongoing process.

588
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:09,729
So I'm looking forward to us working through it together here, you know, with the tasks we do in order to keep your business.

589
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:13,990
For those who are to miss a header, enjoy a lot of the pile up.
