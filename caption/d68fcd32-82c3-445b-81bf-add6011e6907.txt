1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,980
Laura Power: Okay.

2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:34,920
Laura Power: I think we can get started today so welcome everyone to our episode six or three professional development session where we'll be focusing on sort of nonprofit careers and Community engagement and really just learning more from.

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:45,150
Laura Power: career journeys from people who are working out in practice, and this time we have TT Ob on room and it is that you go by tg of that right.

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:57,270
Laura Power: I remembered from last year and TT is right now, at the Institute for population health in Detroit but has had other jobs as well and worked in different sectors.

5
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,710
Laura Power: And so we've invited her here to kind of tell us about her job experiences or her career journey help us understand.

6
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,590
Laura Power: What a nonprofit organization is have that supports the mission of public health.

7
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,160
Laura Power: And so to try to answer those questions but also just to learn from her journey like we've been doing in the past, so we'll take some time to do that.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:31,350
Laura Power: Today TT i'll let you introduce yourself, we have, we have the class session goes til 1215 so we have time to kind of go through and hear about your journey here about you what you're thinking next in your career to.

9
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:45,030
Laura Power: And then take some questions and then depending on the time we have left class i'm happy to stay on and answer any questions you have about anything else going on to does that all sound like a good agenda for everybody sounds all right.

10
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,490
Laura Power: Okay we'll teach you welcome I don't know what you kind of introduce yourself to the class as well.

11
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,820
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Okay, and well good afternoon everyone, my name is chino lbo.

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:13,320
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I graduated from the School of Public Health and epidemiology in 2010 so i've been in the public feel the public health field for around 10 years and i'm actually going back for my PhD.

13
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,970
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And still trying to kind of figure out just navigate how that journey is going to unfold.

14
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But yeah so.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:38,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I did episode at the School of Public Health who's really loves the program got a lot of experience right out of Grad went straight to the Department of Defense in Virginia.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,230
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And was a public health analyst epidemiologist.

17
00:02:43,230 --> 00:03:02,490
Chi-Chi Obianwu: At the Department of Defense for around three four years and then came back to the city of Detroit and worked for the Detroit health department we're doing at the geology and then transitioned Institute for population health doing program management.

18
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,550
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So yeah.

19
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:25,140
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I can tell you guys a little bit about the government kind of federal government God how that experience was and how local government at experience was and then also how a nonprofit experiences.

20
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:39,330
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So yeah I worked in three different sectors and definitely got three different experiences, but I will say there are some things that stood out the most in all of those.

21
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:49,470
Chi-Chi Obianwu: In all of all of those experiences at as an epidemiologist and I also taught at Wayne State University intro to epidemiology.

22
00:03:49,470 --> 00:04:01,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so, there are some things that really stand out in terms of like if I was back at school, what would I tell myself what are some courses that I really wanted to focus on.

23
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,760
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and

24
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:14,280
Chi-Chi Obianwu: like and what are some skills that are really important when leaving the School of Public Health to make sure that you have specific skills, under your belt.

25
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,380
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So I can jump right into.

26
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,440
Laura Power: That sounds good, I forgot that you had worked at the Department of Defense to so you really do have a very broad.

27
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:33,450
Laura Power: range of experiences that you can kind of help us think through the different different careers and like what might be similar and what's different from from each of those so yeah.

28
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:59,070
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah so So when I started right out of Grad I went to work do a fellowship and then transitioned into a consulting firm but at the same place, and that was Department of Defense in Norfolk Virginia ports actually Portsmouth Virginia there's a naval base, and so I worked at that.

29
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,410
Chi-Chi Obianwu: At the hospital at the naval base.

30
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:11,670
Chi-Chi Obianwu: At help it's called help Center it's like the they call it the CDC of the Department of Defense and.

31
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:26,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: It was a great experience, but I will say, the most important skill in any kind of public health analyst position is knowing how to analyze data very well.

32
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Chi-Chi Obianwu: If I could go back and tell my Grad school itself, it would be learn how to analyze data very well, whether that's be a SAS are spss but just know how to be able to take large chunks of data and slice and dice and be able to create descriptive reports, you know aggregate counts.

33
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:12,510
Chi-Chi Obianwu: be able to take large databases and tell stories of what is the state of health from a bunch of data sets that's really what epidemiology, is it tells a story.

34
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:34,080
Chi-Chi Obianwu: It gives a story of the status of the health status of a particular group and in that particular case it was telling a story about the Department of Defense the navy I worked with looking at like mental health we're looking at mental health, we were looking at the heaters report.

35
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:55,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Those measures it's making sure that let's say an individual comes to the Department of Defense and is is has depression, so there are major depressive disorder, so there are certain things certain amount of visits that an individual who presents with any kind of.

36
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,570
Chi-Chi Obianwu: disease or or disorder that.

37
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:17,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: There are certain evidence based best practices on how to treat that individual, and so you have to be able to essentially take large data sets to make sure that that individual.

38
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,620
Chi-Chi Obianwu: was seen.

39
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:43,770
Chi-Chi Obianwu: To the in alignment with the best practices so we're seeing in six times in one year kind of thing and so being able to analyze data to do like to do loops and you just different you know different skills of analyzing data I can't I can't express that enough.

40
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:58,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And I hope you know you'll I know you guys have SAS courses and you know are like these are very, this is what epidemiologists do we analyze data we tell stories about.

41
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:13,200
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Current health based on data based on large data sets or small data sets so being familiar with data sets being familiar with the various data sets for using census.

42
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Using you know all the CDC data.

43
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:26,310
Chi-Chi Obianwu: that's just being familiar with those data sets and understanding how to tell stories from those data sets is really important.

44
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:39,000
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So in Department of Defense they collect all their data and that's not how the general population works in terms of like civilians civilians you, we have to go to different.

45
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,210
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Health care plans to collect their data or we have to go to the census and collect the data so it's a little bit.

46
00:08:45,210 --> 00:09:04,620
Chi-Chi Obianwu: More messy but in depart The great thing about Department of Defense is that they collect they they have data pieces for everything they really monitor every person who's in the navy army marine etc, so the data is really clean in the Department of Defense.

47
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:20,970
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So now i'm going to transition to when I worked for the Department of earth when I worked for the Detroit health department and so that data wasn't in one repository there are many data repositories that you have to kind of be aware of and.

48
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Or you have to ask.

49
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,700
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Different people to collect the data so.

50
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:42,840
Chi-Chi Obianwu: working for the Detroit health department, making creating relationships with the State Department and get having access to their data their birth record store, you know empty hhs is.

51
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Chi-Chi Obianwu: has a lot of data they have a lot of reports to have a lot of epidemiological reports so they were a great resource.

52
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:04,800
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so any state that you work in or any city that you work in they have a State data base that you can pull data from.

53
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:21,870
Chi-Chi Obianwu: If you work for a health care plan they usually have data at that health care plan so like let's say someone worked for blue cross Blue Shield they usually have data at blue cross Blue Shield that you pull from so it'd be a public health analyst job to pull that data.

54
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,990
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and be able to.

55
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,880
Chi-Chi Obianwu: tell a story from that data, so I can't emphasize that enough, and sometimes I will say that.

56
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,400
Chi-Chi Obianwu: The school of public health.

57
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:45,870
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Sometimes can be really high level, I think that it's really beneficial to have like a basic epidemiology epidemiology textbook.

58
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:56,430
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Like beginners one on one like not Grad school, but just like a beginners level epidemiology textbook and actually have when I can show it to you guys.

59
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:09,180
Chi-Chi Obianwu: That is just really easy to get the fundamental concepts of epidemiology down, sometimes I think in Grad programs we doing very specific things or high level things.

60
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:17,160
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And sometimes you have to get the foundation of epidemiology before you start building on it.

61
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:25,440
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And sometimes like our professors at university of Michigan are like extremely brilliant erudite you know profound professors.

62
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:36,420
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But the thing is sometimes they're like really high level and for someone who's just being introduced to epidemiology, you really want to get the fount foundation fundamentals.

63
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:56,760
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So, like any kind of introduction to epidemiology textbook is really beneficial, just so that you can understand the foundation, the epidemiology before you start building on like a Grad level.

64
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,260
Laura Power: So, like both commons could possibly be resonating with our students, while I.

65
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:08,220
Laura Power: don't see any comments I feel like just that you know I know we have a very strong epic program and, as you mentioned, like SAS and our.

66
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:16,530
Laura Power: You know sort of in depth classes, that we have but also be able to step back and just understand the Foundation and our students are you know working through that right now they're.

67
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:27,930
Laura Power: they're me some high level classes, but also, you know, trying to make sure they understand the Foundation, so I think that i'm guessing that speaking to some of our students on the class.

68
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:39,030
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah and The thing is, is that you know in Grad school it's sometimes like a fire hose coming towards you with all the amount of reading didn't work and sometimes.

69
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:50,970
Chi-Chi Obianwu: We make the mistake of getting the grade or getting the assignment done but you also have to take the time to make sure that you understand the assignment.

70
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,610
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And why you're doing that assignment and how that assignment translates in the big world of maybe where your interests lie, and where you want to work.

71
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:13,260
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so, if you do feel like you're kind of drinking from a fire hose I will.

72
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,900
Chi-Chi Obianwu: encourage you to slow down a little bit and ask for help.

73
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:30,000
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Not from a place of length to really just grasp the fundamentals of epidemiology and I know that seems kind of like.

74
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:43,140
Chi-Chi Obianwu: not feasible because you're like well like how teachers won't understand like me needing to slow down, but the truth of the matter is that.

75
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,610
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Education is like really.

76
00:13:47,610 --> 00:14:00,510
Chi-Chi Obianwu: it's you're paying for your education so make sure that you believe with skills that you know what that make you attractive to employers.

77
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:08,640
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Make sure your job I know your job is to pass your courses, but your job is you paid.

78
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:20,670
Chi-Chi Obianwu: For a skill, so that you can be marketable when you leave so you want to make sure that you have that skill and these two years you have to ask yourself what am I, leaving with.

79
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:32,580
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Not that you're only leaving with that mph behind your name but you're leaving with tangible skills that make you attractive to upload employers.

80
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,970
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and being able to analyze data is very attractive to employers.

81
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:50,550
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So that was so trends, so that really talks about epidemiology now i'm in a space of program management, which I.

82
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:58,170
Chi-Chi Obianwu: write a lot of grants do a lot of create a lot of programs, and a lot of initiatives.

83
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,860
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And that's been really fun.

84
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,540
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know.

85
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:17,970
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And the thing about epidemiology, is that it tells a story and you're able to make recommendations from the data that you've analyzed because the data will tell you, if you're if.

86
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:40,680
Chi-Chi Obianwu: If the initiative is working, or if it's not or what initiative, do you need to create because there may be a void and so epidemiologic epidemiologists have a lot of authority, because they are able to give recommendations, based on data and so from that space of.

87
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:55,980
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Being able to analyze data I was a I was equipped with a lot of recommendations, based on the data which transitioned me into a leadership role of program management of Okay, based on my.

88
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,240
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Experience in epidemiology and knowing what's going on and state of health, because i've been.

89
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:15,600
Chi-Chi Obianwu: so close to the data I can now with authority say that we need to do this bait like data based recommend recommendations and so.

90
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:39,240
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I transitioned to program management with which was a more leadership position and I was able to write grants bring a lot of funding into my organization and create different create different programs that received a lot of.

91
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:48,300
Chi-Chi Obianwu: attention and received a lot of changing the way, so I my background I did a lot of maternal child health.

92
00:16:48,300 --> 00:17:00,750
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so, a lot of the data, I noticed that we weren't really addressing fathers, we were only looking at moms and babies, so I strengthen the maternal child health dialogue through fatherhood.

93
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:17,790
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And started really talking about Okay, we need to every maternal child health program needs a fatherhood program, this is what the data is telling us, I was like seeing that the data, the zip codes, with the highest infant mortality, or the zip codes with.

94
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:29,460
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Like I think it was something with fathers were there weren't fathers there, and so the getting the father's narrative was really important.

95
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:44,880
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so that's so we started getting a lot of like applying for funding doing a lot of partnerships, even with university of Michigan to get funding around fatherhood, and to understand that narrative and understand.

96
00:17:44,880 --> 00:18:02,400
Chi-Chi Obianwu: What I call maternal child health, so from this data, I have a whole story which creates is able to create programming and bring funding and address something like infant mortality.

97
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:13,320
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So yeah so the data tells a story and from a story you really can get funding and address different health health issues.

98
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:34,680
Chi-Chi Obianwu: it's and then so yeah that's what i'm currently doing now i'm creating a lot of programs, I actually just returned back to the University of Michigan thinking about a PhD but initially because public health is macro on a macro level.

99
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:51,060
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I have been exposed to since transitioning into program management I work with people with individuals and so like when you look at epidemiology let's say on a graph you see a line on a graph.

100
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:58,170
Chi-Chi Obianwu: that's kind of like more macro but all the little dots that.

101
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:13,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: are like makeup that line that's kind of what i'm doing now is looking at those individual data pieces, we can get individuals, which make up that line in epidemiology, or like on a on a graph if that makes any sense.

102
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:22,650
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But so now i'm working with the individuals to understand more of the databases and why the databases are.

103
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:46,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: or site to understand the data to understand the story of the data so i'm more now working more one on one with individuals, and so I went back to school to do go therapy and public in in social work, so I will say that, like social work and, at the MP h.

104
00:19:46,530 --> 00:20:01,860
Chi-Chi Obianwu: They a lot of people actually do that together mph and social work together so that's a dual degree that's offered at university of Michigan is social work in mph so that's essentially what i'm doing.

105
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:16,770
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And that's because I want to get a better understanding of each of those data pieces on an individual level, and so that may transition to a PhD from i'm still thinking about it but yeah so i'm.

106
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,940
Chi-Chi Obianwu: basically doing.

107
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:24,270
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Like the dual social work in mph, I am sorry mph.

108
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,570
Laura Power: mathematics, are you must be a lot to juggle then.

109
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,710
Laura Power: you're still there and mph diary right so.

110
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,760
Laura Power: I pH.

111
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,170
Laura Power: IP yeah mph over the other nonprofit.

112
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,850
Chi-Chi Obianwu: missing a couple yeah so.

113
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,830
Laura Power: yeah so you must be you know juggling a lot fun kind of back in class and.

114
00:20:43,830 --> 00:21:00,510
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah, and so I will say it's actually making me sharper because I, you know I really think that the social I really like the idea of social work and MP and and.

115
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:17,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: masters of public health mph so that I really liked the idea of that and I understand why that is a will degree, because there is a lot of overlap and a master's in public health and social work.

116
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:28,950
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I feel like yeah so i'm learning a lot so, for instance, right now, at work and program management i'm looking at.

117
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:41,490
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Infant mortality, but i'm looking at it from a perspective of race, as the root cause so looking at the disparities that we have in certain health outcomes, such as infant mortality.

118
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:53,580
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So understanding why we do have these help any qualities, and so this social work is actually helping me understand different concepts such as race at the root cause approach.

119
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Or what does it means to be anti racist or what is critical race theory.

120
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:11,010
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And these are these larger social concepts, but is aligned me to understand the data more and allowing me to understand the that likes like health equity.

121
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:23,910
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and understanding why we see a disparity like we see health disparities so it's, in my opinion it's allowing me to be a more well rounded.

122
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:30,270
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Individual and earth will practitioner and speak to the data and.

123
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,010
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And I.

124
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:42,420
Chi-Chi Obianwu: In a more really educated way because this the social work degrees is i'm reading a lot about.

125
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: About race and about pods they call it a privilege oppression.

126
00:22:49,500 --> 00:23:01,710
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Diversity and social justice, and so, when we look at things like social determinants of health and epidemiology.

127
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:13,020
Chi-Chi Obianwu: understanding it from a perspective of using frameworks like race at the rate rate RC which is race at the root cause approach it.

128
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:26,940
Chi-Chi Obianwu: It helps you understand the data better and it helps you tell the story in a in a more impactful way and a thoughtful more thoughtful way when creating interventions.

129
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:34,020
Laura Power: that's great it's really interesting to hear your journey that you've had, and I wonder if you could reflect a little bit for our class just you know hearing.

130
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:46,230
Laura Power: How you've kind of gone from the sort of intense data analysis really using your deep epidemiological skills and then you kind of shifted into more program management and probably had to gain different skills or.

131
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,570
Laura Power: Different professional skills, like you said, working with people doing program management.

132
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:59,400
Laura Power: Sometimes we talk about the the the public health t of skills, like the strategic skills and the technical skills and.

133
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,900
Laura Power: You probably came out of the mph with very deep technical skills or deep technical.

134
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:15,840
Laura Power: Technical epidemiological knowledge and there's also sort of the other professional skills that kind of cross cut you know across different things like communication leadership you mentioned taking on a leadership role.

135
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:28,110
Laura Power: I wonder just to reflect a little bit on your kind of overall journey and maybe how you've how you've managed, you know to learn different skills as you've gone through your journey or or have you approached them.

136
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:38,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Well, I do think that I know this is very like bias of me and it's just my opinion, but I do think that.

137
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,390
Chi-Chi Obianwu: A PhD in epidemiology gives you access to more leadership.

138
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,910
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So I am a proponent of getting a PhD.

139
00:24:50,910 --> 00:25:08,250
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So I would advise you know any and like master's in public health student to think about getting a PhD just because it gives you access to more leadership, and you know, maybe that's that important to you, though, so but.

140
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,810
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah so like I said it's biased but.

141
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:23,490
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so it was always my intention to go back and get a PhD but more so in something that i'm really interested in.

142
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:39,630
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And so yeah so the journey with a master's in public health, you know it was really great to be able to practice, and you know, to have the degree and go out into the world and practice.

143
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:52,410
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But then I realized, you know that I would have more authority at having a PhD and so that's why i'm going back to school now but.

144
00:25:52,410 --> 00:26:10,830
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah and now i'm determining if it's going to be in the realm of social work or or what are you know so but I do think that it just gives you more authority when you do have a PhD in the space of US health really.

145
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,340
Chi-Chi Obianwu: that's.

146
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:21,900
Laura Power: kind of like i'll mention to our students that our class session next week is focused on if you're interested in applying for doctoral programs or you're thinking about it will have.

147
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,100
Laura Power: Sarah Dar for who's the head of our doctoral committee.

148
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,640
Laura Power: she'll be joining us to think about that will also do a concurrent session for those of you possibly interested in medical school.

149
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:42,870
Laura Power: But that's it's kind of an interesting transition to youth and you're mentioning consider that you will we'll talk about that next week in more detail for students, that are interested in applying.

150
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:53,670
Laura Power: And, and you know i've heard people say different things to where it's probably helpful some feel that it's been helpful to have practice like like you have you know you've been out and you've gained work experience so.

151
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,490
Laura Power: Sometimes, our students will say yeah they're thinking about it, but they definitely want to get some practical experience first.

152
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,880
Laura Power: And you know of course it's there's there's no one right way to do it, but there's lots of you know, ways to consider and.

153
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Laura Power: So you know for our students kind of figuring out what your own goals are and how you how you want to get to the goals that you've set these are things to think about so let's see here tg.

154
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,750
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Emily has a question.

155
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,550
Laura Power: Oh good.

156
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:40,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Do you think, having a PhD in general is what opens those doors to leadership opportunities or specifically in epidemiology and do you feel that it holds true in certain sectors, so what I find is that experience.

157
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:51,180
Chi-Chi Obianwu: opens up doors to leadership so let's say that.

158
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: i'm.

159
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:07,020
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Like so again i'm biased but i'm going to tell you what I thought so having a master's in public health with experience is a really great combination, because that means that you.

160
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:19,050
Chi-Chi Obianwu: you're able to talk about epidemiology, you have the language, there is a language in any field and the more that you are.

161
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:24,180
Chi-Chi Obianwu: will set language, the more articulate that you will be in that language so like.

162
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:34,590
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know, we can say that with any language Spanish you know if we were in a Spanish speaking country we would know more, Spanish and we would know different dialects etc, so you just be more.

163
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,870
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know, articulate in in spine in Spanish, the more you're exposed to it.

164
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:55,590
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So it's the same thing, the more you are exposed to epidemiology, the more you learn the language you learn that the nuances the in and outs of epidemiology, so a master's with experience is really great.

165
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:05,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: it's a really great combination because you've been exposed to it, so you have that experience, so you speak it fluently However, having a PhD.

166
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:21,030
Chi-Chi Obianwu: In any field really just gives you authority in a sense that you, you have a doctor or a doctor isn't it so it's the highest level, you know, so I so.

167
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,150
Chi-Chi Obianwu: We can't really.

168
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: We I don't think.

169
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:46,050
Chi-Chi Obianwu: He disingenuous of me to say that it doesn't matter, I do think it matters, and I do think that when you have a PhD it does open up more doors, and you know and that it's at the highest level, and you know.

170
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:56,160
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah it's the highest level, having a PhD is the highest level in the field of epidemiology in the field of any kind of science field, really.

171
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:19,590
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Having that PhD as opposed to the Masters it's just it just is going to open up doors, because it requires you to be exposed to more schooling, to learn more things a PhD you are exposed to more classes, you know you have a more educational experience, and that means something.

172
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:27,840
Laura Power: will observe though today, you seem like you've gone very far and I, and I think you, with your mph, so I think that.

173
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,580
Laura Power: you're a good example of someone who can be successful, but then you know you may be now thinking like what's next because you're kind of through your.

174
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:45,990
Laura Power: You know, going on your journey and you're figuring out Okay, this is what i've accomplished this is maybe what you you're reflecting and like for you, what is next and that feels like the right next step, possibly for you.

175
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:51,600
Laura Power: yeah you're also a good role model of people within a person with an mph being successful.

176
00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:02,640
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Absolutely, and you know you can be successful and and pH you know with experience you certainly can and.

177
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,590
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I mean do it tell you guys how much.

178
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:16,920
Laura Power: Well, I think you put I mean that they need, as a point, though I, and I think these are good questions for our students to ask you know, does that affect the salary I think that's a fair question.

179
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:27,960
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So with experience it does so I do make very low six figures very low six figures and you know just there.

180
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,610
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But that's after a decade of working.

181
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:43,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I feel like, if I had a PhD I would make more money, though, and not only make more money, maybe have like have more autonomy.

182
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:50,040
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And yeah and so that's honest, you know.

183
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:59,190
Chi-Chi Obianwu: When I first started with my mph I was not making six figures you know it took a decade to get there.

184
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:19,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But I think that there's still more to accomplish and so that's why i'm going back to school I don't think that I would have been a good candidate for PhDs as for PhD after Grad school because I just didn't have the language, I was not.

185
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,200
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know I couldn't speak the language, the way that I speak the language now and.

186
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,520
Chi-Chi Obianwu: applying for a PhD just would make more I wouldn't be a good applicant now.

187
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,790
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I probably would have been a good applicant, you know.

188
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:54,540
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Seven years out six years out, but you know I did I did a pivot so i'm not i'm probably not doing a PhD in epidemiology, I still am a scientist, and I still love science, but i'm pivoting a little bit.

189
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,650
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But so yeah.

190
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:11,670
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I think that you can you know, make a great living with the MP H, and not everybody is able to do a PhD and that's you know that's, we have to be honest about that as well.

191
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:25,560
Chi-Chi Obianwu: It does take a lot of time like right now me working full time and in school, it is a juggle it definitely is a juggle and you know you have to just be able to be.

192
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,230
Chi-Chi Obianwu: honest with what you can handle and time management.

193
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,740
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And just accept you know where you are.

194
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,230
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But yeah.

195
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:43,110
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Could you give salary salary ranges at each step of your career.

196
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:50,790
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Sure, I can because I want to be honest, a lot of people don't talk about money, but I think money is very important.

197
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,070
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Sorry, I mean.

198
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,740
Laura Power: I think our singles are enjoying hearing this so.

199
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:03,690
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Thanks, so it was like two it was like maybe three steps so coming right out.

200
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:10,920
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I was consultant, I was around a 52,000.

201
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:24,240
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And I would you guys like taxes are really important like having a good accountant understanding taxes is really important, I was a consultant, so I had to do my own taxes.

202
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:35,490
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And even you know just being an epidemiologist you know I you i'm still a consultant, I still work on other projects, so you should be able to have an accountant to do your taxes.

203
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:49,620
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So when I first started it was around 52 right out of Grad school and then it jumped to around 75 and was there for a while and then it jumped to like 102.

204
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,220
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So.

205
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:56,130
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And that's just as a the past like two years so.

206
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:03,330
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah so it jumps but with that junk comes more responsibility.

207
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,790
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and

208
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:18,750
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And yeah it comes to my responsibility and I don't think i'm supposed to say how much I get paid like to like I don't I don't think other people in my organization are supposed to do that so let's just keep this.

209
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:28,740
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But um, but I think that's pretty much how it is for everyone, though, to be quite honest, in a sense that it starts off at around 5060 maybe.

210
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:48,870
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And then, depending on you know if you stay there, it increases over time, if you do jump to another job Maybe you can do 75 but if you've been in the field, or working for one of the things I will say i've been working for the same organization for a very long time, and I think that that.

211
00:35:48,870 --> 00:36:07,260
Chi-Chi Obianwu: that's in that's what's allowed me to make what I make now is because i've been very consistent with them and i've been on the journey with them, so when people left and came back you're not sad when people left, I felt I felt I filled in different positions.

212
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So i've been there for a while and.

213
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,450
Chi-Chi Obianwu: i've taken advantage of opportunities i've asked for raises.

214
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:22,890
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And I think that that's also allowed me to make what I make now is just that kind of.

215
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:29,370
Chi-Chi Obianwu: being kind of being persistent and saying what I want.

216
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,280
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And, and also being.

217
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,230
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Innovative.

218
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:47,430
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and being able to you know have authority in the space of epidemiology and telling leadership what's needed based on data.

219
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:57,690
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So yeah you know you have to have a you do have to have you know worth work ethic, to be able to ask for.

220
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,280
Chi-Chi Obianwu: ask for certain salaries.

221
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:18,030
Laura Power: I appreciate you talking about that because you're right we don't a lot of times we don't talk about salary what is very important as we think about our careers and our next job steps, and so it is helpful to have sort of open discussion about that, so we do appreciate that.

222
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,220
Laura Power: And I have no go ahead teach you.

223
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:31,080
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I think that also writing grants is really important, so if you are writing grants, you can write yourself into a grant if you're going to do that or.

224
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:46,740
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Do the responsibility of that grant that's also what's really nice about nonprofits is that you are able to write grants, it creates more work for you, but you are able to command a certain amount of money because you're.

225
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,500
Chi-Chi Obianwu: including yourself on that grant.

226
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,050
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So that's also kind of a plus about working with nonprofits.

227
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:02,130
Laura Power: I was going to ask you, maybe to just talk a little bit about like what is a nonprofit exactly, and how does that.

228
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:12,030
Laura Power: Help the mission of public health or or work alongside maybe government, public health, what does it mean to be in a non profit, because the end in public health, especially.

229
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:19,410
Chi-Chi Obianwu: um so.

230
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:43,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: The thing is i've never worked for a for profit for profit agency i've only worked for a for the government and then for a city and then for nonprofits so i've never worked for a for profit agency, but I know for profit agencies in public out they get paid like let's say big pharma.

231
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,320
Chi-Chi Obianwu: They get paid a lot more.

232
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,890
Chi-Chi Obianwu: They do get paid a lot more, however, their jobs are more.

233
00:38:52,890 --> 00:39:15,360
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I feel like nonprofit I have a little bit more autonomy to go for various grants that I believe that our community needs or based on the data, this is what we need, so i'm going to apply for this particular grant so I have a new project, so I have more autonomy and maybe more.

234
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,990
Chi-Chi Obianwu: More.

235
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:32,220
Chi-Chi Obianwu: variety of projects, but if I work for big pharma I think that I would be doing kind of the same like pushing maybe a drug.

236
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:42,660
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Or, and it would be kind of it would be a little bit more repetitive, but big pharma is they'd make a lot of money because of.

237
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,860
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Because of these pharmaceutical drugs so that's you know that's a whole nother conversation to.

238
00:39:49,860 --> 00:40:04,830
Laura Power: We will have someone join us in a couple of classes later who works in more industry type position so it'll be something to sort of students, so they can kind of keep this discussion in mind, and then we can pick the brain of the next person in their industry type role.

239
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:14,100
Laura Power: There is a i've had a couple questions this one was sent to me i'm going to just sit here, so we can see it but it's asking about.

240
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:27,060
Laura Power: resources to find are there nonprofits or maybe non governmental organizations hiring like for for people for our students that are on the job search and are looking see what their options are.

241
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:41,430
Laura Power: what's a good way to find a nonprofit, which is a very broad term I guess right, as you pointed out, you worked in government agencies and so all those are really nonprofit many hospitals are nonprofit.

242
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:51,210
Laura Power: But how you maybe so maybe just thinking about the job search in general, looking for places that are hiring or finding something that matches up with your interest you don't have any advice on that.

243
00:40:51,210 --> 00:41:02,400
Chi-Chi Obianwu: um yeah um.

244
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,310
Chi-Chi Obianwu: yeah so I kind of I ended up in my the nonprofit that I work for.

245
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,590
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Because it's split.

246
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:22,020
Chi-Chi Obianwu: From the health department and then I pH so I worked at the health department and then we split into the Institute for population health.

247
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:47,430
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And then they went back to the to the health department, but I stayed with Institute for population health um so I don't really I can't answer that question because i've worked at the same place really but they just split due to like political kind of like government things so.

248
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:58,650
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know I I worked at the Detroit health department and that's kind of how I ended up at the nonprofit that I am not at so.

249
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:08,310
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I don't know how I would go about that, like I don't yeah I wouldn't know I just knew I wanted to work for like.

250
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,760
Chi-Chi Obianwu: The city with general causes I was.

251
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,360
Chi-Chi Obianwu: interested in maternal child health and so that's also how.

252
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:29,550
Chi-Chi Obianwu: That decision was made, but whatever you're interested in, you know that would be a start up just you know getting on Google and starting to really ask questions.

253
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:37,290
Laura Power: Everything through through Google i've noticed and I don't know if this is true locally to, but I think you know when I sometimes I think of.

254
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:49,560
Laura Power: Like our state health department and then there's empty J and it seems like mph is sort of a non governmental nonprofit that sort of next to the State health department and often can kind of.

255
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:57,270
Laura Power: have other flexibilities or like you were saying different grants can support the effort, sometimes and i've noticed a job posting sometimes where.

256
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:11,790
Laura Power: someone's sort of getting hired by the help to be with the health department, but they're really getting hired through mph guys, so it seems like sometimes those jobs are connected I don't know if that's the same thing for say Detroit health department and I pH or.

257
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:20,760
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Sometimes, sometimes so sometimes larger entities are fiduciaries of our entities so yeah and like different.

258
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:33,180
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Sometimes different political leaders come into leadership, they create different agencies, and so, and I will say that that's one thing that I did experiences.

259
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:52,950
Chi-Chi Obianwu: The changing sometimes you cannot control things usually administration or the like see the CEO or the the health department director, they are the one who controls the situation so it's like being flexible is really important.

260
00:43:52,950 --> 00:44:06,540
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I did not like we moved a lot like, so in that transition of being the Detroit health department and the Institute for population health, there was a lot of moving with finding out a good.

261
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,540
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Good building for our agency and during that time it was really stressful.

262
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:21,660
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Moving especially like having a lot of data on your computer having to move your computer from one room to another building to another building.

263
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:35,310
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And that kind of flexibilities really important and kind of just like rolling with the punches really and just being resilient is really important.

264
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:46,950
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Because it wasn't as straightforward as I thought it would be, but with political changes the structure of governments changes and so.

265
00:44:46,950 --> 00:45:08,640
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You have to change with that and that's out of your power but it's really nice to kind of just be cool with it because it's usually out of most people's power so being like a good team player and kind of being resilient through those movies those movies, are is really important.

266
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:22,770
Chi-Chi Obianwu: there's a question here, though, on did you do a fellowship I did do a fellowship If so, do you think it assess with assist with job advancement, yes, it does it does fellowships really get you in the door.

267
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:42,900
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And then you transition usually to a consulting firm, so I worked with booz Allen Hamilton which is like the biggest military consulting firm and you know that was sometimes I think to myself, like I should have stayed there because booz Allen Hamilton is essential.

268
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:49,170
Chi-Chi Obianwu: You know, you can go anywhere in the world like working on a military base.

269
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,730
Chi-Chi Obianwu: So yeah starting off with a fellowship gets you into the door.

270
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:12,750
Chi-Chi Obianwu: With an agency, like the Department of Defense or the CDC so fellowships are such a good way to open up the door and university of Michigan has a lot of connections throughout the country, so your event is such a good school to have an mph from because.

271
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:24,780
Chi-Chi Obianwu: It opens a lot of doors, and you know that name U of m opens up a lot of doors, but that fellowship really gets you into those job positions.

272
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:36,420
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Okay, do you have any advice experience with public service loan forgiveness through nonprofit work now I don't it was just paying off those student loans.

273
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:51,450
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I didn't do the loan forgiveness, I just paid them off, and it was a lot and so honestly, if I could do it again, I would look for scholarships take some time I know you guys have.

274
00:46:51,450 --> 00:47:13,920
Chi-Chi Obianwu: fall break, but if you see scholarship you could apply for it's really just writing essays writing one or two essays so the school of social work I got a I got a what is it a scholarship for it, but I wrote several several essays and.

275
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,370
Chi-Chi Obianwu: If writing an essay is worth $30,000.

276
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,470
Chi-Chi Obianwu: right that say.

277
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:45,720
Chi-Chi Obianwu: And it's it's really it's really in your vm has money you owe them has money so and I know that I did not my I paid for my mph and I was like 70,000 but if I could do it again, I would have wrote some as I would have I would have wrote many as I could.

278
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:57,390
Chi-Chi Obianwu: cut up because it's really all about just writing essays and you literally get $30,000 like that's so worth it.

279
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,140
Laura Power: On the list to Google those scholarship opportunities that are out there.

280
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:21,540
Chi-Chi Obianwu: With your advisor speak to visor or or go to the office and a student services and speak them in there, but there's a lot, you have them has a lot of funding like this is one of the things that makes you stand out from other universities is.

281
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:29,070
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Is that you know that the U of m is has a lot of you know, money available.

282
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,530
Chi-Chi Obianwu: and

283
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,660
Chi-Chi Obianwu: Yes, so.

284
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:46,800
Chi-Chi Obianwu: I mean i'll just tell you how I did it I gave myself a little weekend and I treated myself to a really great restaurant and I stayed in that restaurant all day and I.

285
00:48:46,800 --> 00:49:08,010
Chi-Chi Obianwu: ordered coffee and Nice meal and I wrote a bunch of essays and, yes, that is an investment that was probably like a 50 $60 investment for the return of like $30,000 so it's like you have to like figure out little things to do to.

286
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:27,360
Chi-Chi Obianwu: But these that, in my personal opinion, it is a priority, and you have to get it done with ease, because it is hard so make it easy on yourself and make yourself as comfortable, as you can so that you can get that return on your investment that's great.

287
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:34,800
Laura Power: that's great Thank you so much tg I think this was a really helpful discussion for our class.

288
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,460
Laura Power: let's see I know many of our students will be heading off to another class of people may be dropping off, but if there's.

289
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,490
Laura Power: Any last questions, we can try to take them here too, but thanks to our students were saying on and tg for.

290
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:52,980
Laura Power: joining us and I will just say just to wrap up for our students who have to leave that next week will be the.

291
00:49:52,980 --> 00:50:04,620
Laura Power: Thinking about doctoral programs or MED school programs that may not speak to all of you, you know you can choose to attend or not attend, depending on what your interest in that is we'll have two concurrent sessions will.

292
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:11,010
Laura Power: Try to do the smaller one which i'm guessing will be the MED school one, but I might actually send out a survey to kind of get an idea.

293
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:24,570
Laura Power: Because it's just me this time without Kate i'll figure out how to i'll probably do one in a breakout and maybe have Sarah adar with all of you, in the main, one for the if you're interested in the PhD one so that's What will be next week.

294
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,950
Laura Power: Lots of thank yous in here and I just wanted to make sure.

295

298
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:10,500
Laura Power: The Foundation is there, but making sure you can really grasp it and talk about it, and I say thinking that's a nice reminder know when you come out of your making sure that you have the skills that you want and.

299
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:21,060
Laura Power: And that's what we're hoping you're thinking about through the professional development classes like what are your goals and making sure that when you when you leave the program you have what you need and that you've just thought about what you need and that's what we're.

300
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,300
