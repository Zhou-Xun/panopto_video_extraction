1
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:06,011
Okay. So I wanted to make this a bit more open ended this week just because I do think there is value in trying

2
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:12,101
to like put things into words instead of just like writing down or or choosing between several responses.

3
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:20,021
Okay. So thank you for. Responding to this.

4
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:29,321
Okay. So there's no real great way of seeing people's responses, but I'll try to kind of keep those in mind.

5
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:34,091
On the PowerPoint slides, I also have my reasons.

6
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,710
Um. Okay.

7
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:42,911
So why don't we like three fields?

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,081
In my mind a big thing. What is an art? Does anyone know what the Nazis?

9
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:56,651
I think many people do not know what Nazis. I think oftentimes when people say odds, they mean a probability.

10
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:01,691
You know, I don't even know if odds you're supposed to use like a plural or a singular verb after

11
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:09,611
I've clearly has has meaning in terms of gambling and in terms of like the Kentucky Derby.

12
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:16,901
But outside of that, we just don't really use it. So odds ratios do show exaggerated results compared to risk ratio.

13
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:20,561
They're not flexible. I like to stay over represent things.

14
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:25,871
And again, especially for cohort and cross-sectional study, it's not the greatest but for case control studies.

15
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:31,601
But also, if outcomes are really rare, then it's probably fun and it approximates the risk ratio.

16
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:38,801
You might have learned in other classes where it might appropriate or might approach a rate ratio in other situations.

17
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:44,171
Um, I think sometimes, you know, when other analytical methods don't work,

18
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:49,511
going back to an odds ratio can be good because logistic regression is just a very simple they're very clean.

19
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:54,281
They're one of the easier things for statistical programs to model.

20
00:02:54,281 --> 00:03:03,641
But also if you're just trying to get a propensity score or to do like a risk calculator or something like that, a logistic regression model slide.

21
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:11,921
Okay. Um, what is the counterfactual comparison?

22
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,641
Certainly like changing the exposure. That is great.

23
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:27,131
But I would say like in, in the end, it's in my mind I go it go back to this idea of time travel, give somebody a cue, go back in time.

24
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:36,431
Don't give them a cue. You could also think of counterfactuals as in like everything else stays the same between these individuals.

25
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:40,451
But theoretically, everything else that stays the same would be time and secular trends.

26
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:44,111
So that's why I think this like time travel aspect is important to think through.

27
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:52,361
But we can also think more largely about like exchange ability of these populations that like the distribution of confounders should be the same.

28
00:03:54,251 --> 00:04:00,941
And so for a counterfactual, it's the individual. If they get a Q, if they don't get sick, everything else is the same in their lives.

29
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:12,131
Okay. So what are the limits of using race and causal inference and in, you know, epidemiological methods in particular?

30
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:20,050
Uh, my simple answer is that it's unclear what the counterfactual comparison is.

31
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,901
I think, you know, other people are talking about how it's related to some of the other socioeconomic factors,

32
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,091
things about it being a social construct.

33
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:34,091
I didn't say, you know, when we're thinking of counterfactuals and we're thinking of like even an experimental study,

34
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,911
something to think about, like, is how could you change your own exposure so for yourself,

35
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:45,670
so for like whether a vaccine is effective or not, if we wanted experimental evidence, we could think in our minds,

36
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,991
like, what would it mean for me to get a better vaccine or for me not to get a vaccine?

37
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,831
When you start thinking about some other things, it becomes a bit more difficult.

38
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:00,041
Like when you start thinking about race, what would it mean to me to be white?

39
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:03,821
What would it mean for me to be black? What would it mean for me to be Asian?

40
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,091
Like those are complicated kind of awkward things to be thinking through.

41
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,241
And I think some of these awkwardness, these are things that you're mentioned,

42
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:18,401
but we can model things like racism, we can model race relations, we can model structural issues.

43
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,930
So there's a lot we can do. And this isn't to say that we should totally ignore the race issue.

44
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:30,431
I think we should definitely be thinking about it, but just thinking about it, counterfactuals can be really difficult and there are limits.

45
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:38,411
Okay. So natural direct effects again. I know this is the the complicated thing.

46
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,991
What does it mean for there to be natural direct effects?

47
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:48,311
Again, the direct effect is we are controlling for the mediator what we're looking at, like what's purely going between the explosion, you know,

48
00:05:48,941 --> 00:06:00,341
so it's kind of like what's going on between hydroxychloroquine use and malaria, controlling for this idea of inflammation within the individual.

49
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:09,041
So here are my explanations for what a natural direct effect would be versus what a controlled direct effect would be.

50
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:17,171
So, you know, a natural direct effect is the comparison, a counterfactual comparison of those who are or not give any CQ.

51
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:25,211
And then we are setting the inflammation levels to be as if somebody was not given any CQ.

52
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:33,181
But for the control direct effect, that's where we control the levels of the mediator.

53
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:38,131
So for, you know, we could have we would have two different controlled direct effects then.

54
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:41,821
So we'd have a comparison of those within whatever excuse,

55
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:48,901
setting them to have high levels of information versus controlling people with and without HQ, setting them to have low levels of information.

56
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:56,881
So these are, you know, the number of controlled direct effects is equal to the number of levels of mediators there are in the analysis.

57
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,601
And the natural direct effect is sort of an average over these.

58
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:12,001
But I think it is kind of in line with what we're thinking about in terms of like a direct effect and burning kind of your civil test approach.

59
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:22,591
Okay. Another review question. What is the frequentist interpretation of a p value point of three?

60
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:27,991
Whenever I have questions like this is, a lot of students would just be like to do the hypothesis testing.

61
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:33,631
We'll say, you know, theoretically we have an alpha level point of five, so it would be significant.

62
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:41,971
Okay. So yeah, I mean,

63
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:49,590
I think how you have to start off thinking about these is you have to say you have to have like

64
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:56,611
an introductory clause where you say that there is no relationship between excuse and malaria.

65
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:15,121
3% of time we will get a value as extreme or more extreme. And then some of you are.

66
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:22,111
Okay, so we're designing an experiment. We're trying to reduce the risk of neuropathy among patients with diabetes.

67
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:27,841
We randomize individuals into receiving a recommendation to attend weightwatchers or not.

68
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:36,301
We could have three different ways of thinking about this experimental effect. One, How does reduced weight affect risk of neuropathy?

69
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:40,831
Two How does attending Weight Watchers affect risky neuropathy?

70
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:44,961
Or three How does receiving a recommendation affect risk in our opposite?

71
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:51,931
So the answer is this one. I would say this is one that we want, like we want to know, like how does changing your weight,

72
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,231
presumably reducing your weight, how does that affect your risk of neuropathy?

73
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:59,351
But that's just like not what we are able to test like.

74
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:09,781
There's no I would argue there's been no randomized clinical trial which has directly attack tested the effect of weight changes on health outcomes.

75
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:19,321
And that's just because we cannot with a flip of our hands of snap of our fingers, switch somebodys weight again.

76
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:25,891
We can, you know, ask them to attend Weight Watchers, but, you know, we can't force them to attend Weight Watchers.

77
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:33,420
Maybe in some, like unethical society where we like actually are going to people's homes and dragging them into Weight Watchers.

78
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:39,031
We could test this. But in the current ethical regimens that we have, this is what we're actually testing.

79
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:45,961
And I think that's really important when you think of these experimental studies which are doing is like what is the point of randomization?

80
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,051
Because the point of randomization is the fact that you are testing.

81
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:55,831
So for this study, we are giving people either a recommendation to Weight Watchers or some other placebo.

82
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:01,411
That is what we are testing the effect of. We're not testing the effect of whether they actually attend Weight Watchers,

83
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:07,111
which we'd have to do more of like an observational or maybe like a more of a per protocol analysis.

84
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:12,511
And we certainly aren't being able to do something, release their weight loss.

85
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:32,610
Any questions on those? So today we are talking about quantitative bias analysis.

86
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,631
And a lot of this has to do with what do we do when there are unmeasured

87
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:41,671
confounders or there is some bias that we were unable to deal with previously.

88
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:48,871
So like, for instance, in a marginal structural model, we're able to do these fancy statistics,

89
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:53,131
but like we can't control for unmeasured confounders in a marginal structural model.

90
00:10:53,491 --> 00:11:00,450
We can in instrumental variable analysis, but not every not every question can use an instrumental variable analysis.

91
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,881
That's a very particular type of data set that you need to have.

92
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:09,121
So what do we do in a situation where we do have unmeasured confounders or what do we do in a situation where there is bias?

93
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:16,531
We can do a quantitative biosensors. So I want to talk a bit about this idea of a total error paradigm.

94
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:26,461
And in my mind I used that error to refer to some deviation which is a bit random in scope, whereas bias is it's a bit more directional.

95
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,831
I think there are two types of errors or two types of biases.

96
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,381
You can take a measurement and representation.

97
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:41,430
So measurement also sometimes called information in representation is sometimes called selection or sampling,

98
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:45,391
although sometimes that's something a bit more specific, but it's that arena.

99
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:59,131
So what do we mean by this? We have maybe a particular statistic in mind, and maybe the statistic which we are trying to compute is,

100
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,631
you know, how many people are depressed in a population?

101
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:08,131
What proportion of population is depressed? So our construct is this idea of depression.

102
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:12,691
So idea that people, you know, have a certain mental health issue.

103
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:15,031
There's depression. So we have a measurement of it.

104
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:21,121
Our measurement might be like some short term scale that we have, you know, people responding to a survey.

105
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,930
But that's that's not a measurement.

106
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:36,421
So that's like us as researchers putting together this survey, the response is like, how are people responding to how how do they answer that survey?

107
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:42,960
And then the edited response is sort of like us as we are analyzing the data in our dataset,

108
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:47,251
like how are we, you know, deriving our variable or like what kind of data cleaning are we doing?

109
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:53,071
So that's like issues in measurement. Then we have issues with representation.

110
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:59,541
So maybe what we're trying to do is like, what is the prevalence of depression here?

111
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:04,051
And we're here to enter. So our target population is ANOVA.

112
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:10,291
We just don't know how many people are depressed there. There's no sampling frame of everybody who lives in Ann Arbor.

113
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,461
I didn't even know if the US government has this.

114
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:25,681
Probably the closest thing we'd have would be maybe we're able to buy a list of households from a commercial company.

115
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,961
But note that not everybody will be present in that list.

116
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:36,721
But you know, we have this list of households and then we develop a sample and we're not going to talk to everybody in Ann Arbor.

117
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:43,531
But we have this sampling plan. And, you know, from your previous classes probably talk about different ways you can sample people in the studies.

118
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:50,451
So we have some way of getting people to sample is a smaller number, but not everybody's going to respond.

119
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:54,661
You know, we knock on some houses, some people are not there or they don't participate in our study.

120
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:59,941
And then, you know, depending on how we set our study, we might need to create some weights.

121
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:06,601
So throughout all of this, there can be issues with error and issues with bias.

122
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:14,401
So validity is this idea that our like is the measurement is the scale that we came up with.

123
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,471
Does that actually measure the construct?

124
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:30,001
We could have a measurement error in the sense that a measurement error is like how are people responding to our study or our scale?

125
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:36,211
And it could be processing error. Like, you know, as we're analyzing the data that are in steps, maybe we're incorrectly coding things.

126
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:42,741
And then along here again, there's also errors, coverage, error.

127
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:47,251
You know, we're not getting the homeless population in our sampling frame.

128
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:55,111
Maybe when we buy it from this company, they're using addresses from like five years ago and there's been new developments and those are included.

129
00:14:56,881 --> 00:15:00,451
Sampling error is, you know, how we put our study together.

130
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:06,391
Maybe there's error in how we're sampling people. There could be non-response errors and adjustments.

131
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:15,871
And again, errors is probably more on the side of there's not systematically an error or a systematic deviation in one way or another,

132
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:19,641
but biases like there might be in one direction or another.

133
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:26,731
So there can be errors throughout. This can be kind of errors in measurement.

134
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:39,331
We can have errors in representation. So I'm going to give you some graphic depictions of how we can talk about these errors.

135
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:46,801
I will say that, you know, every paper or every researcher probably has their own unique ways that they want to do that.

136
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:54,120
What I'm trying to introduce you to today are pretty common ways that people do it across different studies or across different papers.

137
00:15:54,121 --> 00:16:00,241
But always good to keep in mind like a figure legend that people have because this may or may not apply to you, for you in the future.

138
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:07,831
So we have an idea of conditioning or adjusting for something, and that's just like putting it in square brackets.

139
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:17,721
So that means it's kind of like included in our model. Stratification is where we will specify who's included in our model.

140
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:24,621
So basically we're limiting our analysis or limiting this to only one group of individuals.

141
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:31,781
If we have some sort of confounder or some variable in general that's unknown and unmeasured,

142
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:37,750
we just use you if something is known, but we don't measure it.

143
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:46,261
We probably just put it in parentheses. If something is a proxy variable, we will use an asterisk.

144
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,211
And I'll give an example of that in a moment.

145
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:58,541
So the next few slides will kind of delve into all of this.

146
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:07,461
Okay. So what do we mean by there being bias or even just error in measurement?

147
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:19,281
Um, you know, we typically have our x y like, um, hydroxychloroquine use and malaria incidence that can be something.

148
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:27,360
In reality, there's probably going to be some bias in how we measure the exposure and the outcomes.

149
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:31,801
So the exposure we would love for us to be able to directly measure the exposure,

150
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,331
which is like hydroxychloroquine use, but we probably actually don't measure that and said we have a proxy measure.

151
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:47,091
So a proxy measure might be survey respondents reporting that they use hydroxychloroquine and hopefully they're not lying to us about,

152
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:54,091
you know, there could be systematic biases. Maybe they don't understand the question, maybe they don't want to respond in a certain way.

153
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,291
Maybe they think there's some social desirability bias in one direction or another.

154
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:06,391
So what we actually measure is this actors we measure like what we survey with the survey respondents think or what they see,

155
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,901
what they report is their hydroxychloroquine use.

156
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:16,291
Whereas, you know, we don't care what they report, we care what they like actually are doing is that distinction makes sense.

157
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:22,561
And similarly you can do the same thing with like malaria incidence is the outcome.

158
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:23,250
And again,

159
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:30,151
there could be errors based on self-report from the individual or maybe we're collecting labs and there's just been like incorrect diagnoses.

160
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:37,770
So, you know, probably for any variable, we're like really not measuring what we think we're measuring.

161
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:47,941
We're measuring a proxy and that's just something to kind of keep in mind and maybe make us a bit humble in how we interpret our findings.

162
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:57,601
Okay. So, um, how you ask about things can be really, really important.

163
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:02,591
So this was an interesting study which compared two different ways to conduct interviews.

164
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,791
There's a standardized interviewing and conversational interviewing.

165
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:12,861
So standardized interviewing is sort of the I guess it's historically been considered the gold standard in survey work.

166
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:18,061
And basically the idea of standard interviewing is that if somebody is confused about a question,

167
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:22,831
you, the interviewer, can't really explain it to them.

168
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,471
You can basically just repeat the question over again.

169
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:34,081
So like we are very clear with we are going to have a set survey question which is given to everybody in a survey.

170
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,531
Respondents are confused. That's kind of up to them to try to figure out the response.

171
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,221
And there may be some limited definitions we can give people, but not much.

172
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:48,331
Conversational interviewing is much more, you know, you start off with the same question, but if people have confusions,

173
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:54,361
you can try to respond to their confusions and kind of kind of work through what they have in more of a conversational like.

174
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,251
Again, the point of this class is to distinguish between standardized and conversational interviewing.

175
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:03,581
It's basically just to say that there are different ways of collecting information and let's look at some differences.

176
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,571
So this is a study of people sexual behaviors,

177
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:12,421
and they randomized individuals into getting a standardized interview versus a conversational interview.

178
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:16,621
So if you look at things like age and education, it's pretty much the same.

179
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:22,471
Like there's not a significant difference in how people recorded their age or how they reported their education.

180
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:30,961
These are percentages. There wasn't a difference, you know, based on or this the this is not a difference between these two groups.

181
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:38,280
But this is where it gets interesting where like if you asked a bit more sensitive things in terms of,

182
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:44,641
you know, like condom usage in sex, you can get different responses.

183
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:53,221
And so for people in a conversational interview, about 4% admitted to it versus 1% in a standardized interview.

184
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,701
And, you know, we don't know the truth here,

185
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:02,671
but presumably at least the researchers were thinking in their mind that probably the higher number is more accurate.

186
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:09,661
So probably people were bit confused about like, what does this actually mean, what it means have protected sex or not?

187
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,761
You know, there's probably lots of things there that they might need to talk to somebody about.

188
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:23,971
And this is just to say we got different answers or different proportions of responses depending on how we conducted the survey.

189
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:29,850
But the interesting thing about this is not only was there a difference based on like these two behaviors,

190
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:33,631
but they actually found a difference by ethnicity.

191
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:40,741
So in a conversational interview, people were more likely to report that they were Hispanic versus in a standardized interview.

192
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:45,661
And again, some of these like questions on race, ethnicity, we heard them and really weird ways.

193
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:50,010
You know, it's not really based on scientific considerations most of the time.

194
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:57,561
It's usually based on like how the government decided to do things a long time ago.

195
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:00,031
And we just like stick with that wording over time.

196
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:07,411
And this is all to say, you know, there is measurement error in places which you probably don't expect it to pop up.

197
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,821
Okay. So that is kind of like the information side of things.

198
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:21,911
If we go to the selection side of things, this is how we'd read, we'd represented with Dags.

199
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,821
Again, we have our X, Y. We're just going to pretend that there's no measurement, error or bias here.

200
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:36,731
What we might be doing is we might be just selecting a certain group of individuals and we might not be purposefully doing that.

201
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:45,371
But if there are some unknown variables in the background, those could be influencing their exposure status in the selection.

202
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:53,501
The one example could be going back to our example of coffee use and diabetes.

203
00:22:53,501 --> 00:23:07,571
That's what we're trying to study. Let's say say we are doing some sampling based in a clinic.

204
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:20,561
There might be a third variable out there which is related to both their coffee usage and to them being at the clinic.

205
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,671
And maybe it's like another health status that they have.

206
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,941
Maybe it has to do with like income,

207
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:35,891
maybe it has to do with like social capital or like being in the know that they can get a doctor visit at a certain time.

208
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,670
So that's how these selection biases can often arise,

209
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:50,461
is that there's these unknown and unmeasured variables in the background which will in practice select for a certain group of individuals,

210
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:57,211
even if we don't want that. Uncontrolled confounding.

211
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:02,101
This is where, you know, we have in, but we know there is this confounder Z.

212
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:08,581
But we're just not measuring it. And that's why there's parentheses around it. But it still is the cofounder of the X Y relationship.

213
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:22,751
And so all these things can happen in tandem. You know, it's not just that in this one study, there is selection bias.

214
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:29,081
This other study, this measure of bias and this other study there's, you know, can unmeasured confounding.

215
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:33,131
In reality, these these things operate in tandem in our study.

216
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:35,351
So what are we to do about this?

217
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:48,971
So I would say most of the time, including in my own research, we just don't or maybe we will mention in our like a limitation section the discussion.

218
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:53,671
We'll talk a bit about how there might be some areas or some biases within our study.

219
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:58,101
That's probably the extent to what people do. And I think that that's a relatively good thing, too.

220
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:07,241
The thing is, there's been a long history of people advocating for more quantitative approaches to deal with these biases.

221
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:17,950
It's just we haven't really done much with that. So here's a paper from 1965 where this person was trying to introduce the idea of a

222
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:25,061
need for more rigorous quantitative methods to deal with with biases in our sample.

223
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,100
So of course, hindsight's always 2020.

224
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:37,481
But, you know, we don't always think ahead of time and try to minimize the amount of bias in terms of our analysis,

225
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:42,311
in terms of, you know, the information we're collecting in the sample that we're getting.

226
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:49,211
So we rely want that. And so, you know,

227
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:56,711
I think that's the whole point of many processes that you've been taking is training ahead of time to think through what the analysis plan is,

228
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:02,741
minimizing data collection errors. I think that that's that's useful.

229
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:09,251
But more often than not, we're just like given a data set or we have access to data set, it's imperfect.

230
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:17,261
What do we do with it? As an aside, because I've been talking a lot and I want to kind of push this back to you.

231
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,151
Let's think about an example.

232
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:33,670
Let's think about hybrid silver, high bias, low variance, low bias hybrids say that we are trying to measure how tall or no, let's do it.

233
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:38,891
How how long somebody has gone.

234
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:46,961
Like we're measuring the length of distance or they're they're like a jogger run that they're on.

235
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:51,250
Maybe we have like an app on their phone or some like smartwatch or something.

236
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:54,881
So we're trying to collect that geographic data. And there's kind of two choices.

237
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:58,961
We can either choose a low bias, high variance watch,

238
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:06,401
which like on average will say that you ran five miles, but there will be like a kind of a distribution.

239
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:14,980
It's, you know, not that accurate with or we could go with a smartwatch, which is high bias, low variance.

240
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:22,031
So it's always going to kind of like push up a bit. Um, which one do you think would be best for the study?

241
00:27:22,781 --> 00:28:12,541
I'll let you talk among itself for a few. That's about all of that.

242
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:18,881
I don't like the term.

243
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:55,631
She was. Yeah.

244
00:28:56,451 --> 00:29:00,611
Okay. You know, there's a lot of things that we can think through with this.

245
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:05,561
I'll go to a couple of groups to gather your thoughts. This is a record.

246
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:23,371
What is your thought on this? Do you have any is that just like a gut feeling or do you have any thoughts on that?

247
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:35,391
Yeah. Still low base, high variance, the sort of averages around the number that you're supposed to get moving over here,

248
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:38,811
the type two areas and different parts with similar thoughts.

249
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:46,871
Very difficult to get the temperature. Mm hmm.

250
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,931
Um, but you women in my group, the deceased.

251
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:57,161
Did you have any other different thoughts? Oh, no.

252
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,551
So first off, there's no right or wrong answer with this.

253
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:18,250
So a few things to keep in mind. I think, you know, in general, my initial thought also would be to think about the low bias,

254
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:24,791
high variance, because like, you know, on average it's there maybe spread across multiple people.

255
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:30,551
You know, there'll be some like error here and there, but it's certainly, you know, more of a error issue than a bias issue.

256
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:36,611
The one thing with this high bias, low variance is that we have very precise results.

257
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:42,611
So if we are able to know the direction of the bias, then we can control for that.

258
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:52,031
Like if we know that this is always going to say that you run one and a half miles more or like 20% higher than you actually run,

259
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:57,251
then we can just control for that in our analysis and like compute a new number based on this.

260
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,901
And then that's sort of like that best result is you can have like a little by little variance estimate.

261
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:09,260
We don't always have that. And I purposely gave you very little information. So, you know, that might happen for certain measures.

262
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:18,851
That might not happen for certain measures. But I will say that a lot of times in epidemiology, we have a bias variance tradeoff.

263
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:23,421
We need to make a decision like, are we going to do something which will, you know,

264
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:27,311
introduce more bias, but how a variance or have high bias and low variance.

265
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:32,261
And my charge for you is to not always take the low bias, high beams,

266
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:36,911
because I think that's like our gut intuition is epidemiologists is that's the one that we want.

267
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:40,421
And I you know, I get all of what you said. I think it all makes sense.

268
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:46,751
But sometimes we can correct for the bias and then that could be like an ideal thing.

269
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:57,941
Okay. So moving into what is what is a real world situation, how does this how does this impact us?

270
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:03,340
This is what we want in a data set. We want to know, you know, all the unmeasured confounders.

271
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:06,341
We want to know like our X variables and our Y variables.

272
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:10,981
This is just a simplified representation of nine different people in a dataset,

273
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,921
many oversimplifying just to say that these are the three variables of interest.

274
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:20,651
And then that means that we have that information collected. So this is we want we want to complete information.

275
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,181
In reality, what we have is a lot of missing information.

276
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,731
So a lot of this bias actually has to do with like it's a missing information problem.

277
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,991
So like, we obviously do not have any information about unmeasured unknown confounders that's like missing.

278
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:40,631
We also just have some people who just didn't respond or maybe we weren't able to collect that information.

279
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:47,710
And here I'm just trying to highlight that maybe like what we are measuring is more

280
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:51,161
of a proxy that could be very different than what we actually are trying to measure.

281
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:55,741
So there could be, you know, substantial error between what we're trying to measure and what we actually measure.

282
00:32:56,801 --> 00:33:02,771
So, you know, I think oftentimes in our epidemiology courses, like what we give you is this.

283
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:07,541
But in reality, this is like what we have a lot of the times in the real world.

284
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:18,731
So what can we do with it? There are very different methods in each of these could probably be its own three credit course.

285
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:24,911
So I'm just here to in a couple minutes highlight what these are for the homework assignment for today.

286
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:31,060
You will go through a couple of examples of these, but I am like holding your hand as you do it.

287
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:41,590
So it's not supposed to be any like really particularly difficult coding, but what can we do if we have biases?

288
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:46,031
I guess the thing which I to the point is oftentimes you just like write about them

289
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:50,560
in a limitation section that's probably like the default and I think that's okay.

290
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,571
A lot of times I, you know,

291
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:58,181
there might be some hardcore methodologies which says you need to do a quantitative bias analysis for every single analysis you do.

292
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:05,441
I'm not one of those people, but there could be people like that out there. You could try to find the missing data.

293
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:09,521
So how can you do that? Like if you had all the money in the world,

294
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:18,401
you could go back to everyone and try to get this unmeasured confounders so it's no longer unmeasured and you could try to fill in these holes.

295
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:24,281
If you can't do that for everyone, you could try to do that for like a limited group of people.

296
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:28,421
Or you could try to compare your data to another study which has done that.

297
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:35,431
You could do multiple imputation. And I'll explain that in a moment. The other thing is you could determine the extent of the problem.

298
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:38,831
So one thing we'll be doing today is calculating in value.

299
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:42,161
You could do very sensitivity analysis.

300
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:49,001
You know, probabilistic sensitivity analysis are that's a fancy way of saying doing like multiple sensitivity analysis all at once.

301
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:56,500
I think you do some modeling, you do some Bayesian approaches. So, you know, it's not my goal to have you understand all these things,

302
00:34:56,501 --> 00:35:03,041
but let's talk about a few of them so we can compare our data to an external dataset.

303
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:10,941
So again, this is. What we have. But maybe there's an external data set which actually did measure this you and does have good access in wise.

304
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:21,051
So in this external data set, we could run a similar analysis as ours and we could try to see in this external dataset,

305
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:28,641
what's the relationship between you and executed Y. And we could try to use that to predict what the values for use would be like in our data.

306
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:33,681
So this is basically using this external data set to predict what our data sets would show.

307
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:39,321
That's one thing we could do. We could also do an internal validation study.

308
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:45,591
Again, this is where we might just go to back to a few people and try to fill in some of the holes in our data set.

309
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:54,351
We could do multiple amputation. I'm only showing you two I'd lose here because.

310
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:59,841
But ideally, you know, you have this for everybody, for multiple amputation.

311
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:03,440
What we are trying to do is we're trying to put together a best guess for what

312
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:07,011
the relationship between different variables should be like in our dataset.

313
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:16,371
And then what we will do is we will come, we will output answers, but there will be a distribution of answers.

314
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:23,511
So maybe this new variable, if we're still thinking about like hydroxychloroquine use and malaria,

315
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:30,501
maybe this you variable is something related to that.

316
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:39,440
They have insurance or do they have medical insurance or not for everybody any we might predict

317
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:43,551
then what this you is based on other variables in the dataset including like their age,

318
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,700
their occupation, things like that.

319
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:54,231
And so for some people there might be a high likelihood that they have insurance, some people a very low likelihood,

320
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:56,211
but for a lot of people may just kind of be in between,

321
00:36:56,421 --> 00:37:00,891
in which case some of the times for you will say that they have insurance and some of the times we want.

322
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:09,350
So for you, there could be a range of responses here. So the idea for multiple amputation is we we don't just have one best guess for everybody.

323
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:13,821
We have like multiple best guesses which can which can vary.

324
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:25,791
And then in our final analysis, we will we will account for the fact that, like everybody has multiple values the same time.

325
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:38,010
Okay. One thing we can think about also is reweighting the sample,

326
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:41,641
especially if there's a lot to follow up, although we could wait for a variety of reasons.

327
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:49,801
So say we have in we've one 20% of people are low income, 70% live in urban areas.

328
00:37:50,941 --> 00:38:03,261
But when we look at the way to like we follow up a year later, only 10% are low income and 80% are in urban areas.

329
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,541
So we kind of we maybe we lost 100 people or so.

330
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:15,321
What we can do is we can relate this wave to sample to be more similar to what it was like in the wave once civil.

331
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:27,231
In practice. This means that if you are a low income person who lives in a in a rural area, you are going to be upgraded.

332
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:34,701
So we are going to account for the fact that, you know, people who are similar to you are the ones who are being dropped out of the study.

333
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:47,930
So your value of this study is kind of upward. Okay.

334
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:57,921
So for the homework assignment, this is what I'm going to have you do three different types of quantitative analysis.

335
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:06,771
One, we will have you do a selection bias where we deal with confounder, will have you deal with misclassification.

336
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:15,501
So for the selection bias similar to this whole issue, what I would have you do is update individuals similar to those last fall.

337
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:22,281
So we're going to figure out like who's more likely to be lost to follow up and then upwind individuals who are still in the sample,

338
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:33,531
but similar to those who are lost to program. Then we are going to use a validation subsample to kind of evaluate what the

339
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:39,441
probability that an individual is part of a different level of confounder.

340
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:45,431
And then we were going to look at misclassification.

341
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,091
Also using a validations sample.

342
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:58,941
The last part of this before our very biases do not always occur in the same direction.

343
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:05,841
So I would say like kind of the three big things that we're thinking about in epidemiology are information biases, selection biases and confounding.

344
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:12,681
And again, that that has to go back to this like first thing you know, we have biases in this part.

345
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:18,681
We have biases in this part. And then the confounding has to do with like analysis that we were putting together.

346
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:23,061
So, you know, these are the three types of biases that we can be having.

347
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,131
And the biases do not always operate in the same situation.

348
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:37,221
So you see the true value of something is five.

349
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:45,941
Like maybe that's a risk ratio for hydroxychloroquine use and malaria incidence.

350
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:53,951
But because the information bias, it might be even exaggerated more because of confounding, it could be even higher.

351
00:40:54,311 --> 00:41:01,661
But then selection bias might point in a different direction. Which is all to say that, like, if we only dealt with information bias,

352
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:09,671
maybe we'd come up with a different value than if we had dealt with confounding versus if we had dealt with selection bias.

353
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:15,881
So I this is all the same. Like, I think if you're going to go do a quantitative bias analysis,

354
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:22,301
do it like try to think comprehensively about like all the different sources that might be affecting this otherwise,

355
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:26,981
you know, you're not necessarily getting any closer to what the true estimate is.

356
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:29,891
And this is just a different way of thinking about things.

357
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:37,471
You know, your information confounding could be kind of cancel each other out, to be honest, and the selection bias could be even worse.

358
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:44,621
So again, the biases, you know, occur in all sorts of different areas.

359
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:53,351
Okay. So with that, let me give you a few minutes and we'll start back here at 2:00.

360
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:22,939
We are going to be going over very.

361
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:44,739
So what I have been talking about before, you know, there is all these like analysis you can do and sensitivity analysis and,

362
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:54,009
you know, get somebody to do a validation study, you know, appoint your surgery people in your study sample.

363
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,109
There's a lot. That's a that's a lot to do. You know, it's a lot different. It's a lot of effort.

364
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:09,569
So the value is one way of quantifying potential problems of unmeasured confounders, which is relatively simple.

365
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:18,489
You know, it's a very simple equation you can do. So the easy value is an easy to calculate number,

366
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:26,409
which shows the strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have to explain all of the observed x y associations.

367
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:38,859
So repeat that in a different way. See, we have this relationship between hydroxychloroquine use and malaria incidence.

368
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,029
But there might be other unmeasured confounders.

369
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:52,929
You know, we have better sense of how strong of a confounder would the insurance status need to be in order to

370
00:43:52,929 --> 00:44:01,989
explain away all of the association that we found between hydroxychloroquine and malaria incidence.

371
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:06,909
And again, it's explained away all of it because clearly confounder might, you know,

372
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:10,989
an unmeasured confounder will probably explain away some of this association.

373
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,449
But can it explain all of it?

374
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:22,419
Like basically if we found a significant result between hydroxychloroquine use and malaria, how bad of confounding, how much residual confounding,

375
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:30,459
how much unmeasured confounding must there be to make it so that we actually would have had non-significant results?

376
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:36,659
That's basically what the evaluation is trying to say. So a bit of a back story.

377
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:43,379
But the value first off, if you Google E value, there's like a bajillion other measures out there which have the term e value.

378
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,629
So you're going to have to specify that it's like a statistic and it's about like unmeasured confounding.

379
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:55,559
So tell me, Brandi, we'll again like a big methodology thing, epidemiology.

380
00:44:56,249 --> 00:45:02,669
He came up with this idea of e value and he reported it in Annals of Internal Medicine,

381
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:12,358
which if you know nothing or if you know anything about about journals, is, is more of like a clinically oriented journal.

382
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:16,119
So like a lot of doctors are reading this, it's not a methodology.

383
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,969
They're like, you didn't publish this in the Journal of Epidemiology or some statistics journal.

384
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:28,349
You publish it purposely in a clinical journal, because the idea is he wanted to start introducing clinicians to this idea that,

385
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:32,179
you know, there could be bias in your research. And here's an easy way to do.

386
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:39,359
You know, he's not going to publish in Annals of Internal Medicine like this really complicated formula for doing quantitative bias analysis.

387
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:45,149
But this is value is simple enough that ideally, you know, a few clinician researchers could be able to start to use it.

388
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:59,689
So some formulas here know we have our treatment outcome and then we have measure covariates, which we can control for in our analysis.

389
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,429
The problem is when there are unmeasured confounders. So this is the issue here.

390
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:10,999
So what do we do with these unmeasured confounders? We think of two numbers for these unmeasured confounders.

391
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:20,149
First, what is the relationship between the exposure and the unmeasured confounder and the unmeasured confounder and the disease?

392
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:25,879
So I think he is referring to the exposure of the treatment and D is the disease or the outcome.

393
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:32,018
So, you know, we have our risk ratio that we can calculate here.

394
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:39,219
And ideally, you know, if we can throw up or measure covariates, we get, you know, some statistic, observable statistic.

395
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:43,629
But this these are unobservable this is like, well, we don't have because we do not measure that confounder.

396
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:55,348
So what the EA value is, is it's a simplified representation of how strong would these two values need

397
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:00,689
to be to completely negate any finding that we that we are talking about.

398
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:08,798
So in a way, I kind of wish he called it an E curve and not an E value,

399
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,628
because the E value itself is just a simplified representation of these numbers.

400
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:18,969
The E value is like assuming that this relationship is as strong as this relationship.

401
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:25,319
But this is you know, the calculation is it's a pretty simple to do.

402
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:32,219
If you have a risk ratio, you just do the risk ratio plus the square root of the risk ratio, times the risk ratio minus one.

403
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:38,839
I think the hardest thing here and what students, if they do any slip ups is they don't like put the parentheses in correctly.

404
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:43,649
So the square root is over, you know, both the risk ratio and the risk mindset.

405
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:51,289
If your risk ratio is of less than one.

406
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:59,419
Basically, you just need to flip it first so you can kind of like flip it and then you can we flip the value back if you want in this?

407
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,248
You know, this is this is part of epidemiology.

408
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:10,728
Like if we're looking at the risk of malaria for those who use hydroxychloroquine use versus those who do not use hydroxychloroquine,

409
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:19,188
use the inverse of that. Like for those who don't use hydroxychloroquine versus those who do like that's that's the same association.

410
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:24,499
It's just like a flip number. So that's, you know, something just to keep in mind, if you have a risk ratio of one,

411
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:34,069
this is for a risk review is if you have some other measure of association, there's some other formulas which are presently in this in the slide deck.

412
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:42,649
So this is what I mean by there is an E value, but there's also like a curve associated with it.

413
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:54,049
So this axis refers to the exposure unmeasured confounder relationship, like what the risk ratio would be.

414
00:48:54,169 --> 00:49:02,029
And then this axis refers to what the relationship is like between the unmeasured confounder and the disease.

415
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:12,018
And this is a hypothetical example where the risk ratio between the exposure and the disease is 3.9 and the E value is 7.26.

416
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:16,819
And again, it's just this formula to find out what these values.

417
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:25,708
So the key value is us assuming that the that the strength of the association for

418
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:29,819
the exposure unmeasured confounder is the same as the unmeasured confounder disease.

419
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:41,579
That is probably, you know, a simplified this is simplified assumption because like you could have, you know,

420
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:50,159
the relationship between the exposure and measure confounder could be stronger and then the unmeasured confounder disease could be less strong.

421
00:49:51,479 --> 00:50:00,749
But the idea behind this is that everything here is okay, but everything over here could influence your values.

422
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:09,028
So let me try to. Be technologically competent and put this on this board.

423
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:17,949
So if you have your. Your relationship.

424
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:30,969
And I just want to make sure. Had this issue.

425
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:37,589
Me The value is the it's like the minimum points for both.

426
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:50,049
But really like everything in this area.

427
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:05,289
These are values that could. That will impact our results.

428
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:18,089
So values here in this area.

429
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:34,719
Theoretically they will. They will not make the risk ratio of the exposure disease.

430
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:46,229
Not me. So this is like significantly.

431
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:01,069
Okay. So hopefully what I'm trying to say is like a bit comprehensible.

432
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:08,449
So again, the E values just one simplified representation of this entire area here, this entire curve.

433
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:14,569
But really anything outside of this is something that could influence your results

434
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:19,689
and make it so that your exposure to disease relationship actually is faulty.

435
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:21,679
Because that's really what we care about.

436
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,659
I think most of the time in epidemiology, like the risk ratios are important and we want to measure those correctly.

437
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:30,649
But more often than not we're like, is there a significant relationship or not?

438
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:36,469
And you know, like whether it's like a risk ratio of 1.5 or 1.7, you know, maybe that's not super,

439
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:41,089
super huge because like in this area, the unmeasured confounding could change again.

440
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:47,329
You know, maybe in our study we found our risk ratio of 1.7.

441
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:59,479
But if we actually include an unmeasured confounder which has the strength of association here, it would change to like a 1.5 or 1.4.

442
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:10,499
Here is where the risk free fluid seems to like a 1.1 or a one or maybe even go beyond it in like just not be significant anymore.

443
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:17,309
Does that make sense? Okay. So.

444
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:31,379
I have, uh. Paul everywhere for you, just for us to think through this a bit more.

445
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:38,639
To go to this, it should be like a new survey for you to do. And I'll give you a couple of minutes to.

446
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:55,259
Okay. Good. There are diversities of responses that we can track this.

447
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:01,469
Okay, so you conducted a study.

448
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:12,538
You found the existence of a new variable U1 and you are able to calculate the RR for the measure of disease,

449
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:18,839
relationship and exposure to a measured relationship. You found that to be 5.2 and 3.2, respectively.

450
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:26,879
And what we're trying to look at here is, are are those values going to explain away what we previously found?

451
00:56:30,229 --> 00:56:41,439
Um, so I mean, we can just look at this graph if the risk ratio for you D is like 5.2 that's around here and for you would be around here.

452
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:48,679
So it's like this number right here and everything to this part is not going to substantially impact what we found.

453
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:55,159
So I would say there's a low likelihood that confounding could have explains the original association we.

454
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:05,829
Okay. So we now found a new another new variable for the unmeasured disease relationship.

455
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:11,079
It's 8.2 and four exposure on measured at 7.4.

456
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:16,389
I'd probably put that around here. So it's within the bounds of this curve.

457
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:22,799
So we would say that there is a high likelihood that confounding could have explained the original association.

458
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:39,429
Finally, we have an example and I'm sorry there was an advertisement like this one, but it is you these 15.2.

459
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:46,319
So that's like here. And if it's 6.1.

460
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:53,169
Yeah. I mean, that one is like a bit hard to to say.

461
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,319
I don't know exactly what is going on with that, but I think it might have been in this area.

462
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,819
So certainly for any test or whatever, I would make it like very apparent that this is, um,

463
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:06,759
but I think the big thing to think about is that like in this part of the church or is it in this part of the church?

464
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:14,809
And let's go back to where I was saying before, you know what? If we have like in a protected effect that we're looking at, um.

465
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:35,099
So we could have our. It's great, you know, but that was great here for you.

466
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:40,139
So here is where we're looking at like detrimental effects.

467
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:49,639
And here we are looking at protective effects.

468
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:58,769
And we'll get to that in a moment. But, um, so maybe I'll have you try to calculate this on your own money.

469
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:12,379
So if the risk ratio is 1.8, let's go back to this a risk ratio of 1.8.

470
00:59:12,399 --> 00:59:46,589
How would you evaluate? Does anyone want to try to throw out an answer?

471
00:59:56,619 --> 00:59:59,829
When I did this earlier, I got three.

472
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:07,869
Did other people do that? Okay. I was like to double check because I'm not infallible.

473
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:14,709
But that's what I go for. Risk ratio 1.8 and trying to get an E value of three.

474
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:22,569
So if we go back to this, you see that the risk ratio was 1.8.

475
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:29,199
We have like a e value of three 1 to 3, one, two, three.

476
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,859
So like our E values rate here. And then we would have like.

477
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:44,839
So this is what our curve would look like.

478
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:47,839
And you don't need to be able to calculate the curve.

479
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,489
I'm sure there is like a formula for figuring out what that is and we don't need to do that.

480
01:00:53,869 --> 01:01:02,429
The inverse of. You know, the inverse of their risk ratio would be.

481
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,119
Bang, bang, bang would be 0.56.

482
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:27,799
So if you were to log transform it. It would have to be like down here.

483
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,389
But again, these things just like flip back and forth.

484
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:42,529
So I think for the sake of ease and to make it so that we don't need to like log from everything,

485
01:01:42,919 --> 01:01:47,779
we just keep everything on one axis and try to make it so that it looks like there's a detrimental effect.

486
01:01:50,579 --> 01:02:01,618
So, you know, there's a lot going on here with different things that we are calculating and with what we are having to do for the party.

487
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:02,669
The bias analysis.

488
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:09,808
I get it for you know, for many of you, if you're not going into more of like a methods heavy career, that may not be the super most important thing.

489
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,869
But I do think this value will be showing up more and more.

490
01:02:13,919 --> 01:02:20,489
So that is something, you know, for you to keep in mind. It has to do with unmeasured confounding and measuring how impactful it could be.

491
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:28,248
So today I am letting you out a bit early because the homework assignment,

492
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:35,329
I don't think it's particularly difficult, but it's like a bit longer than it has been in the past.

493
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:41,649
But we are, you know, rapidly encountering the last parts of this class.

494
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:47,209
There's this homework assignment, which is also the last statistical programing we will have to do for this course.

495
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:53,089
The rest of the homework will just be more reading articles. So I will stay up here in case you have any questions.

496
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,909
But otherwise I hope you have a good rest duty.
