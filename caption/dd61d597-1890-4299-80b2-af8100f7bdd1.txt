1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:20,470
I just want to say you.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,970
Look at me. You know, I.

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,520
Welcome back. Happy New Year to you.

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,920
I hope everybody had a great holiday break. I personally thought it went a little too fast.

5
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,250
But, you know, I think you say that every year.

6
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:55,620
Okay. If you're here. Nutrition assessment, those of you second years last semester who really have the best guys.

7
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,480
Oh, my goodness. All right.

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,590
So we're going to talk a little bit about the course.

9
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,220
And I just want to run around the room real quick after and just have everybody introduce themselves.

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,390
We have a mix of second years, the largely second years, but there's also some first year PFC as well as my students in here.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:30,570
So we'll just do a quick round of introductions and then we have to start right off with dietary assessment.

12
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,160
That's the first third ish of the course and there's a lot of content.

13
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,020
So we're going to actually cover a couple methods today.

14
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:51,450
So that's the game plan. And so for this course, we have a GSI.

15
00:01:51,570 --> 00:02:03,750
Jennifer, hello. She's one of our stellar students, so she's going to be our GSI and then Phil Hartley.

16
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,950
Many of you guys had him as a greater or a GSI actually in vitamins and minerals last year.

17
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:19,170
So Phil's also going to be a greater for this course. So we have lots of help.

18
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:31,170
Yes, that's about all I have to say here. Just to point out that this course is broken up into roughly thirds.

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,080
We're going to be covering dietary assessment probably a little bit longer than a third.

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,800
Then we'll cover biochemical or laboratory assessment, primarily from the standpoint of micronutrients.

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,160
I will cover protein, but it's micronutrients.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,520
And then the last. Section of the course, which is the smallest is body count.

23
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,960
Okay. So that's how the course is going to unfold.

24
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,010
This is a course that covers them as methods.

25
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,300
These are all tools that you guys will have in your toolbox.

26
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,030
You may choose not to use some of the methods, but I cover them.

27
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:23,070
Okay. So and for some of the courses, some of the methods you're going to be learning about validity,

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,709
I hope when you leave this course in addition to your toolbox, something that you'll always think about.

29
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,310
If somebody asks you about a particular assessment method, your first thought is, Oh, for what they want to do.

30
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,610
Is that valid? Right.

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:51,280
There's been examples of, you know, assessment or using particular tools or methods that afterwards when the data looked a little wonky.

32
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,900
They had to ask themselves, was it because it was actually not a valid approach given the population and the purpose?

33
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,230
So validity is a really important concept.

34
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,790
And then there are some analytical approaches that you'll be learning about the various assessment methods.

35
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,510
I'm not going to go through all the competencies. Take a look at them when you have a chance.

36
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:29,190
But I did want to just highlight that in addition to assessment approaches, you'll some of you are interested in it from a clinical standpoint.

37
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:39,450
Some of you may be interested from a research standpoint because we have a number of competencies for both the AMS that include research.

38
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,280
Everybody's learning this is not a research methods class, however.

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:56,070
So it's going to be fairly basic. But you'll learn about, you know, different assessment approaches used in different research scenarios.

40
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:11,430
Okay. I think that's all I wanted to say about that. In terms of how you'll be evaluated, there are two exams, mid-term and final.

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,890
You'll note they're both take home. I.

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,720
And they.

43
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:33,060
Well, especially the midterm, it will have anything from a range of multiple choice questions to analytical problems to scenarios or case studies.

44
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,790
Okay. Likewise for the final.

45
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:48,990
There is an assessment project which is basically a mini review of two assessment methods that you have a particular interest in.

46
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,759
The caveat is the first one has to be one of the major dietary assessment methods.

47
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:01,580
Recall the record frequency questionnaire, diet history, and then the second assessment method is your choice.

48
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,520
It's going to be a mini review that is actually framed in a project, and I'll talk more about it.

49
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,950
This project fulfills the Iley for those of you who are students.

50
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:24,200
And so at the end of the semester you will upload your assessment project to the NSS workspace or NSS workspace.

51
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,860
Okay. And then there's homework.

52
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,570
Just to reinforce the first homework is something that you will do.

53
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,850
It's a little bit more involved.

54
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,459
The other homework is you'll learn an analytic method in the class and then you'll get to work on it again in a homework setting.

55
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,900
Bring it to class. We'll go through it and so forth.

56
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,250
So they're pretty straightforward. Any questions about the evaluation?

57
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,140
Pretty straightforward.

58
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:14,220
One thing I want to note is that I understand sometimes the situations that can come up where you may not be able to make a deadline,

59
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,310
illness and so forth, other extensions may come up as well.

60
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,860
That being said, I want you to give me five days notice unless you're ill or there's a family emergency.

61
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Especially those of you who are second year students.

62
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:41,520
You need to start having the frame of mind that you can't just reach out to the faculty member and say, 24 hours, oh, I can't do it.

63
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,400
And, you know, we are we try to be compassionate and give you that extension.

64
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,540
But in the workforce, I mean, we've had alums.

65
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,800
Sure. Back then, you know, supervisors want a lot more notice than 48.

66
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:08,440
Hours, even three or four days. So this is just to get you in the mindset of planning ahead.

67
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,370
That being said, the due dates for the assignments in this class.

68
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,430
Generally speaking, students don't have any issue getting them done because they're highly padded.

69
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:28,810
So. But again, if something does come up, please be sure to reach out to me well before the due date so that we can make an adjustment.

70
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,540
And always happy to work with everybody. Also, if you're ill, please don't come to class.

71
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,909
We're still in that. We'll take care of one another after being around.

72
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,950
Everyone out there at the holidays will probably have some issues in the next week or two,

73
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:57,160
but I always record the classes in Panopto, so just let me know if you can't make it because you're not feeling well.

74
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,560
I handed out the course calendar. Did everybody get a copy?

75
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,440
This is on the syllabus, which is on canvas. But I just wanted to walk through it.

76
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,510
So again, it's broken down into roughly a third, a third and less than a third.

77
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:25,960
You can't see it down here, but on your handout, it's the body composition, the due date, or when an assignment is assigned, is posted.

78
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,100
For example, your first one is on the 12th. Reflection homework is assigned.

79
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:44,170
Has the due date. The midterms are post the date in which it's posted, meaning I just posted on canvas and when it's due.

80
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:53,050
So all your due dates and assigned assignments that are assigned are all on the calendar.

81
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,880
These due dates, with the exception of midterms, are not on the canvas.

82
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,200
You know, that landing page at the home page there is the course.

83
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,370
Classes or the calendar of classes. But these due dates are not on that.

84
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,840
So make sure you refer to the syllabus for due dates and I'll be sharing it,

85
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,160
you know, in class, letting you know, giving you a heads up on due dates and stuff.

86
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:32,030
I just wanted to point out that on Tuesday, this coming Tuesday, those of you that are dietetic students are excused from class.

87
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,820
You should be attending the speech of dietetic conference over at Palmer.

88
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,850
So if you haven't registered, please register.

89
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:48,740
Class will be recorded. I still will be holding class, but dietetic students are excused from Tuesday's class.

90
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Okay, so just make sure you watch the Panopto recording.

91
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,300
And actually, I want to emphasize, make sure you watch the Panopto recording because we're going to be going over 24 recalls and food records.

92
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:06,360
Sarah Ball and Jessica are going to be coming in on that Thursday to go over to our recalls.

93
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,340
Jessica is going to be talking beyond that and from a clinical standpoint.

94
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:18,710
So those of you who aren't here on Tuesday, please try to get through the Panopto recording for Thursday just because.

95
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,230
Sarah And just this content will build off of that.

96
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,460
Kim And I'm still going through my emails from break. Did we get an email about how to register for that?

97
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,550
I just haven't. She sent it out to everybody. So who should?

98
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,070
So just Sarah did. Yeah. So just do a quick search of Sarah.

99
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,660
And you should. I you should find the link.

100
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,890
And I don't think there's anything else that I need to.

101
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,390
Does anybody have any questions about the course calendar? Okay.

102
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,990
Okay. I guess I'm done. We just checked. Make sure that's actually true.

103
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,200
Mm hmm. It is.

104
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,320
All right. Any questions about what I covered regarding class?

105
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:34,060
For those who have not had a class with me before, I always post a PDF of the slides and a slide handout by the afternoon before.

106
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,740
Sometimes if it's really busy, it might be the evening, but I will get them posted before class.

107
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,730
Something else I was going to say. Yeah. So by email, Sarah, if I didn't get this email, I think a couple of us didn't get it.

108
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Yeah. No. Yes, definitely.

109
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,710
Email her. Okay. Yeah. So she can. It's interesting that you guys didn't get it.

110
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,830
Anybody? None of you got to let her know that.

111
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,250
Your Facebook group. Facebook. Yeah, well, it should have gone through.

112
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,220
No, it should have gone through on email. Yeah.

113
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,830
Yeah. Thank you for looking at last year.

114
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,060
Yeah. Yeah. Because there's a link that you need to use for registering for the course, so.

115
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:37,670
Okay. Let's just go around the room fairly quickly because class is big and introduce this name your program.

116
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,440
Second year. First year. Just that would help me to begin.

117
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:50,930
Okay. I am a second year and you know, I'm out of every year and then I'm.

118
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,220
Are you I'm a second year MPH student, second year mph and out of school.

119
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,290
Switch on second year and page dietetics.

120
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:11,960
My name is Hannah in Pacific. This is my first year here.

121
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:23,089
I'm Sarah in the seventh year and then exotics and was second year MP in her primary and secondary and M.S. and so that is this is not good.

122
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,580
We don't have enough, you see here.

123
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,310
But killing me. Oh, yes. I seem to come here only now.

124
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,400
But I'm just saying I'm sorry.

125
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,410
I'm just realizing that I'm sorry.

126
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:50,780
I'm a first year student from Jordan. I'm a second year, so I'm a second MP instead.

127
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:59,050
I'm to me, I'm a second year dietetics dealer, second year, and I took my second year.

128
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,940
So this second year I'm doing my first year.

129
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:32,060
So it turns out the incident here seven years ago and I'm only the second year and you can use that to engage in 50 seconds, you're engaged.

130
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:51,230
And I mean, this is only one year because he was a candidate in champions.

131
00:15:51,780 --> 00:16:06,890
And second and third, the second year, second year student called me about the trust.

132
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,790
Her name. Welcome to the second year.

133
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,710
Great. Okay. Um.

134
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay. So we're starting the dietary assessment component is going to be talking about food availability,

135
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,319
which is a review that those of you had community nutrition.

136
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,430
And so bear with me, but we're thinking we're going to be just thinking about it in different contexts.

137
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,760
We're thinking about it from an assessment standpoint and then household and expenditure surveys,

138
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,430
which I'm just going to touch upon briefly for those of you who may be working internationally.

139
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,890
So in terms of learning objectives,

140
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:12,080
it's important to understand these indirect methods and actually why they're considered indirect assessment of food consumption,

141
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:20,959
how are they used to assess food consumption as well as other applications and discuss the significance of a lasting loss,

142
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:27,500
adjusted food availability data, and then just understand the strengths and limitations of these two approaches,

143
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,610
food availability and household surveys.

144
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,340
And this is also just a reminder assessment.

145
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,260
We think about it in terms of assessing an individual, but also populations.

146
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,020
And so that's another important component of this class,

147
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:54,140
is that you will be learning about these methods on the individual level as well as population level when applicable.

148
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:03,229
So at the national level, these assessment methods can be an important part of our nutrition monitoring,

149
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:11,390
which plays a key role in research as well as policymaking both at the national and local level.

150
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,020
So this is a figure from the FAA, the FAA or the Food and Agriculture Organization,

151
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,170
and it breaks up the dietary assessment methods into direct and indirect.

152
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:38,540
Over here we have direct methods, so we have dietary recalls, food frequency questionnaires, dietary history, all considered retrospective approaches.

153
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:54,080
And they're direct because. They assess the individual right there, ask, you know, they assess what the person is consuming in their diet.

154
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:03,050
We also have technology based where we can take snapshots of food and so forth.

155
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,800
And then we have over here the perspective approaches, which is basically food records.

156
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,790
Or there's a duplicate diet model which we'll talk about.

157
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:20,580
It's not used as much, but that is the perspective.

158
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:29,160
So these are direct assessment methods and they're direct because they directly assess intake at the individual level.

159
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,410
Over here in the left, we have indirect.

160
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:47,570
National and household level. So we have the food availability, our food supply, food balance sheets as well as household surveys.

161
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,930
These are indirect because they don't actually assess individual food consumption.

162
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,000
They step back a bit and look at it with a wider lens.

163
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:09,050
Okay. You don't see this kind of terminology much in the US literature on dietary assessment, indirect versus direct.

164
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:18,210
But I like it because it reminds it's it was a reminder for me to think about food availability as an indirect approach to dietary assessment.

165
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,320
So I like this for us to think about.

166
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:31,170
But again, I just want you to be aware you're not going to see the terminology direct and indirect in some of your in some of your readings,

167
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:37,890
because it's just not used that much. But again, it's it's a useful way to remind us that these two approaches,

168
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,280
balance sheets and household surveys are important dietary assessment methods.

169
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,959
So I just want to go through the food availability. Again, I know this is review for a number of you,

170
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,370
but we can be thinking about it from a sort of broad lens of dietary assessment at the national level.

171
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,880
So this is a data series in the United States that tracks the food that's available for consumption.

172
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,370
Tracks over 200 food commodities. Food commodities are just simply an agricultural product.

173
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:23,020
Right. That can be that many of them which are used in food production or food manufacturing and the data series that is.

174
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:33,930
Maintain supported in the United States is food availability and loss adjusted food availability.

175
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:44,879
There was also nutrient availability with that ended. So we just have the two data series and I just want to point out that again,

176
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,290
food availability is just a proxy measure of food consumption at the individual level.

177
00:21:52,770 --> 00:22:02,970
So again, indirect or proxy. And I also want to highlight this slide is simply to, you know, point out the USDA economic research service,

178
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,810
IRS that oversees managers, provides the statistics and so forth.

179
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:20,490
The food availability data is also generated by other countries, by most countries and other countries that may be called food supply.

180
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,900
It may be called food disappearance of means all the same.

181
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,200
And that the FAO monitors worldwide food availability.

182
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:39,720
And I have a slide that has the website where you can go in and actually you can review for a specific country.

183
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,430
You can review the methodology in the data, the food supply data.

184
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:57,700
So food availability. So in the United States, we typically call it food availability, but it can be called food supply of food disappearance as well.

185
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,630
But it's basically derived from a basic. Balance sheet.

186
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Okay, so.

187
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,070
The available commodity supply I think is pretty intuitive.

188
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,510
It's the beginning store, so it's all the spending stock from the previous year.

189
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,690
What was that? What was leftover becomes a beginning start for the next year.

190
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:35,890
So you can think of that as like any leftover grain and other agricultural products, anything that was produced in that year, plus imports.

191
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,010
Gives us the available commodity supply,

192
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:51,110
but it becomes a balance sheet because we have to subtract out any of the commodities that are not used for food.

193
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,070
So for animal feed or for fuel.

194
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,330
So corn is used to generate ethanol in this country.

195
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:08,370
So you have to subtract out any kind of farm inputs and anything that's used for animal feed and so forth,

196
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,510
any of the commodities that are exported from the country.

197
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:27,360
And so forth. So that is the estimates that we have to subtract out and then we end up with the total food supply for a given year.

198
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,190
That's the food that's available in the country for the population.

199
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:40,170
And in fact, they usually they always take it one step further and actually divide this estimate,

200
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:50,130
which is often in pounds by per capita, meaning it's divided by the actual population count in the country.

201
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,440
So it's called per capita.

202
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:10,660
And that just gives individuals who are monitoring these estimates an idea of or an estimate of how much food is available per person in the country.

203
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:17,080
You had a question and you said the ending stock of one year is the beginning stock of the next.

204
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:31,840
Basically the ending stock is food that did not disappear into the retail system and that includes the food manufacturers.

205
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,970
Right. So anything that's leftover becomes the beginning stock and.

206
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:47,170
So you can see why this can be useful and why most countries have food supply data because it

207
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:54,910
does provide a rough proxy estimate of the food that's available in a country to its population.

208
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:05,580
So. And I just wanted to highlight that those of you interested in food availability,

209
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,640
there's a really useful report, workshop report put out by the National Academy.

210
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,100
It was published in 2015. It's really useful for explaining,

211
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:26,550
getting more into the nuts and bolts about at least some aspects of the food availability system in the United States.

212
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:36,360
And I like this point because. This was one of the researchers involved in the report, the term disappearance.

213
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,250
So, again, food availability, food supply, food disappearance, they all mean the same.

214
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,870
The term disappearance describes what the availability data really are.

215
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,690
The data are the food commodities that disappear into the retail system.

216
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,640
And that one for me has always helped wrapping my head around where is it going?

217
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:07,320
But just remember that when we say retail, we also mean commodities that are being utilized by food manufacturers.

218
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,270
Right. So it's not just the food showing up at the grocery store.

219
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,640
Food manufacturers, somebody have their hand in.

220
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:32,270
What's nice about the food availability data is that we've been monitoring this since the early 1900s.

221
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,370
So actually the data didn't start until about 1941, I think,

222
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:48,950
but they had enough information that they were able to model an estimate and estimate what the food availability data was beginning in 1909.

223
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:56,090
So for some commodities, we have data all the way back to 1909, and so it's very useful to see trends.

224
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:03,830
So this is an interesting one, looking at pork, beef and chicken over time.

225
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:21,620
Food availability data has been useful with like sodium, so they might look at sodium intake based on NHANES and then they might look at the.

226
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Food availability of salt or sodium and see if it's showing a consistent pattern with what they might be seeing in trends with NHANES data.

227
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,650
So it may be used in addition to more direct methods.

228
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:51,030
For those of you interested in the data sources, this is from the workshop report for the Academies Workshop Report.

229
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,980
This has the actual data sources.

230
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:04,649
For those of you interested. So there is a National Agriculture Statistics Service Census data, right.

231
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:13,650
Because we generate per capita that estimates there's I would have to look at that one now.

232
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,300
It's energy.

233
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:30,560
I got back and I remember thinking at the time, why would energy be an important data source so anybody have it and want to take a guess as to what?

234
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:39,960
Yeah, it's Energy Information Administration for the US government and it's the statistics and analysis division.

235
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:53,570
So why would Energy be? Data source for food availability, like how much it takes to produce all the food, I guess, like, energetically.

236
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,060
So maybe that may maybe part of it. Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:07,850
There's one other key issue and it might be I, I honestly haven't actually delved into,

238
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,360
but there's one other story in terms of how much we need compared to how much is produced.

239
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,860
Energy. Yeah, but how does that relate to the food commodities?

240
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,970
Guys are on the right track. Huh? What? Ethanol.

241
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,030
Ethanol? Exactly. Yeah. Yep.

242
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,650
So the amount of corn that is removed from the food supply and converted to ethanol,

243
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:41,880
because in the United States, corn is one of the primary inputs for ethanol.

244
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:49,530
Yeah, but the other suggestions that you guys brought up may also apply.

245
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,450
So this slide is nothing more than for those of you who want to know.

246
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,919
Want to look? I've had students in the past want to dig into the literature a little bit deeper.

247
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:11,510
And so that's all this is about. The next data series I want to talk about is lost suggested ideally.

248
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,840
All our food availability data should have loss adjusted estimates.

249
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:31,950
Why is it so critical that loss adjustment data is available for the commodities in terms of estimates of the food supply?

250
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,290
They make up for a big part of the food production created during transportation or in production.

251
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,980
So it's closer to what is actually consumed.

252
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:53,820
Yes. So if you don't have loss adjusted data, you actually overestimate what's available to the population.

253
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,190
That's why it's so critical. So this is an example, I believe, of apples.

254
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,520
So. There is loss. We think about apple orchards.

255
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,600
There's going to be loss of apples just going from the farm to retail.

256
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,620
We know there's a loss of apples in the retail system.

257
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:26,610
We go to a grocery store, we see staff pulling spoiled or apples that they're choosing not to sell.

258
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,300
So there's loss of the retail to consumer. Then there's the loss by the consumer.

259
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:39,690
So if we think about some of our plant based foods, most people don't eat the core of an apple.

260
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,620
Most people don't eat a banana peel or the peel of an avocado.

261
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,940
So there's that non edible or the avocado pear.

262
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,620
You know, it's just all that non edible components.

263
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,840
In addition to there's also going to be spoilage. There's natural gas and so forth.

264
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:09,180
So you can see how if if loss adjusted estimates are not available for commodities, you are overestimating what's available to the consumer.

265
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:20,790
Okay. So is this standardized like per item or does it take or does it is it does it fluctuate based on current events,

266
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,210
like, for instance, like with the avian flu? Like that's an excellent report.

267
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,520
Much better than typical loss. Consumption or during holidays when.

268
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:38,050
So is it just standardized? And they like, say, like about 25% of whatever around the chapels we have it standardized.

269
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,260
Okay. So because it's actually really expensive to do all of the estimates from here to here to here.

270
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,250
Yeah. Because it requires studies. Right. So it's standardized.

271
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,819
That being said, they recognize that there's a report out in 2019.

272
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,879
I'll actually post it on canvas.

273
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:07,880
For those of you interested, the Academy had recommendations to how to improve the lost adjusted data.

274
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,810
Basically the methods that are being used and there are issues, then they acknowledge it.

275
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,770
So I will post the report on if you're interested,

276
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:33,500
but and not all of our commodities have lost adjusted data simply because it is an expensive endeavor to estimate at each level.

277
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:42,110
Yeah. So then how would they adjust for something such as like during COVID and there was workers at the bottom to the field,

278
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,620
so the amount of loss in the fields was much greater.

279
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,280
And then like currently currently with the avian flu. Yeah, that's a great question because those are.

280
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,950
Not in the home, but they have a big impact.

281
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, I don't know. You'd have to look and see if the Economic Research Service made some adjustments.

282
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,130
Yeah, absolutely. Well, those images of zucchini and summer squash that were just piled out in the fields.

283
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:23,499
Yeah. Yeah. This is an example of a figure that just shows the most commonly consumed fruits in the United States.

284
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:30,460
So this is pounds per person, per capita. But you'll note that it was based on lost adjusted data.

285
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:41,340
Okay. So if you see tables or figures, that is food availability data, Italy, the say food availability or loss adjusted.

286
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:48,250
And so for some of our commodities, we don't have loss adjusted estimates.

287
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah. So theoretically for a food that is not as prone to spoilage, you would expect less.

288
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:05,290
You would expect less loss, right? Mm hmm. So higher real consumption you would compare to, let's say.

289
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,000
I see, because I see strawberries and I see oranges and oranges can last longer.

290
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,090
Correct. So you would have more lost their job in terms of the presumed purchase amount.

291
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:24,350
It may look a little bit different. I think.

292
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:35,890
Well, so this is LB Yeah. So the point here is just that all of this data we know was adjusted were loss estimates.

293
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,810
So if this had not had loss estimates, strawberries might have been quite a bit higher.

294
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:50,260
So any of the produce that, you know, pineapples, you know, you've got that big green top and then so,

295
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,530
you know, pineapple would be higher if it wasn't adjusted.

296
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,440
Yeah. Yeah. Some of it's really obvious. Like watermelon.

297
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,180
Watermelon is a good example. It's with the skin and so forth.

298
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:08,090
So, yes, those would all be much higher if. It had not been long suggested.

299
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:17,780
The other important point for last adjustment is if they look at all food, all commodities,

300
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:28,520
because they're interested in is there enough calories in the current food supply for or per capita for the population?

301
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,670
And here is our food availability data.

302
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:43,040
This is over time, but at any given point, you can see what the estimated calories would be based on the food supply per person.

303
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,770
But you can see it overestimates because it's not loss adjusted data.

304
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,679
So this is actually really critical,

305
00:37:51,680 --> 00:38:05,200
especially for countries that rely on this data as proxy estimates of adequacy for their for the population loss adjusted data is expensive,

306
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:13,340
so some countries don't have loss adjusted. But it's important to be aware that without last adjusted, it's overestimated.

307
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:27,700
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know, in some countries where they have to rely on their food supply data more heavily that there may be.

308
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,940
Approaches to adjust weather even without their loss suggested.

309
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,080
I'm I don't know but I'm just that's a possibility.

310
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,329
Yeah this was a reading I don't know if any of you had a chance to read.

311
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,979
If you haven't, please do.

312
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:56,300
Because I think this is a great article and I love this because it's a great example of how lost adjusted data can be used to estimate food waste.

313
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:08,630
Um, so this was a paper that looked at the relationship food waste, quality and environmental sustainability and.

314
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,090
There was a lot. It was a long paper. Did anybody read it?

315
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,680
Kitty, did you have any thoughts about the paper?

316
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,140
Um, I guess I was interested in the way that they,

317
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:35,280
in what you've explained thus far is kind of like explained because there was limited information on how they calculated the the loss from birds.

318
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:44,280
I was a little confused on that, but I think that was clarified in the piece, and I just don't like how they calculated their ways.

319
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:52,560
I thought it was interesting, counterintuitive to the relationship between healthy, healthy diets and food waste.

320
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,490
But yeah, I was really interested.

321
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:03,720
I've actually spoken with both shooters, Blackstone, so I just so I know a little bit more about her other research.

322
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah, I think I just think that the high quality diet is related to high food waste, but it's the other way around.

323
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:25,140
So that's one of the important results of this, is that the higher the quality of the diet, the more waste.

324
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,070
But if you think about what goes into a higher quality diet, we're usually talking more fruits and vegetables.

325
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,389
I was wondering also that has been adjusted for income, too,

326
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:43,980
because a lot of times people who eat a healthier diet typically are more like it's associated with greater wealth,

327
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,290
and if they have greater help, then they might not feel as like obligated to save everything.

328
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,719
Yeah. So that's why I thought that, you know, the confounding factors.

329
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,070
And so yeah, it matters like what kind of we're used to making too,

330
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,210
because think you're taking those strawberries and composting them at something different then,

331
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,040
you know, having a bunch of plastic wrap like they didn't consider all those things.

332
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,980
Right. Because one of the concerns with food waste has to do with and this is something that

333
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,790
I was just learning the sort of agricultural inputs because I'm not as familiar some.

334
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:29,970
So the agricultural inputs that they talked about was, well, first the crop plan, then fertilizer, pesticides and then irrigation water.

335
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:37,200
So if you compost, some of that input is not lost, although you transfer.

336
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,059
But but if you don't compost, right, it's lost, right?

337
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,580
If there's food waste, then all of that agricultural input is wasted,

338
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,040
which I hadn't thought about, which is why I like this paper, because it kind of gets into that.

339
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,770
But yes, the whole point about how your diet quality results in more waste,

340
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:07,139
it also makes me think about we have to rethink the edible portions versus what we perceive

341
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,730
as inedible that that maybe there's more of a vegetable that we could consume that.

342
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:22,410
And I think it's very important to me to increase the I know to talk to like how to keep the fruits and vegetables longer.

343
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,100
Yes. Yeah. So it would have been nice to know.

344
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,120
And it's harder because they had no way of knowing.

345
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:37,080
They had they calculated waste basically on the amount that was actually consumed from an enhanced dietary recall.

346
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,300
Right. They didn't actually they weren't they didn't talk to the participants.

347
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,780
But it would be interesting to know how much of the waste was just because the food is

348
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,129
spoiled and they didn't consume it versus just the inevitable portion that wasn't consumed.

349
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:59,010
I suspect probably waste. Spoilage was probably a further composting.

350
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,000
They don't count that as food waste that people do. Complicit.

351
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:11,129
I don't know. I this outside of my realm of any or anybody who's in do you get to it's counted as food as

352
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:20,730
food waste is because it's not consumed so it just goes into it's called mechanics recycling.

353
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:27,600
So then like there is a way to measure what performance or and of I think like if you are but that's a separate metric.

354
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,460
So if you were looking at like what if you want to, if your goal was to,

355
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,269
if your objective was to observe how much was actually being consumed, that would not be.

356
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,320
But if your objective was to observe, like how much organic waste is going into the land.

357
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:49,490
Yeah. So it's a different question, right? Actually, because King I came from islands, countries like Taiwan and Japan.

358
00:43:49,890 --> 00:44:01,200
It's been decades that our government was sent out every day, trucks to collect food waste so it can bring back every day.

359
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,260
The restaurant or us will have a box.

360
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,500
We only just put it in there. Yeah, yeah.

361
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:19,920
Totally sterilize that and then expose. Feeding two bigs is a direct contribution, but the waste is really in the process and put back to the soil.

362
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:34,200
So for this study, they use loss adjusted data to estimate the actual inedible component.

363
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:45,600
So it was a proportion of every food. What they did was they took the food from in Heinz and linked it to come on it for basically food, commodities.

364
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,729
And then based on the food commodity,

365
00:44:47,730 --> 00:45:02,310
they then estimated what the loss adjusted estimate would be and then the actual amount that was wasted came from the amount that was consumed.

366
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,610
Reported on the recall. Okay.

367
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:16,730
So the last suggested was sort of an early calculation, but then later they once they got an edible amount,

368
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,280
they then subtracted the amount that was actually consumed.

369
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,950
So they actually got the amount that was wasted by the consumer.

370
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,830
That makes sense. There's a supplement, one that shows actually, I have it.

371
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:47,629
I'm just going to. Sorry. Hang in there. So the purchase weight of the food minus the loss adjusted estimate for that given commodity.

372
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,490
So again, all foods that were reported on in Heinz were linked to some kind of food commodity.

373
00:45:52,910 --> 00:46:00,050
So whatever the loss adjusted estimate is for that commodity resulted in the edible weight of that food.

374
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,170
And then here we have the actual amount that was consumed recorded on in Heinz.

375
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,810
And so then you can figure out what proportion of the food was wasted.

376
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,670
Okay. So that's where the loss adjusted came in is here.

377
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:27,050
So I just thought that was. Clever use of loss adjusted in research.

378
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:44,630
So that's okay. Applications of food availability used to monitor consumption again as a proxy of food intake per capita.

379
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,820
It is used to show trends which can be really helpful to look at research,

380
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:58,280
use a lot of countries for developing policy, and what's not here is forecasting.

381
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:09,050
I mean, food availability data is used heavily for forecasting, forecasting how much commodity is needed maybe next year, several years in advance.

382
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:21,680
So forecasting is one of the key uses of food availability and then just comparing from different countries and so forth.

383
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,219
But strengths and limitations, I'm going to let you guys just kind of wander through.

384
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:36,920
I think it's all pretty intuitive. Just be comfortable with understanding the strengths and limitations of food availability.

385
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:48,050
Right. And probably one of the key limitations when we're thinking of dietary assessment is that it is an indirect proxy of food consumption.

386
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:55,930
At the individual level. Okay. Yeah.

387
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:05,240
What about those ultra processed foods and only how you said the manufacturers, they take the real food and then make product.

388
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:11,360
So that's not monitored by food availability because you have to remember,

389
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:20,340
food availability is the primary commodity agricultural products that then go into the food systems,

390
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:28,280
like the retail system purchased by food manufacturers who then may make and ultra processed food.

391
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:33,979
Okay. So that is one of the limitations of I don't know if it's on this one,

392
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:41,330
but that is one of the limitations is it doesn't provide like essence and doesn't really say,

393
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:47,930
but it doesn't provide specific information about specific foods like processed foods.

394
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:56,960
Oh, yeah. It only addresses it only provides estimates for the actual agricultural product like corn.

395
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,520
Wheat, rice, barley. I see those days only.

396
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:09,460
Yeah. The top ten foods that to the core and right beat with sugar.

397
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,000
But that is one of the gaps is that and they acknowledge it and one of the

398
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,490
reports is that it doesn't cover specific foods that have been manufactured.

399
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:25,610
Yeah. Okay. And then I just wanted to do a quick shout out for.

400
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:39,050
In other countries, food availability data is used sometimes to estimate nutrient or nutrient adequacy in the food supply,

401
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:53,600
I guess is the best way to say. So there's just some examples who and that actually I should point out that we had a whole

402
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:00,830
group in countries that don't have the infrastructure and the financial resources to.

403
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:12,440
We have a national surveillance system like NHANES, where we actually conduct 24 hour recalls on individuals in a nationally representative sample.

404
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,140
This data, food supply data, is critical in addition to household surveys.

405
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:25,970
So that's why you will see papers that are really trying to basically wring whatever they can out of that information.

406
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:36,500
We have way of saying it, but that's they're trying to get what they can out of the data, estimating everything from nutrients to.

407
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,700
Food patterns and so forth. This is the website for the FCO.

408
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,460
And again, if any of you are interested in food supply data,

409
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:56,200
you just type the country and you can access the methodology and its food supply estimates and so forth.

410
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,589
Okay. How's everybody doing? So we just motor through household survey.

411
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:06,460
So do you need a five minute break? You just get up and stretch.

412
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:15,910
Yes. Get up, stretch. Yeah, I have three legs.

413
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,500
That's good. Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:31,000
I know. I was just trying to tell you that.

415
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,450
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:57,790
That was never I guess I'd never seen in the case of how much you figure out how to troubleshoot while you're in Lebanon.

417
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:04,270
They they shoot at the top of the range for the first time.

418
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,450
I mean, this is very normal.

419
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,395
But then the next day, you're trying to disagree with that concept.

420
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:29,416
I think that I was I was disappointed because I was worried about what it was.

421
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:32,456
But they were beautiful. But I know.

422
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:37,347
I don't know. Yeah.

423
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:48,167
What were you doing with them straight away?

424
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:53,197
Yeah. I mean, I don't have anything.

425
00:52:56,217 --> 00:53:01,947
We're talking to you for the strategy, right?

426
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,827
It's worth thinking in a few minutes. Let's just clear the head.

427
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:12,927
Yeah. My. My watch yells at me. I don't get out right now.

428
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:25,767
All right. Why don't we go back? Get back to the scene.

429
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:39,597
Okay. So the other indirect method that we're going to cover today is household consumption expenditure surveys or just household surveys?

430
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:44,157
These are widely used in countries.

431
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:56,937
We don't actually have a household consumption expenditure survey in the United States, mostly because we have in Haines, but.

432
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:07,677
Household surveys are conducted globally. And I just wanted to I've just included these are older papers,

433
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:13,946
but they are still relevant, they're still cited, they're very useful for just a review.

434
00:54:13,947 --> 00:54:19,137
And I've got some other on your canvas site as a Fiddler article.

435
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:21,837
That's a really good review of household surveys.

436
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:28,467
So again, for those of you that are going to be working internationally, it's important to be familiar with household surveys.

437
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:35,547
So. Moving from food supply, which is a very broad.

438
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:42,297
Not broad, but indirect way of assessing consumption.

439
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:46,407
Household surveys bring it to the household level.

440
00:54:46,497 --> 00:54:51,477
So it's actually, again, more micro lens relative to the food supply.

441
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:58,857
And they're very useful for assessing poverty, food security, even.

442
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:08,517
They're even used to assess adequate calories and nutrients for countries that just don't have a more direct method.

443
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:21,927
So this is just a brief description or definition of household surveys assesses the total amount of food available for consumption in a household,

444
00:55:22,257 --> 00:55:28,107
generally excluding the food eaten away from home unless it was taken from home.

445
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:38,966
Okay, so these assess or measure the amount of food that's in the household that's available for the household to consume.

446
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:46,527
And there are some caveats to that. So the kit, yeah, these are basically from grocery shopping.

447
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:55,407
It depends on the country, but food available for consumption could be grown by, you know, their own food production.

448
00:55:56,277 --> 00:56:04,347
Food may be used as payment for some things, so they may be getting food called in-kind or as a gift.

449
00:56:04,587 --> 00:56:08,607
So all of the food that's available to the household is documented.

450
00:56:08,637 --> 00:56:15,417
Now, that being said, some household surveys might not look at it at such a micro level.

451
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:29,037
There's a great deal of variability from the survey to survey, but those that are very stringent will assess food that's purchased,

452
00:56:29,247 --> 00:56:37,887
food that's grown, food that was given to them as a gift or in-kind payment for something.

453
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:42,957
Yeah. And then at the house level, the food waste is deducted.

454
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,577
They do not that I know of take into account.

455
00:56:48,237 --> 00:56:51,776
Well, they take into account what was consumed.

456
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:59,387
I don't know if food waste is accounted for or is the algorithm they just apply after the house or in the zero.

457
00:56:59,397 --> 00:57:03,647
There's, there's algorithms in that which is minus one sort of or some of that.

458
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:07,027
There may be research that uses household surveys for food waste.

459
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:11,187
I haven't looked into that. You'd have to look into that and dig into the literature on that one.

460
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:15,687
Okay. So they're typically conducted every 3 to 5 years.

461
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:24,927
Again, it's using a national or a regional representative sample of the population and the information that's

462
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:31,827
generally collected generally because there's huge there's a great deal of heterogeneity among the surveys.

463
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:37,707
They typically will ask about household composition, adults, children.

464
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:46,147
If there's visitors that are at the household for a extended period of time, that may also be taken into account.

465
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,627
They also ask about income, assets, wealth.

466
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:56,087
They may ask about the actual housing. And so forth.

467
00:57:56,927 --> 00:58:01,967
Most household surveys have a food list.

468
00:58:02,597 --> 00:58:07,367
I would say most, if not all, and they typically look more like commodity foods.

469
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:13,217
So it will say rice, flour, barley, beef, fish.

470
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:15,647
It's not specific foods per se.

471
00:58:15,677 --> 00:58:23,707
Now, that's not to say that a household survey might not have, you know, if more detailed foods or processed foods on it.

472
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:32,027
But for the most part, they typically look like quantities. And then they ask how much of the food was purchased?

473
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:35,647
Again, depending on how detailed they are. Was it a difference?

474
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:42,587
Was it grown? And so forth?

475
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:52,217
Professor, do you mean that the raw material level, like tomatoes and all that, not like takeout, correct?

476
00:58:52,427 --> 00:59:02,667
Oh, correct. They can be a recall and most of them are recalls.

477
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:11,037
So they're asking, they're querying what was consumed over the last seven days?

478
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:14,367
What was consumed over the last 14 days?

479
00:59:15,297 --> 00:59:24,747
I have seen household surveys that asked over the last month and year, which I can't even imagine doing that for a year.

480
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:29,577
But most the most common is seven or 14 days.

481
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:34,466
The diaries are really expensive to do,

482
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:40,046
and more and more countries are dropping diaries because oftentimes they're

483
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:46,197
measuring or weighing the food to get really precise or more accurate measurements.

484
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,917
But as you might imagine, it requires field workers and so forth.

485
00:59:49,927 --> 00:59:55,497
So one estimate was 3 to 8 times more expense with a diary versus a recall.

486
00:59:55,587 --> 01:00:03,177
So most countries use the recall approach. That's all I wanted to just highlight.

487
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:08,877
They also have columns for expenditures.

488
01:00:09,657 --> 01:00:15,776
I've also seen household surveys that have the market price, which I'm not exactly sure how that's used.

489
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:25,407
But they, you know, depending on what they are, the information they need, there can be a fair amount of information collected.

490
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:31,047
Yeah. So the difference between recall and diary is recall.

491
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:39,177
You have to sync back, correct? I can't sing back what I yesterday, but 7 to 14 is what diary is like as you go.

492
01:00:39,717 --> 01:00:44,997
So and oftentimes with diary, they are measuring the foods that are in the household weighing them.

493
01:00:45,327 --> 01:00:51,687
How much in pounds do they have in terms of wheat or sorghum or barley?

494
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:54,947
And so the record is very hard. Yep.

495
01:00:55,287 --> 01:00:59,097
I can't recall. It's an estimate. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's an estimate.

496
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:04,917
Yeah. You mentioned commodity foods.

497
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:07,977
I feel like I hear that term used in different ways.

498
01:01:08,337 --> 01:01:16,297
So I guess I just want to get clear on that definition. So you can think of commodities as basic agricultural products.

499
01:01:16,647 --> 01:01:22,636
So the household surveys that I've seen, the lists really reflect more of a commodity.

500
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:27,087
It will say barley. It'll say rice. It doesn't say.

501
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:39,487
Asparagus. Oh, we could have asparagus and it will have vegetables that have beef, but it won't have even vegetable soup.

502
01:01:39,577 --> 01:01:45,097
Oh, I know. That being said, there may be some household surveys that have some.

503
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:55,017
You know, aggregate rescues. But generally what I've seen is the foods are very basic for the most part.

504
01:01:55,467 --> 01:02:01,107
Does that make sense? And so when we think of commodities, think of it as the basic agricultural product.

505
01:02:01,707 --> 01:02:04,827
Okay. So, yeah. Yeah.

506
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:08,127
So fat and oil don't count. Yeah.

507
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:14,577
That's a commodity. Seeds. We had to be parses and squeezed fats.

508
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:18,447
Specific fats like canola, olive. That's a commodity.

509
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:25,287
Yeah. Seeds would be it. Well, it depends on if they break it down into specific.

510
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:33,807
Sunflower seeds. If there's nuts that are used by a community that would be on the you know.

511
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:40,466
And you have to remember that these household surveys are used in low income countries

512
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:48,027
where the foods are going to be often just a basic commodity that they've grown or gather.

513
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:52,767
Right. That is so healthy, Professor. Yes.

514
01:02:53,047 --> 01:03:02,947
Yep. Process. Okay. So health health surveys can be used to identify food patterns, monitor poverty, assessed for food security.

515
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:07,347
They are used a lot to develop policy for fortification.

516
01:03:07,377 --> 01:03:13,377
Mm hmm. And they can identify variations in consumption based on region and seasons.

517
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,436
So if they're conducted at different times of the year,

518
01:03:16,437 --> 01:03:28,467
they can determine if a community during rainy seasons that the food available to households may drop considerably depending on what's available.

519
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:36,057
So there's variations in when they may administer the household survey.

520
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:45,296
There are a lot of strengths and weaknesses. This episode report is on today's canvas.

521
01:03:45,297 --> 01:03:51,387
Reading is under optional. There's this table plus another for strengths and limitations.

522
01:03:51,387 --> 01:03:55,796
So just take some time to just review. I think it's pretty intuitive.

523
01:03:55,797 --> 01:04:02,457
It's an inexpensive source of nutrition data relative to like in Haines.

524
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:11,637
Right? Again, when I talk about in Heinz, I'm referring to assessing people individually.

525
01:04:11,787 --> 01:04:18,087
So relative to that, it's it's inexpensive and is routinely conducted in other countries.

526
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:24,547
It also collects socio economic and demographic data, which is important.

527
01:04:25,147 --> 01:04:30,876
Mm hmm. So, erm. So anyway, the strengths I think are pretty intuitive.

528
01:04:30,877 --> 01:04:39,997
And I think also. Oh, food wasted or given away is not accounted for unless they have a specific column that highlights.

529
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:43,687
Was Food gifted and if so, how much?

530
01:04:46,237 --> 01:04:49,897
So. Yeah.

531
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:54,206
Service microphones. Right. Who is performing these typically?

532
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:58,827
Is it like the governments themselves? Yes. Yeah. Or the ministries of health.

533
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:13,317
But yeah. And there may be organizations I'm putting up, the U.S., USAID is heavily involved in administering.

534
01:05:13,887 --> 01:05:17,817
So there could be nonprofit organizations or agencies that are also involved.

535
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:21,767
And yeah, especially if there's high poverty, famine.

536
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:31,077
Yeah. I think this is a great resource for those of you who, again, may need more information on household surveys.

537
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:34,257
Also this I feel like I think it's.

538
01:05:35,987 --> 01:05:42,167
International. I was going to go and just you know, wing it.

539
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:49,217
No, let's not we get let's. I was going to say it was household a household and I couldn't remember.

540
01:05:49,307 --> 01:05:58,187
So it's International Household Survey Network. So it's an informal network of international agencies that operates solely on the basis of.

541
01:05:58,427 --> 01:06:01,577
Okay, that's not what we needed to know. It's a.

542
01:06:07,117 --> 01:06:15,847
The purpose of this agency is to share information on ongoing and planned survey programs so they have like a house.

543
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:23,257
It's like a clearinghouse of surveys, household surveys, as well as methodology and so forth.

544
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:26,857
So this is a great resource.

545
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:37,297
Again, if any of you are going to be working internationally and need more information about household surveys, that's a good resource.

546
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:50,137
On canvas today under optional readings test index program as well as insight, I think it's called INSIGHT.

547
01:06:51,397 --> 01:06:55,037
It's at the very bottom of it's one of the last resources.

548
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:58,017
Again, for those of you who might be working internationally,

549
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:07,567
those are two awesome resources for household surveys and applying it in a lower middle income country.

550
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:11,137
So I just wanted you to that's one of the important things about this.

551
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:16,477
This class, in addition to learning about methods, is I try to provide you guys resources,

552
01:07:16,477 --> 01:07:20,737
especially since many of you are second year students about to take off.

553
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:28,627
I try to provide resources for you to have that when you're working professionally where you can go to get more information.

554
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:38,257
So your optional readings is heavily resource based to ask any questions about household surveys.

555
01:07:43,117 --> 01:07:51,457
One thing I forgot to mention is household surveys can be used to estimate an intake of individuals.

556
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:57,527
From a proxy standpoint, it's an adult male equivalent approach.

557
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:04,247
And there the Ziegler paper covers that approach.

558
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:13,367
So you can instead of just looking at the amount of food available at the household level, it can be an.

559
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:24,736
Micro-level of individuals in the actual household take into account that caloric intake of children is going to be less than adults.

560
01:08:24,737 --> 01:08:28,337
And so there is equivalence depending on the age and gender.

561
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:32,747
So it's called adult male equivalent.

562
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:37,797
Equivalence in the Ziegler paper goes over that.

563
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,547
So. All right, that's all I've got.

564
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:47,787
Any questions for Jalen?

565
01:08:47,787 --> 01:08:51,867
Can I ask?

566
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:56,576
So again, Tuesday, dietetic students are excused from class.

567
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:59,667
Just make sure you review the Panopto recording.

568
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:01,707
And then on Thursday,

569
01:09:02,277 --> 01:09:10,467
Sarah and Jess will be here to talk about interviewers system 24 hour records and Jess will be talking about it from a clinical standpoint.

570
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:14,577
So. Right. And very question in terms of the commodities.

571
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:21,687
So asparagus would be in it. I first of all, it's very specific to the country an area, right.

572
01:09:21,897 --> 01:09:26,517
What they produce. Yes, yes. So food supply is going to be very sensitive.

573
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:31,047
Yes. To each area and then agricultural.
