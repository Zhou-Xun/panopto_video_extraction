1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,410
So in my opinion, life expectancy is one of the more interesting measures that we have in epidemiology.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,420
Given your birth year and current age, it tells you how much longer you're expected to live.

3
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:27,010
So how is this number calculated? Well, it's using known relationships between incidence rate and risk over time.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,939
Curious how it works. In this video.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,190
I'm going to walk you through exactly that.

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,640
We'll start using the mathematical equations that link incidence proportions or risks with incidence rates.

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:47,590
All Then show you an example of how you can calculate this in the most generic scenario when there's changing incidence rates over time.

8
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,480
I'll then talk you through a scenario where we have constant incidence rates and then finally a situation where the disease is rare.

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,820
Or then describe the intuition behind these formulas.

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:09,820
So here we go with the math. This here is a formula that allows us to estimate our incidence proportion from incidence rates and time.

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,670
It's the most generic version of the formula that allows for different incidence rates over time.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,780
So in our example of thinking about life expectancy, the time would be someone's age.

13
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,040
And this specification of the model will allow for the fact that mortality rates increase with increasing age.

14
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,270
For now. We're going to start with an example of how you execute this formula.

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,640
But please don't worry. I'm going to try and give you some insight as to why the math looks like this.

16
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,399
At the end of the video. Here. I'm showing you the mortality rates and deaths per 100,000 person.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Years broken down by age group. We'll start by assuming that we're interested in estimating the ten year risk of mortality for a 50 year old.

18
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:05,140
To do this, we first have to create the sum as shown by the sigma in the equation of the

19
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,270
incidence rate for each age group times the number of years spent in that age group.

20
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:21,100
So for the 50 year old, we're basically waiting the mortality rate of a person between age 45 and 54 for five years with the

21
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:29,620
mortality rate for a person age 55 to 64 for five years in order to get the 50 year olds ten year risk.

22
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,380
Plugging these numbers into our equation, you can see that the ten year risk of death for a 50 year old is 6%.

23
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:50,420
In contrast, for a 78 year old, I need to wait seven years of time in the 75 to 84 age group and three years of time in the 85 and older age group.

24
00:02:51,140 --> 00:03:00,050
Plugging these numbers into our equation, we see that an individual who is age 78 has a ten year risk and mortality of 51%.

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,160
As you might imagine, if there's no change in the incidence rates over time or with increasing age,

26
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,970
then the equation can be simplified to this particular formula.

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:21,150
Using this version of the formula. We'll take an example where we're looking at the prognosis for individuals with very aggressive brain tumors.

28
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,430
With an extreme case fatality rate of 210 per thousand person years,

29
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,999
we see that the risk of death within two years is 34% after we multiply the incidence

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,890
rate times the duration and then exponentially rate the negative of that quotient.

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,560
Similarly, we get a four year risk and mortality of 57% for somebody with this particular end point.

32
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,660
It's clearly not the kind of disease that you want.

33
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,040
Yet these risks and they're inverse, which represent the probability of survival,

34
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,230
can provide very valuable information to patients and families who face this condition.

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,069
Now,

36
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:10,830
one interesting thing to note before we move on this slide is that the four year risk of mortality is much less than double than the two year risk.

37
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:20,690
So why is that? Well, it turns out that these relationships are nonlinear over time because inside of a closed population,

38
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,550
the number of people at risk of a disease declines with passing of time.

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,180
This is why we have the exponential in our equations.

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,520
Intuitively, you may be able to understand this by looking at the following two lines.

41
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:42,170
The blue line is reflecting the cumulative incidence, and the green line is reflecting the population at risk of our outcome.

42
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,820
At the start of the follow up period, no one has experienced the outcome,

43
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,250
so the percentage of the population at risk is 100% and the cumulative incidence is 0%.

44
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,880
Even as you move a little further out in time, very few people have developed the outcome.

45
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,830
So almost the full population remains at risk. As time progresses, however, more and more people have developed the outcome.

46
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,670
So the population at risk is shrinking down towards zero.

47
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,040
In other words, with the most aggressive types of outcomes,

48
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,670
there are far fewer events in later years because most people have already developed the outcome at earlier times.

49
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,950
Importantly,

50
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:34,400
the non linearity due to the lack of survivors in the population is mostly an issue for aggressive diseases or for very long follow up periods.

51
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,690
It's far less of an issue for diseases that have very small incidence rates or for various small durations of follow up.

52
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:50,250
In these situations, there are so few new cases that the population at risk is not being depleted as a result.

53
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:58,070
In these situations, the product of the incidence rate times time is a good approximation for the incidence proportion.

54
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:07,660
You might now be wondering how short of a time or how low of an incidence rate must be in place in order for this approximation to hold?

55
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:15,310
Well, as a general rule of thumb, you can say that the incidence rate times time will be a good estimate for the incidence

56
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:22,060
proportion when the product of the incidence rate times time is equal or less than 10%.

57
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,490
As one final note on this concept,

58
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,490
I just want to mention that one critical assumption when we use these formulas is that there are no competing risks.

59
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,299
So what is a competing risk? One other words.

60
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:43,580
What I'm saying is that the population is not being depleted with respect to persons at risk for reasons other than our outcome of interest.

61
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:53,060
While competing risk is clearly non-issue for outcomes like mortality, other end points like dementia may have challenges using this formula,

62
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:00,140
since the population at risk at higher ages when dementia occurs are also likely to die of other causes.

63
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:11,130
So in summary, we covered in this video how to estimate incidence, proportion or risk from incidence rates in fixed populations.

64
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:20,290
The two key takeaways are that risk or incidence proportion is equal to the incidence rate times time only when the disease is rare.

65
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,010
Otherwise, risks will plateau over time due to reductions in the population at risk.
