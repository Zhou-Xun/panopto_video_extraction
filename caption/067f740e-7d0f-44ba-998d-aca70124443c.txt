1
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:13,174
After watching this video, you will be
able to use PROC MIANALYZE to combine

2
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:17,410
the estimates from the imputed datasets.

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,503
We just did the first step of multiple
imputation in the previous video.

4
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,792
Now, let's do the other two in this one.

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:29,590
We will do the analysis and we will use
PROC MIANALYZE to combine the results.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,326
Step number two requires you to
analyze every imputed dataset and

7
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:40,450
you can do that easily using
by_imputation_ statement in your syntax.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,847
Remember that anytime you
want to use a by statement,

9
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:47,970
you need to sort the data
set by that variable first.

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,046
Now, also remember that our regional
study was a much control study.

11
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:55,343
So, we need to perform
conditional registration here and

12
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:58,140
that's the corresponding syntax.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,299
If you were doing linear regression,
you would do the same.

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,928
But with the syntax for
in adoration and so on for

15
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:07,400
any other models that
you run in this course.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,950
So the only difference in this code
compared to the previous code that you

17
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,381
have used is that we are doing
it by imputation number,

18
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:18,588
which means the analysis
will be done 25 times and

19
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:24,320
we're asking in the model statement they
cvb option to get the covariance data.

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,098
They purposes of despair is to
generate the parameter estimates,

21
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,476
the barriers to gradual ratios,
and the covariance data.

22
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:36,910
So you can calculate your parameters with
confidence intervals in the next step.

23
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,797
For that you will need to save those
parameters and that covariance structure

24
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:46,400
into their assets that will be
imputed in program analyzed.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,976
Note that the name of those two
things changed by procedure, so

26
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,480
you will need to check the syntax.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,342
So when you run that, you will get
a really low loan loan loan output with

28
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:03,860
25 logistic models for
imputation number one computation #25.

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,872
You don't really need to look at that
because we're saving the parameters and

30
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:12,006
the covariance of each model into their
assets to combine them later with program

31
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,900
analyze.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,122
Here I'm printing them so
you can see what we're saving.

33
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,224
Again, you don't need to do that, so

34
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:23,950
just to give you a sense of the type
of data that you're getting.

35
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,500
So now you're going to combine the results
from 25 imputed datasets to get correct

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,950
estimates.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,935
No one's more than the keywords
you use for your parameters, and

38
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:38,283
covariance will depend on what
procedure you use in the previous step.

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,838
In program analyze doing put
those parameter estimates in

40
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:46,800
their parliaments option and
the covariance there in the COVV option.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,110
Then in the model effect statement you add
the two variables that you have in your

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,740
model Alpha linolenic acid running.

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,828
And that's everything you
get from program analyzed.

44
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:02,559
You can ignore most of it and just look at
your parameter estimates highlighted here.

45
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,776
With a rebel this earlier
betas understand their errors.

46
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:09,782
Note that this was registered ovation so
you will have to spawn in shape.

47
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:14,820
Those together alterations
in confidence intervals.

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,828
So as you can see here, multiple
imputation is not necessarily complicated,

49
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:23,070
but it clearly takes more time that
just using complete case analysis.

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,088
So there are some practical issues where
you may prefer to use complete case

51
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:31,900
scenario as opposed to multiple
imputation, regardless of not being idea.

52
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,735
If you only have a few missing values,
I would recommend remove their survey.

53
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:41,714
Tiens, even if they missing, this is not
completely random, being only a few.

54
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:44,203
I really doubt it will cause a huge bias.

55
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,521
So how many are a few?

56
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,386
Well, I mean it depends
on the sample size, so

57
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:53,010
you will get a sense of that
once you do more analysis.

58
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,380
Since summer, in this video we use program
analyzed to combine the estimates from

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,070
the beauty that assets and
we're done with Unit 7 in the next video.

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,800
We will summarize the main
concepts learned in Unison.
