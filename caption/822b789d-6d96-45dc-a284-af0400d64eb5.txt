1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,460
I have to figure out. Hmm.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,510
Yeah. I talked in this room. If you have notes on your PowerPoint, it's going to, like, capture them to.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,120
Okay. Think that? Yeah, I think that's better.

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:41,450
Who thinks. I mean, I can't see.

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,510
Guess I'm not worried about it.

6
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,990
Okay. Thanks.

7
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,660
All right. Hello, everybody. Morning.

8
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,390
Welcome to SAS for epidemiological research.

9
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,010
This is EP at 640. If we in the right spot. Um, I'm Scott.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,260
I'm going to be your instructor this semester. Um.

11
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,360
It's kind of a big class, so. Well, we'll work through that.

12
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,900
Hopefully get to know you a little bit over for the semester, but it might take a little while since there's so many of you.

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,950
Um, we also have two excellent GSI.

14
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,069
Lisa and Rachel. And they're here to help us out.

15
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,030
And they're primarily going to be helping you out in your lab sections, which you'll meet later today.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,180
Okay. Um, we're here to learn SAS.

17
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,080
So let's get right to it. I think.

18
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:25,890
So the first objective, Isely, is we want to learn data management manipulation really how to use SAS or any kind of.

19
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
Any kind of research that you might want to do.

20
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:38,580
So that's the first objective, and that's going to include things like importing data, storing it, merging it, manipulating it.

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,120
You want to be able to summarize your results that you have and write clear code in doing so.

22
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:00,630
Now the problem that comes up with any kind of programing is that data is often very messy.

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,040
It's usually not that nice. Sometimes it is, and you're lucky if it is.

24
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,270
But a lot of things can happen when you're working with data.

25
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,410
Files are in different formats and you might have labeling that's different in different files.

26
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,950
Variables might be called different names. There's errors, typos, things like that in your data, all lot.

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,010
Um, it also might just not being a forum that's very conducive for analysis.

28
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,790
So there's a lot of things that can can happen here that we're going to have to deal with along the way.

29
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:55,380
And so that's part of what we want to get you to be able to do. Um, since we're programing on computers, computers are machines.

30
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,290
They really only do what you tell them to do. So that's important to understand.

31
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,220
And you want to keep a watchful eye on your results.

32
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,170
Because it's not necessarily going to tell you if you did something right. You're going to want to make sure it makes sense.

33
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:21,710
And that's another goal that we're going to have for you to look at your your results critically and make sure everything looks normal.

34
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,810
Okay. So that makes sense. So here's an example of what I mean by that.

35
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,670
So suppose this might be something I would get from a student or someone.

36
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,690
Okay, so suppose I've asked them to look at the relationship between inhaler use and exercise.

37
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,550
Among a sample of about 500 asthmatic third graders.

38
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,390
And this is what they bring me, this nice little two by two table.

39
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,460
We've got inhaler use on the left here and exercise in the columns.

40
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,020
Do you notice anything that looks unusual here?

41
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,270
Anybody? Don't be afraid to speak up.

42
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,810
Sorry. Say there's more than 500 people. Yeah.

43
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,860
If you look at the total down here, we've got 1423 people in this table.

44
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,120
Right. Anything else that might be strange.

45
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,960
Well, down here at the bottom says very conveniently tells you how many missiles you have.

46
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,360
There's also 870 missing people. That might be a problem.

47
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,490
I don't know. But it's something to spot and look out for.

48
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,880
So we want to look at this a little further. What what happened? So I might ask them to.

49
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,520
Look at some just descriptive statistics on the sample itself.

50
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,150
And here's what they come up with. Well, this all looks fairly.

51
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:20,220
Reasonable. When you get down here to asthma status, you see that, in fact, 1870 were healthy.

52
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,130
We were interested in asthmatic. So we go back and look here.

53
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,000
That's exactly the number of missing there were. So that's that explains that.

54
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,930
So no problem there really. We were interested in just as medics anyways.

55
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,640
Okay. So that's fine. But what else?

56
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,750
Um. So why did we have more than 500 people that we were expecting?

57
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,880
And the idea. Yeah.

58
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,370
Go ahead. We all. Yeah, that's, that's probably it.

59
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,950
So we were interested in third graders and we see we have a wide range of ages here.

60
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:10,060
It's pretty unlikely these older kids are in third grade. My son is going into fifth grade and he's ten.

61
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,020
So I imagine most third graders are about eight years old.

62
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,910
Right. So it's probably some subsample of this 830 that we're actually interested in.

63
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,830
So this is the kind of thing we want to be able to.

64
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:33,170
Get the hang of really keep a careful look at what we're doing and do the results make sense from what we expect?

65
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,110
All right. Any questions about that?

66
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Please feel free to stop me anytime, if you have a question. Okay.

67
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,750
Just raise your hand. It's totally cool to interrupt if you have something to say or ask.

68
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,910
Yes. Yes.

69
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:09,080
The table. Yes. Yes. The longer it is.

70
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:21,110
So that's a good question. You can see here that inhaler use is coded as zero or one and so is the exercise.

71
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,280
That's a typical way to code things for one being, yes, generally and zero meaning no.

72
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:36,590
So in this case, those ones are those people who use an inhaler today and exercise.

73
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,350
So the 67 would be those who exercise and use their inhaler today.

74
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,600
So that makes sense. It's a good question.

75
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,850
Yes. O r stands for odds ratio.

76
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,310
Yes. Another good question.

77
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:04,030
So if you haven't had a lot of statistics yet, the odds ratio kind of tells you how related these things are to each other.

78
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,110
In fact, this would mean that if you exercised.

79
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,510
Then if you exercise today and you have one and a half times.

80
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,250
You're one half times more likely to have used your inhaler today. Okay.

81
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:32,460
So that's what that means. You'll certainly learn a lot more about that in your bio stats and here as well.

82
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,790
Okay. Any other questions on this?

83
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,940
Excellent. Yeah.

84
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,380
So we want to be able to think critically. And remember that we do all make mistakes.

85
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,760
And the trick here is to be able to notice when you when you do or help someone else out when when they make a mistake.

86
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,960
So we want to look critically. At the end of the course.

87
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:14,690
You're going to hopefully be well situated, answer epidemiologic questions using SAS coding and really more importantly

88
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,330
be able to manage data and that will help you with any program that you use.

89
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,170
Okay. So let's talk about the actual class.

90
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,810
So we're going to meet our team. We can already do that.

91
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:42,990
Um, I understand my teaching philosophy is important, and we'll learn about the actual structure of the class and identify some sources for material.

92
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:52,860
So, again, I'm Scott. I'm a primarily a data analyst here at U of M.

93
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,480
I work with Jen Smith in her genetics lab. I've been.

94
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,870
I've been doing SAS probably for 15 plus years at this point.

95
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:11,840
I used to teach math. I used to teach the SAS, the SAS course for my students at at Virginia Commonwealth University.

96
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,030
And. My background's in math.

97
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,810
I got a master's in applied math. But again, I've been programing for a long time.

98
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,000
And I enjoy teaching. So hopefully. Hopefully I'll be able to help you guys out this term.

99
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,540
Our guest is Rachel Lisa. We introduced. Do you want to say anything more?

100
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,460
You can learn about them in your lab. Yeah. Yeah. And the schedule.

101
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,680
So it's pretty packed. We're going to learn something a little different each each week.

102
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,550
And it ranges anywhere from.

103
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:59,690
Importing data will start out with that kind of stuff all the way down to regression in some macros and things like that we'll talk about at the end.

104
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,570
So that'll all be very useful stuff. This may in fact be the most useful course.

105
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,500
You take it as an MP. You use this stuff a lot.

106
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:21,370
Even if you don't use SAS, even if use are something else, the the data skills that you that you learn in this class will be extremely helpful.

107
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:33,020
The teaching philosophy? Well, you really can't learn programing without doing it, so it's really going to be exercise centric.

108
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,980
That's what the labs are for. Get practice on doing these things that we learn in the lecture.

109
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,820
Lectures meant to introduce the topic and give you some reference materials to go by.

110
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,980
And then the lab. You really is where you're really going to. Strap down and learn this stuff by doing it.

111
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,640
And. Yeah. We all learn by doing and sometimes failing.

112
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,520
And that's going to be part of the learning process, is figuring out what went wrong and trying again.

113
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,560
And that's totally okay. Um.

114
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,840
Let's see. Yeah. We'll have the weekly lectures to cover the content in the labs.

115
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,590
That's where you'll get your practice. Those are done in person in the labs downstairs here below us.

116
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,700
Yeah. So you really just need to tinker with it.

117
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,530
That's really what it's. What's going to help you just play around with it.

118
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,060
Get the practice doing labs. And don't be afraid.

119
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,990
Afraid to try different things. In SAS.

120
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,870
Also, please be aware that we're all here to help.

121
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,850
You shouldn't feel like this is a competitive cause, or it's just there's some race to finish the lab first.

122
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,060
Okay, we want to help each other out. That's really important. So we're going to encourage you to work together on those labs.

123
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,969
Please do find a partner. If you want to do partners, that's fine.

124
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,870
If you want to. Two groups of two or three. Work on this together.

125
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,950
And if that's not enough, ask another group next to you. Okay.

126
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,530
Our guys will be in the lab the whole time, so you can always ask them if you're stuck.

127
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,420
Or you can you can come to me as well. Right.

128
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:39,640
If you email questions, it's probably probably best just to email all three of us, you know, probably get a quicker response.

129
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,690
Uh, because someone, some will be on their computer, probably.

130
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:52,180
So that's, that's probably a good idea. Just email us all if you have an email question, but you're welcome to ask questions in class in lab.

131
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,380
Office hours and stuff as well. Okay.

132
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,720
The labs are going to be graded on completion, not accuracy.

133
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,620
Uh, it's again, it's really meant for practice.

134
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,130
So we're not too concerned about you getting everything right.

135
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:21,590
And these labs. So if you do it and you do it completely, you'll get credit for it.

136
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,600
Right. They're not meant to be long assignments.

137
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,240
They're short little things. You should hopefully be able to finish them in your two hour lab session.

138
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:45,540
Okay. They are due by the end of the day at midnight, which hopefully won't be a problem because you're sure if you don't finish in your lab session,

139
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,570
you might have to take 15, 20 minutes to finish it up on your own during the day sometime.

140
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,680
Hopefully that won't be a big deal. Again, they're just complete.

141
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,580
They're just graded on completion. So. Yes. Yeah.

142
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,990
What's that? You have a you do have a lab today. Yes, you do.

143
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,430
Yeah. You'll have lab after every every lecture.

144
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,460
Uh, the exception would be we have a midterm in week ten.

145
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,840
So you won't have a lab that week and Thanksgiving week, you won't have lamb.

146
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,689
And I guess the last the last week of class, I'll see you won't have a lamb, but every other class session.

147
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,440
You'll also have a lab afterward. Okay.

148
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,870
There will be 12, 12 of them. And that's those are worth 10% of your grade.

149
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,520
So really, it's as long as you're showing up to those and you're doing the doing them, you should have an easy 10%.

150
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,360
And there's, in fact, 12 labs as well. So we'll drop two of those.

151
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,980
So if you have to miss for some reason or you just can't finish for some reason.

152
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,990
No, no big deal. Two of those will be dropped. Okay.

153
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:15,480
Other assessments will have homeworks. There'll be six of those throughout the semester on a some semi biweekly basis.

154
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,520
There will be a midterm exam, which we'll just take in class here.

155
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,020
Okay. So it will be an in-class midterm exam.

156
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,220
It'll be open note. So you can bring whatever you want. Those exams are really the only time you can't work with another person.

157
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,860
Okay. So just show up class to take that with any notes sheets you want.

158
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,979
Whatever monetary you have except the computer, I guess I don't really want you to use your computer in here,

159
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,630
but if you have notes and things, you can use that. The final exam will be take home.

160
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,110
So it's going to be kind of a longer week long exercise, much like the homeworks.

161
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:11,820
And you'll turn that in on canvas. As well as your homeworks, by the way, those are also get turned on to turned in on canvas and lamps.

162
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,110
In fact. Everything's trending on campus. Okay.

163
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,540
Labs 10%. Homework is going to be 40%. That midterm 20 and the final 30% of your grade.

164
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,330
Homeworks are going to be due at 9:00 on Fridays.

165
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
So when this class starts, you should have turned it in.

166
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,950
Um, you know, I try to be flexible, so if you have some extenuating circumstances, just let me know, okay?

167
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:53,390
But generally, without some situation that's reasonable, there'll be a 10% penalty per day.

168
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,300
That is late. Yes.

169
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,990
Well, the homeworks will be like word documents, so you can just fill those out and upload those.

170
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:21,550
That's probably easy as well. Some of you may end up using Google Docs or something and converting that into a Google account.

171
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,860
You can upload that too. That's fine. Okay.

172
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:34,830
As long as we can read, it should be fine. Any other questions so far?

173
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,760
All right. On the campus page, you'll find all the materials that you need.

174
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:54,760
So here's the home page. We like SAS. Um, so you'll find the syllabus here and the syllabus tab.

175
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:06,010
So everything I'm kind of going over now is in there. Assignments tab will give you all your all your labs and your homeworks and so on.

176
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,600
So that's where you'll find that stuff. And the home page, you can also find those things in the course schedule.

177
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,840
So here, if we go to this first week, you'll find these slides that I'm going over.

178
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:30,020
You'll find some other resources. Some stuff about virtual sites and Dropbox will be useful as you get started with your labs.

179
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,420
There's also kind of the SAS cheat sheet set around here.

180
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,420
It's more or less like a textbook, like a little. Yeah.

181
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:48,400
They're just basically like a textbook. We don't have a formal textbook for the class, but you can use those for extra material.

182
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,910
The lab's here. There'll be a link into the lab on assignment here, as you can see.

183
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,660
So this is where you'll find all your lab stuff that you'll need.

184
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,210
Okay. And if you're if there's any assignments that are out that day, that'll show up down here as well.

185
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:14,390
Yes. Is there a tutorial for us to download SAS?

186
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,010
Yeah, we'll talk about that. Yeah, we will talk about that. That's coming.

187
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:27,400
Be patient there. All right. So I definitely encourage you to look through this page.

188
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,100
Some of you already have, I'm sure. But take a look through here and let me know if you have any questions about it.

189
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:42,210
If you're having trouble with any links or anything like that, a lot of things are still locked, so don't expect you to be able to see everything.

190
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,110
The labs will open up at 945 a day that you do it and.

191
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,150
Lecture slides will open like midnight the day before that we do them so on.

192
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,920
So if you do want to print them out or whatever, you can do that before you come to class.

193
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,920
Right. All right.

194
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,150
There's also some other good textbook resources and online resources.

195
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,880
I really like this book. This is one of the ones I learned SAS with.

196
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,020
It's very good. It's all examples, really. So it makes it really straightforward and easy.

197
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:37,150
I think. These UCLA help pages are really useful as well for an online source.

198
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,070
So feel free to use any of these things. Um.

199
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,280
Programing can be tricky and can be tricky sometimes.

200
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,970
So you might get frustrated. I do sometimes.

201
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,749
SAS does some quirky things once in a while. So that can be frustrating.

202
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,500
But don't let yourself get get too worked up.

203
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,300
Just remember that whatever works, works.

204
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,650
There's not one way to do things. Generally in SAS.

205
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,930
Okay. If you get stuck for too long, just ask for help.

206
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:28,450
Yes. Sorry.

207
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:37,360
I don't hear anyone. How does that compare to other programing languages and.

208
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,330
Well. It's different.

209
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:50,030
It's definitely different than other ones. Yeah. They're not really super comparable.

210
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,190
Ah. Is another good program. Um.

211
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,120
But it's, it's the way it's programed is.

212
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,790
It's. Pretty different. It's vector based where SAS is not.

213
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,620
I think SAS is a lot easier to do data manipulation on than anything else.

214
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,610
It's very flexible. With our you have a bunch of individual little packages for anything you want to do.

215
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,290
You have to download a new package if you want to do something unique.

216
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,090
Where everything's built into says. It's all there. Okay.

217
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,750
Things like SPSS. That's more Windows Drag Down menu based.

218
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:50,050
So it's not so much programing. There's things like stadia, which is another programing language which a lot of people use, maybe not quite as much.

219
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,370
But it has its own programing style as well.

220
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,980
So unfortunately, if you know one, you're not going to know the other.

221
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,040
But that doesn't mean knowing one won't help you learn the other one.

222
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay. That is sufficient answer.

223
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,750
All right. Why says.

224
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,170
Well, it's. What is it?

225
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,870
Well, it was developed in the sixties by a graduate student at NC State.

226
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,430
It originally stood for statistical analysis system. But no one ever says that.

227
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,600
Just everyone just assess. So be aware of that.

228
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,940
It's very common in epidemiology and other research areas.

229
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
It's really been the work horse for many, many years.

230
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:57,000
There is some movement towards ah, because it's free, but it's also open source which can limit your use by government.

231
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,889
It's. Again, it's a different language.

232
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:11,600
So since gas has been used for so long, a lot of people are used to that in both academics and in industry.

233
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:27,940
It's very widely used still. And knowing sass is going to be a big benefit to you, even if your job eventually doesn't use it and uses something else.

234
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,380
It's really good for data manipulation and management. I think better than any other program.

235
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,040
It's documentation of of your activities.

236
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:48,960
So it has a log that it produces is really good as well as the documentation for using it is really good both online and on the program itself.

237
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,270
There's there's a lot of good resources for for figuring out how to use it.

238
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,640
Since a lot of people are used to SAS, they don't want to change.

239
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,790
So we've got all these SAS files that you've done research on.

240
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:15,490
You don't want to have to convert them over to some other form. So it's it's going to be widely used in both academics and and.

241
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,530
The industry. It's very marketable.

242
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,670
All programing skills are marketable. But SAS in particular.

243
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:33,170
So let's get started. And actually. What how to actually do anything in.

244
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,680
So. For the basics here.

245
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,680
We just want to be able to access and learn the basic windows in the environment.

246
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,010
So first of all, if you're going to use gas at home, you've got a couple of options.

247
00:27:51,110 --> 00:28:00,950
You can purchase the actual software license from the computer showcase for about $50 and.

248
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:09,920
So that is an option. You can pick that up at the computer showcase and install it on your computer, your personal computer.

249
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,850
The license only lasts for one year. Unfortunately, that's the way it is for us.

250
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,280
You have to pay for it every year. Probably the better option.

251
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,160
It's very easy to do is to connect to SAS through virtual sites.

252
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,980
Is anybody familiar with that? Maybe some of you have used it.

253
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,930
Probably a lot of you haven't.

254
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:50,670
It's it's a it's basically a way that you can log into a virtual computer from anywhere and use all the programs that are on that virtual computer.

255
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,520
So there's some good resources for figuring that out and.

256
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,660
And canvas. And we'll talk about a little bit more in your lab today as well.

257
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:14,990
Okay. But mainly you're going to have to download a program and kind of set that program up to be able to log into that virtual computer.

258
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:22,630
It's not difficult. So. You should be able to figure it out based on the directions that are there.

259
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:33,090
And if you need help, please, please ask us. When you actually have this either on your computer or you're using the virtual computer,

260
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:44,130
you really just need to find either the icon on the on the front page or you can navigate in the in normal windows way.

261
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:57,749
So here, if I was going to open SAS, I would just find SAS down here and use 9.4 and English and bingo.

262
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,130
There it is. It's open. This is generally what you see when you first open SAS.

263
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:11,860
Um. You can just close that. What we're seeing here is kind of the general SAS environment.

264
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,330
There's a few windows that pop up, which we'll talk about here shortly.

265
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,480
Okay. So on the left, we have an explorer window.

266
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,450
Which shows kind of all your data files, any libraries that you've created.

267
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:37,890
We'll talk about that more. So that's kind of just just like Windows Explorer, you can kind of navigate all your files that way.

268
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:49,290
This upper window is is your log. Where they'll tell you what code you've submitted and if you've got any errors from code that you've run,

269
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,620
this is something you want to check every time you run something very important.

270
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,680
Anytime you run anything, just check this log. Down here is the editor window.

271
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,940
So that's really just where you're actually typing in your code. Okay.

272
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,570
Now how you use these windows is kind of up to you a little bit.

273
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,270
Some people like to have all these windows open.

274
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:27,850
I tend to like to maximize this so I can see more and then you can kind of scroll through them and with these tabs below.

275
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,790
Right. So the log is here. Any output that you create will show up here.

276
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,350
And then there's the out of your window. So that's generally how I. I use it.

277
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,689
You're welcome to have multiple multi windows open if you want at the same time.

278
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,490
And sometimes it's if you're prone to forgetting to check your log,

279
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:55,450
that might be a good idea to have it there so you can see it produce some information.

280
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,550
Okay. Um.

281
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,850
You can also toggle between the Windows in the view tab up at the top.

282
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,900
So up here. Up here you can see. You can toggle through them this way.

283
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:24,560
We will always use the enhanced editor. So don't even bother with the program editor to see how it is enhanced when it's nicer.

284
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:35,620
Um. Let's see. SAS is very helpful in the way it's color coded.

285
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:44,440
So this is an example program here. Which we see is various colors.

286
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:56,030
So green is for any comments that you make. This is stuff that you write in your code as notes to yourself or to describe what.

287
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,780
What you're trying to do or. And your homeworks.

288
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,350
You might put your the homework question number on there.

289
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:11,030
Okay. What's important is that these are very helpful for to redo your code and go back to it and understand what you were trying to do.

290
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:20,240
And these are not executed in the program at all. So when you use them, SAS just ignore them when it's running the code.

291
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,330
They're really just for you. Blue will show up for any kind of keywords that Sass recognizes.

292
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:38,440
Like there's a dark blue here. You might not be able to tell it's dark blue, but data is a keyword that'll show up dark blue input datelines.

293
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,270
These are statement keywords. And so those show up blue as well.

294
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,510
Black. We'll just be for any information that you provide it.

295
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:59,840
So any things like variable names or data set names or just equations and stuff that you type in, those all show up black.

296
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,760
If you do type any numbers or show up teal. Other than this kind of thing.

297
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,480
These are here, you're entering data. But if you're using like an equation.

298
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,380
Numbers of show appeal. Anything in quotes will show up as purple.

299
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,320
Here's an example of that. And that's all there is right here. Here State equals I.

300
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:33,580
So that's in quotes. So that shows up purple. And if you see red when you're typing code, that's definitely something wrong.

301
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:39,730
So you've spelled something wrong or you forgot a semicolon or whatever.

302
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,940
Okay. And again, it's very important to to review your log.

303
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,220
Any time you run any code. It's going to tell you.

304
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,019
A lot of information. What you'd like to see is everything.

305
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,650
Show of blue. Blue is generally good.

306
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:09,920
That means that the program ran. That doesn't mean that doesn't mean you program it correctly, but it does mean it was able to execute the program.

307
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,690
Right. Green.

308
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,940
If you see like green, those are warnings. So it was able to execute the code, but it thinks something might not be quite right.

309
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,740
So that's worth checking out if you see anything green in your long.

310
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,750
If you see red in your log, well then it wasn't able to execute your program at all.

311
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,580
And usually it gives you some hints. As cryptic as they may be.

312
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,710
It'll give you some good hints for what went wrong and how to fix it.

313
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:56,210
Okay. So you need to check this every time you run any code. So on the left of Sass, there was that Explorer window.

314
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,380
Here, you'll find the clickable list of any procedures that you've done.

315
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:10,910
Any results that you have. And so on. So you can kind of click through the list on the left to to look at them.

316
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:17,540
You can also just open the results tab, which is down here and just scroll through.

317
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,420
They'll all be there and they'll just stack on top of each other. Okay.

318
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:33,660
Unless you clear that window, which you can also do. So to use the Explorer window, it's just clickable.

319
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,980
Just like any other Windows Explorer. You'll find libraries in here.

320
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,570
That's where you're going to store all your data. You can also navigate your the actual PC you're on.

321
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:58,330
You can open folders with this icon up here. So again, it's a lot like any other Windows based program.

322
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,050
In the way it navigates through folders. Okay.

323
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,750
And usually there's layers. So in libraries, these would be libraries that you create.

324
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:20,870
These are really just names for locations on your computer. And when you open those folders, you'll see all the SAS files that are in that folder.

325
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:29,650
In that location on your computer. This is what I'd say states that would generally look like.

326
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,140
Variables in SAS are either numeric or character.

327
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,100
Not at the same time they're either numeric or character only.

328
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,770
Okay. So things like this exam on days that would be numeric.

329
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,460
This over here. This new code description would be character.

330
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:04,639
When you open a data set to view like this, you can tell if they're numeric or character and by the way, they're justified.

331
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,490
So numerics are right. Justified. Characters are left justified.

332
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:21,290
The other thing that's important to remember is the way sass codes are missing numeric variables like these ones.

333
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,830
If you have missing data, they're coded as a as a dot a period.

334
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,260
Where a character missing or just blank? Just an empty blank.

335
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:46,559
Okay. So there's a distinction there as well. You've got the menu bar at the top of SAS, the open SAS.

336
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,210
You can see it up here at the top. So this looks like many other windows.

337
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,280
Many buyers, especially this first buyer. These are all kind of generic.

338
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,160
Windows type things you're probably familiar with and the writer, the specific ones.

339
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,090
So there's this little cool running guy here, which is what you click on to run your program.

340
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,550
This big x is the death X, which I don't know why it's there.

341
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:27,460
I hate it because what it does is it clears out your entire your entire screen, your entire editor window, and just clears it out.

342
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,310
And unfortunately, they put it right next to the run button. So that's fun.

343
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:40,420
Yeah, that's really great. But luckily, there is this this undo button right here, too.

344
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,370
So if you accidentally click it, freeze and don't do anything until you hit undo.

345
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:53,590
Okay. You can also stop your code at any time with this exclamation point.

346
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,800
And there's lovely help menus for SAS as well that you can get to with this icon.

347
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:13,260
Okay. New questions there. The SAS help is very useful.

348
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:24,030
Don't be afraid to use this. It works well. So just go to help or hit the little little dictionary icon either way.

349
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:31,120
And. Choose, assess, help and documentation and a window will pop up somewhat like this.

350
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:38,270
You can search for keywords or procedure names or whatever else you're looking for.

351
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,170
And here in this example.

352
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:54,040
They typed in freak F3. Q which is a procedure we'll learn and the free procedure comes up and it tells you all about the syntax,

353
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,510
all the options and all the stuff that goes in there and statements that can go with it.

354
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,570
So it's very useful. Okay. So we're going to try it.

355
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,990
The basics. So we want to understand the basic building blocks.

356
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,220
I've said a lot of words that you probably had no idea what I was actually saying.

357
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:23,290
So let's learn what those mean. Um.

358
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,280
So it's a simple well, I shouldn't say simple.

359
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:35,120
It's a program that you give a sequence of instructions to you just like anything else.

360
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:41,450
Okay. You must first tell generally what you're trying to do, and then you can tell it the specifics.

361
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,900
So if you are going to try to go find a book at the library, you'd.

362
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:53,469
You might first look up. You know, you might first go to the fiction section.

363
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:58,240
Right. And then you might look up an author, and then you might look up the book name and so on.

364
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,340
So the order isn't super important in which you do that, but.

365
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:12,410
You must approach it in the right way. Okay. There's three main building blocks of SAS code.

366
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,080
There's steps, datum, proc steps, procedure steps and short for procedure.

367
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,490
Their statements. And there's options.

368
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:37,030
Let's talk about the steps first. There's data steps which read data from some external source, manipulate your data, combine it and so on.

369
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:46,650
And the output from that is another data set. So this is really where you do all the meat of your your data manipulation.

370
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,100
Okay. There's also procedure steps. Those are.

371
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:59,420
Going to perform some kind of analysis on your data. So it might be.

372
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:09,010
Looking at frequency tables where it might be running a regression analysis or printing or sorting things like that.

373
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,750
Generally, output, there is some result a report. Okay.

374
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:25,530
For the general syntax. All SAS programs are made up of statements.

375
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:33,020
When I say statement. That's kind of the main building block of SAS code.

376
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,800
It's a statement. Statements always end in a semicolon.

377
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,920
If you're getting weird errors on your log or something's not working, that's probably the first thing to check.

378
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,850
Do you have a semicolon at the end of every statement?

379
00:43:54,580 --> 00:44:03,270
Okay. A full block of statements, starting with a data statement.

380
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,260
Or a proc statement all the way to a run statement.

381
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:18,140
We call a step, either a data step. If it's it starts with a data statement or a proc step procedure step.

382
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:26,950
If it starts with a procedure. So this whole block here, we would call a step, data step.

383
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,230
Makes sense. And then options are what are going to modify your statements and give any further details about what you're trying to do.

384
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:51,210
So for example here this data equals is a is an option that tells proc sort that we want to start with this data set.

385
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:58,510
Okay. That's the data we want to actually sort. All right.

386
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,610
Making sense. Yes.

387
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:24,990
Uh huh. So in this case, what this is going to do is it's going to start it's going to take this data, said Biostatistics 40.

388
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:31,150
And it's going to sort it by these two variables.

389
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,920
And replace the old one. So it did.

390
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:43,550
The result was a data set. It was the same as the original one, except that it's now sorted by these two variables.

391
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,100
We didn't tell it to make a new one. So it's going to actually replace the old.

392
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:54,930
We can tell it with another option to make a different data set altogether.

393
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:08,950
Okay. Good question. If you actually want to run your program, you highlight the piece of code that you want to run.

394
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:17,560
Click the little running guy that we saw earlier. If you don't highlight any code, SAS will run the entire thing.

395
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:24,010
Which maybe you want to do, but usually not. So be aware of that.

396
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,479
If you've got a super long code and you accidentally don't highlight something and hit run, that's where that little exclamation point comes in.

397
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,340
You can hit that and stop your code. All right.

398
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:48,420
Again make sure you and every. Statement with a semicolon and make sure that.

399
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,100
Um. You end your steps with a run statement.

400
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,620
Okay. If you don't have a run.

401
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,130
SAS will compile the code but won't actually execute it.

402
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:13,310
So you you might see in your log just a repeat of the code that was just run.

403
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:21,470
If there's no run on it on the end. You'll just see the text and you'll be like, Why didn't it tell me if this ran or not?

404
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,940
Well, that's because it didn't actually execute it. Okay.

405
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:35,300
So make sure you it's generally a good practice at least two and each data or proc step with a run statement.

406
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,510
Again. You can stop it if it gets stuck or if you just want to hear impatient and can't wait anymore to stop your code.

407
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,110
It's an exclamation. This window here will pop up.

408
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,040
You can cancel submitted statements. Okay.

409
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:03,940
Formatting and sass is very flexible. It's not case sensitive.

410
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,860
Unless, of course, there's already an exception. Unless, of course, you're dealing with something in quotation marks.

411
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,310
So this code right here. Runs exactly the same as this one.

412
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,100
Which runs exactly the same as this one. Okay.

413
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:35,230
I tend to use this one. Just because it takes that little extra effort to hold the shift key down, which is super annoying.

414
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:48,120
So I usually just do this, but you know, it's, it's also not a bad idea to capitalize keywords like data reset.

415
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,130
A lot of people who program in science do that and that's totally cool.

416
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,570
Whatever works for you is fine as long as it's readable.

417
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,590
Which brings me to the next point, which is spacing also doesn't matter in sense.

418
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:11,200
So this code right here would work exactly the same as this one, which would work exactly the same as this hideous mess.

419
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:19,070
Okay. However. Only one of these is really, truly readable.

420
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:28,340
Right. And so we want to get in the habit of organizing our code.

421
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:36,680
Well, and this is kind of a format I like, so I'll start with, you know, my data or track statement.

422
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,270
Any statements that are within that block indent.

423
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:51,730
Right. And I use one statement per line and like this one over here, which kind of lead down the multiple lines.

424
00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:00,320
And then the run finally is back to left justified to show that that's all one big black.

425
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:07,800
It's a nice, easy way to see what your blocks of code are. All right.

426
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:22,940
This is a mess which doesn't use that type of formatting and this is well certainly work, but it is just horrid to look at and and try to read.

427
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,870
Right. This is the same code formatted more nicely.

428
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,830
So it's this or that's much easier to to deal with.

429
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,740
Right. Okay.

430
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,290
So that'll be important. Uh, and your homeworks.

431
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,880
You will be deducted a little bit if you're not doing this, if you're not organizing in a readable way.

432
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:06,160
Okay. Also, if you don't use comments, you may be deducted a little bit on your homeworks because this is really important for.

433
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,840
For the readability of your code as well, especially for someone else reading your code.

434
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:20,500
Or if you. Write some code and then you come back to it a year later and you're trying to remember what you were doing.

435
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,280
It's a really good idea to comment out all the things that that you've done in your code.

436
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,020
Yes. So does that automatically turn green?

437
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,040
Put. Put that in there exactly like it does.

438
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:45,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the way you actually make the comments is to either place text between a star and a semicolon,

439
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:53,790
and if you do that, it will automatically turn green. Or between a forward slash star and a star forward slash.

440
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:02,260
So that's in this first one an example of for it's my star staffer it's less and so you can put multiple stories if you want.

441
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,150
Kind of makes a nice little meat bar.

442
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,790
Here's the other example here with a star and a semicolon at the end.

443
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:23,680
This first, this forward slash version is usually nice for commenting out large sections where the star semicolon.

444
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:28,720
Uh, might be better for, like, a single line. Or if there's an option you're.

445
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,140
You're trying to include and not include, you might just.

446
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,220
Stick a little comment in version of it in there.

447
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:43,030
Okay. So key takeaways.

448
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,500
Programing is. Uh.

449
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,280
Providing sass with a list of instructions. You tell her what to do.

450
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,190
It's only going to do what you do. The three main building blocks.

451
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:09,050
Date and proc steps, statements and options. And careful formatting is very important for reproducibility.

452
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:17,390
And you're could. Okay. And since I'll stamens and in a semicolon, that's the end of the slides.

453
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:26,600
Okay. Anybody have questions? So in a couple of minutes over there.

454
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:33,170
Yes. Does the program save automatically?

455
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:38,300
No, no, it's save it just like you would any other windows type thing.

456
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:44,990
Okay. Hopefully you'll get to that in your lab when you practice a little bit.

457
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,300
That. What's that? You do have left it in it. Yeah.

458
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,150
Huh? You don't literally.

459
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,390
Elvira is one of it is when you actually do that.

460
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:20,690
So you can either send an e-mail to her or me and forwarded on her. I think there's maybe three spots open, maybe in the later sections.

461
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:25,290
Yeah. You know.

462
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:40,440
Oh, my God. Well, if you think you're going to roll and you're going to be able to do that, won't the U.S.?

463
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:48,060
Well, there is, I think, a couple spots available.

464
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:56,760
So just go to one of those late elections and don't worry about it.

465
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:04,709
Hopefully we can get that right on time. And also to land the job.

466
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:10,350
So if you're not concerned about giving the green light.

467
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,510
Was that Elvira Rivera?

468
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:26,360
She's she's the assistant coordinator and she's the one who gives overrides the classes.

469
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:33,260
Okay. Yes. Yeah.

470
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:44,490
I definitely. So.

471
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:54,190
So you're not ready to keep out.

472
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:06,040
I see, she said. You thought it was okay and.

473
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:17,720
Yeah, I have to agree.

474
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,020
Right? Right. Yes. But today since.

475
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,290
Did you know if you're going to be in a morning or. Well, to.

476
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:31,920
To. Okay.

477
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,220
And why don't you send me an email with your name and I'll see what I can do there.

478
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,770
But you can certainly just attend. You can work together.

479
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,500
You can you can get the documents and stuff from your department.

480
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:55,280
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hi.

481
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,820
I'm so tired. Okay.

482
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,500
And, you know, you talk to someone at a pharmaceutical.

483
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,650
Here. Yeah. The side.

484
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:13,630
Right. All we know is our son. I'm refurbishing our little.

485
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:23,100
Okay. You've got to look at all the. I'm just excited to learn it so I can use it in my job, basically.

486
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,990
Right. But it sounds good. Let's make a great.

487
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,570
Me too. Do you have a. Yeah.

488
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,390
Do you know of any issue, existing issues for downloading the virtual site?

489
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,190
Really? Yeah. I'm not aware of the issues.

490
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,280
I can try to clear the command line. Maybe, but. So when you saw when I.

491
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,280
When I use the links provided in. Our clients.

492
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,060
Mm hmm. When I don't want that executive file.

493
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,780
And so and so. And to back. Really?

494
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,260
Yeah. Huh? So it gets almost all the way done.

495
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,260
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure I you.

496
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:37,510
I'm like. Okay.

497
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:43,840
But you have a Windows 11. Yeah. Okay.

498
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,950
I'll have to look into that, I guess. Yeah. So they said they said that they had updated their.

499
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,900
Yeah. I'll work around. All right.

500
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,820
Yeah. Yeah. Let me know if you figure it out or don't.

501
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,010
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
