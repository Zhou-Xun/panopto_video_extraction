1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:17,410
But it's not that they say it's going to change my life now.

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:25,650
You know, I think it was to Yasser Arafat.

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,700
Does it really? I was wondering about this yesterday.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,540
Like, are you okay? You know, like, I don't want to do it.

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,780
I know you can say that helped because one of those issues is actually like God is not going to let it happen.

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,680
So I start, she said once and it started all over my gloves.

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,320
So I left my gloves and then got three out.

8
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:08,310
So she spent the whole lot trying to get something out of my house.

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,840
Yes, I've done everything other than this. Once you figure it out and then.

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:21,550
But I don't like it upsets me in due time.

11
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,280
I would think honestly, I happened. Yeah.

12
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,580
Oh, yeah. I started that. I tried to do that.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,310
I was like it was like, work hard and I'm like, let me grab the ball.

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:53,790
And I'm like, well, I was like, first of all, I don't think I would take, like, 30 minutes because I would like, go on TikTok.

15
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,980
Like I get up one day and ready to roll.

16
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:06,090
I did all that. It's great. I'll find out why I didn't do anything tonight.

17
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm trying to. I don't know if I want to finish up the cereal, cause that's not my style to give us different definitions of security for us.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,360
And right now, it's out in force to do that.

19
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:35,490
And now we developed the idea of cost curves for firms that reflect how their costs of production change and sort of see output changes.

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:45,360
So the first kind of fundamental one is the total cost curve at work in our sort of simple to a point where all the things are capital by definition,

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,790
because their total cost is just like your labor spending and your capital spending.

22
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,720
So W is sort of the wage rate of labor and also not what you want to hire.

23
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,850
And this is what we call the rental rate of capital. So the price of using a unit of capital for some period of time is the amount of units.

24
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:11,069
Then we just got solar costs. The sum of w l was being paid and we think about cost curves.

25
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:20,910
The firm is mean on the underlying assumption that they're using the cost minimizing input bundle, but they are in fact producing in an efficient way.

26
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,360
And we're also have to assume that w indeed those prices reflect sort of the economic cost of those inputs.

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,149
In other words, a firm has to pay them at least as much as they could make in their alternative use.

28
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,790
Otherwise, they're not going to keep the components of the economic cost up.

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,580
From last time we talked about that as being from the perspective of the person or firm who's trying to hire the employee.

30
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,800
I don't discover their opportunity cost of working for me.

31
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:56,070
They're probably not going to stay very long. I don't cover the owner of the capital's opportunity cost of renting it to me.

32
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,310
They're going to use it themselves or rent somebody else instead.

33
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,320
So we're assuming that the input prices reflect sort of the economic cost of those efforts.

34
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,010
I can't for a very long expect to be paying less than that.

35
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,960
Otherwise they would no longer work for me or no longer be rented to me because their owners,

36
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,480
the individual owning their own time or the owner of the piece of capital would find a better use of that resource and having it being employed by me.

37
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:34,330
Yeah. If we think about profitability of firms, we also then have to now for the first time talk about sort of total revenues as well.

38
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,660
So we've kind of been building up to this, starting with the production function she said were so purely technical.

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,910
We just said what are the feasible choices for the firm if it wants to produce a certain number of units of output?

40
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,660
What are the different input combinations that it could feasibly use?

41
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,560
And we talked about those sort of like technical or engineering relationships.

42
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,320
We talked to that point about what it could sell the product for or what the input prices are.

43
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,550
So now reducing input prices and there were also here introduce the price of the final product.

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,900
So total revenue, again, kind of by simple definition is price times quantity.

45
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,770
I sell Q units dollars for a unit. That's my revenue.

46
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,520
The product of price, times quantity. Where do we get quantity?

47
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,820
Now we can keep bringing our production function back in. Quantity is simply determined by our production function.

48
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,270
So we can substitute the production function case F of k l generically for quantity.

49
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,720
Because given that production technology that I have available at how much capital, how high higher,

50
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,460
how much labor I hire, that's going to determine it, determine the amount of quantity that I can actually produce.

51
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,450
So we can relate quantity back to capital and labor using the production function.

52
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,820
So I now see things sort of coming full circle in terms of where this all fits together.

53
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,450
So what are my economic profits? Well, there's something like total revenues might have minus my total costs.

54
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,040
We're going total revenues. Price times quantity. Our total costs are w, l plus VC.

55
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:17,330
So subtracting those out and then we can make this entire profit statement a function of K and L by doing that substitution

56
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,430
we talked about in the last slide of just plugging in the production function for you because that's in fact,

57
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll use the term now the sky gives me a kind of a statement of how my firm's profits vary with the amount of capital labor I hire.

58
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,840
Ever assay. The firm's goal is to make that as big as possible.

59
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,590
They got excessive revenues over costs as large as possible.

60
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,270
So if I want to maximize profits, if I want to actually achieve that, sort of.

61
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,080
One of the things that I ought to be doing is minimizing the cost of producing whatever it is I'm producing.

62
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,410
If I were not choosing the minimum cost way of producing whatever quantity of output I'm producing,

63
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,159
obviously I'm kind of wasting resource input resources.

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,100
I'm spending too much. So if I'm spending more than I had to to produce.

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,549
Q It's not going to help my revenues. But it is going to raise my total costs.

66
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,600
So by definition, I can't have been maximizing profits. So logically,

67
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,700
we're kind of concluding that one of the things the firm needs to do in order to maximize its

68
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,970
profits is it needs to pick the minimum cost input bundle to produce whatever it is producing.

69
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,120
So there are many different ways I can possibly produce something. We have that whole Isaac wants that producing on the Q equals ten.

70
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,560
I want the standard shape. We are that sort of steeper to flatter shape, like a standard indifference curve.

71
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,760
That tells me there's a lot of different capital labor combinations that I can use.

72
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,240
Some of those are probably going to be more expensive than others.

73
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,400
So I better not be picking the more expensive one if my goal is to maximize profits.

74
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,650
So that's part of my profit maximization problem is actually a cost minimization problem.

75
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,910
If I'm not minimizing my costs of producing whatever level of output I'm producing, I'm wasting profit opportunities.

76
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,890
So now how can we characterize what the cost minimizing bundle looks like?

77
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:22,450
So we now have the sort of framework. We begin to begin to introduce input prices.

78
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,600
What is the cheapest way that I can produce a certain level?

79
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:38,560
And so again, if we talk about our Q equals ten, Isaac, what that shows me all the technically efficient ways of producing ten units of output.

80
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:49,040
Technically efficient in the sense that. So I started some input bundle like this.

81
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:58,280
Suppose I want to use less capital. I could do that, but I need to then use more labor.

82
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,890
There is. There's no way that I can produce ten units of output using less of both inputs.

83
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,750
So that's what all I mean by technically efficient. I'm not sort of literally throwing inputs away, you know?

84
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,280
Yeah, I could use less capital, but then I have to use more labor. I can use less labor, but then I have to use more capital.

85
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,320
There's no way that I can use less of both inputs and still produce ten units of my product.

86
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,930
So that's all it means to be technically efficient. Since in this graph, we haven't yet introduced the idea of what these inputs cost me,

87
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:41,750
you can't say which of these bundles is economically efficient, which is the cost minimizing way of producing ten units of output.

88
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,400
This by law might be more expensive than this bundle, or it might be the opposite of if labor is relatively cheap compared to capital.

89
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,010
This bundle might be cheaper. So all these models are technically efficient.

90
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,999
I can't produce ten units of output using less of both inputs.

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,050
If I use less of one, I have to use more of the other.

92
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,480
But they're not necessarily all economically efficient. Some might be more costly than others.

93
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,400
So now we're going to add sort of a second tool. So what are the curve look like when you first saw it?

94
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,290
What did remind you of way back at the beginning of first week class?

95
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,850
Like in a different story. And we interpreted it very much like we even interpreted the slogan the same way.

96
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,770
Give it the same name. We just threw the word technical into it. But marginal rate of technical substitutions.

97
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,020
Substitutions. We're not going to get from a second tool that's going to look a lot like.

98
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,430
So if you had indifference curves, what else was on that graph? We're maximizing utility.

99
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,200
What is the other marginal rate of substitution?

100
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,560
What was the other grab the other curve or line that was on their budget?

101
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,980
Is that so? We're not going to have something that looks a lot like a budget constraint.

102
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,720
We're talk about where it's similar and where it's different, but it sort of looks like that.

103
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:13,549
So for example, any input bundle that satisfies that equation, it's going to cost exactly $100.

104
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:21,440
So given my input prices, any labor and capital combination, satisfying that equation is going to cost $200.

105
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,210
So we're trying K on the Y axis. So let's solve this for K.

106
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:35,209
And so if we solve that equation for K, we end up with tables 100 divided by V minus W over v,

107
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,930
divided by l l remember what our budget constraint looks like.

108
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,059
It's all kind of similar. So we said, well, you know, if I had, say, $100 of income,

109
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:17,260
the intercept would be $100 divided by the price of why here I'm spending $100 on graphing all the different input bundles that cost $200.

110
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,310
What's the intercept? 100 divided by the price of the Y good.

111
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,850
Which in this case is capital. Capital input.

112
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,950
So that intercept is really just the same advertising terms of how we interpret it.

113
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:38,230
What are the what was the slope? The slope of the budget constraint was the price ratio negative of the price ratio.

114
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:50,530
What's the slope? The negative of the input price? The ratio? Negative W over v so you can interpret the intercept and the slope exactly like

115
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,430
we did or interpreted the intercept and the slope of the budget constraint.

116
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,329
So the intercept to the wider sub essentially says,

117
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:05,830
if I was spending $100 on inputs and I spent it all on capital, how many units of capital could I buy for $100?

118
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,939
100 divided by three? The price of capital, just like the Y intercept of the budget constraints as well.

119
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,550
If I have $100 to spend, that was my income and I only spent it on good y.

120
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:29,410
How many units could I buy? 100 divided by y as a slope is sort of that relative tradeoff in the marketplace between the two goods negative x over

121
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,930
Y for the budget constraint negative W over B to the input price ratio is the slope of the I supply or ISO plus line.

122
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,640
So let's jump ahead here and let's see how this firm would minimize its input costs.

123
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:57,610
Suppose it decides what it wants to do as it wants to produce ten units of output and says, Well, I've got all these different ways I could do it.

124
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:57,910
I could.

125
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:08,469
For example, produce ten units of output using that input, bundle that input, bundle that input, bundle that one, that one for any other input.

126
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,250
Bundle that lies on. Q equals terrorism.

127
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,190
What? What's the cheapest possible way?

128
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,000
So we're going to take a stab at it again, to pick an analogy, the utility maximizing, what was the consumer's equilibrium model?

129
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,540
It would be work start star because it's tangent to the like.

130
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,290
The ISO is tangent to the iso cost. Yeah.

131
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,370
Because. We could try and.

132
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,230
A whole bunch of ISO class lines. Right.

133
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,450
As many as we wanted. Okay. I would love to be on this ISO coastline.

134
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,540
What's the problem? No curve there. Yeah.

135
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,059
I decided to produce ten units of output. There's no input bundle on the side.

136
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,390
So cost line that allows me to produce ten units of output.

137
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,770
Why would I ever want to be on this side? So costs like to produce ten units of output.

138
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,320
Each also costs lives more and more dollars. Just like if you have different budget constraints,

139
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,460
the budget constraints further from the origin or higher incomes and ISO costs line further from the origin means I'm spending more dollars.

140
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,709
So now you see a little difference already between consumer and producer, because the consumer would love to have a higher budget constraint.

141
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,030
They want to be far from the origin because they're trying to maximize utility.

142
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,349
The firm is trying to minimize costs. They want to get closer and closer to the origin.

143
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,510
They want to spend less. So for a consumer, where do you want to go?

144
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,370
You want to go in that direction is you're trying to maximize your utility, a firm, trying to minimize costs.

145
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,630
They want to go in that direction because they want to spend as little as possible.

146
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,840
They would love to be on this ISO cost slide. Unfortunately, that's not technically feasible.

147
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:04,540
There's no technically feasible way of producing ten units of output and spending only that much money.

148
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,409
So let's say they started here at that bundle.

149
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,110
Okay. Double star. L Double star.

150
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:21,300
We could kind of make an analogous argument to what we did for utility maximization to say, Well, that can't possibly be the best they could do.

151
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:33,299
Is there the marginal rate of technical substitution, the absolute value of the slope of the ice of want is greater than the input price ratio,

152
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,920
the absolute value, the slope of the ISO cost slide. So for example, they could cut down capital just a little bit.

153
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,930
They would then have to hire more labor and they have to sequence all technically efficient.

154
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,990
So if they cut capital, they have to add labor. We can't simply cut everything and still produce ten units of output.

155
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:03,150
But wait a second. If they did that, if they made that move. They retain the lower ISO coastline.

156
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,500
So clearly that new input bundle that I've drawn there is better than the original one.

157
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:19,440
It's still not the best, though. So said the best is when you substitute all the way down to here.

158
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,810
So that's the cost minimizing input on all these at that point.

159
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,620
So while the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal to the input price ratio, those things are in balance.

160
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,060
I can't do any better if I make any other change that's going to move me back to a higher ISO cost line.

161
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,500
So the cost minimizing input by law with our sort of standard shaped isopods is going to be characterized by a tangent.

162
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:55,640
See, just like the utility maximizing input bundle is characterized by a tangent see between difference curve and a budget constraint.

163
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,019
And the only difference is the firms trying to go down towards the origin.

164
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:07,640
Where is the consumers trying to go? Up away from the origin. So the direction is different because it's minimization rather than maximization.

165
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,880
The firm would love to be on this slice of cost line.

166
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,630
But unless they can figure out a way to make their production process a lot more efficient than the current technology allows, you know,

167
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,420
if they could do R&D and improve the production process like we saw when we talked to our production functions,

168
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,390
that you're going to, you know, if you could develop a more efficient process, then you can move.

169
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,200
Nice it wants towards the origin. You can produce ten units of output using less inputs, but currently that's not feasible.

170
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,290
Certainly this is the technology we're stuck with,

171
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,759
so the best we can do with that technology is attain whatever total costs are associated with that ISO cost line.

172
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,190
So we call that total cost. We want some amount of dollars, $300.

173
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,930
That would then give us one point on this firm's total cost curve.

174
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,860
We mean by that is that if this would tell us that if this firm wants to produce ten units of output,

175
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,830
the lowest possible total cost that I could do that at is $100.

176
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,149
So if we're starting to draw out a total cost curve, we'd say, well, we've got one point.

177
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,470
You got quantity in this axis, the official total cost of production.

178
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,640
The total cost curve assumes you're being efficient. You're making this cost minimizing choice.

179
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,090
It just illustrated so well, there's the first point.

180
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,900
We then repeated that for say, the Q equals 20. I squat and say, well, what's the cost minimizing way of producing 20 units of output?

181
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,160
And then how many dollars is associated with that lowest ISO cost line that we could attain that would give us a second point.

182
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:06,319
So maybe that point would be. 20 and 200 or maybe 20 and to 50.

183
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,650
If we're getting less efficient, we'll see turns to scale.

184
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,430
And we find that with respect to cost curves, we see right now, if we double the cost and we double the output,

185
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,650
it kind of says that this firm has constant returns to scale over this range.

186
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:31,209
It's not really getting more or less efficient. That have been, say, 150, you would say, well, wait a sec, redouble our output and roll it.

187
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,470
Raising our input cost by $50. We're becoming more efficient as we scale up.

188
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,450
So that firm would have increasing returns and we'll see that little more. The insiders who get that kind of excess,

189
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:52,479
the terms of how we get a point in the cost curve is at a point on demand curve was derived from a particular utility maximizing bundle a point.

190
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,780
Our total cost curve is derived for a particular cost minimizing bundle.

191
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:05,050
There's a point by point correspondence. If it's like there's a point on the capital cost curve that was derived from a graph like this conceptually.

192
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,589
So we already kind of talked about this. Firms want the high consumers want the highest possible indifference curve.

193
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,610
They want to move away from the origin. Firms want the lowest possible ISO cost line.

194
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:26,560
They want ideally move back towards the origin. Okay.

195
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,780
Now what if input prices change? So we talked about utility maximization.

196
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,360
One of the factors they look at is what happens if the price changes.

197
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,390
We saw the budget constraint pivot to price change and then consumers would change,

198
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,500
would respond to that by choosing a different utility maximizing bundle.

199
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,450
They would substitute towards the bundle. It became relatively cheap away from the want it become.

200
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,090
Rather became relatively expensive due to the price change.

201
00:21:52,750 --> 00:22:00,280
Then we also talked about an income effect that if, say, a price went up and it was a normal good, well, that price going up makes you poorer.

202
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:08,799
You buy less of it because you're poor. And the sort of net effect on consumption is that some of those substitution and income offsets swing.

203
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:17,420
See something similar here? We've got change in prices. So let's say labor becomes more expensive.

204
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:26,330
So originally we had this was $100 ISO coastline.

205
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,819
That was the efficient way. Of generating the original quantity.

206
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:41,770
I call that old quantity. And now, just for the sake of argument, let's imagine this is a stubborn firm and this firm says, you know what,

207
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:49,450
we're still going to keep spending $100 even after the price of labor went up and to keep producing the old $100.

208
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,129
No way, because now labor has become more expensive.

209
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,020
The hundred dollar Isaac cost line.

210
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:05,080
It's going to have the same capital intercept because we haven't changed the price of capital, but the labor intercept is going to be smaller.

211
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:15,090
That's going to be a steeper curve. So if this firm was stubborn and said, you know what, I refuse to spend more than $100 on inputs,

212
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,450
despite the fact that labor is more expensive, it's going to have to accept a lower level of output.

213
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,600
It's got to move to a lower.

214
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:29,160
I support there's no way it could keep producing the old quantity and kind of spend $800 if it's going to keep spending $100.

215
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,990
It's got to produce a lower quality.

216
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:42,389
So that's one way of sort of thinking about how the how that input model might change, how realistically a firm might not be so stubborn.

217
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,490
They might say they might be stubborn in the opposite way.

218
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,650
They might say, well, I'm going to keep producing the old quantity and I'm just going to eat the larger costs.

219
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,430
Or more, maybe more realistically, it might do something in between, I might say,

220
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,600
but I'm going to be stuck spending more than $100, and I bet I'm not going to quite produce as much as I used to produce.

221
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,530
So I'll probably be somewhere in the middle of the profit maximize, which is sort of.

222
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,560
Graphically. They kind of just make it easy.

223
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:18,740
Let's start with this scenario where the firm said, Well, I'm going to keep spending $100, therefore I gonna have to sacrifice output.

224
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:27,290
That's one scenario. Another scenario might be, well, what if I to spend more money?

225
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,130
But as I say, I refuse to reduce my output.

226
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,370
So think of those as the two extreme responses. Probably neither of them.

227
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,780
Probably somewhere in between that. So there is the.

228
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,230
A new $100 ISO coastline.

229
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:04,090
So that's the last graph. That's the graph from the last slide and filling in that is actually filling in this lower line here on the last graph.

230
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,960
Now, if I want to keep reducing the old quantity, I'm going to have to spend more.

231
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,560
What's the efficient way of producing the old quantity of the new prices?

232
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,760
I want to sort of keep pushing out that ISO cost line until it just touches the original supply.

233
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,990
I wouldn't want to go all the way up to here. For example, I'd be wasting money.

234
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,470
But the very cheapest way that I could keep producing the old quantity at the new prices is that.

235
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:44,770
Let's look at you, will l you. So those are sort of two extreme potential responses of the firm to the higher price of labor.

236
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,060
And we will ask GRAFF It was I refuse to spend more than $100.

237
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:56,410
Therefore, I have to move to a lower. I want. This one, I refuse to reduce my my output.

238
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,260
I'm going to have to be willing to move to a higher ISO cost to spend more money because one of the inputs is not more expensive.

239
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,830
And again, real, real scenarios is probably gonna be somewhere between just probably on both margins.

240
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:16,810
Most real scenario is if I spend more than $100 now and produce less than the old output one after, they sort of re optimize everything.

241
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:27,870
Any questions about this before I move on? Not the most exciting stuff isn't.

242
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:40,580
All right. So how does my input use change if I now want to expand my output, if I want to produce on a higher ISO quad?

243
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,840
So now suppose we're holding input prices constant and the only thing we're changing is what I want I've decided to achieve.

244
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,580
So we talked about sort of point by point the total cost curve.

245
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,190
Each point on the total cost curve is derived from a particular cost minimizing input bundle.

246
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,960
Now kind of put that together. By tracing what we call the expansion path.

247
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,610
The expansion path is just sort of the set of cost minimizing input combinations

248
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,890
to produce higher and higher levels of output at a fixed set of input prices.

249
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:28,560
Okay. So suppose the expansion path looks like this. All we're doing is we're connecting these tangent points.

250
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,720
You could imagine doing this for a whole bunch of other commodities.

251
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,550
If we did that a thousand times, we'd eventually draw this line.

252
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,520
So in this case, it says that the ratio of capital to labor is independent of output.

253
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,159
The cost minimizing input by nil always has the same ratio of capital to labor.

254
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,870
In other words, expansion path is just a straight line. It doesn't have to be that case.

255
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:09,010
Just in this case, it is. It says we're always going to use as we, you know, with the fixed input costs.

256
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,209
So all these lines are parallel. All the ISO cost lines are parallel to each other.

257
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:18,340
So the input costs are not changing. Normally over V is constant in the cost.

258
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,740
Minimizing input bundle in this case is always going to increase capital and labor in the same proportion.

259
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,630
So say one worker to one machine. We always have one worker to one machine.

260
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:37,570
It doesn't have to be the case. We could have an expansion that the say looks like this and this says that the firm

261
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,410
is becoming more capital intensive as it gets bigger are more labor intensive.

262
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,920
Capital for capital intensive is we're getting for they have a ratio of capital to labor.

263
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,639
This expansion path is getting steeper and steeper and steeper.

264
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,950
So as my firm gets larger, I increase my capital by a lot, my labor by only a little bit.

265
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:05,720
And it's even possible to have it sort of bend backward. And the labor might even be what we call an inferior input beyond a certain point.

266
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,480
So imagine you're making a product like automobiles and you're only going to make ten of them a year.

267
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,100
What do you think the most efficient production process would be to make ten cars?

268
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:24,010
Probably a very inefficient to make only ten cars a year. But if you were to make just ten, would you buy all types of robotics?

269
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,799
Or would you just hire skilled tradespeople? Exactly.

270
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,450
Because you get all these robotics and it's just sitting there all year to make ten cars and you're barely using it, but you have to pay for it.

271
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,280
So probably if I'm only going to make ten cars, all the seats are going to be hand-stitched.

272
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,390
It's going to be painted by a person with a sprayer, not by a robot.

273
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,790
You're not going to have a big assembly line where machinery is going to move the door panels in for me,

274
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:01,210
or I'm going to have a couple of workers carry that door panel and then place it and have a couple of workers do that.

275
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,420
So probably the efficient way of building ten cars a year would be to use a lot of workers relative to machinery.

276
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,880
Now, what if I'm building 5 million cars a year?

277
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,380
Well, my worker. Stay away from that door, panel. Let's walk it over here.

278
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:28,420
Let's stitch the seat by hand. That sounds like it's probably the lowest cost way of producing 5 million cars a year.

279
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,280
It sounds really stupid, doesn't it? So probably it's a much more capital intensive process when building that scale.

280
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,210
I want an automatic assembly line that's moving the door panel for me.

281
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,330
Then all the worker has to do is grab it off the assembly line when it arrives at the right spot and put it off.

282
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,850
You don't have to walk over there and carry it by hand. I probably want a painting robot.

283
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,390
I probably want a stitching robot to stitch the seats.

284
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,000
So as I get to a larger scale of output, I'm getting a more capital intensive process.

285
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:12,690
The cheapest way of producing many cars per year is to use a lot of automation, a lot of machinery, a lot of robotics and relatively few workers.

286
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,030
The cheapest way of building a few cars per year is probably not to use any robotics at all.

287
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:28,220
And use workers and with minimal tools like a sprayer for the paint and some wrenches and things like that.

288
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:36,920
Okay. So the capital, the the ideal role of process might be more or less capital intensive as output scales up.

289
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:45,450
So in other words, it doesn't have to be like this. All right.

290
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,660
So we talked about the different cost concepts last time.

291
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:55,440
So know how to distinguish those. And then we today finished up by saying, well,

292
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:05,160
the most efficient input bundle is the one that allows the firm to produce whatever level of output it decides to produce in the lowest cost way.

293
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:13,470
So all the input bundles on the ice support are technically efficient, but generally only one of them is going to be economically efficient.

294
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,960
So with our standard shaped isopods, there's going to be that unique tangent see point where say, well, that she,

295
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:26,700
given the current input prices, the cheapest way of producing ten units of output is one specific bundle on that on that isopod.

296
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:37,060
All the others are more expensive. And then that afternoon football can change when either I decide to change my level of output.

297
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,320
If I want to produce more, I'm going to use more inputs.

298
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,650
And then that expansion path kind of told me how much more inputs and would it be in the same mix or a different mix than I started with?

299
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,510
Or if an input price changes, if the cost lines pivot.

300
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:05,110
Any questions before we move on? We deal with effects similar to the substitution in income effects on these graphs as well.

301
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,070
Capital. We could we probably won't really.

302
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,010
And I don't think it's terribly, terribly intuitive as it really has a lot of damage.

303
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,230
But you could say, well, the equivalent of the income effect is moving to a different level of output.

304
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:27,330
Right. The different ice acquired is kind of like a different indifference curve because just in the graphical mechanics of it,

305
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:34,260
not quite interpretation here, but in terms of the mechanics and then moving to different ice,

306
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,419
the cost line is kind of like moving to a different input and different income

307
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,260
level because that's kind of the graphical analog to the budget constraint.

308
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,510
I think sort of less intuitive in this case. The whole figure really adds too much.

309
00:33:48,510 --> 00:34:14,350
So we we'll go down that rabbit hole. Talk about some more definitions of costs.

310
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:19,210
I'm sorry. Economics definitions are kind of boring. You get there.

311
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,419
And they want to talk about returns to scale. So that's something I just alluded to a little bit when we talked about those different

312
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,300
cost minimizing input bundles and how they translate into points in the total cost curve.

313
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:37,180
And finally, we're going to distinguish between. So what we mean by a short run situation versus a long situation.

314
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,600
So it's kind of three specific things in the set of notes.

315
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,429
So as we saw a few minutes ago,

316
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:52,920
the cost minimizing input bundle is a tangential and I want to add ISO cost line when we have our standard shaped ISO class.

317
00:34:54,110 --> 00:35:00,050
And then change in quantity. Moving to a higher or lower ISO client is going to change the minimum cost of production.

318
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,840
And then point by point, we can translate that. How many units of output is on the price of what?

319
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:12,080
How many dollars is associated with the lowest possible ISO cost line into a potential cost curve?

320
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,590
We could do that infinite number of times and have the expansion pass and then almost every single

321
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,970
point of that expansion pass could then be translated into a point on the total cost curve,

322
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,150
just like we can again demand curve from a series of utility maximizing bundles.

323
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,620
We could imagine changing the price, for example, to go ahead and trace out the demand curve.

324
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,400
So our kind of three basic types of costs that will be graphing total costs.

325
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,180
We already kind of gave a definition of in terms of the sum of the input costs when

326
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,770
I'm taking the cost minimizing input bundle and then from the total cost curve,

327
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,919
we can derive the average cost curve. That's pretty easy.

328
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:05,670
It's just total cost divided by quantity, cost per unit. What is my input cost per unit and how does that change as my scale changes over time?

329
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,699
So go back to the auto example.

330
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,680
What do you think would be more efficient on a cost per car produced that ten car per year operation or the 5 million car per year operation?

331
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,200
You would think the ten car for your operation more efficient for the car at a lower cost?

332
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,320
No. And that's probably why we don't see a lot of ten. Car per year manufacturers.

333
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:39,510
If that were the more efficient one, we wouldn't have GM and Ford and Toyota and VW.

334
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,410
We would have thousands and thousands of little tiny auto manufacturers operating out of their home garage.

335
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,130
If that were the most of it. So basically the structure of the industry sort of gives us the answer to that question.

336
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,070
If it really were more efficient to build just ten cars a year, there would be a gazillion tiny auto manufacturers.

337
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:07,670
So we don't we have a handful of really big ones. The fact that we have a handful of really big ones probably is enough for us to infer that, yeah,

338
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:15,570
that probably is a more efficient way of producing cars or to produce 5 million cars a year at a lower cost

339
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:24,000
per unit than 500,000 different companies making ten cars per year would also produce 5 million cars,

340
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,659
but the cost per unit would be a lot higher. If it weren't.

341
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,850
We'd observe that that reality of the world that we have 500,000 little tiny car manufacturers.

342
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:39,450
You know, I'd be making cars out of my garage. The fact that I don't make cars out of my garage is probably a good inference.

343
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:46,080
That wouldn't be a very efficient way of doing business. Four could really beat me on price.

344
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,770
Then marginal costs will also derive from total cost, and that's just the slope of the total cost curve.

345
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,870
So we're graphing the slope of the total cost curve and then we get marginal cost.

346
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:05,310
And that's just tells us how much additional input costs do I have to incur to produce one more unit?

347
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,840
I told you would be a lot of definitions. Yeah, I agree with you.

348
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:22,340
So I fixed costs. Fixed costs are costs that don't change as output changes.

349
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,030
You have an example of a fixed cost of buildings and buildings.

350
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:36,840
So ability once you have it, once you have that building in place and you decide to maybe, you know,

351
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,940
you've got a factory and you're running two shifts and now you're going to side to run three shifts.

352
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:49,640
That doesn't increase the cost of the factory increases the cost of labor, increases the cost of utilities, increases the cost of raw materials.

353
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:56,960
Those are all things we call variable costs. If I decide to run three shifts rather than two in that factory, those are all going to go up.

354
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,670
But the cost of the building is the same.

355
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,910
If I run zero shifts, one shift, two shifts or three shifts if I run weekends, or if I only run five days a week.

356
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:21,380
Short run costs. So we defined the short run not as sort of a specific amount of time because it can vary by production process.

357
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,829
Think of it as the time period in which I'm stuck with at least the level of one input that I have.

358
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,390
I can't change at least one input. So think of that building as another great example.

359
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,970
Suppose that I decided now I want to go from two shifts to three.

360
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,790
And as a matter of fact, my business is going so great. I actually want to go to four shifts because I can't put four shifts in one building.

361
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:54,980
I got to get a new building now. A new factory. Can I just snap my fingers and suddenly I've got a new factory?

362
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,130
So if he decides who wants to build a new factory, how long do you think it would be from making that decision yet?

363
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,770
We're going to go ahead with this new factory project, too, when the first car rolls off the line of the new factory.

364
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:17,900
One month for three year. Two or three years, probably minimum, even for two or three years.

365
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,860
Think about the logistics. Okay, so I got to get a location. Okay.

366
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:28,950
So maybe I already own some land. Okay, that's great. I got the location, but then I've got to get the architecture.

367
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:35,870
I've got to. Or, you know, I've got to get whatever permits I need from the local authorities to build it.

368
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:44,420
I've got to then hire contractors. I've got to get all the materials it takes to put the building up.

369
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,010
I've got to build it. And it's got to at various stages, it's got to pass inspection.

370
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,530
So I've got to stop till the inspectors come and say, okay, you're okay here and move on to the next step.

371
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,800
Then I've got to get all the equipment. Two or three years.

372
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,100
Probably is a best case scenario for a big factory.

373
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,620
You know, four or five might be more likely.

374
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:15,780
So for that type of production process, you'd say I'm probably in the short run for multiple years because the amount of capital I have in this case,

375
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,650
that number of factories I have, if I were to decide to change it, it would take me multiple years to accomplish that.

376
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:30,060
Now, what if my business is a lemonade stand? What's my capital stock if I have a lemonade stand on my front yard?

377
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,380
Some would share a share table. A table?

378
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,620
What else? A sign. Sign. A picture.

379
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,730
A spoon? Yeah, that's my capital stock.

380
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,180
Those are the fixed things. Those right? Durable goods that I can use over and over again.

381
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,750
Think about my variable inputs. Water, lemons, sugar, and the cups.

382
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,540
The Dixie cups and the lemonade. And those are all my variable inputs.

383
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:05,020
Now, what if I have a lemonade stand and I see that while the cars are just lining up to buy my lemonade?

384
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:13,390
How long would it take me to increase my capital stock to get more pictures, more spoons, another table and other chair?

385
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,340
No water to take me to get more lemons and more water and more sugar.

386
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,470
So in that production process, there's really no meaningful difference between the short run in the long run.

387
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,200
If I were to decide to increase my capital stock, I could do that just as rapidly as increasing.

388
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,480
Lemons in the water and sugar. So in other words, it's not a magic thing.

389
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,860
Well, you know, if it's a year, you're in the short run, if it's two years in the long run.

390
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,820
You know, it depends on the production process before it.

391
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,630
It's probably multiple years before they could freely variable all of their inputs.

392
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:57,610
The lemonade stand. I could do that with one trip to Walmart. Jump ahead to the picture.

393
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,600
So here are some different types of returns to scale and how they would be reflected in total across curves.

394
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,670
I already kind of gave an example of constant returns when you do those two points and say, Well,

395
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,450
if it costs me $100 to produce ten cars, ten years of output, that might minimum cost and it was 200 to produce 20.

396
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:27,050
I said, Well, the soon to be concert returns to scale. I doubled my output and it's going to cost me exactly twice as much.

397
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,060
I'm not really becoming more efficient as I scale up, but I'm not becoming less efficient either.

398
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:41,089
Okay, so we have a total cost curve. That's a straight line. So if we say what's the efficient way of organizing this industry?

399
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:48,110
What do we want to have, say, one big firm or two smaller firms, each producing half of the half as much?

400
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,410
And the answer is, from an efficiency perspective, it doesn't matter.

401
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,770
But what if we have a total cost curve that gets steeper and steeper and steeper and steeper as output goes up?

402
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,750
Does that look like that industry is becoming more efficient or less efficient as it scales up?

403
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,320
For less efficient. Less efficient? Yeah. Because we're thinking of.

404
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,220
Originally costs go up gradually with output and then costs go up faster and faster and

405
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,890
faster and faster with output so that that firm would have decreasing returns to scale.

406
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:33,860
So there we would expect that industry to probably be organized in having a bunch of small firms because one big firm would be really inefficient.

407
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,389
What if it had the opposite relationship where total costs got flatter and flatter?

408
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:47,240
Flatter, say, well, one big firm would be more efficient than a bunch of little firms.

409
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:55,460
So if we say Wipro's 100 units and total in the industry, having ten firms producing ten units is better than having one firm producing.

410
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:03,290
Having one firm cruising 100 units would be better than having ten producing tonnage because that big firm is more efficient.

411
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:10,559
Costs are going up more and more and more slowly. As the industry expands so that we kind of like auto industry.

412
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,750
Why we don't have to have 500,000 auto manufacturers building ten cars a year in their own garage.

413
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,550
And then we have one that. Kind of combines the two.

414
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,450
What does it look like? Sort of over this range in output?

415
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:34,170
What type of returns to scale if you were just looking at that range of output and increasing that increase?

416
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,750
Exactly. It looks like this. This is what we say. We're getting more efficient as we get bigger and bigger and bigger.

417
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,540
But that doesn't last forever. What if you only looked at that piece of the total cost curve?

418
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,580
What type of returns? Skills that look like increase?

419
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:54,840
Yeah. So we have a situation where there are some opportunities to become more efficient as we scale up.

420
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:04,440
So the specialization story we told with the cooks in the kitchen, I have a very small restaurant.

421
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:13,680
I can only have one to cook in the kitchen, be too costly to hire two people for such a small restaurant, but that one cook has to do everything.

422
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,150
If we had a little bigger restaurant, we can hire multiple cooks and we can have some specialized tasks,

423
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,340
and it's more efficient to have them specialize their tasks about one cook doing everything.

424
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:33,090
So there are opportunities for us to become more efficient as we scale up from very small outputs to somewhat bigger outputs.

425
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:41,440
Eventually we've exhausted those opportunities to become much more efficient and now running a bigger and bigger and bigger restaurant.

426
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:51,220
We have to have multiple layers of middle management, multiple layers of supervision, more training and more complex organization to run.

427
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:57,040
It might become less efficient. 5000 Table Restaurant.

428
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,950
Who wants to manage a 5000 table restaurant? I'm offering you that for your first job out of grad school.

429
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,640
That's not like a fun job. I don't want any part of that.

430
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,720
You're probably not looking for a restaurant. Chelsea Hospital's who wants to manage a 10,000 bed hospital.

431
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,610
Would you rather manage a 500 bed hospital? For sure.

432
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,350
So we call that optimal scale type returns to scale.

433
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,260
And we'll see in a moment sort of what we mean by optimal scale when we look at the average cost curve.

434
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,800
From each of these total cost curves, we can derive what the average or marginal cost curves look like.

435
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,020
So remember, it costs the returns to scale. The total cost curve looks like this straight line.

436
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,350
So marginal cost is constant straight line by definition.

437
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:02,550
It's the same slope everywhere. So if we graph the slope of that.

438
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,080
It's going to be considered average cost is cost per unit.

439
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,130
If the marginal cost of each and every unit we produce is the same.

440
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,330
The average cost of all the units we produce should also be the same. Right.

441
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:28,070
So average of marginal cost would just be. Constant that is horizontal and they kind of way at the same point.

442
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:34,650
So like if the slope of this was. One.

443
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,510
I would say the marginal cost of each and every unit produced is one.

444
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:53,509
So for example, there's five and five would be on that one and one would be on that total cost curve.

445
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:59,600
Ten and ten. What's the cost per unit? If I produce ten units, $10 divided by ten units is a dollar.

446
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,980
The five units, $5 of over five is a dollar. One unit dollar cost divided by one unit it's a dollar.

447
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,310
What's the marginal cost of the first unit? Well, I spent $1 to produce one and I spent zero to produce nothing.

448
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,010
The added cost of that first unit is a dollar. It's a marginal cost to the 10th units.

449
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,370
If I produced nine, it would cost me $9.

450
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,850
So my costs go up by $1 to produce that 10th unit.

451
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:34,900
The marginal cost again stays at one. So that's kind of the very simplest case where the total cost curve is linear, constant returns to scale,

452
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:39,650
marginal average cost are going to be horizontal and they're going to be right on top of each other.

453
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:46,700
This is just the first derivative of that curve. So the marginal cost is the first derivative.

454
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,860
So those are calculus. The first derivative of any function is the slope of that function.

455
00:49:52,490 --> 00:50:02,069
So if we had in this case. But the equation that one of its equals.

456
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:07,980
Q That's the equation of the total cost curve because it has a slope of one.

457
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,610
So you convince yourself of that if I plugged in quantity of one over total cost of one.

458
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,640
Yeah. That's that point of a quantity of five over total cost. Two five.

459
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:23,920
Yep. That's that point. What's the what's the first derivative of the equation?

460
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,540
T. C equals Q. One is our power rule.

461
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:42,169
It's really cute of the one. Well, you multiply the coefficient of one by the exponent of one, so got one and then you subtract one from the exponent.

462
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:48,650
Q Two to the zero is one, so the marginal cost is equal to one.

463
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:54,139
So those you have in our calculus, don't worry about that, but you have had calculus.

464
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:59,240
That's sort of the intuition of it. The marginal cost is just the graph of the first derivative and total cost curve.

465
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,090
So super simple in t c equals Q because then C is just equal to one.

466
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,390
Okay, now let's look at the decreasing returns to scale and then a total cost curve that looks like this.

467
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:25,470
So we see that marginal cost is rising. The draw a tangent line down here, tangent line here.

468
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,179
Right. And your line here. So if you have an hour calculus, you do the geometry.

469
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,350
What we're really just graphing is the slope of the tangent lines as quantity increases.

470
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:40,100
Those tangent lines are getting. Steeper and steeper and steeper.

471
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,560
So marginal cost. Has to be rising.

472
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,300
Decreasing insurance to scale and becoming less efficient as I scale up my operations.

473
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,670
The added input costs to produce one more unit go up as I produce more and more units.

474
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:08,240
That's also going to pull up the average cost, but the average cost is going to stay below.

475
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:15,980
The marginal cost is on a per unit basis. The average still has the benefit of those early units that were cheaper than the more recent units.

476
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:23,270
So average cost is also going to go up. You can think of the average cost as being as Q overall.

477
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:35,490
So you can think of average cost as just being. The slope of those lines.

478
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:45,140
I guess this is queue up. See that getting steeper and steeper.

479
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:51,750
So the cost per unit is going up. Increasing returns if decreasing looks like that.

480
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:04,460
Increasing is going to look exactly the opposite of it. They're both declining, but the average is higher than the marginal decreasing returns.

481
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,430
So there is our decreasing returns. Sorry, it's getting a little messy, but it's getting flatter and flatter.

482
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,830
So if we graph the slope of that curve, you see the slope is going down and down and down and down and down.

483
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,900
Now, if we think about cost per unit, what were the most expensive units?

484
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,729
The first units are the last units. The first were the most expensive.

485
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:52,880
So in this case, the average is always going to be stuck with the fact that those first units are more expensive than the more recent units.

486
00:53:53,420 --> 00:54:00,889
So adding units is definitely going to pull the average down, but the average is going to stay above the marginal cost because the average is

487
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:04,760
still stuck with the most expensive units that we had to produce at the beginning.

488
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:11,750
Okay, now let's go to the optimal scale and see why we call it that.

489
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,030
Let's just look at this piece.

490
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:29,520
So from around the total cost curve, we said. The total cost curve had this sort of shape.

491
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:36,990
And we just look at this beginning piece. Well, it looked like the increasing returns scale.

492
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,070
So then the average or marginal costs are going to look like increasing to.

493
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:55,160
It looks like that we see that they're both declining and we see that the average cost is above the marginal cost kind of shade on the average.

494
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:03,490
So you can see which one the average is. So black is marginal costs and red is the average cost.

495
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,890
But now we get to these large units of output.

496
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,540
And it looks like that. It's like the total cost curve.

497
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,870
We said, well, that increasing total cost curve.

498
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,650
If you just look at this piece, it looks like that.

499
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,050
So we've got the marginal is above the average and they're both rising.

500
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:41,810
The reason we call this optimal scale is that there is a particular finite, non-zero quantity you starve that minimizes the cost per unit.

501
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:50,810
There's one specific quantity that is what we call the optimal scale, the cheapest per unit way of producing this product.

502
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,870
Okay, what's the cheapest per unit quantity for constant returns?

503
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:05,620
Back to this one. It doesn't matter, right?

504
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,880
They're all exactly the same. The average cost per unit is one, regardless of how many years we produce.

505
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,470
So as what's the most efficient way of producing in terms of lowest cost per unit?

506
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:26,490
It doesn't matter. Any quantity is the same. What's the cheapest cost per unit when there's decreasing returns?

507
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:37,380
Zero. So infinitesimally small. So the cheapest way of producing this product would have a gazillion, teeny, tiny, teeny, tiny firms.

508
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,580
What's the cheapest cost per unit when there is increasing returns in the vicinity?

509
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,260
Right. Because if there's always increasing returns, this is always going to go down.

510
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,850
It might reach some asymptote, but it's always going to get a little closer to that asymptote.

511
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,500
So the most efficient quantity. Any.

512
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,020
All this epsilon is zero. That doesn't really accomplish anything.

513
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:12,370
We want to get epsilon as close to zero as possible. You're the cheapest quantity is infinity in terms of cost per unit.

514
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:23,910
So the only one where we get sort of one specific finite quantity that minimizes our cost per unit is at the optimal scale.

515
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:31,190
So that's why we call it optimal scale, and that's probably the one of the more realistic ones.

516
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:39,700
Most of this is a mess. I know I got to move off this package.

517
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:48,410
So that's the only type of returns to scale where there's like one specific finite quantity.

518
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,570
This is why you can always try to make a little smaller. You always try to get epsilon a little closer to zero.

519
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:00,560
This one, you can always make it bigger and get a little bit lower cost per unit.

520
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:09,100
This one doesn't matter what scale you have whatsoever. You all have the same cost per unit, so only this type of a set of cost curves.

521
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:14,899
Seattle scale cost curves are going to give us one specific finite quantity or say that's the quantity

522
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:21,440
that minimizes cost per unit of production or any other quantity results in higher cost per unit.

523
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,300
Smaller quantities or larger quantities. All right.

524
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,810
Short run versus long run.

525
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:41,480
So as we mentioned, the short run through a period of time in the production process where at least one input is fixed in quantity.

526
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,460
I can't freely vary everything immediately. It's a great year for Ford.

527
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:54,380
They can't immediately open new factories. They can probably pretty quickly contract from for some more steel.

528
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:58,430
They can probably pretty quickly get some more autoworkers.

529
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:09,440
They can probably pretty quickly get more utilities. They can't quickly build a new factory in the long run, though they could if four decided,

530
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,460
you know, Hey, we think the prospects for our business is great going a decade out.

531
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,920
They can begin making plans today to scale up their factory capacity and eventually they could get there.

532
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,660
So eventually all inputs are variable.

533
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:31,970
So long run is just however long it takes that company to be in a situation where they could freely choose the entire input bundle.

534
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,760
In the short run, they can only choose the variable inputs and there's at least one input that

535
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,660
they the amount we happen to have for whatever historical reason we have it.

536
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:47,900
That's what we're stuck with. Maybe we've got too much. We've got factories sitting here underutilized.

537
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:53,180
Or maybe all of our factories are running three shifts seven days a week, and we're desperate to have more.

538
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,870
But that's either way. That's the number of factories we have.

539
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:05,870
You know, we're stuck with too much or we're stuck with too little, or maybe we happen to be lucky and just got it right.

540
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:15,380
And so we can redefine total cost as a short run, total cost curve.

541
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,860
So short run, total cost just depends on how much capital I have.

542
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:28,040
So if I happen to have the level of K of capital, it looks just like our long run total cost.

543
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:35,510
VK plus w well, except for the fact that K in that total cost curve K was variable,

544
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,730
we kind of assumed implicitly as a long 1ki could take whatever k I wanted was the cost minimizing.

545
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:48,890
K I'd pick that. Whereas in the short run it's that fixed level of k one that I happen to have some

546
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,240
other words we can divide our short run total costs into fixed cost plus variable cost.

547
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,880
That's the fixed cost. VC one is a constant.

548
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,350
I can't vary. Okay. And V is whatever the market tells me.

549
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,750
Yes. So at this point in time, that loss was independent of any decisions I make.

550
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:16,430
This is my variable cost. So if labor is the input that I could freely change, I can rapidly hire more workers.

551
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:29,260
Then Labor is my variable cost. Capital is my fixed cost. So what might this total cost curve look like?

552
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:36,580
What's one thing you see that's different than the long run total cost curve just visually on that graph?

553
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,070
So. So if we do a long run total cost curve, where do they start?

554
01:01:53,940 --> 01:02:00,870
The start of the origin. Because think about it logically in the long run, if I could freely.

555
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,380
That means I can freely vary the quantity of all of my inputs.

556
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,300
And if I decided to produce. And I'll put up a zero.

557
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:14,280
What would be the cost minimizing input bundle to produce zero units of output?

558
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:21,400
Scottish Requestor. I had already inputs.

559
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:31,720
So if I could freely vary all inputs that I decide I'm not going to produce anything, I'm going to hire no capital and no labor and incur zero costs.

560
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,709
So any long run, total cost curve, all those different shapes we drew.

561
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:40,000
If you kind of go back to that graph, you'll see all of them start came out of the origin.

562
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:48,280
And that's because logically the cost minimizing way of producing nothing is to hire no inputs of any sort and spend no dollars on inputs.

563
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:56,320
Whereas here, even in the short run, if I decided, you know what, I'm going to close my factories and build nothing.

564
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:04,829
If I can't get rid of that factory immediately, if it takes me a while to find a buyer,

565
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:09,299
transact the sale, or maybe I think that my business is going to go to get better.

566
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:15,240
So I'm going to close it this year. But, you know, we're in a big recession, but next year we're going to maybe have a recovery.

567
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,469
Maybe I don't want to sell that factory this next year.

568
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:27,150
I'll want it. But I can't make that cost go away, even by producing zero in the short run.

569
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:32,730
So any short run total cost curve is going to start at some positive intercept.

570
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,670
In other words, I'm still spending V times k one.

571
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:43,410
Even if I produce an output of zero in the long run, I would never spend any amount of money on inputs if I was producing an output of zero.

572
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:48,840
If I could freely vary capital of labor, why would I hire anything to produce nothing?

573
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:59,630
So I am currently an auto manufacturer, but I just am in the long run and I've just selected to produce no cars and hire no inputs to do so.

574
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,430
Okay. So then we've got the amount above the UK.

575
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,950
One reflects my variable costs. So think of.

576
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,080
The amount by which my total costs exceed VK. VK one is just the variable cost.

577
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:29,440
So divide it up by two my costs into the fixed cost and variable cost.

578
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:36,970
So the only way I can expand my output in the short run is to hire more of the variable input as I'm stuck with k one capital.

579
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,820
This looks like an optimal scale total cost curve, right? Okay.

580
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:53,930
Don't get fooled. You actually can't tell anything about returns to scale from a short run total cost curve.

581
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,220
However, a way to find returns to scale.

582
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:09,290
When you talk about production functions, the thought experiment was we can change all of our inputs in the short run.

583
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,190
You can't do that.

584
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:17,270
So you essentially need information over what long run total cost curve looks like to see anything meaningful about returns to scale.

585
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:27,220
Because a long run you can vary all of your inputs. So the shape of this curve is driven probably more by the marginal productivity of labor.

586
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:33,690
A story we told about the cooks in the kitchen. This is exactly the cooks in the kitchen story.

587
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:39,479
K one is the fixed size of my kitchen. So going back, I've got the kitchen.

588
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,430
Is everything in front of the desks here?

589
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:53,330
So one shelf has plenty of room in this kitchen and is probably pretty inefficient because I'm running over here to get something out of the fridge.

590
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,730
Come on over here to the prep table. I've got something on the grill which I'm now ignoring and is getting burned.

591
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:09,100
I hire a second cook. The kitchen is big enough that. We can easily work here together, and now we can specialize and be more efficient.

592
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:15,360
But unfortunately, K1 is fixed. So now let's keep hiring more and more cooks.

593
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,709
And eventually. The marginal productivity.

594
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,290
Labor goes down too for most industries.

595
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:30,710
Would you expect, I guess, any point on that total cost curve to be higher at a given quantity than if the capital you could start with was higher?

596
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:41,310
Yeah. So he might. So in other words, there's a whole bunch of short run total cost curves I might have if I had more capital.

597
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:55,530
Maybe it might look like that. So. You can draw a total cost curves for any amount of capital that I might have to have.

598
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,640
And then imagine again, if you go to the cooks in the kitchen, imagine this kitchen a bit smaller was less than K one.

599
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:10,860
So the number of cooks I could put in here before the gains to specialization are outweighed by the

600
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:18,600
congestion and inefficiency of us being jam together with knives is going to be probably a lot lower.

601
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:23,640
So there's sort of one level of output for which kind of that this kitchen.

602
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,870
And I happen to have is the right kitchen size and there's I wouldn't change it even if I could.

603
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,980
In the smaller that kitchen is, the smaller that output is likely to be.

604
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,600
Because imagine if the kitchen were the size of that of literally this table.

605
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,450
How many of you should how many chefs could I put in here before we start getting into each other's way of becoming inefficient?

606
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,170
Probably two would be that number. You know, one is probably gonna be the most efficient way of running.

607
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:57,060
Your kitchen is literally as small as this table. Whereas I could put three or four people in this kitchen in front of the whole desks.

608
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:05,220
So I guess on that point, would you expect these different curves to be parallel in a sense,

609
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:11,280
or would you expect something to converge on the other ones? Because it does cause more?

610
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,900
If you've a super small kitchen to produce,

611
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:20,190
I probably wouldn't expect them to be parallel because of that story of how how many of our two input world labor is our variable input.

612
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:27,810
How many? If you have a small factory, how many workers can you put in there before they start getting in each other's way, you know, so that.

613
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,340
You know for a very small.

614
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:43,690
If we had a very small level of capital, a tiny, tiny factory or a tiny, tiny kitchen, all of that increasing returns to scale.

615
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:59,150
It's going to kind of run out very soon. So let's look at cost minimization in the short run.

616
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:07,210
So I've got this fixed level of capital K one. And I want to vary my output.

617
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,520
So the only way I can vary it, my to input world is to hire more labor.

618
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:21,250
So when we were talking about kind of the long run, at least implicitly, we hadn't really talked long run versus short run there.

619
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:32,090
But you could see we're sort of doing it implicitly. Because we said that firm can fit any input bundle along that is the client.

620
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:44,940
So of course it's going to pick the one where. It's challenging to an ISO cos line you can't get it wants to get as lower cost as possible.

621
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,710
They can't get any lower than that.

622
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:56,250
Implicitly that was a long run situation because we were allowing the firm to freely choose capital and labor in the short run.

623
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:07,650
Our two input world. The only feasible choices for the firm are the bundles that lie on their line because they can only pay one capital.

624
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:20,380
That's all it's got to be. Other words, this firm here in the law and to freely choose any any bundle it wants to on this whole quadrant.

625
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,630
If you go up or down in capital, it can go up or down on labor in the short run.

626
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,530
It can't go anywhere on capital. It can only go up or down on labor.

627
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:37,570
You can only choose the variable influence. What if it happened to want to produce 20 units of output?

628
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:48,070
Would say, well, all I can do in the short run is pick whatever amount of labor it takes to get me up to the Q equals 20.

629
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:58,150
I want given that I've got k one units of capital and magically that happens to be the cost minimizing input bundle even in the long run.

630
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:04,480
So typically there's only one quantity in which what the firm would do in the short run, it would keep doing in the long run.

631
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:09,309
So if I asked the firm after 20 years of output and happened to have for whatever

632
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:14,200
historical reason it made its capital decisions in the past happened to

633
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:20,769
arrive today with K one units of capital and said I will I will magically allow

634
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:25,180
you to instantaneously change your capital stock and move to the long run.

635
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:30,130
If that firm which was 20 years of output is that forget it.

636
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,490
I'm fine. I'm already where I want to be.

637
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:43,230
But now what if that firm which produced 30. The only way to produce 30 is to move to L2.

638
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,640
They can only move in that direction and can't move up or down in capital.

639
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,650
Now, if I made that firm that often said, I can just magically transform your capital stock to any level you would possibly want.

640
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:00,090
Instantaneously, I would say I would take that offer.

641
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:12,520
Ideally, I want to be somewhere like here. With more capital than K1 and less labor than L2.

642
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:21,700
And that would allow me to get to a lower ISO class line. So is this firm in the short run to produce 30 as an inefficiently small capital stock?

643
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:28,990
It's going to have to. The only way to produce 30 in the short run is to essentially use too much labor and too little capital relative to the ideal.

644
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,490
Conversely, what if this firm said, Hey, I only want to produce ten units of output?

645
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:43,890
So in the short run, all it can do is it has to stay in K one and it would reduce its labor to zero.

646
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:50,610
But again, went to that firm and said, Hey, I can magically transform your capital stock to any level you want.

647
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:54,150
Instantaneously, I would take you up on that offer.

648
01:12:55,620 --> 01:13:02,220
Why? Because again, this point is see the ISO quite is cutting through the ISO coastline.

649
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:10,980
So it's not the best I could do in the long run. In the long run, I would rather have a smaller capital stock and more labor.

650
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:20,790
So we can see that where the firm would want to move to if it was a firm Q equals 30, they would say, You know what?

651
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,730
There's no magic genie that's going to do this for me instantaneously.

652
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:30,690
But if I think I want to keep producing 30 into the future, I'm going to start making plans to expand my capital stock as soon as I can.

653
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:38,130
If the firm only wants produce ten, it would say If I want it. If I expect I keep producing just ten going on into the future,

654
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:45,480
I'm going to start making plans to get rid of some of my capital stock is to be more efficient, have smaller capital and more labor.

655
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:50,280
If I want to happen to produce 20 going on to the future, well I'm good.

656
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,060
The amount I happened to have today is actually the right amount.

657
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,379
It's that kind of makes sense in terms of what the firm is sort of thinking in the short run.

658
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:10,570
In the short run stuck with K one. But then I'm going to start making plans to adjust capital when I, when it when I can feasibly adjust capital.

659
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:15,070
I want to expand on my contract or maybe I'm absolutely perfectly lucky.

660
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:22,010
I made these awesome historical decisions that have placed me exactly where I want to be today and be as good as I can.

661
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:26,410
It actually doesn't matter that I'm in the short run. I wouldn't want to change even if I could.

662
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,770
So only a q equals 20.

663
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:37,600
Will short run costs be as low as long run costs in any other quantity firm is going to be incurring higher costs in the short run.

664
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,850
Therefore, it will try to make changes to move towards that long run position.

665
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:56,850
All right. Let's talk about that. And the final thing shifts and cost curves.

666
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:02,460
So we said the total cost curve is derived from the firm's cost minimization process.

667
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:08,880
And since average and marginal costs are derived from total costs, they're also derived from the firm's cost minimization process.

668
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:13,530
So therefore, anything that's going to change the set of costs,

669
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:19,140
minimizing bundles is also as the expansion path is also going to change the cost curves.

670
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:24,300
What are some things that might change the set of costs minimizing bundles?

671
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:36,110
What might change that would change, say, total costs. Labor costs, the wage of labor for the rental rate of capital.

672
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:40,009
So prices, input prices are one. What's another one?

673
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,900
What might what might happen over time?

674
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:48,379
This is from change the quantity you might change that might change the quantity that's not that could change the cost curve.

675
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:53,840
It's just moving to a different point on the cost curve. But you could change your technology.

676
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:59,780
Let's say we do R&D and develop a more efficient way of producing that's going to lower the cost curves.

677
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:05,120
So, you know, your input costs might change or production technology might change.

678
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:09,860
So those are things that potentially will shift the cost curve. So economies talk about demand curves.

679
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,880
They say, well, changing the prices of movement along the demand curves,

680
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,870
changing the quantity is kind of the analog of changing the price risk, moving along the existing curve.

681
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,070
But then if we change the other things that are held constant in the background,

682
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,840
we drew that demand curve in income prices of other goods preferences.

683
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,340
Then they'll give us a whole new demand curve which shifts the demand curve. Same thing here.

684
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:36,860
What's sort of held constant in the background is input prices and production technology.

685
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,090
What's the production function?

686
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:45,020
If the production function changes or input prices change now we're going to shift the cost curve at a whole new cost with excess.

687
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,930
So a lot of different types of costs.

688
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,970
And then we saw the relationship between the shape of the total average and marginal cost curves and returns to scale.

689
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,950
Those had to be long run curves.

690
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,940
The short run, we really can't do that thought experiment of saying what happens if we scale up the entire input volume?

691
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:16,890
That's sort of a long running script alongside experiments. So in the short run, basically, well, this one input can't be varied.

692
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:21,389
And how long we're in the short run depends very much on the type of industry

693
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:26,320
where an auto manufacturers takes a long time to fully adjust their capital stock.

694
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:34,270
Lemonade stands takes a trip to Wal. And then anything a change, the cost minimizing input bundle is going to shift the cost curves.

695
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:40,990
So I don't know if any of you looked at the article. It was posted today on plant based meat.

696
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:49,390
You take a look at that look sort of illustrates a lot of those points.

697
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:58,450
I think the next challenge for plant based meat winning the price war against animal meat.

698
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,860
Okay, so impossible burger. What is it?

699
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:07,769
Cost per pound. We bought it recently. That's my reason why.

700
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:11,230
I am glad I'm right. I've figured it on sale.

701
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,410
You can get it for, like, four or $5 a pound. Yeah, that's.

702
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:18,100
That's the best I would have ever seen. Usually it's like 789 a pound.

703
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:24,709
So now what does ground beef cost? Three for the Jeep brand.

704
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:35,420
If you want to get something nicer, it's like five. So six will sell it maybe like 6 to 8 for impossible burgers, 3 to 5 for ground beef.

705
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:41,989
So the fact that a lot of you kind of shook your head when you said, what is a possible burger cost or have you bought it recently?

706
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:52,250
It's like, that's probably why what could happen to decrease the cost of plant based meat relative to animal based food?

707
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:04,560
Removing corn subsidies. So there are certain subsidies that are provided that benefit animal based meat.

708
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:12,370
So that's one thing. To others, that's the first one. They make it in large quantities.

709
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:19,180
Okay. So returns to scale. So if there are returns to scale in the industry and that's kind of a I mean,

710
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:24,310
I apologize for the analogy, given the context, it's kind of a chicken and egg problem.

711
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:35,990
So for plant based meat, for that industry to become big, to become bigger, it has to compete on price.

712
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,020
But to compete on price, it probably has to become bigger.

713
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:46,389
If there returns to scale in the production process, then it sort of is that sort of chicken and egg.

714
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:50,560
We could have lower cost per unit if we could get bigger, but we'd have to get bigger first.

715
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,960
So there is a chicken and egg because that's a return to the scale that we talked about today.

716
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:57,220
So what's the third thing? So you've got.
