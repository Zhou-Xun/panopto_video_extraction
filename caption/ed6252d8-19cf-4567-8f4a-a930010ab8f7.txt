1
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:08,307
So, when you're starting to
develop a communication for

2
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:12,297
a new audience obviously you need to
consider the basics, right, your audience,

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,580
your goals, and your message.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,530
And being informal about how you think
about those things is okay in many

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,840
contexts.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,701
But in general when you're developing
a health communication intervention,

7
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:28,270
like a big project such as say a topical
campaign to a particular audience or

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,201
a report that used to have a broad impact
in the scientific field or an educational

9
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:37,723
intervention that needs to prepare
the audience for behavioral change.

10
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:40,822
That’s when you really do need to be
a little bit more systematic about your

11
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:43,130
preparation and your planning.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,860
It’s really useful therefore to have
a planning framework to make sure you

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,270
don’t skip any steps and
that will help you to avoid problems.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,260
So here’s a simple framework that’s
often used in the design of health

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,940
communications interventions.

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,170
It includes many themes
you've seen elsewhere, but

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,720
just a little bit more structured.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,410
So first step in the planning framework,
assess the science.

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,160
Figure out, what do you know or not know.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,420
You might think this is obvious, but

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,510
honestly in real world practice it often
gets skipped, and that's a big problem.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,640
You have to know the state of the science,
what is known and

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,830
what is not known, in order to be able
to think about who your audience is and

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,360
what they need to know and
what you're message is.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,690
Too often, what happens in reality
is that people design communications

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,700
based upon what they think is true.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,960
So always make sure,
at least at some point in this process,

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,320
to check the science,
check the facts about,

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,980
make sure what you're saying in
your communication is right.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,230
Now, once you've done that,
you need to define the purpose.

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,080
Why are you communicating with people?

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,040
What's our goal?

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,780
Is this a situation in which
we're trying to inform them?

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,460
Provide some information or knowledge or,

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,740
is this a situation where we're
trying to persuade or convince people

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,660
that they need to do something or
maybe that they need to not do something?

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,480
Or is this one of those not-as-common but
sometimes really important situations

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,490
where we're really trying
to induce compliance.

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,670
We want to make sure, for example, that
people pay attention to safety messages.

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,950
Knowing our goals is critical
to the design of everything

41
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,670
else that's gonna follow.

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,540
Third step, identify the audience.

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,090
Who are they?

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,470
What are their characteristics?

45
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,320
What are their needs in this situation?

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,270
Now, I'm gonna pause here for a moment
to talk about order, because thus far,

47
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,305
the way I presented this
framework is science first,

48
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:44,540
then figure out your purpose,
then figure out your audience.

49
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,430
But it's not always that case.

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,630
Sometimes, and

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,050
in fact in many situations, audience
needs should really come first, right?

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,174
You have situations where you know
the audience needs to know more about x.

53
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,733
And then, you go and
you assess the science about x.

54
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:05,810
And you figure out what specifically does
this audience need to know about x in this

55
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,440
situation, and that then helps you to
define the purpose of your communications.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,750
So even though I'm presenting this as if
it were of particular order, one, two,

57
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,790
three, four, and onward.

58
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,260
There is some fluidity here.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,970
You have to think about what has
to come first in each situation.

60
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,420
Audience interacts with science,
which then interacts with purpose.

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,850
And it's sort of a fluid process to figure
out which you need to consider first.

62
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,660
Now once you've gone through those three
things the science, the purpose and

63
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,450
the audience then you're ready to really
start developing and testing your message.

64
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,790
Thinking about what is it you wanna say.

65
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,338
And it's time to start thinking about
channel, meaning, what process or

66
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:55,884
what method are you going to use to get
your message to the target audience,

67
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,571
when, where and how?

68
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,377
Now again, audience, message and channel
are not completely separate things,

69
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:06,010
they're interconnected with each other,
right?

70
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,970
Often we need to know how and when
you're gonna be communicating with your

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,250
target audience in order to
create the right message.

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,930
So as a result,

73
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,760
sometimes channel selection happens
before you really develop the message.

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,210
You have to think about
how am I gonna reach them?

75
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,270
Where am I gonna reach them before you
figure out what you can actually say to

76
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,340
them at that moment in time.

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,890
So regardless of how you're thinking
about it, you have to be going through

78
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,730
these steps of considering each of
these types of pieces of the framework.

79
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,440
First, planning it first and
then actual implementation and

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,570
development comes second.

81
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,168
Now, once you've developed your test
message, chosen your channel, timing,

82
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:51,260
developed it, and made sure that
it's saying what you want it to say.

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,280
Then you implement, you get it out there,
you see what happens.

84
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,060
And it's that last piece,
see what happens,

85
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,920
that's really the last
piece of this framework.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,370
Evaluation, now evaluation
is critical because

87
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,860
how do you know whether the message you
just gave your audience made a difference.

88
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,700
Unless you've thought about
what defines success,

89
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,190
you're not gonna really be able to say
whether your communication is working.

90
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,450
It's also important to think about,

91
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,940
evaluation happens in
parallel with implementation.

92
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,680
You don't ever wanna wait till the end and
then say, wait, now we're done.

93
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,590
We should think about trying
to evaluate whether it worked.

94
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,510
No, no, no,
you have to evaluate continuously.

95
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,600
At least be thinking right from
the start of your implementation,

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
how do I know whether it's working?

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,460
How do I know whether there's a problem?

98
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,650
At a minimum, doing so
allows you to catch any errors or

99
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,140
problems faster, and
that's always important.

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,630
Now, this framework I’ve presented in,
it doesn't work for everything.

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,470
I don't wanna pretend that any
framework works for every situation.

102
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,500
But the most important thing for you to
take away from this discussion is one

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,570
thing and one thing only, how critical
it is to make sure you don't skip steps.

104
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,870
Each one of the pieces of
this planning framework

105
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,600
is important when developing a message for
a broad audience.

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,220
The order might change.

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,560
The audience might change, right?

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
You might do it differently
if you're reaching out for

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,000
a broad message to the public,
versus if you're designing a report for

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,320
some scientists, versus if you're, say,
doing an interview with a policymaker.

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,196
But whichever way you're doing it,
thinking about each step is critical.
