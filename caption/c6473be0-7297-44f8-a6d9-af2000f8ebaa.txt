1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,010
You've already had four years. Actually, that's the deal, honestly.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,650
All right. So we're going to go ahead and do the neoplasia lecture.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,589
I checked. It looks like doing manual Panopto reporting.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,190
Worked well for the regeneration lecture. Looks like it uploaded, which is great because I think of the lectures that we do,

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,540
the first part of the class, the neoplasia one is the one that gets a little difficult.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,780
Sometimes there's a lot more conceptual concepts to it.

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,130
So I just wanted to make sure this one was recorded so good that the other thing worked.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,149
All right. So, so we already talked about basically body response to injury, right?

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,770
We went through our whole sequence of injury, body response, regeneration.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:58,890
And I told you that was all a pathology, which is a bit of an exaggeration, because we all know that one of the aspects of pathology is neoplasia.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,970
Okay? Neoplasia can be understood.

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,150
It borrows a lot of the same concepts that we just talked about with regeneration, reentry to the cell cycle.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,270
But it's sort of cell proliferation gone wild or cell proliferation without the normal controls.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,149
So that's going to be kind of something that we're going to discuss. Here are some definitions for tumor is the word we've used before.

15
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,040
We used it when we talked about inflammation. And we know that historically it just means swelling.

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,600
So technically it can be neoplastic or non little plastic.

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,120
It comes from gross observation of a swelling, although that's the historic meaning.

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,490
I will tell you that, you know, in common usage today, if you say tumor, most people are going to think you're talking about neoplasia, right?

19
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,270
So for the most part, we reserve that term for the use of neoplasia, but by itself, it's a pretty generic term.

20
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,469
Okay. But the tumor mostly we're going to use in the context of neoplasia, but a tumor by itself,

21
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,170
it doesn't specify the behavior of that swelling or of that neoplasm, but that's how we're using it.

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,440
And when we talk about neoplasia, another concept that we often refer to is whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

23
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,890
Okay, so in general use you think, okay, benign, not so bad, malignant, really bad.

24
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,950
And that's generally true. But in terms of pathology, the real definition is that a benign neoplasm.

25
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,740
Neoplasm has a limited growth potential.

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,730
So it's something that's going to grow more than the normal tissue can have a greater extent of growth than the normal tissue,

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,040
but it's going to have some limits on its growth. So these are tissues that tend to not be as invasive to adjacent tissues.

28
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,470
These these are tumors that don't invade blood vessels or metastasize to other areas.

29
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,060
So they're growing locally in a certain extent, but they have some limitations.

30
00:02:51,570 --> 00:03:00,090
Okay. So they may be responsive to some growth, suppressive signals, or even in a tumor or even in a malignant tumor, you have some cell death.

31
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,070
So one of the finding, one of the hallmarks of a benign neoplasm is that the rate of cell proliferation approximately equals the rate of cell death.

32
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,540
Or, you know, maybe it's just a little bit over. So it has some growth and then it just kind of stays there or maybe it grows really, really slowly.

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,990
Another mechanism that can come to play plan benign plasma is that it can enter a senescent state.

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,000
So growth to a certain extent than just stop there zero permanent growth rest.

35
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,180
So there are some signaling pathways still in place that recognize that abnormal proliferation and kind of arrest it.

36
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,730
So a lot of skin tumors actually behave that way.

37
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:45,120
So some limit on growth as opposed to malignancy or a malignant neoplasm, which has essentially unlimited growth potential.

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,650
So this is a tumor that's lost the cells and lost the ability to respond to like pressure from adjacent cells.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,700
They don't pay attention to the limits of the extracellular matrix.

40
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,400
So they're not going to just grow nicely along the basement membrane.

41
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,260
They're going to go through the basement membrane and invade to the next the adjacent connective tissue.

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,080
They're going to invade two blood vessels, their lymphatics and spread from there to other areas of the body.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,640
They get sent to another tissue and take up shop there. So these are tissues that do not obey the normal limiting signals for growth potential.

44
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,770
And for the most part, they have a rate of cell proliferation that's greater than the rate of cell death.

45
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:32,069
Okay. So when we talk about cancer, usually what we're talking about are malignant neoplasms that are going to spread or locally invade or have

46
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:39,390
some significant functional deficit for the organism because of these cells go up overnight versus malignant.

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,860
Here's a thought question for you.

48
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,240
I told you that benign tumors retain some limitations on growth, while malignant tumors of uncontrolled growth seem to think, okay, benign.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,870
That's fine. Malignant. But are there situations where benign tumors, from the standpoint of you as the human or the organism,

50
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,400
can be life threatening or cause major functional loss? The.

51
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,270
If it was if it was walks the whole.

52
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,630
Yeah. They got obstruction or you can do something else.

53
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:14,970
Yes, absolutely. So like in the g.I. So actually in mice induced intestinal tumors of mice are usually benign,

54
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,410
but the mice can die because just as you said, they'd become obstructive to the GI tract.

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,160
The same could be true if you have a tumor in like the ureter or something.

56
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,540
So blocking a functional exit.

57
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,030
Anything else? Yeah. Pushing on a part of the brain.

58
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,630
Yes. Very good. So the brain is in a hard cavity, so there's not much place to go.

59
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,440
So meningioma is which are tumors of the outer lining of the brain are usually benign tumors.

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,200
They don't metastasize or go anywhere. But because they have all way out, they can only grow out.

61
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,110
So they're going to hit the cranial cavity. That's going to create pressure, that's going to push on the brain.

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,290
And then you get necrosis because pressure, injury neurons die.

63
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,560
So you get secondary deficits because of that pressure.

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,510
And remember, that can be very serious because neurons we talked about are one of those tissues that don't regenerate well.

65
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,140
Okay. So benign and malignant has specific meanings in terms of pathology that relate to growth potential.

66
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,180
And it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a non consequential tumor to a human right for some term.

67
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,590
Is it like if you have a benign skin tumor, it's unsightly.

68
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,979
You're probably going to have that removed,

69
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,770
but it's less likely to cause you a functional deficit that is get to her like a squamous cell carcinoma, which is going to be.

70
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay. All right. So some definitions when we talk about inducing gene expression changes for tumors,

71
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,440
two terms that we often talk about are tumors, tumor suppressor genes or oncogene.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,640
So let's think about definitions for those. So a tumor suppressor, gene's normal function.

73
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,650
So the normal one is to limit cell proliferation or to limit cell survival.

74
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,160
So these are some of the checkpoint related genes that ordinarily limit the amount of cell cycling occurring.

75
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:20,260
So if you have a mutation or an altered function of a tumor suppressor gene, typically it contributes to neoplastic formation by loss of function.

76
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,400
Okay. So its normal function is to put on a rest of the cell cycle.

77
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,360
If you lose that function, you're removing. Right. One of the gatekeepers.

78
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,080
And that can happen very often. These are genes that need to hits.

79
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,180
So, you know, you have two alleles, one copy from your father, one copy from your mother of each of these of each gene.

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,840
So for many tumor suppressor genes, you need to have both dysfunctional in order to have the effect.

81
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,800
So retinoblastoma, which we talk about a bit, is a good example of that.

82
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,900
Or in some instances like P53, which is a major checkpoint protein,

83
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:06,580
that a function of protein is so important that the diminution or the loss of one LEO is sufficient.

84
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,370
So you can have dominant negative mutations. Okay. But these are genes that their normal function is to limit proliferation.

85
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,569
So the absence of that function removes a checkpoint. Okay.

86
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,400
So here are examples from that previous tumor suppressor cell cycle diagram that we looked at.

87
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:30,190
We talked about there's the G1. S checkpoint where you can have a rest of the cell cycle and that principally occurs

88
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,700
through the protein RBD or retinoblastoma gene product and P16 and also P53.

89
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:46,420
So those are all checkpoint inhibitors at that stage that P53 comes into play in the G2, EVA checkpoint as well.

90
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:55,450
So how does that happen? So here's a more complicated diagram of the cell cycle describing sort of go and stop factors.

91
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,310
So one main, this is a tilted a little bit so that our G1.

92
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,870
S checkpoint is here.

93
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:12,370
But one major factor that controls whether you proceed into the cell cycle is the e to this blue thing, the E to F transcription factor.

94
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,890
Okay. So that's a go signal.

95
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:24,040
In order for cells likely to occur, you have to have the E to have a transcription factor initiating the cascade of gene transcription.

96
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,570
That's a major go factor for cell cycling, but usually we want to control cell cycle.

97
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:39,250
So it's used its activity is usually kept in close control through binding to the retinoblastoma gene product.

98
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:48,490
Okay, so if a quiescent stage when you're not cycling retinoblastoma, a gene binds E to F, so that's an inactivating interaction.

99
00:09:48,870 --> 00:10:00,550
So it is bound up. But under the correct signals there's going to be a dissociation of RB and that occurs to phosphorylation.

100
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:11,139
So if RB gets phosphorylated detaches from E2 F thing and then E to F is free to bind in the

101
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,060
nucleus of the cell to its recognition sites and facilitate gene transcription and so forth.

102
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,760
Okay. So obviously we want to control the phosphorylation of RB.

103
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:32,139
So we have a number of kind of push and pull factors doing that activation of E to f signaling that do them all.

104
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:40,180
But there are major. Proteins called cyclists and cycling dependent kinases that so effectively is a major

105
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,810
one that facilitates the phosphorylation of RBD and frees it to have to become active.

106
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,280
The segments are a kind of a go factor, right?

107
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:05,040
I thought an additional factor are the P16 or incorrect family of proteins and these guys prevent RB phosphorylation,

108
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,490
so they normally favor keeping RB in a phosphorylated state by inhibiting the activity of Spike.

109
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,190
Okay, so we have a couple of redundancies here. We have go factors and we have stop factors.

110
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,890
Okay. And all of them are under the influence of environmental signals to the cell, whether it should be replicating or not.

111
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:33,240
So tumor suppressors, stop factors aka genes or another type of gene or category important in cell proliferation.

112
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:43,710
A protein oncogene is a normal gene that normally controls cell proliferation or gene transcription related to cell proliferation.

113
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Okay, these are growth factors.

114
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:56,160
If a protocol gene is mutated or epigenetically altered so that it no longer responds to the stop factors to things like the tumor suppressor,

115
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,630
that's a gain of function mutation. So now it's not responsive to the normal signals controlling its behavior and

116
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,690
it's kind of a permanent go signal because of the gain of function mutation,

117
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,010
typically because that's a go mutation. Typically those are dominant mutations where only one copy is needed.

118
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,050
So these are things that are going to facilitate cell proliferation. Okay.

119
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,940
You might remember this diagram, what we talked about in the last lecture and in a previous lecture we talked about growth factors.

120
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,950
We said that like when the hepatocytes, for example, reenter the cell cycle,

121
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:39,480
a lot of that activity takes place through growth factors, acting tyrosine kinase receptors and that I glossed over it.

122
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:47,070
But the activation of the preceding case receptor activates an entire cascade of downstream proteins.

123
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,750
And you look at some of these names, rats make these cyclic.

124
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,790
You might recognize these as commonly mutated proteins in cancer.

125
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:05,490
So all of these downstream activators, there are known mutations associated with that with certain types of cancers.

126
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,270
So these are all potential alcohol proteins, right?

127
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:18,000
So if I have a mutation in ref that allows it to remain constitutively active without a growth factor receptor signaling.

128
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,850
Right. That's an active genetic mutation in rats. And now I have all this activity happening and it has no control.

129
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,430
Does that make sense? Okay, so those are all aqua proteins, same diagram.

130
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:41,430
There are naturally checkpoints in this situation. So we have a protein that d phosphorylated active RAF that moves it back to an inactive state.

131
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,769
We have a protein that limits it limits possible inositol kind of activity.

132
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,260
So these are stop signals and these also P ten in particular prostate cancer.

133
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,580
These are also proteins that are known to be mutant in certain cancer types.

134
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,420
So these are loss of function mutations. So these are tumor suppressor genes that again contribute to the dysregulation of the cycle.

135
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,870
The tumor suppressor is tend to be loss of function mutations. All right.

136
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,460
So that's genetics. Let's look at some basic nomenclature which will come into play a little later.

137
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,330
You heard of all kinds of type words when you describe tumors. But basically breaking it down.

138
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,910
Essentially, all tumors are of three types. There's epithelial tumors.

139
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,480
Think back to our histology. We talked about the different types of epithelium.

140
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,080
There's epithelial tumors which tend to be named after the epithelial type.

141
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,009
So we have things called hematomas, for example,

142
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:50,030
that are epithelial to benign epithelial tumors of hepatocyte hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic carcinomas.

143
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,980
Carcinoma is the generic word for a malignant epithelial tumor.

144
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:02,540
So think of all the personal words. You know, squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of squamous epithelium.

145
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,780
Adeno is a word that means gland. Technically, it's like opening.

146
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,500
So if you have an adenoma, that's just a special word that refers to a epithelial tumor of gland origin.

147
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,320
And then if you want to talk about the malignant version of that, here's our word.

148
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,280
Carcinoma and adenocarcinoma is simply a malignant epithelium tumor of glandular origin.

149
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,260
Pulmonary adenocarcinoma, that's another one.

150
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:43,610
So carcinoma within the tumor, epithelia origin. But so the other major tumor type is mesenchymal tumors, connective tissue tumors.

151
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,750
And there you just have a benign version, all by just means swelling.

152
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:55,279
You just take the tissue type of stick the word Omar behind it, lipoma, a benign tumor of that kind.

153
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,540
Roma is a benign tumor of cartilage, cartilaginous tissue.

154
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:07,310
Okay. And the equivalent to the word carcinoma, the malignancy signal firm as that couple traverse the word sarcoma.

155
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:16,450
So lipo, sarcoma, malignant tumor, a fat, fibrous sakuma malignant tumor of fibroblasts.

156
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,910
Okay, so these were carcinoma, malignancy, sarcoma, malignancy, and they use modified depending on the tissue type.

157
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:30,050
Those are most of the ones we're going to talk about in this class. There's another category which we call round cell tumors,

158
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,530
and those are the origin are essentially hip out of poetics cells or cells that are not connected to each other.

159
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:45,500
Right. So red blood cells, lymphocytes, leukocytes, mast cells where the cell itself is kind of floating around,

160
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,220
but it's not part of a distinct organ like a liver or something.

161
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,740
So those are referred to as root cell tumors there. They have a little bit of complicated oncologia.

162
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,050
It's not really something I quiz you on, but just you see it. If you see it in the literature, you kind of know what's going on.

163
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,370
Those are usually the cell type, the word for cell, because these are cell based tumors rather than like a discrete tissue.

164
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,269
And Omar so masto, so talk about his style.

165
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,030
So these are benign tumors of mast cells and macrophages.

166
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:25,579
It's kind of a historic word for macrophage. Lymphocytes are an interesting tissue type because I told you that the definition of

167
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,650
a malignant tumor is a tumor that's not limited in terms of proliferation potential,

168
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:38,749
and it's also not limited by sites that can go different places, lymphocytes or cells that already, you know, circulate through the blood.

169
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:46,450
So they're already going different places. So there's really no such thing as a benign lymphocyte derived tumor cells.

170
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,290
Cells are already floating through the blood. So essentially they're already have the potential to go anywhere.

171
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:57,410
So essentially all lymphocyte derived tumors are already, by definition, malignant.

172
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,940
Some of them are sort of growing than others. So they don't all have the same prognosis, but they're all malignant.

173
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,930
So the word for malignant rounds,

174
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:12,320
the tumors is essentially the tissue type plus of the cell type also more or to designate kind of that they're all malignant you stick sarcoma.

175
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,250
So lymphoma, lipo sarcoma and essentially the same thing.

176
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,530
Okay just in case you see in the literature, not important for this class but just this one is.

177
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,079
This is just some other examples with different types of tumors.

178
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,900
You can kind of see that common. Other ones that's just kind of FBI.

179
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,330
Okay. So check back time.

180
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,570
Okay. We're good. All right.

181
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:50,210
So that's kind of the big overview of gene mutations that carry gene types that can contribute to formation of a tumor with little or not a creature.

182
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,010
We're going to step back and get a little theoretical. Any questions so far?

183
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:04,730
Okay. All right. So in terms of Carcinogenesis, there are two fundamental theories of carcinogenesis that we're going to talk about.

184
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:14,810
There are others. There are corollaries to this. But conceptually, one useful way of thinking about carcinogenesis are these two fundamental theories.

185
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,310
So these are multistep, carcinogenesis, and then the stem cell theory of cancer.

186
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,960
So let's look at multistep Carcinogenesis first, which is the older of the two theories.

187
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,870
Okay. So this diagram is depicting cancer development of the colon,

188
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:38,390
and that's because the theory of multistep carcinogenesis was first developed and demonstrated in the colon,

189
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,380
and it actually fits fairly well with how most cancers of human in most colon cancers in humans develop.

190
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,549
So this multi-step pathogenesis, I'm sure some of you have read about this,

191
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,920
but this is a theory that was first put forth by Bert VOGELSTEIN and Eric Fearon.

192
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,250
It's very conceptually important to our understanding of cancer and remains.

193
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,750
We have modifications of it now, but it remains relevant to a significant degree today.

194
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,710
Okay. So on the far right is the normal colon.

195
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,380
This suggests you guys remember I told you for GI, you have a defined structure where there's the epithelial part,

196
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,830
the B Kosa and then there is a sub mucosa which is like the connective tissue support and then the muscle on the outside.

197
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,310
Right. So it's a normal colon structure. Everything's very controlled.

198
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:32,270
If you have a situation where one somewhere in there, let's say the epithelium one cell has a mutation which can either be acquired.

199
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,200
So as we go through life, we're exposed to environmental agents. This is a labor tissue.

200
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,520
So it's proliferating all the time. Every time it replicates, it has the potential for making a mistake.

201
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,930
So as we age, we have a higher and higher incidence of spontaneous mutations.

202
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,620
So at some point you get a mutation in one a will of a gene.

203
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,790
Okay. Potentially, you could also acquire a mutation in a second level,

204
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,680
which if you are born with a mutation in the first LDL, you're kind of one step closer in that process.

205
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,339
So potentially you have a shorter time to onset of a tumor.

206
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:21,800
But at some point, if you have mutations that knock out two wheels or both the wheels of a tumor suppressor gene, you have a transformed cell.

207
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:26,720
So this is a cell that has a mutation in it that's disrupted its normal function.

208
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,620
So this is an initiation of that. This is the first transformed cell.

209
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,500
And this sequence of events was first demonstrated, as I said, for colon cancer.

210
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,530
Kind of the prototype gene was the Adenomatous Polyposis holy gene.

211
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,240
So this is a gene that is a tumor suppressor gene. So it's normal function is to arrest the cell cycle.

212
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,790
And there are individuals who have mutations in APC, their inherited mutations,

213
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,500
and then they are at high risk for acquiring that second hit and having early onset of colon cancer.

214
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,050
But this first event is just the first event, the first transformed cell.

215
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:13,340
So at this point, we have a single cell that has the loss of a tumor suppressor gene, but it's just one cell.

216
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,700
So as long as that cell just sits there, who cares?

217
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,600
It's not doing anything. It's disrupted, but it doesn't really matter.

218
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:28,100
So initiation or the formation of the first transformed cell by itself is not cancer formation.

219
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:34,580
Right. But the thing I have to happen is that initiated abnormal cell has to proliferate.

220
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,880
So we have to have some signal that induces usually all the cells in the area to proliferate.

221
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,510
And then this guy is going to proliferate as well and make more of itself.

222
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,649
Okay. And it has a little bit of an advantage from a cell standpoint because it lost the tumor suppressor gene.

223
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,200
So when all the cells proliferate, the normal cells will do the right thing and follow all their stop signals.

224
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:04,400
The cell block, the stop signal. So it has an advantage of the cells around it and it's more likely to continue to proliferate.

225
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:12,230
So the proliferation event is promotion of that is the selective growth of the initiated cell.

226
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay. So anything that caused cause all this to cause that cell to proliferate and oftentimes these are reversible signals, right?

227
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,200
Sort of mutation in this colon cell.

228
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:31,130
And now, I don't know, I get salmonella, I get some sort of injury, and now my cells are proliferating to repair the injury.

229
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,150
But this guy is proliferating, too, and it has no stop signals.

230
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,700
So now there's in the setting of injury and it's going to proliferate to a selective advantage over its neighbors.

231
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,950
Okay. So if this continues long enough, you'll start to have a little focus.

232
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,700
It's still hard to see, but this area, the mucosa is drawn kind of funky.

233
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,700
There's more cells here, lost a little bit of structure. There's a more they'll get a proliferation there.

234
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:03,300
The promotion is the selective growth of the initiate itself. It's often reversible, but if it goes on long enough,

235
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,870
you'll start to get something that you visually see is distinct from the other tissues, but it's still in the mucosa.

236
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:21,180
Every time that cell proliferates, it has the potential for having a mistake and acquiring another mutation or other things can be happening.

237
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:28,860
Maybe there are additional carcinogens you're being exposed to and additional mutations can occur that will facilitate this selective cell growth.

238
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,460
So the third step in the process is called progression,

239
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:40,890
where cells within that proliferating area of growth to acquire additional properties that further promote survival and spread.

240
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,480
Okay. So tumors might start with an initial mutation,

241
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:53,880
but by the time you could see that they usually acquired a lot of mutations or a lot of epigenetic alterations that can promote their growth.

242
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,260
If the if there's still some control of growth signals, you'll have growth of benign tumor.

243
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,720
So in this case, these are adenomas, glandular origin, benign tumor.

244
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:14,700
So Colon, I don't know those which you often hear referred to as polyps are visible areas of proliferation.

245
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:21,240
What they look like with endoscopy or whatever. They're still but they're obeying the limitations of the membrane.

246
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,460
So they grow out into the lumen of the colon, seen above the surface of the colon.

247
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,889
You know, people do colonoscopy that these are trying to remove them before.

248
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,840
I think it further can happen. But they're benign tumors of the colon.

249
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:47,100
If further mutations are become present, you might lose the cells that are affected by lose their respect essentially for that basement membrane.

250
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:52,920
They now can grow through the extracellular matrix and they erode into the deeper tissue.

251
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,920
So they can erode into the colon wall. They can invade the vessels that they go to other tissues.

252
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,920
That's colon cancer. That's a carcinoma. Malignant tumor of epithelial origin.

253
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:13,590
A lot of adenocarcinoma. Okay, so initiation is the first cancer cell, but by itself, who cares?

254
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:20,160
It's one cell promotion. Anything that makes that cell proliferate, being a mutation or just a growth signal of that.

255
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,750
Now you have a little focus and a progression is the acquisition of additional properties that promote the survival and spread.

256
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,210
Okay, this is what that could look like in the focus or in the setting of a percentage.

257
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,090
So we have a carcinogen induced mutation.

258
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:46,080
We have a carcinogen that suggested by the body, remember that just ingesting a carcinogen doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get cancer, right?

259
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,910
Because your body has a lot of defenses. It could detoxify the carcinogen directly.

260
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,829
You could have metabolic activation of a carcinogen, which makes it quite dangerous.

261
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,110
But then you also had detoxification mechanisms.

262
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,610
So exposure to a carcinogen, maybe you're able to deal with that.

263
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,900
But there is the potential for alterations of DNA either directly like is illustrated here by binding

264
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:17,280
to DNA and causing an addict which can create a mutation because you've basically found the base.

265
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,480
The base is going to be removed by DNA repair mechanisms and the wrong base could be inserted.

266
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:28,439
So this could be a mechanism for inducing IT mutation, or you can affect other aspects of the cell,

267
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,100
like maybe there's more reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species themselves can be mutation inducing.

268
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,849
So percentages can directly of DNA or separately even at that phase situation,

269
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:48,740
if you have intact stop mechanisms of DNA repair induction, you have the potential for correcting that mistake.

270
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,500
But the more events like this that you have happen, the more likelihood that one of them will become fixed.

271
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:03,120
And what we mean by fix is once you have that mutation, if that cell proliferates right with the right base mutations,

272
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,640
then it forever sets a fixed mutation, and it's an irreversible event at birth.

273
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:16,920
As we said, if you have proliferation of that cell, there's the potential for the acquisition of additional mutation causing properties.

274
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,220
Okay. Some of you may have seen this diagram before. This is a classic example of chemical carcinogenesis in mice.

275
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:32,420
This was kind of one of the experiments illustrating the principle of reversibility and irreversibility.

276
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:39,110
So this is an experiment. Skin tumors in mice that had an initiate or chemical applied to the skin.

277
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:47,570
So it's something that actually initiates a mutation in the DNA and then a promoter chemical that triggers replication.

278
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,379
So in group one where you just have the initiator that creates mutation, but the cells aren't proliferating really.

279
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:02,660
So the animals aren't going to get tumors. But if you follow that up with application of a promoter, you get development of tumors.

280
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,909
Remember that the initiate itself. You know that there are what's it's been initiated.

281
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,770
That mutation is in place. So if you have this happen, then you wait a period of time.

282
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,950
That sounds like a ticking time bomb and just sitting there. Right.

283
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,200
So if you then apply the promoter after a time delay, you still can have the generation of killer virus, the ticking time bomb.

284
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,700
It's just replicating a little later. In this situation, you have cell proliferation first, but those are all normal cells.

285
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:38,060
And then application of the initiator, not a big deal. Same thing or kind of similar thing.

286
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,750
If you're just a plant, a promoter, what is going on here?

287
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,470
Here we have application initiator and then we have application of the promoter.

288
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,660
So it kind of seems like this.

289
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,360
But these animals did not get tumors and the x axis is time.

290
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,750
What's going on there? Why don't both guys get to work with me?

291
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,230
Because I have to do with the dose.

292
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:12,230
So, like, in the second example, there's enough time for clearance or region for healing, whichever one applies in that setting.

293
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:18,830
Yeah. Dose in the sense of frequency. Yeah. So like here we have initiation through a cell.

294
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,330
After some period of time, we apply a promoter event. So there's going to be a cycle of replication.

295
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,280
But these are very widely spaced. So the rate of replication is slower.

296
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,249
And, you know, if we're just starting with one mutation, there might be some cells that are dying off in between.

297
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,580
Maybe they haven't had time to acquire enough mutations to make them independent.

298
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,700
But there's a longer period of time between replication events.

299
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,660
So, you know, if the spouse's life were longer or the experiment is longer, maybe eventually it's going to get a tumor.

300
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,410
But the growth signals are the proliferation signals are not as rapidly or frequently spaced.

301
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,350
But these animals are going to have an earlier onset of tumors. These animals might still get them, but it's very slow.

302
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,420
Okay. So that's the explanation for this one.

303
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,190
So that explains the threshold effect, which can't be dose in terms of the numbers of occurrences or the frequency.

304
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,260
But promotion events tend to have a threshold effect initiation.

305
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,390
That's once that happens, it's just there.

306
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,799
It's fixed. And with initiation events, it really it's kind of a luck.

307
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,850
It depends on the binding of that chemical to DNA or the initiation of the mutation.

308
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,990
It's not really dose dependent. It's sort of there's no real threshold effect.

309
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:39,020
Every time you have the exposure, you have the potential for that to happen depending on, you know, if you're able to either detoxify the chemical or.

310
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,230
Yeah. So there's no threshold effect for initiation at a threshold effect for promotion.

311
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:53,570
In this case, does the initiator have to be a chemical? No, not necessarily considered a chemical.

312
00:31:53,570 --> 00:32:00,740
Carcinogenesis event with the promoter was a chemical, but the initiator was like some other maybe even genetic.

313
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,280
Yes. Yes. That's such a great example.

314
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:11,510
So like there are individuals who have A, B, C mutations or who have some other mutation that predisposes them to cancer.

315
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,480
You can't affect that really because of genetics, but you can't affect the promotion.

316
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,750
So that's why things like inflammation. Inflammation itself is considered a risk factor in many contexts for cancer,

317
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,800
because the more chronic inflammation you have, that in and of itself is a body injury.

318
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,040
So you're going to have that cycle of replication, right? Yes, that's a great example.

319
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,630
Okay. So what does Neoplasia look like? Your pleasure by definition is disorderly growth.

320
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,290
So we're going back to a cervix example. This is stratified squamous epithelium, basal cells,

321
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:48,019
which are the normal proliferative where if a big nucleus kind of polygonal cuboid or looking and then the

322
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,350
cells get bigger and differentiate the nuclei drop off normal cervix in the case of cervical carcinoma.

323
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,600
The basal cells don't have the same differentiation signals and they just proliferate like crazy.

324
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,220
So you get kind of a full thickness layer of what looks like a basal epithelial cells.

325
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,330
So you can actually in a tumor, you can even see mitotic figures.

326
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,830
So this is a cell that's getting ready to divide. So all the chromosomes are condensed in the middle of the tissue and that's all going to pull apart.

327
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,649
Those have a distinctive look. In histology sections and what are the things that you do in histology to try to measure the

328
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:28,840
proliferation potential of a tumor is you can count mitotic figures per high powered field.

329
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,020
That's kind of a proxy for the growth rate. Here is our common example.

330
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:43,300
In like an actual histologic section on the far right is the normal colon with Eric Koza at the external muscle layer.

331
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:49,900
You can't see much of the stem because a here in an adenoma, the part on the left hand side is the normal mucosa,

332
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,290
the lower back photo panel, left hand side of the normal mucosa.

333
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,410
And all of a sudden, it looks like there's a tree growing up in the colon. This is an increased height of me closer.

334
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,600
So still kind of looks like colon, but it's growing outward to a greater extent.

335
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:11,500
It's lost that kind of normal knowledge of how high the mucosa should be, but the suddenly causes fine and the deeper tissue is fine.

336
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:17,740
And that a carcinoma, it's hard to even tell where things are now because because it's very dense and the

337
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:23,020
tissues are invading through into the sub because of the muscular external case.

338
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:32,049
That's cancer. And this is a benign I don't know, it's just a higher magnification showing the normal colon with differentiated cells.

339
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:39,880
The bluish looking cells are goblet cells. Some of the normal color have you have just clonic episodes and goblet cells and that I don't know about.

340
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,900
You have a loss of some of that normal differentiation.

341
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:48,370
You have kind of a piling up of the cells and it occurs in although you can hardly tell that they're colonic parasites anymore.

342
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:56,170
So you have both altered tissue architecture and you have what's called dysplasia, which is abnormal growth or abnormal appearance of the cells.

343
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,690
Going. Okay. So in general, if I showed you some tissues that look a bit different in general,

344
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:14,760
when you look at a tissue under the microscope or if you have a tumor that that more closely resembles the normal tissue.

345
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,180
So in this instance, this is mammary cancer. There's this tissue is a tumor.

346
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,740
So it's not the normal organization of every tissue, but it still kind of resembles it that it still can form glands.

347
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:34,710
So epithelial cells around that opening. So this is a well differentiated tumor because it still retains some of those architectural signals.

348
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,340
These tend to be tumors that are more slow growing or less likely to be aggressive.

349
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:49,800
The more alterations from normal growth that you have, which is essentially the less responsiveness to signals that the cell has,

350
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,850
the more likely those tumors are to be rapidly growing and invasive.

351
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,439
So these are tissue grading systems for breast cancer tumors.

352
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,050
And on the far right, you see that you have cells that have completely lost the ability to form glands.

353
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,490
You can't really tell what cell type they are.

354
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:12,270
They're just proliferating, proliferating, proliferating in a range of tissue and not creating the normal structures.

355
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,460
So one of the things the pathologists do is try to grade these both these tumors.

356
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:25,950
And that gives you a rough sense of the likelihood. It's not a defined science by any means that there are tumors that kind of behave, apparently.

357
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,660
But it gives you a rough sense of the likelihood of a more aggressive growth.

358
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,620
Okay. So what was once we talked about what is that carcinogenesis we talked about a

359
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,540
step with stepwise process with metastasis and invasion being a late event.

360
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:51,840
So if that's the case, then by logic, early detection programs, if you detect things that are at a polyp stage or at an adenoma stage,

361
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:59,040
right, and you remove it, that should decrease the incidence rate of advanced cancer in the population.

362
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,980
Right. Because you're removing it at the adenoma stage before you get the chance to acquire additional mutations.

363
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:15,480
That's the theory anyway. This is a graph the age standardized incidence rate of breast cancer in the US, in white women.

364
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,670
So in the late seventies and eighties we really stepped up kind of our

365
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,980
institution of early mammography and early screening programs for breast cancer.

366
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,730
So one of the things that happened is we detected early.

367
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,670
So the black line is localized to a virus like flow masses in the breast.

368
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:42,629
The gray line is regional tumors that might be in the local lymph node and the triangles are distant tumors.

369
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,780
These are metastatic tumors in other areas. Okay.

370
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,670
So in the late seventies, early eighties, we increased the use of mammography.

371
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,989
And so the detection of these early stage tumors went up. So we're doing good.

372
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,340
We're getting a lot of these early stage tumors before they get to the point that they're symptomatic.

373
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,440
But the coordinator to that should be, if that stepwise happens, that the really malignant lesion should go down.

374
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,680
Right. And as you can see, kind of flat back, maybe it spiked a little.

375
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,810
So one of the mysteries was like, well, why is that the case? That for catching these lesions early and removing them?

376
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,200
Why are we having a corresponding decrease in the incidence of these distant tumors?

377
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,219
So the question there really becomes or the corollary is that some tumors, you know,

378
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,760
if the multistep carcinogenesis were true in every case, that should happen.

379
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:42,870
But it appears that some tumors have an inherent likelihood for metastasis almost from the very beginning.

380
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,910
So almost at the first stage, you can detect that there are tumors that have a more severe prognosis or increased likelihood to metastasize.

381
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:57,300
So why is that? Why do some tumors carry invasive metastatic potential from the very beginning?

382
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:06,000
So to understand that, we have to go a little bit back to what is a tumor and a little bit back to our concept of stem cells.

383
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:13,560
So in 2000, there was this article in cells that ended up being like the most read article ever in cell,

384
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,590
and it tried to identify features that are hallmarks of cancer.

385
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,130
So what are the fundamental features that define a cancer?

386
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,860
There was actually kind of a ten years on version. I think there was even another update from 2021.

387
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,320
The ones that have listed here are from the first article, which is kind of the most fundamental and basic.

388
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,640
It's gotten more complex over time, but these fundamental ones are still a very useful concept when we think about how cancers behave.

389
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,840
But these are great articles that cause you to read them. So we think about cancers.

390
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,800
Some of the features that cancer cells have is that they are self-renewing.

391
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,030
They don't need growth signals from the outside. They stimulate their own growth.

392
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,370
They're not responsive to suppressive signals, so they resist inhibitory signals.

393
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,350
They can kind of provide their own growth environment.

394
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:10,079
So they're resistant to evoke ptosis, they can stimulate angiogenesis, they don't undergo senescence.

395
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,910
The normal cells were replicated a couple of times. Never again. These cells will continue to replicate.

396
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:26,220
And then some cancer cells have the propensity for invasion, metastasis or metabolic survival save a lot of kind of features favoring their survival.

397
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:33,990
And if you look at these some of these by the right you a little bit so some not all of them of some of the properties of stem cells, a tissue.

398
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,740
So stem cells in tissue or preserved cells, they're normal cells, but they're reserve cells in tissue that are self-renewing.

399
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,610
Their long lived they have a long life perpetual.

400
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,300
So stepping back to the concept of stem cells in normal tissue, stem cells are important for normal tissue renewal.

401
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,860
And one of their features is that they are self-renewing by asymmetric division.

402
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:01,230
So when they divide, they give rise to one copy of the cells and to one differentiated cell.

403
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,429
So a population derived from a stem cell changes over time.

404
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:11,430
But you always have that basal cell population, the stem cells still present that can further renew itself.

405
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,490
The stem cells are long lived, are immortal in tissue, and they have multiple potential differentiation phase.

406
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,660
Okay. So depending on the level that you look at, obviously the ultimate stem cells, the zygote,

407
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:32,070
a total stem cell that can form any tissue in the body, embryonic stem cells can form many different tissue types.

408
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:38,400
So those are pluripotent. And then in an adult organism, we are talked about in the liver, in the gut,

409
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:44,100
we have tissue stem cells that can form many differentiated cell types for that tissue.

410
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,019
Okay. So stem cells by definition have many potential functionalities.

411
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:54,420
And how many different differentiation fates they have depends a little bit on what kind of stem cell it is.

412
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,210
In normal conditions, stem cell niches and tissue are very controlled.

413
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,670
So this is the code. Again, at the base of the colon glands, there is an area called the crypt.

414
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:12,930
That's where the tissue stem cells of the colon are located. And when they divide, they generate one copy of themselves.

415
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:20,010
So they repopulate the STEM niche and then they generate a data cell that differentiates either becomes one of the goes up,

416
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:27,300
becomes one of these differentiate itself, or it can form a pet itself, which is a specialized cell at the base of the crypt, but differentiates.

417
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,110
That's normal, right? That's normal stem cells.

418
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:41,040
Let's look at tumors. I talked about initiation, the acquisition of an initiating mutation at the start with the formation of the first tumor cell.

419
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,559
But if you look at a mature tumor, mature tumors have cells that are actually very heterogenous.

420
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,570
There's a lots of different mutations in those types of cells. And that's because the initial cell.

421
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:59,520
So here we have that tumor cell divides itself. And as it goes, all the daughter cells can potentially acquire different mutations,

422
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,560
but it doesn't become that all those cells necessarily going to survive to the end.

423
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,820
Some of them are still they're going to start to express abnormal proteins so the immune system could recognize them and destroy those cells.

424
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,970
So some cells are going to die off depending on what control mechanism they're still vulnerable to.

425
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,740
By the time you get to the detectable, mature tumor, all of these cells were originally derived from the same clone.

426
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,300
But the tumor itself is heterogeneous because all the daughter cells in it

427
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,890
come from different lineages and it potentially acquired different properties.

428
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,110
So that anywhere along those lines, that's why I took the tumor here.

429
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,490
I have some cells in the tumor that are going to go on and I have some cells that are fated to die.

430
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:52,650
Right. So if I take an example of this tumor here, not all the cells in that tumor are equally likely to continue to proliferate.

431
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,180
So that's kind of a hierarchical model of tumor development.

432
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:05,100
So if I have a mature tumor and I associated it to all its different cell types, not every cell in the tumor,

433
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:11,940
if I template it like in an immunosuppressed mouse, is likely to continue to proliferate and form a tumor itself.

434
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,340
Hopefully some cells in the tumor have the potential to perpetuate the tumor.

435
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:27,780
Okay. So analogous to the situation of tissue in a tumor itself, there are cells that you would think of as stem cells for the tumor.

436
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,469
So those are cancer stem cells that are lived within the tumor and have the potential to

437
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:39,900
perpetuate themselves and to give rise to all the other cell types generating the tumor.

438
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,850
Okay. So cells within the tumor that can give rise to new tumors.

439
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:53,760
If I were to dissociate the thing and put it into mice, cells within the tumor that can give rise to new traverse are considered cancer stem cells.

440
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,250
And so if we think about malignancy in a tumor in our two scenarios.

441
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,630
We can either have features of malignancy that are acquired by the initiating cell population.

442
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,880
Right. So we have a normal hepatocyte undergoes a mutation that's the first cancer cell.

443
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:15,800
But in order to become an invasive tumor, it has to acquire a ton of additional mutations.

444
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:25,340
Right. That's going to take a long time. So that in that case, the cancer stem cell, that that first initiated cell population,

445
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:30,740
it's going to take a long period of time before it acquires enough additional mutations to form a tumor.

446
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,720
So that is an example of how many cancers appear in old age.

447
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,870
You know, if they're originated from a differentiated cell type,

448
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,500
because it takes a really long period of time for those additional mutations to occur.

449
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:51,210
Conversely, we have some tumors that occur to children or proceed very rapidly from the point of first detection.

450
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,300
If you have the initiating cell, the first cell that gives rise to the tumor,

451
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:03,680
if that initiating mutation takes place in a cell that already has some cancer like properties,

452
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:10,460
that tumor has left the additional mutations necessary to acquire to give rise to a tumor.

453
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,550
Okay. So there are some correlation.

454
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:24,380
If the initiating cell population is not very differentiated, what if you have an initiated tissue stem cell?

455
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,280
Those tend to be tumors that grow more aggressively and more rapidly.

456
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,509
So the nature of the initiating cancer stem cell,

457
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,940
whether it's a differentiated cell or a poorly differentiated or an undifferentiated or just

458
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:44,960
cell that can dictate to some degree the outcome or the progression of that tumor makes sense.

459
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,750
So this is an example from thyroid cancer.

460
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:54,440
In thyroid cancer, there's different types of cancer, and the most aggressive one is anaplastic thyroid cancer.

461
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,130
So one strategy would be if you have a mature thyroid cell,

462
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,520
it just requires lots of mutations that the most aggressive one happened a long time in the future.

463
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,830
But there's evidence that in fact,

464
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:17,810
the thyroid cancer is that arrived at fetal thyroid stem cells are already kind of predisposed to form the anaplastic poorly differentiated cancers.

465
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,680
So there is there are some car types that actually, because of the nature of the cell in which they arise,

466
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,680
have a higher likelihood to have an aggressive outcome than other cell,

467
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,670
other tumor types that have to arrive at a differentiated cell and have to acquire all those mutations.

468
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:43,310
Okay, that's that. So that's your stem cell theory of carcinogenesis only some cells within the tumor can perpetuated.

469
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:50,540
And our corollary to that was that the nature of the cell that starts the tumor can to some degree dictate its progression.

470
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,180
Um, I think I want to skip through that. So there's a thought question here.

471
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,140
So let's do the start question. What does this mean in terms of therapy?

472
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,000
Like, how do you treat cancer? Have you thoughts on that?

473
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,520
But there's just like some running theory of like personalized medicine in work as a means to link

474
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,030
these individuals either hybrid like stem cell or hybrid unified something to different conditions.

475
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,640
Yeah. So to some degree, so like you might be able genetically to kind of classify tumors into different areas,

476
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,900
but like when you treat tumors, a lot of times they'll do a couple of things.

477
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:33,220
You might use radiation therapy, right, to arrest the rapidly proliferating cells.

478
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,000
You might use surgery to debunk the tumors, you might use chemotherapy, but in some.

479
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:43,010
So that might get rid of the tumor ostensibly. But in some individuals, the tumors regrow.

480
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,250
If there are only certain cells of the tumor that can give rise to a neutral are.

481
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,069
What's pivotal to important in your therapy is not just debulking.

482
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:56,480
It's not just removing all the cells that already potentially are destined to die.

483
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:02,960
If you have any of those cancer stem cells remaining in the body, there is the potential for that tumor to recur.

484
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:10,940
Right. So therapy kind of has to be geared or we have to be able to detect whether any of those altered cancer stem cells remain.

485
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:18,860
And that's kind of the end goal, a follow up or of our therapies to try to how do we detect those minuscule remaining cells?

486
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,580
Because that's what dictates whether you're going to there's going to be a recurrence or not.

487
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:28,670
Or if you can't get rid of those cells, how do we affect the downstream events that cause them to proliferate?

488
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,930
Maybe we can keep them in a quiescent state so that we don't have that recur.

489
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:39,380
Okay. The last few slides, you can probably they're pretty self-explanatory to go through on your own,

490
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:45,170
but it's a review of the concepts that many different factors can contribute to cancer formation.

491
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:54,770
You've got a genetic predisposition like we talked about the ABC, but remember that 95% of cancers actually have no no inherited predisposition.

492
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,210
Right. So it's not all genetics. You can have environmental.

493
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,000
Factors that we've talked about that might affect the proliferation of cells.

494
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,510
So you can modify those factors. It's the easiest one to modify.

495
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:14,100
But there is also an element of chance of cancer. And cancer is kind of the flip side, the price we pay for evolution, right?

496
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,380
Because every time our cells divide, we have the potential for new mutations to be acquired.

497
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,600
And that's what drives the evolution. Right.

498
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:28,720
So on a cellular level, you kind of want there to be some looseness because you might be able to acquire a mutation that's beneficial to the cell.

499
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,670
But there's also a chance that a mutation that you acquire, you know,

500
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,950
will enhance the cells survival and proliferation, but that can be detrimental to the organism.

501
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:43,440
So every time you have a round of DNA replication, it brings the mutation risk, the risk.

502
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:51,090
And over time, like in later life, we'll have acquired a lot of those, which is why cancer, for the most part,

503
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:57,630
is a disease that the age the incidents occurred later in life because you've had more time to acquire these mutations.

504
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,310
Okay. All right. So that was a lot of stuff.

505
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,820
But that's a nice lecture for breakthrough concepts.

506
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:11,610
It's kind of a fun one to hear some of the things you did, you know, from this or from the cartoon.

507
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,710
This animal protection alert. The wild populations of these animals are almost gone.

508
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:27,240
Growth. Growth picture. They're these horrible tumors called devil facial tumor, the transmissible tumor of the Tasmanian devil.

509
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:33,810
This is the ultimate cell advantage, evolutionary advantage story.

510
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,930
These tumors are actually spread by contact. These are aggressive animals that when they fight with each other because a lot of wounds,

511
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,640
the tumors, these numbers are currently able to have almost wiped out the wild populations.

512
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,760
And each tumor is more genetically similar to the other tumors than to the host animal.

513
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,650
Because what's actually happened, these cells have acquired so many proliferation mutations,

514
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:04,260
they actually are physically kind of placed on the other animal when they're fighting and then take hold and proliferate,

515
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,310
like they can evade the immune system. They can evade the new tissue and proliferate.

516
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,230
So they've become almost independent of the originating organism in their capacity to proliferate.

517
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,810
This is one of only two known tumors that does that.

518
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:22,950
That's a great example of how the cellular level cancer is basically acquiring different survival advantages.

519
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,730
So several facial tumor categories. All right, thanks, guys.

520
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,420
I will put those presentations first.

521
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,260
I wasn't born that.
