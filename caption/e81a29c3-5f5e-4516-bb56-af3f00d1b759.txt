1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,880
Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. Harmful algal blooms, one that was a major reason causing harmful algal blooms.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,020
With. One of the major reason why we have these harmful algal blooms is the agricultural sector.

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,660
Agriculture practice. I was just going to say like I believe requirement for microorganisms.

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,170
How beauty. Okay.

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,190
So agriculture practice.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:47,510
Ideally, what our priorities are we can think of is that climate change could be a one way, one where temperature would be so major reasons.

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,510
One of them is the nutrient phosphorus nitrogen anymore.

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,980
Okay, so we'll have our means now almost every year, every place.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,300
Do some reason, some seasonal and other.

10
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,490
What is harmful algal blooms and can't get figured out. But our bloom is pretty common.

11
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:20,270
Alright. Okay. If you're leaving the neighborhood sometime, even in bad times or even in small leagues,

12
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,140
it these outbuildings during the season and it becomes this opcode is neutrons will produce the what.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,760
One of the major readings of vitamins and nutrients, especially in the form of fresh water, phosphorus.

14
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,960
We add too much phosphorus. That's. Korean War here.

15
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,920
It's really the algal blooms. So this this lizard was prepared by Judy used.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,660
We collaborate work on this topic in the Great Lakes.

17
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:00,890
She left the environmental. Protection Agency laboratory here on the island or somewhere south south of Ann Arbor.

18
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,790
But she left here for Seattle, I think still will compete.

19
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:14,990
But we used to work together on this topic and go to go to the lakes to collect the samples of this.

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,810
So she's monitoring what's going on in the Great Lakes, in the different stations.

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,350
I've tried to get the water samples and to look at the anybody who uses other presence in the water.

22
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:36,700
But she left a couple of years ago by the sea. She used to give the guest lectures in this class as she prepared.

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:46,180
The first slides I think is very useful. So I had to redo the work because she's doing all this very, very comprehensive work on this topic.

24
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,400
So some outlines that you should just hang our balloons.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,880
And then with home health risks, especially, what are the factors that contribute to the algal blooms?

26
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,420
And then what can we do? How would you take them? How to manage them?

27
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,330
Harmful algal blooms is produced healthy. I would planktonic photosynthetic organisms,

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:17,800
high concentrations of CO2 that's called the harmful algal blooms so prolific throughout the waters is not only in the United States, it's everywhere.

29
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:27,730
You can go to any place now in the world. You promise algal blooms due to some hypertension and in some places it was place is less.

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
But in the United States, we kind of make it under control.

31
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,879
In the seventies, eighties. And those come back. It's come back.

32
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,090
That's that's a that's one of the problems. And then the red tide sometimes I've been in the Florida.

33
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:51,280
We have this red tide protozoans. Okay. Some of them, especially from the Mexico Gulf Bay area,

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,689
there's a the the Mississippi River from Mississippi is still a mystery remains the in

35
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,120
the gulf and introduced a lot of high concentration of the nutrients into the Gulf.

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,620
And then what we have is really the danger that they will become bigger and bigger we'll

37
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,209
talk about because these algal blooms there and then that's cause you use all the oxygen,

38
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,650
the water. Good. Oh, you in the water.

39
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:26,640
And then that becomes what isn't in the in the, in the, in these excuse from the kind of different species of our.

40
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:34,750
You can find it on the green and then in the coastal areas, for example, this is took up out of coastal areas, the Marine.

41
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,360
But you can see all these algal blooms almost everywhere in the coastline.

42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:50,160
So here we can see that the Great Lakes, all the coastal area now you see probably oh, we're going to see a lot of this is talk about the Marine.

43
00:04:50,190 --> 00:05:01,110
I was very willing to go fishing and what albums you will find here and what are you can see here basically is algal blooms in all the coastal areas.

44
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:09,960
And this is most common freshwater lagoons because the bacteria algal blooms.

45
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:20,050
And this is what it looks like. Do a summer. So that during the summer some people say, oh, it's pretty beautiful, it's green color.

46
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,210
Okay. But it's not great, is it? And it is easy.

47
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,230
And then it's floating on top of the of the of the water.

48
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,640
So here in the summer, if it was a lake or fort for lake.

49
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,950
Just downstream of Ann Arbor, you'll see something like this.

50
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:49,570
So I went there and won't go there. Worse and worse, we try to to look at the balloons.

51
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,990
We take a boat. And this is exactly like this.

52
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,420
Okay. Exactly like this. And then you'll see this cost of sales and on top of it.

53
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:07,300
So we'll see why they why they need that. So this is a common cyanobacteria.

54
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,050
The general here. Most common.

55
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:19,540
And my course is just. And also like the Sierra, some other species.

56
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,040
What you can see here. This is a class them with cells.

57
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:33,210
It's not individual cells. But if any of the seals that get sometimes houses a Jedi like structure shell and pulling together,

58
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,630
getting them to get it so they can get inside of those individual seals.

59
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,870
But this is a cluster. And sometimes those have the chance to see these.

60
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,220
So it's like one seal wants the ones, so they need to get good.

61
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:55,650
This is a very common and clear expression is, again, a very beautiful chain structure.

62
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,670
This is individual, individual seals. And they also have a differentiation.

63
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,530
And we're going to see a lot of really but sometimes you'll see the picture here.

64
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,650
The SEALs looks the same, but they have different function.

65
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,460
Sometimes they have these differences that one seal defensively, the other type have different functions for that to try to fix nitrogen.

66
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,770
One of them. Okay. So so that's how it looks like.

67
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,670
And then what happened here with this costume altogether, it's very difficult to separate them,

68
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:33,930
try to separate them because they form this polymer exceeds the polo form, the juvenile structure put in capsule them so they're protected.

69
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,230
Okay. And they also have these that I guess we all read the seals get bubble in the SEALs sometime.

70
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,220
That's reason why they can. Fruit on top of the surface of.

71
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,340
Okay. So that's how these cells looks like an old looks like a blue green because they have the pigments in the in the seals.

72
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,290
Again, this is if you see the the causes, especially of the mycosis,

73
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:09,379
just as how it looks like the classes different ways that they're closer together and or having also sometimes inside is

74
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:17,160
causes some of the microorganisms that accumulated you also you have to empathize with them in this field with students.

75
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,920
So about each field individuals, there's about five microns.

76
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,370
That's about the size they have. And again, this is in the clinics.

77
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,740
This is how it looks like. So some of you may see this during the summer, especially in the in the Bay Area.

78
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,850
It closes a little bit. Yeah. You can see this is algal blooms.

79
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:45,140
This is a high coverage. But even with this, there's also the SEALs see the SEALs floating on top of it.

80
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:54,930
Okay. That's why our blooms can find in these. So [INAUDIBLE] work to took next looks.

81
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,830
On Wednesday, we'll talk more about this murky position for some information here.

82
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, actually, that's one of the issues we have is during the summer in some regions, we have these very thick algal blooms in this area.

83
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,980
So why do we worry about how a prince.

84
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:24,239
Surely there's a lot of issues with that. Okay. Do you get the warm coating that your pissed older losses recreational use of make

85
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,729
the cops here or looks the conditions and then the reef fish some some fish cannot

86
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,570
really survive there and the older these the foot waves and sometimes and and the

87
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,100
most the one of the problem really is a toxin producer they can produce toxins.

88
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:54,299
Okay you know they the the the toxin to the zoo practice of fish animals and also humans and some dogs especially when they drink

89
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:03,690
the water from the pond directly and they can kill you killed that because the toxins they have the collider in the several

90
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:12,540
years ago the how to shut down the the Waterman plant because these algal blooms they have for for the some of the some of

91
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,380
the tricks of a few years ago and that's really brought attention to this issue especially in the drinking water community.

92
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,900
The, the, the, the, the, the toxin that produce one of the most sensitive produces tobacco.

93
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,330
You. That's a toxin that produces about toxin toxins.

94
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,920
They have the damage to these the livestock wildlife birth place but also to the human health.

95
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:51,540
So one of the issue is really the most severe, like diarrhea with cramps from the healthy but irritation and then they also new would damage.

96
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,410
Okay exposure causing new damage.

97
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,580
There's a study there's a study pilot.

98
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:13,160
Unfortunately, Ohio is one of the states that have the the the higher incidence occurrence of algal blooms every the in the live snakes in the rivers.

99
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,060
What they found is that the.

100
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:24,490
Now. Never a la iconic, never vanish.

101
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:34,760
Associated correlates with the concentration of the other being defunct in college.

102
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:44,590
It is a weak correlation, but also that these the algal blooms could cause this chronic impact on the human health and.

103
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,100
So this is a tablet that you recommend you explore an image as a 20 gram,

104
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,860
100 micrograms per liter, and therefore the drinking water is one Michael Company.

105
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:10,690
Because that's we, the Nimitz Explorer, Nimitz we have recommended so that it will not impact the health or reduce risk.

106
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:23,950
So be the Explorer to the hoaxes, not only through the drinking, the war, or you have the full body contact and Evans aerosols.

107
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:32,590
So one of the study from one of the faculty is and the house was moved to the to the chemistry.

108
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,240
So what they found is that we can find the toxin to take.

109
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,670
We go to the Great Lakes? Definitely. If you look at the beach, it is heavy.

110
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,870
Although beneath you can find you can you can find any of the cultures.

111
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:55,570
You know that I mean is if used for €10 time that could potentially be exposed to the properties.

112
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,610
So that's not the major. Okay. The major is truth of the water.

113
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,190
But that's another alternative rise you could expose to the to the to these.

114
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,420
So, again, drinking water, water activity full way, way.

115
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:21,190
Sometimes you have the supply of supplements. Can also include to the toxins they try to extract and then they could contain.

116
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,510
They will not separate the toxins from the extract. So this is one of the products you can think of.

117
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,620
You can find interesting effects.

118
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:37,070
As a matter of fact, if there's no toxin produced, the algae is great nutrient supplement.

119
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,870
Okay. You can, you can, you can, you can. If there's no toxins.

120
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,070
This is great. So some people said, well, let's try to do this way.

121
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,270
Okay. So now we are worried about the water contamination nutrients.

122
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,850
The the the organic matter is this killer will produce.

123
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,750
Let's go to the algae so we can make a food supplement.

124
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:10,470
The problem we cannot really enjoy is that's how you can ensure that they don't produce toxic.

125
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,120
It's not easy to separate the toxin producing bacteria with nontoxic.

126
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,990
The supplements are not. They do not need to be duplicative under FDA regulation.

127
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,820
So some of these nuts it's the this is.

128
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,629
Yeah. This is another another fields that needed more attention in terms of how they came to have house if you

129
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:41,030
go to a supplements or you go through so many different supplements and the regulations there is kind of.

130
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:50,980
Great. So. And by the billions, there will have to be something.

131
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:57,820
They have very good opinions. Okay. And as you can imagine, I mean, it's just difficult to imagine how many people believe we'll take the supplements.

132
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:06,490
Okay. I mean, something sometimes is good. I mean, some some of them the the the the essential elements you probably need.

133
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,140
And that's demonstrates. But the in terms of the clinical study.

134
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,710
They claim they have a lot of health benefits.

135
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,960
But there's no clinical study to demonstrate that those other drugs did, but they don't really see that.

136
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,190
But clinical study of good control can study for that purpose.

137
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:34,480
So that's sometimes that's the issue we have. But then next week, we'll talk about the regulation, why we don't really regulate some of this.

138
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,319
Okay. And then some people swim and their why do that?

139
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,710
Okay. I mean, if we see this, some people really swim like that.

140
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,440
And and I mean, when I was a kid, okay, I was a student probably like this one.

141
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,700
I could swim. I was swimming. I don't know. I mean, that's was right.

142
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:03,330
And we really like the thumbprint of people's attention because they use media to take pieces of pictures here.

143
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:10,620
But they really it causes health issues here, maybe in Australia.

144
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,590
140 children that was hospitalized with this diarrhea effects.

145
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,090
In the Pennsylvania. We also see people in the field coordinate who work.

146
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,900
That's just that. Just because this yellow potato thing they produced in Florida.

147
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:39,970
We also have this. The cases like Ebola extremists is gathering symptoms.

148
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:48,330
That's the the the demonstrated to people has these health consequences and people even die from that.

149
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,270
Okay. For example, one of the kids in Wisconsin.

150
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,010
The swim in the golf course pond. And during the day, you get the feedback.

151
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,940
Because, you know, with the Gulf there, sure, it is algal blooms during summer in Florida.

152
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,830
So and then in the in the year seven day.

153
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,620
76 people died from this oak fire in the local water supply.

154
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,479
If we don't do a good job. So and this, like an animal like dogs is pretty common.

155
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,230
You can see that when the truth out of water contains.

156
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,630
Contains the algal blooms and especially the toxin producing the seals.

157
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:52,840
So we already talk about the liver cancer, which if you are exposed to that, you may be able to develop this hepatitis B or Nuba cancer chronically.

158
00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:03,640
And there's not only a chronic liver symptoms also associated with occurrence of algal blooms in these areas.

159
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,700
Okay. So or how is one of the things an example for that?

160
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,920
Fish could also as a human explorer because Aedes force fish with a full wave

161
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,110
so that toxin could accumulate in the fish and then they can be B in this.

162
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:32,440
So again, this is the concentration of the toxins recommended by the the.

163
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,640
W.H.O. and EPA for the.

164
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,480
Again. The continuity shall be for the jugular, to be one of the leaders contributions as the maximum you can find.

165
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,150
Okay, so here is the symptom of disease.

166
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:05,620
How much for the fish and. I mean, today, if the contamination was there, you'll be able to expose to high concentration of the lead with toxins.

167
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,690
So you have this portable one micro one microphone for little toxins.

168
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:18,400
That's recommended. We have not regulated this. Yes. In the United States, this is recommending concentrations of recommended concentrations.

169
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:35,950
So I think it was the phones the try to find the trophy that the in the fish tissue they keep the fish samples of yellow bullets, for example.

170
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,990
And then they look at these toxins in the in the fish.

171
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,040
So this is the fight effects. This is in the Negro.

172
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,310
Okay. And this is the muscle. The muscle contusion is pretty low.

173
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,050
I mean, you see this give you. Okay. MG And this is in the never.

174
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:09,780
So basically the, the concentration of the thought is in the Negro but in the muscle is not really very high.

175
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,390
So that's could be okay. I mean, for the for the, for the for the fish consumption.

176
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:27,160
So think about the age of the fish. Most of these toxins or all these contaminants in the Negro or in the in the in the fat tissue,

177
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,650
the fat tissue, normally the muscle kind of place much less, much less.

178
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,090
So think about this. We some culture, we eat organs of the animals.

179
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,160
And that's not be a good practice because especially never never commit all this talk a lot of different type of into it.

180
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,070
That's one of the people try to get rid of these toxic products.

181
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,470
That's also the where they accumulate by some some culture they really like to eat liver.

182
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,320
That's that's that's that's something that's not. But anyway.

183
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,620
We were talking that's the kids you can see from the lever and this very high concentrated the other places.

184
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:18,830
So this is a lake. They try to find the concentration of the systems in the water.

185
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,860
Look in the water. So here you can see the W.H.O. is microgram per liter.

186
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,470
It's 20 micrograms per liter for the recreational purpose.

187
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:37,250
If you do the full body swim and most of these places like high tide that so as indicate that's probably it's no good idea to swim in that water.

188
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:48,140
Okay. You know what we look at the. Recreationally, it's 20 microgram per liter.

189
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,170
And then if you look at these numbers, you. That's much higher.

190
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,530
There is this with places like surface water and this.

191
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,400
So it's coastal parallel to some of the fish.

192
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,690
And then again, if you look at the fish, yes, the lever is one of the issue tissue they have in the mussels.

193
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:21,140
The country's is much, much lower. And that. Okay.

194
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,459
So. But even with all this, think about the human health effects.

195
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,130
If you compare the rate of the risk income, the life expectancy loss.

196
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,920
So the first of all, institutional carcinogens, I mean, yeah, we, we,

197
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,420
we worry about this, but, but the effects, the, the, the expenses loss is pretty low.

198
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:56,280
And the pesticides, the foods exposed to the need pollution, the drinking mode, driving motorcycles, vehicles, I mean, you can see 207.

199
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,180
And we still try to worry about it. But if it's on the drinking water, this is a big deal.

200
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,170
Big news here. And a smoking. Another big issue is smoking.

201
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:15,740
Smoking is because of our life expectancy, loss and likely rates in the United States.

202
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,140
We kind of been like a lot of places, banned smoking in the United States.

203
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,410
But you still see people smoke. And in the hospital.

204
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:36,530
Every year in Michigan, we've lost some of the physicians, the smoking cell, and you see them come out in the winter.

205
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,520
It's not a good season to smoke in Michigan.

206
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:48,170
It's too close to a cloud of smoke. Some people still do that. I mean, let's let's just the American male is 35.

207
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:57,260
This is pretty risky activities. But what you can see here or you can see here the drinking water effects.

208
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:03,860
When we think about the risk associated with drinking water. Relatively low risk compared with other activities.

209
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,990
When I ran, I still could be a big news.

210
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,440
Anything for that? Was it? Well, if I invite you inside, you get your everyday skills.

211
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:28,190
I mean, I remember I was doing the research with the Canadian cardinal so that the reporter from the CBS that, well, she brought the water to my left.

212
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,690
I do a test. I say I'll find something easier.

213
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,380
I mean, it's usually a it and then people piece. Okay.

214
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:44,410
But in fact, as a matter of fact, the real impact from that is very, very similar.

215
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,120
And I told him, I say, don't just just kill people.

216
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,180
I mean, this is this almost. And I wasn't.

217
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:01,580
Mozilo responded very, very well. No. And she still writes the article and calls on people switching to the, quote order.

218
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,820
I feel very bad about it. I mean, that's the communication.

219
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:15,920
But just look at this here. If you look at the risks, there's many, many other risk activities and the people are still doing it.

220
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,810
And then they. Okay.

221
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,560
Now, what factors really contribute to the harmful algal blooms?

222
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:33,420
Or facts that contribute to the harmful algal blooms. First why they produce toxic.

223
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,610
Okay. So why are the bacteria produce toxins? Why these organisms that produce toxin?

224
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,950
Because that produced toxins try to have them. I mean, everything I think about the biology,

225
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,259
everything will produce what calls energy for this cause unusual substitute for

226
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,749
this dominant we have the purpose of could produce obviously is not just random.

227
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:02,440
The produce was a biological system. When they produce something must have a meaningful event sometime.

228
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,370
We don't know may not be able to understand the use of that.

229
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:13,720
But, um, but the the, the, the, the, the purpose, the, some products for that products have to be some purpose.

230
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:21,080
So these are secondary metabolites. There's no really in the primary metabolism metabolism.

231
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:28,720
But they could have some anti grazer and bacteria and you found fungal active to protect them

232
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:37,210
can more attractants for microbial community but also could be camel attracted for nutrients,

233
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,890
more of animals some of some other elements.

234
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,250
One of the one of the reason we tried to do the study is say whether this is what we also accredit as a key data for hiring in the war.

235
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,230
So one of the ways in the water, there's not much growth.

236
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,900
So one of the reasons I think that I will contribute in the water is still not.

237
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:14,850
Now we know any cell function we need I.D. So in fact, we have kind of competed for our like our body for what we need.

238
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,880
And then the packages. The packages also knew I could have Piper ultimately.

239
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,380
So sometimes they compete with us. And then what do they use?

240
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:35,670
They use the high affinity. And that's what happened also could be for these algal blooms that when they produce these toxins and they can.

241
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,910
Kim is buying these items and they uptake them and then see that everybody goes back.

242
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,160
There could be other reasons for that. So what can see how it becomes toxic?

243
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:05,210
Most of these the other blue that nobody talks anybody can see some some toxic and then you can see some some of the

244
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:16,670
conditions promote the growth of the toxic strains and they just describes and then you find the most toxic community here.

245
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:25,040
And then sometimes you also have this toxic producing, but they have to produce the toxins if the strains are toxic, but they have to produce.

246
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,720
And then some conditions we can think of could also promote the the the this.

247
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:41,760
This is very quick. But what it conditions. That really impacts the growth and affecting production.

248
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:53,430
And in that process, I have a condition that I can't think of. So you have to have the nutrients as the algal blooms.

249
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,980
One of the key factors that have the nutrients, phosphorus is a key for the fresh water that you could be from for the for the very water.

250
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:08,590
But the phosphorus is a key nutrients that it needs to promote the growth of Iowa blooms and humble blooms.

251
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,530
And then what is the light? Okay.

252
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,390
We do have the lights. But if this is a lack of.

253
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:32,390
Fix the cover to the sugar collection issue to hydrate, then use a light for the new light voice and then the temperature.

254
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:40,310
The temperature will be above 20 Celsius because that's the temperature, the otherwise resonant time.

255
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:49,250
What does that mean? If you have really flow fast flow water, they will not be able to accumulate.

256
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,930
They will not be able to cut the growth of the.

257
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:01,420
The algo sales are pretty slow. So we found the thruway high for Lewis.

258
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,969
They will not be able to. I created a commission and then some some grading.

259
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:13,190
Some could be like the the the other algorithms they try to grade on this.

260
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,440
I'll go please. So you can see here to make these algal blooms.

261
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,100
Okay. Although we have this problem all the time.

262
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:32,990
I try to get to this. I will grooms if you have have the right conditions, but they have the right to just that also can give you some hints.

263
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,970
How can we control them? Okay. How can control them?

264
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,800
Think about the this factors which factor will take control.

265
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,630
Nutrients and other kind of nutrients that we can control.

266
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,350
Right. Can we control the lice? Probably not.

267
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,750
Can we control the temperature? We cannot control the bedtime.

268
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:07,090
Cannot sometimes some of what we cannot control. But this this could be controlled because of these zebra mussels.

269
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,460
Some of the the the mussels, invasive species.

270
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,340
What you could use. But since you can take any choice, you choose.

271
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,120
Okay. Nice. Cannot control.

272
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,750
So that also determines why we're only observing the summer.

273
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,040
Okay. In the summer. In the summer, there was temperature with hot.

274
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:45,020
Sometime in the last time, August. September can't see that in the in the big lakes in the pond, but not really in the river.

275
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,820
Okay. In the like a river is only civil.

276
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,550
Some of the sections we can find is algal blooms.

277
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:59,060
But like in the in the, in the, in the river itself, we will not be able to see the group, the algal blooms.

278
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:09,290
So when you look at these horrible, for example, the foliage, then the water flow very slow and then the cat community.

279
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,490
But in the section over here, we don't really see much. Okay.

280
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,370
That's the because the flu every the same river in the same river for that.

281
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:27,830
So try to remember remember the thing about all we have to fulfill all these conditions.

282
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:37,650
We all these conditions to get our produce, get our brooms, and then the only one factors, basically we take control.

283
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,790
Okay. Thank you. So you told the management. That's the best one can do.

284
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:56,880
The best way we can do. Again, the this is another effect is just show you the conditions.

285
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,890
The the one of the problems is that we have the nutrients.

286
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,350
Nutrients only not only from the runoffs. But ozone could come from the sediments.

287
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:18,830
Okay. If it's possible, you can reduce the release of the phosphorus ammonia and then could feed this algal bloom.

288
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,260
SEALs and the seals will also float into the top. Okay.

289
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,849
Some of this reduces the crazy, but here you can see the temperature.

290
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:34,000
Again, it's just the key factors and then the low through high resistance time is also another factor.

291
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:41,850
So here all these factors can contribute to the algal blooms and they will emit all these conditions for either pounding the lakes.

292
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:48,120
And if you have the high flow of the nutrients, then you'll see our blooms.

293
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,250
Okay. That's really the United States. And again, this is another show.

294
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:03,840
Yes. Because in the red is how these nutrients imported from the communities, from industry and also from the from the sediments.

295
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:14,580
From the sediments, then you'll see algal blooms that our blooms will cause the decrease the use of algae when they'll be degraded.

296
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:30,210
And that's can be the big issue. So one of the ideas, some of these crazy, smart, intelligent scientists shows us, how can we can we capture the CO2?

297
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,880
Okay. Those algal blooms you can see here, algal blooms.

298
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,090
They can capture CO2. That we can capture CO2.

299
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,620
Fix it. So let's go to the big ocean.

300
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,990
Mist spray on islands in the water. There's why I raise the ones the limiting factor for other bands to go.

301
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,559
Okay. And then then what I do,

302
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:06,960
I say this this just spread the I will balloons in the the eye is spread Irene the water ocean and then we can promote the growth of our to fix the

303
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:17,040
sea seem to okay but they didn't think about with the other ecological impact but every major we have the experiments we have a the in the Gulf.

304
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,910
Okay. We have a desert in the Gulf. How could you do that? So.

305
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,950
But anyway. And neutrons.

306
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,680
We can see all of the nutrients from different places zebra mussels.

307
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:37,760
One of the issues here in the in the Great Lakes invasive species is zebra mussels.

308
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:48,080
Zebra mussels, they come here and then the filter, one of the reason they also filters the particulars as to make the water so clean.

309
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,910
And then light can penetrate. Okay. They also count.

310
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:01,280
It's interesting that we can also the zebra mussels like the algae, they can eat the algae,

311
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,690
but they can't selectively eat the long toxic algae cells that toxic.

312
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:14,390
They can take them out. It's bad enough so that what happens now you have more toxic students in the workforce.

313
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,780
So that's the thesis here, Nancy. Okay.

314
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,680
Let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about the detective and monetary.

315
00:38:17,890 --> 00:40:23,450
Yeah. If. So.

316
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:42,240
So how can we monitor detect the movements of toxic algal blooms of our blooms?

317
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:50,100
So the EPA has a pretty comprehensive program on the market algal blooms in the region and in the Great Lakes, for example.

318
00:40:50,610 --> 00:41:02,040
So there's multiple ways you can look at the scale of our blooms in the in the Great Lakes, not to mention in small ponds, but in the Great Lakes.

319
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,120
How can we do that? You have these ships, the sample to talk about, but also satellite imagery.

320
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:15,780
So we then we use the satellite image. You can also already see the algal blooms lake area, for example.

321
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:22,970
That's the the you can monitor the progress of the algal blooms and then we'll do that in visual in situ sensor,

322
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,040
but also have some molecular methods we'll talk about.

323
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,900
So, for example, this is one of the boats they use to do the monitoring.

324
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,480
And. And this is a location for the for the sample location station here.

325
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,990
One of the area is the lake area. And this area will be okay.

326
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:52,799
So it'll be it's a common is pretty frequent occurs and then the lake area here presumably that's

327
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,380
also a larger location you see high occurrence of the algal blooms you may wonder why that.

328
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,660
While we see all the algal blooms in this region.

329
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,400
Industries, industry like lack of water flow, like water flow.

330
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:31,580
Any other factors you can think of? We don't really see much the superior.

331
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:42,080
For example, we don't see much that they're. This is a very high frequency occurred in the second would be.

332
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:49,510
And then make area in these locations. In Saginaw Bay, isn't it?

333
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,710
I don't know if it's industrial or more farmland agriculture.

334
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,850
This is from Flint River, for example. All these. Discharge.

335
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:06,200
You just aggravate. Okay. In these areas, the nutrients discharge into this area is pretty high.

336
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,940
And then the flow goes in the Bay Area through relatively speaking, is lower than the Big Lakes here.

337
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:23,520
And then, for example, here, Lake Erie here, if if you think about the contamination in the Great Lakes for these areas,

338
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:34,860
it's a lot higher contaminated because of this flow concentrated and also in charge from from other locations used to be highly industrial area.

339
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:41,190
So and then the temperature. Okay.

340
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,750
The temperature thing about the temperature. Most of the places for Lake Superior, we don't really see algal blooms cold.

341
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,050
Okay. Really. And also the discharge of neutrals into this is pretty low.

342
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:02,130
As a matter of fact, the Lake Superior, some of these locations, we cannot really support the fish anymore because these nutrients discharges.

343
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,130
No. So we kind of destroyed the full weight for the fish in this area.

344
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:18,320
That. But this area like this here is pretty high tech and you see the secular.

345
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:26,890
If you look at this, the the map here, this is the stations we have to watch for the monitoring.

346
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:32,620
But if you look at these maps, you'll see it's pretty high contaminates areas.

347
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,980
That's for the for the data, the monitoring they use.

348
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:44,260
And then they do the monitoring. And then they also look at these algal blooms, the toxins, the concentration in the water here and.

349
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,819
And then it's through the mind moderate.

350
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:56,070
And then to see what the concentration here and the satellite image to the censoring, for example, this is what you can observe.

351
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:03,280
I will lose in this process. In these places.

352
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:11,590
And you can also check the progress of our buildings day by day, day by the fact that we can go pretty quick.

353
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:19,390
And that's the water they found, for example, in August, August, this July, this could occur.

354
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:27,490
And the August, September and especially the August is one of the sea that I will again uses.

355
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,400
Predictions. You are able to predict what the algal blooms occur along the lake area, for example.

356
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,999
And the other is we can use a sensor because a physical signing sensor this this

357
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,710
is the pigments that produce the algal bloom that produce and they use this.

358
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:56,500
The sensor is that you can calculate what's a continuation of the our blooms in the different days.

359
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,160
For example here this is a sensor they have. And then you'll see you'll be able to see what happens.

360
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,810
When you have these peaks based on the concentration of this, the pigment they produce,

361
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,180
and then this is direct sales of the algal blooms in the region.

362
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,220
Again, this is the area you can see these algal blooms occurred in this area.

363
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:30,830
It's pretty, pretty high. And then we can also have this ball sensor and this pretty complicated process.

364
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,620
But what they do is they make the the flow here.

365
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,239
And then what they do,

366
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:45,310
they collect the water samples and then do the imagery and then do the analysis and then to see what concretion of these algal blooms in that area.

367
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:52,630
Okay. In the area. And we employ a few of the Great Lakes for sampling stations like this.

368
00:46:52,900 --> 00:47:01,340
We kind of employ all these sensors, different applications, and try to monitor what's going on in the in the in the in the Great Lakes, the event.

369
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,890
And then they'll be able to see it, for example. When you have the chance to see the sea.

370
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,580
The sea. The sight of a bay here.

371
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,950
This is a sample location with predetermined. Okay.

372
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
It looks very small error close.

373
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:28,890
But if we really bowl you right a boat into the into the thing would be looks like the ocean that had a separate view.

374
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,990
So I try to get a sample from one occasion to the at is not easy.

375
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,550
Okay. It's not easy. So what do we do? One was I went out with them.

376
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,520
The samples tried to go to the different locations and they have the EPA has a special boat.

377
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:58,260
They have high speed boat. I almost vomit out when they want to come back from the to the land because he the guy who who drives the the boat is like.

378
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,430
The maximum speeds she drives so far is far.

379
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:12,050
And that's also one part of the to do the field work, you would be able to explore some of this to the side of a bay, for example.

380
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:21,379
But again, yes, the satellite imagery and then these sensors can give you the information about

381
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,310
what's going on with the methods you talked about when taking water samples.

382
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,650
These are those often do they take a long time to get the results?

383
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,770
Kind of similar to equalize? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,980
Make like some of these out this pretty quick.

385
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:49,610
And then the the this one the of the five cosine signing sensor this quick this kind of gives a real time though really because this they use,

386
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:56,030
they use the wavelengths to excite and then they will see the emission and that we can be through in real time.

387
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:02,660
It's kind of like a is use the light property of these cells to get that consideration if those are accurate.

388
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:10,460
But it's a great indication. So for example, here, this is a one of these side inputs and then what they do,

389
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:17,659
they can collect this information and then they can use wireless to trust me the data directly to the to

390
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:24,229
the to the to the to the to the to the database so that you would be able to more or less you can monitor,

391
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:29,150
like in real time what's going on. Yeah.

392
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:34,190
Imagery is is the big scale, but the reduce is very high.

393
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,969
But it still can have a sense of what's going on in the Great Lakes.

394
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:45,080
And then they have the the the lakes, for example, they have this multi prediction here.

395
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,570
This is what they use. Okay. In the lake area, they can they can produce.

396
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:59,850
So. By this, all these measures, they will not be able to kill where these toxin producing algal blooms always known toxin producing outbreaks.

397
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,170
Okay. We want to be able to sit to see that, to feel that.

398
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:11,100
So what do we need to do really to determine whether we can really see whether it's talk through a nontoxic.

399
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:16,610
Okay, folks, you are not toxic. And this is our program of sales here.

400
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:22,940
You don't really see disulfide morphology as toxic producing algae or not.

401
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:30,080
Okay. So what message that we can use, in fact, is the if you look at the genome, if you look at it,

402
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:37,730
if you look at the genome of the toxins, my sister's this is the gene cluster.

403
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,850
They used to produce toxic. Okay.

404
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:50,060
The produce policy. So if we'll be able to, for example, you take the MSI, YPG.

405
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,190
Indicate that it has the potential to produce the toxic.

406
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,480
Okay. With the toes. Is this the size?

407
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:06,390
So then you have the gene. That's how the protein to customize the size of the g of the autopsy.

408
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:14,370
So there's a crossover of the genes. Why we choose. I'm swab every swab that so we can design the primers.

409
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:24,850
All this to against it. So. So what you can see here. When we designed this how to do the Mississippi if we had to take the missing YPG.

410
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,820
And that means you can be you can detect whether they are toxic or not.

411
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,740
This is MSE YPG. This time was great for them here.

412
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:41,610
We don't really see YPG. That means they are not toxic. The that we created from these locations is not really toxic.

413
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:47,370
But in the signal before all the samples were collected. You see, they are toxic.

414
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:59,630
Okay. They are toxic. And then they use that information and then with additive to the modeling to see

415
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:06,199
where they would be able to predict the occurrence of toxic yellow algal blooms,

416
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,720
harmful algal blooms in the lake area, for example.

417
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:17,030
Okay, we created this information and they will monitor that and they will be able to hear what the algal blooms is.

418
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,720
And there was. What is a toxic on that with a toxic.

419
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:30,580
Right. That's for the detective. This ongoing is like a routine walk now as a routine walk every summer during the season.

420
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:40,330
I think they'll get ready to play July in the second half of July and then obviously the heavy season and then September.

421
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:47,770
Okay. So this year we have the warm, very warm season, full season here.

422
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:54,670
And this temperature will not be able to support the outlook, but it really has to be above like 20 Celsius.

423
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:02,450
How can we manage the harmful algal blooms not only just in the Great Lakes, but even pond?

424
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,660
How can we do that? Anyone has a small pond, clean house in them.

425
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,030
Okay. What about a small pond in the house?

426
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:16,660
In the backyard? You do? So how do you control your other.

427
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,860
You know how to control this algal bloom in the summer? Well, usually it's technically part of.

428
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,810
Oakland County's like it's big enough that under Oakland County's all.

429
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,849
Environment Department. So they usually have two guys coming in the boat and it'll be very motorboat.

430
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:46,230
They'll drive around with this boat off like a liquid and just dump on a lake and we don't respond.

431
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,160
Okay, yeah, that would be some of the work or whatever they use.

432
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,830
Okay. Covert stuff. They use this spray for that.

433
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:02,820
So what can we do to control our blooms in the integrity in a pond like this?

434
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:07,140
Okay. So physical disruption.

435
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,400
Okay, physical disruption. So, Barbara.

436
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,730
We you can think they haven't have the nutrients, right? They have the phosphorus.

437
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:25,150
So the first would come from the surface discharge, but also come from sediments.

438
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:34,440
Consider this. So was this Pablo do as really make good with what Trump and we see the public there right.

439
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:41,740
So this is what they wanted to do. They tried to end the bubbles so that they can increase the concentration with the resources of option,

440
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:49,690
so they can prohibit the discharge of the beach from the the the, the, the, the, the sediments of the nutrients through the water.

441
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:57,780
That's one way they tried to do it and they try to do that experiment in the lake for lake, but difficult to do.

442
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,620
Okay. Tomorrow sink up out of the world body. How much it would cost.

443
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,420
Right. With what's what? I mean, like smoke in the basement.

444
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,730
I suppose a lot of money to do this in the Big Lakes is almost impossible to get.

445
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,290
Increase price rates to reduce the retention time will not be able to do this in the Great Lakes.

446
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:30,550
In small parts. Yeah, you probably can build a tunnel so that you can have the flow of water, fresh water to the to the process.

447
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:42,980
Chemical manipulation can go us outside the copper sulfate that's most commonly practice in a small pond.

448
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:52,340
Just use chemical spray the chemicals in the pump so that we can kill these algal blooms of algae seals ourselves.

449
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,650
Can we really do this in the Great Lakes?

450
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:11,510
No, no, no. Okay. Okay. So people with it why we just two like in the in the in the tornado for example spray this cup of coffee with you.

451
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:18,080
There's a lot of issue with that's why you added chemicals a lot of the chemicals and then you're breaking seals.

452
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:28,050
Okay, you break the seals. What happens? Most of the toxins, most of the cocaine I use suggests the odds allow you breakfast.

453
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:38,150
Of all the toxic work in one. Think about the this and they can also surely reduce the nutrients inputs.

454
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,830
That's one of the way. Okay, let's do more Wednesday.

455
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,110
We'll talk about Great Lakes water management.

456
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:54,599
And one of the key targets is to reduce the nutrients input in the kids and the biological additions from them.

457
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,410
We can try to use to remove zebra mussels, introduce algae, graze our grazers.

458
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,870
Could we also need to bacteria viruses as remove the zebra mussels that easy.

459
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,579
So sorry that to me it's very difficult to induce our greatest.

460
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:19,630
And I don't think that's a good idea. Okay. And all this probably not a very good idea with this scale we got talking about.

461
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:25,000
But if we do it in the lab, yes, walk the small part possible.

462
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:30,130
But if you go to the police, apply these techniques, it's just almost impossible.

463
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,650
So what you can see here, what's a really option we have? Yeah.

464
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,260
I mean, feasibly, a friendly thing about how people can do it.

465
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,990
Reduce emissions. That's almost all you can do.

466
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,989
Okay. Those are turnovers.

467
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,220
Conservative algae, grazers turtles probably lost.

468
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:08,820
Probably us. Yeah. So what you can see here, all these ways we tried to work on and then for the Great Lakes,

469
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:15,440
the only thing we can probably feasibly a few items of we can do is to reduce the nutrients in.

470
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,280
Reduce emissions, improve. How can we now?

471
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:29,640
How can we prevent enemies of the unknown toxin from the drinking water?

472
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:36,960
So we talk about the water in the Great Lakes in the past, but now what can we do for the drinking water?

473
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:45,280
But what we are afraid of, for example, now if you use a salt water with algal blooms, toxic algal blooms,

474
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,210
the source of our drinking water, we're afraid the toxins will get into the drinking water.

475
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,120
I mean, that's a concern, although we don't have the regulation,

476
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,530
but especially in these areas when we use that other source for drinking water for them.

477
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,050
Toledo is the typical example. And I will try to address that. A lot of coastal cities in the Great Lakes.

478
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:10,590
I try to address that. What can we do? Well, we don't really do pay attention to that because it's not really regulated.

479
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:17,310
We don't read about all the issues in the many places.

480
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,580
So what can we do with the sales right now?

481
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:28,110
Okay. A lot of filtration approach. We're happy to be able to take care of it to remove the algae cells.

482
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:35,910
The reason for that, I would say that this process is a concept so that you'll be able to remove it by the test, by filtration.

483
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,320
So toxins if the toxins, the release, what can happen?

484
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:49,840
You can use some oxidation oxidative toxin or we can use a field of the mouth, for example, the active carbon GSC we have,

485
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:58,180
um, if there's not very high concentration, if we can use like copper sulfate, that's probably not a good idea.

486
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:02,200
Okay, no good idea. The reason for that is not a good idea.

487
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:08,670
Now you will be able to listen to seals so the toxins from the seals would release

488
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,020
into the water and then the toxins that become even more difficult to remove.

489
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:18,580
But if you have the filters, you will be able to basically remove the seals for that purpose.

490
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:25,379
So for the drinking water, for example, we use filtration for creation.

491
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,790
We can be able to reduce the so-called seals and therefore the toxins.

492
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,990
What can we do for the toxins? Okay. Using.

493
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,090
To perpetuate the approach by the organization is a very strong stance.

494
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:47,390
They could also look like the older and then we use these the filters.

495
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:59,630
So the greater activity in the biological field that you see in the was to implant that can be also remove used to remove toxins.

496
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:09,680
Okay. We will talk to. So I basically don't really have the problem.

497
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,870
Okay. You can see approach we have what be able to remove the toxins not only just the

498
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:19,280
the the other containment and then the the outer filtration like our system,

499
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:23,869
the reverse osmosis system basically use membrane to filter all these contaminants.

500
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:34,250
That's the approach. So, so basically the first step for situation for creation would be able to address this problem.

501
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:41,540
But if the filters does not, I mean, if the this approach does not work very well and you have these high,

502
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,109
very high turbidity and that can block these filters.

503
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:54,349
And then as reasons for coming to Brazil, why the water have this because once the reason if it doesn't work so okay and then the toxins you can use

504
01:01:54,350 --> 01:02:00,530
chemicals so you combination of the filtration and then use the highest doses would be able to take care of that.

505
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,440
Good. And the other way is very use of refrigeration.

506
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:12,360
Refrigeration. The the the the the reverse osmosis.

507
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:17,200
One of the reverse osmosis is one of the approach you can use.

508
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:22,770
So think about to approach for the many harmful algal blooms.

509
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,190
Okay. Two algal blooms. One is the location.

510
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,780
Think about location. One is the part of the mix of the surface of the water.

511
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:41,430
Okay. There is the algal bloom in the warm water. So that feels like much the condition for the ground water.

512
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:48,479
No, there's no light. Okay. Temperature, vertices, know everything.

513
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,500
Have the high resin times.

514
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:57,480
Most of them static. But they don't really meet the conditions growth.

515
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,720
Okay. So the one. One of only four you to.

516
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:09,910
Only the softball. So now let's say there's a Zoom link for now.

517
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,400
We try to address that for issue. They have the algal blooms.

518
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,990
And then they use algal blooms using Lake Ford as a source for the drinking water.

519
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:25,170
Now during the summer. What can we do? Okay.

520
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:30,460
There is some more can we do? Now we try to address algal bloom issues.

521
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,930
So. We know the nutrients that exist in this animal.

522
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:49,750
We have this our evidence in the way for assuming the light for it is a source for the drinking water.

523
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,890
Then the use of alcohol is.

524
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,720
So supporting your. Okay. So we'll have this.

525
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:04,470
Requirements for addressing this. I wasn't in some good.

526
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:10,050
So to manage that, you know, to minimize the health impact.

527
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:15,840
One thing we have to manage the hour in the live first in the pump and make first.

528
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:23,200
Right. So what can you do? We can reduce the algal blooms.

529
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:32,530
Can we just talk about the approach you can have to some of the algae?

530
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Copper sulfate, it just comes up with smoke.

531
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:41,480
I didn't get it in the lake, in the Big Lake Cops office.

532
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:48,390
Okay, so the options we can have effect is two steps.

533
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,080
So how can we reduce the nutrient? The question can you do bubblers?

534
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:57,590
Like your bubble is smallpox Monday? Yeah, you can.

535
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,950
You can do that. And there's some.

536
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:09,380
Some of the cases are for Chesterfield, but it's just you can imagine that with that evidence we see Lake for smallpox.

537
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,820
How much blood all of those have to use, I guess.

538
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:20,170
When I was walking around speaking for what feels like a small way that leads to bigger things.

539
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,630
But I guess in this case with a bigger tick still have the problems this.

540
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:29,410
Yeah you know that's I think for me as for how this problem itself.

541
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:37,310
So again the practical feasible point you can take is reduced steps.

542
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:43,780
Okay these are two sides that people have seen about like for like once from the upstream.

543
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:50,050
Okay? The other one, it's really fundamentals for these areas and and we need to address that.

544
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,240
So I guess it also depends, I guess on.

545
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:03,940
If there's like lunch, of course, during the farm industries or there's just a lot of law where you have fertilizers.

546
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:09,010
So that's really when you do the investigation, you need to identify what's the source.

547
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,350
So look at the source of this contamination and then I've just opted to do it.

548
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:23,260
And then now because I think we use that a source of drinking water so we're still uptake of water from this area was more choice from other choices.

549
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:30,940
So we say, can we move to some other locations to get the source of if you go all the yes you can, but now this is only option we have.

550
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:39,660
Now you. You're the one they don't need to worry about is doing that constantly going the way of a summer in August.

551
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:47,940
They need to take care of that so. Addressing the algal blooms occur in the lake for is for the primary and they can do it.

552
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,570
And the second thing you can do is to increase the drinking water.

553
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:59,970
Okay. So we do a monitor to look at the concentration of the toxin, and then we have to do the oxidation.

554
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,020
We use oxidation some value of the oxidation.

555
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:13,030
Make sure that filtration works through the oxygen and then to the do that another we've added you see that accurate cardiac recovered which is about.

556
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:22,890
So that's the approach you can take. I do want to mention this issue of when you propose to state to the to the city,

557
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:30,550
what I would do as a as a public house commissioner, what I would imagine this issue in this.

558
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:38,220
It's my area. So because that's a really practical issue we have.

559
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:46,950
I mean, now the for the for the animal with the menu they have this big for issue but they

560
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,630
don't really take the drinking water from there because it's in water from Detroit.

561
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,300
They can get away from the Detroit so that they will have this issue.

562
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,920
But, yeah, that's that's the case. That news bad stuff.

563
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,990
Okay, that's great. Thanks. Thank you.

564
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:15,300
One question both of you mentioned which.
