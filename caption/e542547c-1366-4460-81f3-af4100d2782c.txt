1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,620
One of the great resources we have is the training we have here is great.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,320
Mean, I assume all of you see the Great Lakes, right?

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,870
Okay. So it's like an ocean. Okay, this is great.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,150
I mean, okay. And fortunately, we are living close by.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,360
And think about the coastal lines. The Michigan is the has the longest coastline and the Great Lakes.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:35,080
Right. This is a really great resources we have. So we'll discuss the bay just about or just generally Bay, one of the Great Lakes.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:44,840
And how do we. Matthew, the water quality in the Great Lakes think about now is not only just the United States, it's international border.

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,560
Well, we have border with Canada. Okay.

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:01:00,060
So what kind of programing we're using? How do we menger the Great Lakes for quality and also imagine we have how many states surrounding Great Lakes.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:18,860
Six, six, seven. OC 606 Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio was split up into heaven and [INAUDIBLE].

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,370
New York eight Is this so?

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,030
So. Imagine now this is not like served by eight states.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,610
Okay. You can count how many stands we have thrown in the Great Lakes is eight states, is there?

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,140
So anything we do right will be impacted by the states.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,960
It's these things that seem like Americans think.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah. American state. So they have to assume province from Canada that's running the water.

17
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,089
Right. So so we'll talk about Great Lakes.

18
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,240
This that's that's the state with Obama referring to.

19
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,340
So this is the the Great Lakes.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,240
We have five lakes as the 17 largest in the world as Great Lakes here.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,870
The largest in the world about.

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,180
Approximately one fifth of the water surface of freshwater.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,090
So imagine that we have about one fifth, 20% of the water surface of the water here in this area.

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,240
Borrow 85% of the water in the United States.

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:45,680
The largest lake in the area in the world. But about 50 by more than 50% of the water here this is the largest.

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:55,040
In these Skrillex varies from baroque to a seamless you know painting pointing to the more sedimentary rocks development of southern portion.

27
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,930
So we can see here there's a flows from this way and they all the way through here.

28
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:07,630
Okay, I'm with you. So this is all the order of the lager for the here.

29
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,170
And I see the overflow here. So that's the Five Lakes and this is the washers.

30
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,220
I mean, some of the where we are and then this is a washer.

31
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:28,000
We have the Great Lakes. So states, we have New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan.

32
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,850
And then Wisconsin. Think Wisconsin. Yes.

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,260
And then Minnesota. So that's eight countries, eight states in the in the in this region.

34
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,679
So how many people here? About 11. Highness's standard practice is arrival first population.

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,600
So that's the indigenous population. So if we could, um, in Michigan we still see a lot.

36
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,190
I mean, there's quite a large reservoirs for the native population up in that area.

37
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,830
About 30, 33% still.

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,410
I mean, it doesn't really change a change much. And then 9% American needs, in this case, about 40 million people.

39
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,430
And you close through the to the Great Lakes. That's how much people live here.

40
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,990
I mean, you can see here from one side of Canadian and that southern part of the.

41
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,260
Do you think that estimation is going to increase rapidly over the next two decades?

42
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,910
Not really. I mean, not really. If you think about them, people move within the states affects.

43
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,320
Michigan population drops them. Unfortunately.

44
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:52,350
Okay? Yeah. If you use this to the thesis, the digital publishing jobs stuff is dropping.

45
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,150
People move out. What about, like the next, like, 2050?

46
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,390
I think I mean, my my view is that I will stay busy.

47
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,660
Okay. I hope my lecture there was the ozone initiative is a long term.

48
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,280
Right. I will buy the property. If I have the resources of money, I will buy the property here.

49
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,250
Okay. If your parents have the resources, they ask them to buy the property.

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:28,680
And this is what happened. The twins here probably you will see that in ten years, 20 years makes jobs occur more often than it is.

51
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,540
And then you'll see me. You will become one of the best place you can.

52
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,010
You can. Even in terms of the the resources in the way that.

53
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:45,630
Right. So the winter. This winter. I mean, it's really it's not like last when I first arrived here, the wind is pretty cool.

54
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,760
Okay. And now we see about 20 years in the winter, that is October.

55
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,330
November. Already it's whatever is still okay.

56
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay. It's gradually graduated.

57
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,810
You don't realize, like the we're kind of cooking in the water, in the warm water, like frog in warm water.

58
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,430
And then you don't really feel it. But yes, it is ongoing.

59
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,030
So they also provide and I mean, surely this is a result of the floods for the for the city's fisheries,

60
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,380
7 billion, maybe more than that now, but a lot of activities for them, how many jobs it have.

61
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,320
So the the Great Lakes really support a lot of activities here.

62
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,330
A lot of activity here. People with the old Michigan with is so cold so don't really want to do here.

63
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,750
Yeah, it's cold. But we do see four seasons.

64
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,980
You do really see the foresee that that's really great.

65
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,830
And then the the most of people live in the Lake Michigan here and then you can

66
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,300
imagine like even the experience so big but the population becomes very cold.

67
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,260
So the weather conditions in terms of temperature do.

68
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,070
So this is an interesting table to show you the overall information about the Great Lakes.

69
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,960
What you can see here in terms of the volume, this is the largest one.

70
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,490
It's also deep water. Okay.

71
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,819
And the lake area is a pretty shallow lake area.

72
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,260
If you look at this in terms of area, that's also the shoreline, this kilometers.

73
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,440
The shoreline is really pretty great.

74
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,820
And Michigan here, we also make longest in some of the states.

75
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,400
We are surrounded by the great Great Lakes effects.

76
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,799
We try to there's a there's a there's a there's a plan.

77
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,080
I don't know how many when there will be realized.

78
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:57,800
Is that all the trails, all the trails along the Lake Michigan, along the coastal area in Michigan, try to meet all these trails.

79
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,200
This is a huge project to try to do it, but I don't know when it's kind of dreamy for Michigan people.

80
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,820
They just approved part of that. Well, they're trying to do it around like all of the states.

81
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,760
Yes. To Chicago to do Buffalo. I think if you go to New Buffalo for the for the trails.

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,570
All right. Okay. Go through like Indiana.

83
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:29,210
Yeah. I think there was the stuff they want to I think there's one already collected, finished,

84
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,480
completed from one of the city in the western Michigan for Chicago, about 46 mile, I believe.

85
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,480
So but look at it here. And this is another and another.

86
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:51,020
Another and information that will be directly related to water quality.

87
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,219
So vacation time. Was it repeating?

88
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:05,580
That means. So that means you can if you think about it, it's like think about 100 years.

89
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,759
To replace all the water in Michigan with the inflow outflow.

90
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,200
Now with this current inflows and outflows and also the volume it would take.

91
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:29,260
Hundred years to replace all the water. So does Lake Erie and Ontario have faster growth rates?

92
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,080
It's not fast for it because the volume they have. We see the faces.

93
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:47,050
You see the the volume they have. Yeah, it's it's almost like less than, like less than the one 2/10 of the the volume.

94
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,720
That's one factor. And also, you have the inflow. Yeah, you have the reverse.

95
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,730
You have this inflow. Yeah. So that makes it faster.

96
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,430
Right, right, right. And that takes about 22.6 years.

97
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,660
So if the Lake Erie, for example, were to be contaminated with something, would it be like significantly easier to clean it up?

98
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:17,860
Because you have the momentum of the fast retention helping along with the clean up, along with like.

99
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,890
Yeah, yes or no? Yes or no. Okay.

100
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,430
Yes. That's because you takes less.

101
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:33,880
I mean, you have the influence of dilution factors you can consider that probably make it easier to and to, to, to be removed.

102
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,770
But on the other hand, any dilution at an occlusion you have would be high impact with this like.

103
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,660
Yeah. Okay. So, so like and you've, I've seen the similar amount of the contaminants into the lakes.

104
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,760
Right. So like superior probably polluted. Very heavily so.

105
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,480
But if that's the same amount, get into the lake area.

106
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah. High concentration. So yes or no as the as you can imagine now.

107
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,450
Takes 100 years for Lake Michigan to replace all the water with Lake Superior.

108
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,250
Almost 200 years. So that means what that means if you have a companion in this river, in the lakes.

109
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Your stereo for Beethoven. Right.

110
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,240
It's still there for a very long time. So. So protect.

111
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,000
It's very important for these buildings, for the critics.

112
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,100
Again, this is and then use in terms of the Great Lakes.

113
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,010
Most of the agriculture area, if you think about it, it's a.

114
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,130
Forest or agriculture area. And then we have these urban areas.

115
00:11:51,150 --> 00:12:02,430
Okay. A lot of other areas. So you can see here in terms of urban areas, Chicago area, Detroit, and they believe this is the area.

116
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:14,590
And then it's the Toledo, Cleveland area. Okay. That's the the the area that's has heavily populated and also urbanized and industrialized.

117
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,200
And then this is the area effect.

118
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,950
Historically, we know the Quahog River, for example, is really the flow through the Cleveland and get into the lake area.

119
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:38,420
Cause a lot of pollution we have in this area. So in terms of flow, in terms of the the level of the water here,

120
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,550
surely this is from Lake Superior and then to the Lake Huron and then to the lake area and then to Ontario.

121
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,550
And this is where the Lagoa fourth located.

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,030
Again, if you think about the the flow, what's the flow here?

123
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,150
It's the 50% is the precipitation and the evaporation for is outflow.

124
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,200
That's how much water go out, outflow and inflow.

125
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:15,880
So the evaporation you can see here, in fact, the evaporation becomes also one of the key factors that is to reduce the water volume, the.

126
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:25,610
Okay. So we haven't had time to go to the surface. And the other thing, think about the this is because this evaporation, also the precipitation.

127
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,390
So the deposition we'll talk about the the the non-point source is pollution right into the into the lakes.

128
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,530
The precipitation. The air deposition is also a key factor.

129
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,410
One of the key factors, if I could tell me, is this lakes, these big areas here.

130
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,160
So this is how the water flows through this area and then go to the Atlantic Ocean.

131
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:11,770
So in terms of water quality, water quality and what you can expect to see as human activity intensifies in this area.

132
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,130
And then what kind of contaminants we will see all stress factors in the in the Great Lakes.

133
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:35,040
In the history of the timber harvesting, hydro modification streams, rivers, and then augers just like nutrients loading toxic chemicals.

134
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:46,620
But this is how we see the distress get into the into the lake Great Lakes from the fishery and then to the usual fixation.

135
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:56,730
And this that's 96 years. This is the the the the the at the time that the fishing becomes a big problem as the the 1960s.

136
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:05,489
And in fact, at that time now we're talking about the area of concerns during this industrialization.

137
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,190
All this time that's the most heavily contaminated area in the Great Lakes.

138
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay. Human activities and industrialization.

139
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,280
And we still see the legacy of that. Okay.

140
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:27,160
Some of these contaminants are in fact, in the in the in the.

141
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,870
In the sediments still still the continents we have.

142
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,060
And then the threat of the house in the Great Lakes, especially the the PBDEs, the persistence by community,

143
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:52,580
toxic chemicals like the PCBs, toxins, certain pesticides, the effects that become the Great Lakes issues.

144
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,379
Most common most common contaminants in the Great Lakes is mercury.

145
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,910
One of the mercury effects? The mercury.

146
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:12,290
We have the fishery advisory cause in Great Lakes, most likely due to the mercury contamination.

147
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:22,600
And then look at contamination. One of the would you also point out the disease and the source of the pollution and and then the PCBs.

148
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,550
Toxic dioxin in the Great Lakes. And.

149
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:41,519
If you look at this fishery and the most likely is caused by this, the mercury for that.

150
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,300
So you can see here like acres on the advisory.

151
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:54,060
It's really the mercury is one of the primary concern in most of these lakes and due to the contamination.

152
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,200
So are there any any any lakes?

153
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,530
This is kind of a cycle in a lake. We have the input.

154
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:13,620
Right. Well, where were the contaminants come from? If you think about the contamination in the big area, in the lake and where lakes,

155
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:22,620
we have the contamination coming and some kind of water also are most likely from the river, from the sewage influence and then deposition.

156
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,790
Okay. But this is another. Security source.

157
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,540
So how this chemical transformation into legs.

158
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,960
But then we'll also have the sediments. Think about the sediments.

159
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,299
Okay. Think about the sentiments, the sentiments in some cases, really,

160
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:49,070
that the primary source of the contaminants as well as waterboarding and also how the mixing effects.

161
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,610
Right. So in the Great Lakes, for example, in the Lake Michigan was that Lake Michigan is contaminated by certain compounds.

162
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,710
You probably need to define the areas. Okay. And also lakes.

163
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:11,020
So what happens in the Lake Michigan north of me, that would be impact the the Lake Superior, if you think about it.

164
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,150
Look at this. Look at this. Hydraulic components of these Great Lakes.

165
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:23,950
So if the contamination happens downstream, we're not likely to impact the upstream like a Lake Superior, for example.

166
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,860
If you have something happens in the lake area, you may not be able to see that impact experience.

167
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:37,780
But visibility is not the case if you have some the contamination experience on Lake Michigan and that could also impact the downstream.

168
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:47,860
The downstream of this. This. This. This areas. So think about this.

169
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,300
So we have the sediments, we have the input inflow, but also outflow.

170
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,990
So that's the chemical transformation also in that one body.

171
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:05,650
But I will add question so what are the some of the factors that determine the exchange rates between the water and the sediments?

172
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,879
So yeah, that's a that's really a good question. So that's really a good question.

173
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,470
There's a lot of chemistry involved.

174
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:27,909
One of the one of the the the the the factors is the oxygen the oxygen, some of the the the the like the talk about the phosphorus,

175
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:36,100
the nutrients, you fact that's that's the oxygen play a very important role in the exchange and that's much of your activity also as well.

176
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,420
So so most likely in terms of the impact is page and the oxygen.

177
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:52,360
Okay. And also how strong how strong these chemicals that bind to the to the soil particular acidity.

178
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,910
Okay. So that's the the the ways in terms of the.

179
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,110
Extension that things. Sorry.

180
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:19,070
So if you think about the the from atmospheric atmosphere for toxic chemicals mercury almost like hundred percent is an experience come from the air.

181
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,950
So that's that's a very significant amount right into position.

182
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:38,629
So so that's also one of the reason sometimes you think about the the coal plants, the the the core of power plant, the amount of coal.

183
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,880
And then what happens is that some of this will impact the water quality of the Great Lakes.

184
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,630
Okay. Let's get into that here. And then they can use the water in the in the legs.

185
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,310
So. And it's very difficult to control. Right.

186
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,110
Think about. How can you get rid of the opposition?

187
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:07,040
Prevent the opposition. So it's very difficult to do that. The only thing you can do is reduce the source.

188
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,740
So for example, you have these power plants you want, including.

189
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,150
This particular compound that you included, again, related to this.

190
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,310
Because the war because the the the the the gas cars the supplies to European countries.

191
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:39,160
So now they resume the corporate politics. It is already banned in the European countries, but not because of the lack of electricity.

192
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,530
And now that they have this, they don't have the fuel source for the gas.

193
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,430
So what they do now, they resume the use of coal plants to generate power.

194
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,750
And in terms of contamination you think about this this and.

195
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:07,090
Not a lot more only is just think about CO2 emission but you think about just the contaminants gasping for air and then the difference.

196
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:16,070
And by the way, there's no way I mean, it's very, very rare that you can I mean, even from the individual level, you can control it for the water.

197
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,360
You can control it because that I can choose or what I can do to myself.

198
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,710
Okay. I hope I can use all this systems, the technology, and it costs money, but it can do it.

199
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,110
But for the air. It's out of your control.

200
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:42,130
Individuals. You can say I mean, you cannot really bring this brings the protectors like these filters with you.

201
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,630
I mean, you cannot do that. You don't want to do that. Not just comfortable with it.

202
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:56,500
So that's, again, another thing. Also the community in terms of the forgive me, this is a mockery.

203
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:03,220
I mean, the water is the phytoplankton do plankton again, to the to the to the fish.

204
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,430
You can see the concentration is a community of also as with.

205
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:16,390
So so think about what are the change that you can think of the format, any of the water quality in the Great Lakes.

206
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:29,090
There's a lot of states that all have different. Okay.

207
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,530
Yeah. Water quality standards. Different states have different practices.

208
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,550
Like they may have different water quality standards. Yeah.

209
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,570
Well, but this. This, um, variation. But this is amazing.

210
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:53,630
And they have to follow EPA. If you have to, you have to be you need to be most vigilant that that's the case.

211
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,550
You cannot work for this and adore that it or the proposal.

212
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:06,660
Okay. States. Mm hmm. Um, I would say probably the shipping transport.

213
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,580
Especially if you're doing it from, like, international waters that go up the canal.

214
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,780
We have invasive species. For invasive species would be pollution, not just like the gas.

215
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,270
Yeah. Just usage or like. And, yeah. Industry from port.

216
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,890
Mm hmm. You think climate change as well is going to be heavier rain.

217
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,530
Okay. Heavy rain. Okay. Evaporation.

218
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:39,590
Evaporation. Be evaporation. Right. Any change you can think of.

219
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,650
EPA versus the ocean can estimate as EPA.

220
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,660
Oh, yeah. Okay. This international world body. So how do we manage the water quality?

221
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,780
And we have the boat. We have the border. Right? We have the maps.

222
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:07,020
When you see the map of the border, draw a line between Canada and the United States by the water that don't have the lines and the no line there.

223
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,590
Right. So that's the two country issue.

224
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,090
Okay. Mm hmm. And this is the World War is huge.

225
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,620
It's not area, it's not aerial. And the effects have ingested more as the water part of you is such energy.

226
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,730
Okay. If you just go out on the monitor and and the input.

227
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:29,970
Okay.

228
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:42,350
For the input of the contaminated river into lakes, as many sources of the input involved with thinking about the standards between Ken and America.

229
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,020
A bit different. Yeah. For some contaminant or something.

230
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,370
So how would you address that? We'll talk about how we address that. Okay. And.

231
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:05,980
So Great Lakes is not as prevalent as the three as it is not in Chicago, especially in the Cleveland and Chicago area.

232
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,960
Detroit area. And the Bay Area is probably.

233
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,540
And if you if you live here, I mean, I haven't see that myself.

234
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,780
But if you see the photos, images that you probably don't like it it surely you don't like it.

235
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:37,340
Okay. So the change that we have, that's what we have. How do we the work on this can you on the the one hold here one of these is can you

236
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:44,550
water X and we also have this Great Lakes critical program at Great Lakes initiatives,

237
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,700
one quarter standard among the states. And then we have the Clean Water Act.

238
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,390
That's the Clean Air Act in terms of the the the great work programs.

239
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:03,760
It's one program that's incredible. And sure, it's international also because these are national.

240
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:11,820
So we have these Boundary Waters Treaty and then we have also International Joint Commission created in the 99.

241
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:18,399
That's between the Canada and the United States. In fact, that I've been working with them for quite some time,

242
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,050
a couple of times to look at this one point of the treaties in terms of what pollutions in the Great Lakes.

243
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:31,810
And they have these Great Lakes Water Quality Program and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreements in the 1978 similar program.

244
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:40,570
First, they are just talk about these critical pollutants like the mercury, and then in the amendments,

245
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,160
the concept of ecosystem approach to developing the ecosystem update of indicators.

246
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:52,570
So these aquatic water quality agreements and then we have to revise them every certain period of time.

247
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:01,510
And the increase that we have, the remediation action plans that address this area of concerns have the required management plans.

248
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:13,570
So what you can see here, the the indexes we have the ACS, we have several program impacts to address a lot of problems with the Canada.

249
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:24,370
We also have these international agreements called Relics Quality Agreements, and then the form is international joint.

250
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,540
Commission to address the water quality in the Great Lakes integrating.

251
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,990
That's all we have in the in the in the to to to address to manage the water quality standards in the Great Lakes.

252
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,250
Okay. So let's take a quick break and then we'll come back.

253
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:57,490
Okay. So one of the approaches to address the water quality in the Great Lakes.

254
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:11,280
In agreement is Ariel Castro's. So is the area concerns is any geographic area failed to meet the general fiscal objectives agreement.

255
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:20,550
So I mean they don't need to the one point is that for some reasons, most of these are caused by the historical reasons I just mentioned.

256
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,819
They decided that because that area of concern is altogether,

257
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:37,660
we have 43 area of concerns identified and 26 in the US and then 2012 in the Canada and then five shear.

258
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:45,970
So one of the remedial action plans is to address the area of concern, to respond to one point of view.

259
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,050
And in Detroit, yes, we have the areas over to consensus.

260
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:57,790
That's part of it. So what you can see here, this is the Great Lakes area concerns that in Canada, in the US,

261
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,129
you can you can see that's most of a real concerns in the in the industrial areas.

262
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,800
Detroit is really one of area and it's like, you know, make area and then lake interior.

263
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,700
So in the Chicago area, actually that's one of the area.

264
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:19,810
Also most of these areas concerns really from the from the historical reasons because at that time we have these checks,

265
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,850
okay, we have a discharge and that's content of the sediments.

266
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,310
Now they're still continuously released into the lakes and it causes problems.

267
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:37,420
So what can we do with that? So we have this the remediation plan for that area to address this area of concerns.

268
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:48,510
Detroit River. If you still see the Detroit River some this ongoing the orchestra ongoing in the Detroit River area to address this area of concerns.

269
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:56,970
So this is the area consents for this restriction on the fish and wildlife consumption and then the other issues we have.

270
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:06,809
The immediate action plan, the state law ecosystem based how they address that that in the three stages identify

271
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:12,590
empowerment and social space are the refuge actions implementation and then implement actions.

272
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,830
So that's the for example, the.

273
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:23,350
The action plans for this area of concerns are within the area of concerns of the implementation plan.

274
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,060
You can be listed, for example, the river here.

275
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,250
They can be released after the restoration.

276
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:38,440
This is for the New York Area Rehabilitation Action Plan by the Advisory Committee and New

277
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,930
York State Department of Environmental Conservation and then just started work on that.

278
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:51,700
So I choose this through this area of concerns, restore the water quality to support the swimming and self-sustained fishery.

279
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:02,120
Due to this river basin. So that's one of the. The area, for example, can be deduced after you do the remediation and being approved.

280
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,270
That's what they have to prove was the Met.

281
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:16,180
Now the other plan they have is because the lack of wider management plans as to impairment of the beneficial use in individual acrylics.

282
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,389
So instead of areas are also the big lakes are each individual be liquid.

283
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:27,780
Imagine procedure about the water impairment in terms of maintaining the water quality

284
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:34,800
would take the individual lake as a one body water body to improve this water quality plan.

285
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,860
So again, in consultation with the state and the provisional government and the Joint Commission and work together and then the court,

286
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:54,720
the parties, international joint commissions basically as the Canada and the EPA and the the and the the Canada EPA.

287
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,710
So you consult with the state provisional governments to say, what can we do with that?

288
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,830
And then reduction. So one of the reduction, in fact, the first to focus on toxic chemicals.

289
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,350
Now focus more on the not now chemical toxic.

290
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:19,830
So chemicals. So again. And then we have this additional binational Great Lakes program addressing the chemicals like the our

291
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:27,810
national task strategies in that between the United States and the the the the the the Canada and in fact,

292
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:35,160
the Great Lakes, not also the the the the states, but also the tribal areas, first nations.

293
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,799
We mentioned that a lot of indigenous people,

294
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:46,050
if I live along this Great Lakes area around the coast and which you still see quite tribal areas in that area as well.

295
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:57,830
So if you think about what's what's what's the the the the chance of the contaminants in the in the Great Lakes,

296
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:09,590
what you can see here, the toxic chemicals, excessive nutrients that can impact the harmful algal blooms, impacts the health.

297
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,580
So we address the chemical because that is appropriate in the reducing the noted concentration for chemicals.

298
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:22,070
We can see that especially the phosphorus and the toxic chemicals there you see the trends are decreasing.

299
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,990
So here's the give me the example where the phosphorus concentration in the waters in the Lake Superior and then the Lake Huron,

300
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,870
this is the data we have the Michigan again, this is audio from from US EPA.

301
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,970
What you can see here is when we have these agreements, the overall concentration is really decrease, okay, causes decrease.

302
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,790
And this is the goal we have below this five, for example.

303
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,739
And so one of the one of the agreements, the goal is we want to reduce this half, 50% of phosphorus.

304
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:05,120
We decide that in the Great Lakes, basically, we want to reduce coverage up about half now with a two Largo.

305
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:13,520
Now we want additional help because what we we found is that in that in the Great Lakes that the harmful algal blooms still occur every.

306
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,910
Okay. We improve dramatically. Don't get me wrong. We improve dramatically the water quality in Great Lakes.

307
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,270
We have the agreement with Canada which addresses. But that is still not enough.

308
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:37,190
Is not enough. And again if you look at this a first for yes the reduced pretty dramatically in the in the Great Lakes.

309
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,570
And then if you look at the PCB, yes, also you see the dramatic reduction.

310
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:50,180
So it's really the achievements, the great achievement and in the water quality, in the Great Lakes, in the Great Lakes.

311
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:57,140
So chance in the Great Lakes, really most of the time it's good and they fair mixed.

312
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:06,740
And then if the whole fish for example kind of fell and that's the the concentration you can find what is ongoing emerging issues in the

313
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:15,260
Great Lakes water quality pollutants pollution numbers will be one of my career contamination eutrophication of the near-shore waters.

314
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,890
Harmful algal blooms for full web operations.

315
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:28,180
And then the chemicals there, the chemical climate change, like the other stresses we have in the in the in the Great Lakes.

316
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,520
So, for example, this is just the water quality advisory, harmful algal blooms that we talk about already.

317
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,510
Harmful algal bloom is one of the primary concerns.

318
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,760
Now we try to address between the Canada and the United States and especially we kind of like in the United States.

319
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,190
Okay. So eight states.

320
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,680
Eight states. We have we have the states and.

321
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,360
It is a variation in terms of phosphorus discharge.

322
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,800
First was this touch and then the against Ohio.

323
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:08,790
State of Ohio is one of the worst they've come to mentally and especially from

324
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:19,860
agriculture sector and that's the the the of part of this this ten years that we have.

325
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:31,800
So what do we have the square legs restoration programs and to restore the water quality in the Great Lakes Basin.

326
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,740
So first of course in the Great Lakes Assessment Program changes also women's responses

327
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:48,090
to the Great Lakes regional collaboration from President Bush in the mid 20,004,

328
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,730
the federal agencies task force to promote regional collaboration of national security for the Great Lakes.

329
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,110
So that's the how the United States address these questions.

330
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,490
We have we just talk about we have is this okay?

331
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,350
The state also has a women's and the signed by the law for the Great Lakes Compact.

332
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,690
So one of the one of the one of the restrictions is that we cannot.

333
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:22,200
Divert the water from the Great Lakes outside of Estes.

334
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,280
Okay. So you can imagine out for southwest two states, right?

335
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:37,640
Southwest states. Southwest is they want to get our water from the Great Lakes.

336
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:48,070
So this idea of a lot of ideas has been proposed with your tunnel or your pipes with pipes of fresh water from what predicts to the southwest.

337
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,010
Yes, that is engineering. They are having ideas.

338
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,920
And in fact, as a matter of fact, in China, they are doing that. Okay.

339
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,580
Italians that do that. What they do, they have three roots.

340
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,300
Three involves transport of water from south west.

341
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,940
And this has been happening.

342
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:18,770
Okay. Probably happening. But in the United States, yes, we have this signed by law also.

343
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:28,360
You cannot the the the the the the Great Lakes compacts says prohibit doing that by the system other ways of doing that.

344
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:35,530
Some some places they say you can you can get open water, for example, on our government and then transport to other states.

345
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,180
There's some good policy, some loopholes here for that for that purpose.

346
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,650
Okay.

347
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:56,080
For failing states tribal areas goes to develop have a better quality policy product products because Great Lakes regional collaboration issue arose.

348
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,800
Through the Senate, the great compact that is restricting water from getting out.

349
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:08,900
So see if there were diversions. Stuart Water was approved to be out.

350
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,740
Doesn't mean that it has to return. It's everything is for now.

351
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,980
I mean, the. What is. What do you mean? You just have to pretend to come up with it, you know?

352
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:27,590
Yeah. So. So for these Great Lakes, it was a raging.

353
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:37,590
Work this like several areas in your work in this age sex teams, habitats, species,

354
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:43,500
area of concerns, chemicals indicators, sustainable development, invasive species.

355
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,870
This is in 2005 is also working.

356
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,590
So the working groups research initiative was another one by the.

357
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,760
President Obama. Okay. President Obama. In fact, I was involved in this process.

358
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,260
When we when I joined here, we provided the reports.

359
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,620
We prepared a work paper, a white paper.

360
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:17,010
And we request here. Is that you? How much money for $75 million.

361
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,790
Do you think that's enough for for for Michigan? No, certainly not.

362
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,280
We request, like $10 billion. For Restauration.

363
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:35,020
This has how much it's a pro we estimate that at least $10 billion for for this this.

364
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:45,639
So what does it do I mean for these well-executed initiatives is that as many

365
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,730
for these local authorities they would do the real projects to sort of work on.

366
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,360
It's not research, but as academia, we can participate.

367
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,070
We can we can participate to help with them. This is really the project they have.

368
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,480
And then the the Obama is President Obama signed it.

369
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,280
The the initiative give like $475 million.

370
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,870
And we don't really have any prior funded project for that because that's more like this.

371
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:29,750
The. The project from the Saudi's local governments on local authority to do this again, the Great Lakes, Great Lakes, water quality agreements,

372
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:42,050
they have updated the agreements in the 2012 as the final current final agreements that we have between the Canada and

373
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:49,400
the United States to address the water quality issues in the former state of Michigan for the other for the Great Lakes.

374
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:58,610
So we complete that. The requirements for these agreements is that this is a new component in the agreement.

375
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:08,750
This is general objectives. Okay. So the source of the high quality was drinking water, allow swimming, recreational use,

376
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,270
human consumption free from pollutants in the quantity of concentration that could be harmful to the human health.

377
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,130
Wildlife, aquatic organisms support a healthy and productive wetlands.

378
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,380
Be free from nutrients that direct all do into the water, and then be free from the introduction and spread of connectivity of species.

379
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,119
Be free from the harmful impact of contaminants water.

380
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:39,680
Be free from substance and materials conditions. And you get two negative impacts the, the, the integrated of the water of the Great Lakes.

381
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:44,480
So this is reflects quite a general opposite objective.

382
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,800
Well, what are you see here? This language is kind of there's ambiguity here, right?

383
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,450
It's not really like says, for example, how do we define.

384
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,890
Allow for human consumption of the fish wildlife.

385
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,970
So again, there's some criteria associated with that.

386
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,750
But again, think about this. This is the.

387
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:17,500
Objectives, these objectives. We do have these, for example, criterias, the quality of women's associate with this.

388
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:25,990
So the Joint International Joint Commission has the the report.

389
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:34,480
Again, this is some area of concerns. It took up a liquid management chemical of mutual concern, the nutrients discharged from vessels.

390
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,520
Again, that's another thing we're addressing right now with these international agreements.

391
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Just talk about a shipment into the Great Lakes.

392
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,680
A ways with addressing the water quality issues from that purpose.

393
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,020
Invasive species, habitat, species and then groundwater.

394
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,730
And the climate change impacts all kinds of climate change impacts some sciences.

395
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,810
So one of the the information they have there.

396
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:18,890
So this is a women's. This is a most recent agreement between the Canada and the United States.

397
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:26,960
If you look at this information here, there requires the requires every three years.

398
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,800
We need to provide a progress report. Okay.

399
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:38,790
We need to provide a progress report. And then if you look at this.

400
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,520
This is the most recent report published in 2000.

401
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,540
We have three reports since the establishment of the the the the the agreement.

402
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:06,000
So if you look at this progress report for 2000 2022 just the summer.

403
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,100
Evaluate all these areas to see what's going on in these areas.

404
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,920
So if you look at this, if you're interested in the the deck wide management, all the.

405
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:48,010
So from. Contribute to the achievement of which aerospace order is agreements.

406
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:57,459
And then this is the discharges talking about from the from the vessels where missions does a oil has

407
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:04,180
brutal substance by folding garbage and if only system components of wastewater sewage blast the water.

408
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:09,460
That's how we address that in the.

409
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,210
In this area. So, one, this is one of the things we're doing right now.

410
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:25,510
And then in the United States in 2004, there is the use of the vessel incident or Discharge Act.

411
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,799
Okay. And that's address the. The this.

412
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,390
And then Canada has ballast water regulations that are talking about the the the vessels.

413
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,380
So this is one of the areas that you receive less focus.

414
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:57,670
But again, the United States and the Canada are addressing this right now in the framework of the Spanish Civil War Agreement for the Great Lakes.

415
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,060
For the Great Lakes. The.

416
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:13,080
Our post this progress report for the on the on the tiny canvas side so you can can take a look at that's how we address in the United States

417
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:22,770
and Canada how to address and then we achieved a lot we have achieved a lot effect we have to make it you can see a reduction of the chemicals,

418
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:35,550
the nutrients dramatically in all the lakes, all the lakes, if just because a lot more is so huge and a lot of space and resources are involved.

419
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:39,540
So it's kind of challenging for us to to.

420
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:47,259
But to. To maintain this.

421
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,990
And the other thing, you really think about this. Okay. So with the Great Lakes, with five, great.

422
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:59,290
Now we can enjoy the water quality here, but we have we need to do that to continue doing this.

423
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:05,590
Okay. There's no way we want to go back. This is really the precious resources that we have to see.

424
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:09,750
Just think about in the Southwest. Think about these.

425
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:17,380
The evidence of Access Colorado River, the effort to have access to the surface and water supply.

426
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,180
And we have the resources here. We cannot. Cruiser.

427
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:30,800
Okay. That's not very I mean, for any. Any reasonable people can only think about all the what is ever some contaminants not a big deal

428
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:38,510
is it is a very big deal because see for example here think about the area of concerns we have.

429
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:44,970
Is it in the Great Lakes? We have all this area of concern that is a historical contamination.

430
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,040
Areas that we need to address. We need to address.

431
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:00,130
How do we do that? And there's a lot of engineering work involved also in terms of how to fix the sediments.

432
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:07,960
So because we see the same and it's also one of the major source for some chemicals and nutrients, so they do in fact, you can fix the sediments.

433
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:16,360
I was as you are the Cobble segment all use came close to solidifying the settlements

434
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:21,010
so that it can reduce the release of these chemicals into the into the lakes.

435
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:25,660
Into the lakes. That's one of the the the.

436
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,760
The the one of the approaches we are taking, the other concerns, I mean,

437
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:43,250
surely for the tenure we still have in fact a decimation because we have eight states, we have different policies on dividend policy.

438
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:48,890
It just even took us think about the Baltimore one bothering us is.

439
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:56,530
We have this Great Lakes complex agreement signed by the president, in fact.

440
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:04,360
So, for instance, we cannot divert the water resources from the Great Lakes or basically to the other areas.

441
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:10,850
But how can you foster? Okay. How can you force that?

442
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,780
The different states have different ways to foster and different model of enforcement.

443
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:25,340
So one of the that and one of the controversy destinations the list the city the company pulled through the Baltimore water.

444
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:33,900
So. They get the permits from from the small town.

445
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:42,000
I cannot remember the name of small town now is in the Grand Rapids, like most west of the south, so wealthy subsequent rapids,

446
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:53,340
they gave the permits to extract the water from the ground like a hundred gallons of solid tens of 100,000 gallons could be.

447
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,340
And then they're both without water and then the distributed electricity.

448
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:06,340
Okay. So. And then we get to meet for that.

449
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:16,510
Okay. Get me for that. So if you're wondering why that's so this is the challenge we have is that, you know, the water is free to use.

450
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,340
I mean, it's country. We use it for the reasonable human consumption.

451
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:28,120
You can take it, for example, if you have the you have the property, you can charge the water to use.

452
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,810
That's your property, your right to do it.

453
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,690
And then and they they are doing this. And so they are doing this in the in this area.

454
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:41,350
And then they exposed the because the other states, if we can do that.

455
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,500
So how do we address that? But how to address it.

456
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,920
Everyone can know very Volvo, the piping, the water to the other states.

457
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,720
But how can we address that kind of activities?

458
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:07,590
Okay. I kind of have to resolve. I think the the attunement for these binational agreements or agreements has to be tremendous,

459
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:15,990
tremendous in terms of if there's a lot of quality and the justice system changes that we need to address, we need to do that.

460
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,820
And this is a really, really the precious resource that we have.

461
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,050
When you see that in the States, we can't exist for a.

462
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:37,800
That's provided us just tremendous seats for us and show that we need to do to keep it, to maintain it.

463
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,190
So for the next generation to come. Okay.

464
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:51,660
Questions? So I hope you enjoy the Great Lakes every time you can find me.

465
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:56,460
I try my best to go to the Great Lakes area.
