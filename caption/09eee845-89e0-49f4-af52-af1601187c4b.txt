1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:12,629
Okay, everyone. Will we get settled? There is just like a ungraded pop quiz that to review material from previous weeks.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,940
That's here. If you can do that over the next minute or two, then you'll be able to start class.

3
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,930
Okay. Well, you're finishing this up.

4
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:01,290
I notice talking to many of you last week during class and during office hours, there's some confusion about Greek letters.

5
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:11,590
That's totally understandable. We use them a bit in science and math applications here in the U.S. but I and

6
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,490
I tried to do some like font variations to C sometimes look a bit different.

7
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:28,780
But I think we see alpha and beta a lot. Delta and Omega and included those because those are some of the big waves of COVID 19 that we have had.

8
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,820
And I mean, honestly,

9
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:39,040
I am a bit it's a bit curious to me how we're still on the American wave when there's been like multiple sub variants of all Macron.

10
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,590
And I think what counts as one strain and when do we like, continue on to the next Greek letter?

11
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,829
I don't know if that's political or not,

12
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,649
but I don't necessarily think it's a super scientific decision to kept on sticking with the overcrowded, I'm quite sure.

13
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,400
But I believe the one after that would have been PI. So maybe we'll get five variants of COVID 19 sometime soon.

14
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:11,740
But for the homework for today and for some of the nomenclature that's used with causal imprints and mediation analysis, we'll see Theta and VI.

15
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,450
One thing that I'll note is and I tried to get some.

16
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,780
Different kinds of fonts for this. But I think theta sometimes in more of its cursive form,

17
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:33,960
it can be kind of like this and then five can like in its lowercase form, it could just be like this.

18
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,990
Sometimes you'll see it like this, but the reason why I have CI afterwards is like, this is a totally different letter.

19
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,540
It's like, these are the same, but they are not that.

20
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
In the end. You know, I don't expect you to.

21
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't expect you to have had all of these, like, Greek letters memorized or not.

22
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,010
But you do see them from time to time. And I think it's important to kind of have an idea of what they are.

23
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,320
Any questions on that? Okay.

24
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,400
So let's get into these questions.

25
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,540
So what is the direct effect in this?

26
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:27,250
And I think the things that we're wondering about are whether it's by one, which is this or whether it is theta one which is here.

27
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,160
And the answer would be here for theta one.

28
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,680
So phi one, this is the total effect. And I think that's the thing that people get confused about.

29
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,510
So total effect is sort of indirect effect plus a direct effect.

30
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,700
And that leads to this question, and it's great that most of you got this.

31
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,360
So the indirect effect is going through beta one and theta two.

32
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:01,000
So the whole idea is that this is sort of additive in the sense that the total effect equals the indirect effect plus the direct effect.

33
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,570
So then the proportion mediation or the proportional mediation is just the amount of indirect over the total effect.

34
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,350
So make sense. Okay.

35
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,180
Here's where we get confusing things. So let's say we're studying hydroxychloroquine, use and mortality.

36
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,620
What is the counterfactual condition? And most of you are getting.

37
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,020
So, again, counterfactual. We're thinking of something which is not in reality.

38
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,140
And I like to think of it in terms of time travel. So, yes.

39
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,750
So this is observing somebody who has been given H.Q. and then going back in time and not giving it to them.

40
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:49,920
So observing the rates of mortality of those, given it or not, that's that's an observational that's an observational study.

41
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,620
This is an experimental study. And this is something more counterfactual.

42
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,890
So we have different levels of evidence. We have observational evidence. We have experimental evidence, and then we have factual evidence.

43
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,310
Of course, in reality, we cannot get counterfactual evidence, but we can approximate it through these statistics.

44
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,640
Okay. This is always the heart. So every year, many students are wondering about this.

45
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,630
So we are studying the effect of the new machine.

46
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:30,730
And there are two appeals. You missed one and you missed two. We think smoking could be a mediator and the outcome would be lung cancer.

47
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,260
So what is the natural, direct effect?

48
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:49,420
So we have one where we are looking at the rate of lung cancer across the two different exposure groups where we set smoking levels at the ALIL.

49
00:08:49,440 --> 00:09:03,599
You missed one. And then we have the rate of lung cancer among those comparing year one tumors, two among those who are smokers.

50
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,260
And then we have the rate of lung cancer. For those you missed, one versus two among those who are non smokers.

51
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,750
So the story here is that these are actually controlled direct effects.

52
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,550
So these bottom two are controlled direct effects. And maybe the easy heuristic, if you're looking at a test,

53
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:31,560
is that there are the number of controlled direct effects equals the number of radiation levels there are.

54
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,360
So in this analysis, there are two media, there's two different levels of media.

55
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:45,510
So you can be a smoker and not a smoker. So for control, direct effects, basically you're controlling people's mediation values.

56
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,400
And so we are setting everyone to be smokers. Are we sending everyone to be nonsmokers?

57
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,420
And in that situation, these are controlled direct effects.

58
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:06,299
And so the natural direct effect is the one which is a bit weirder because that's the one which is looking at, again, for a direct effect.

59
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,490
You're looking at the relationship between the explosion outcome. But we have to do something with the mediator.

60
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,310
And for a natural, direct effect,

61
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:25,280
we're setting up this counterfactual condition where we think what would the mediating value be if everyone had just one level of the exposure?

62
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,290
Your question. Oh, it. Like I said, you know, the level of.

63
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,290
So does that mean that your first. Great question.

64
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:55,200
So the question is like, what does it mean with the smoking level, with the levels of smoking set at a level as if everyone had the enrichment rate?

65
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:07,110
And that's very yeah, it's confusing. What this is saying is that what are the natural levels of smoking for people who'd have you miss one?

66
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,350
Now, there are some people who have who have you missed? Two. And we do not observe what their natural levels would be like if they had.

67
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,530
You missed one. That's really the idea of counterfactual comes into play.

68
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,680
So for those people who have you wish to, we have to counterfactual.

69
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,850
We assume that they were you missed one and then look at their mediated values.

70
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,800
So it's sort of like an extra step for those wish to we need to figure out what their mediating levels would be like.

71
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,170
It's confusing. Yeah. I mean, it's not like a natural thing to think about.

72
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:43,149
So but again, the natural, direct effect, we're not directly manipulating the mediating value.

73
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,960
What we are is we are manipulating the the the exposure.

74
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:57,360
And we are looking to see what would happen to the mediating level if we set everybody to have the same exposure.

75
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,670
The other thing about the natural direct effect is it's basically sort of an average of the different levels of the control direct effect.

76
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:16,679
So that's another way you could think of it as well. We will be talking about this more.

77
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,489
I understand if it takes a few weeks to set in and I only have you for like seven weeks, you know, just a couple more weeks.

78
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,220
So I understand that it's I do understand that it's confusing. This last one will get to you in a moment, so I'll skip it for me.

79
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,990
Okay. So, you know, today we are we are in the downhill portion of this class.

80
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,450
This is also a bit of a break. There's no homework due this week. So I met with you yesterday and we have some announcements.

81
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:59,140
One, she might take a bit longer to get back your homework that was submitted this week just because you don't have any other homework due coming up.

82
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,560
So it may not be until next week that you get grades for that back.

83
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:12,040
Um, I think, you know, I haven is, is very happy to help you look over your code.

84
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,100
So if that's also something that you have questions or concerns about, please let her know.

85
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:27,670
You know, I'm also happy to do that. But I think going forward, she will not be looking too in-depth at your code.

86
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,360
I think in the past she's been like running a lot of people's code, but that's just, you know, a huge use of her time.

87
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,119
But if you have questions about your code, we certainly can talk it over with you.

88
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,920
And that could be either me or that could be here. The other question that people had in the homework.

89
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,190
And I did not mean to make this so confusing.

90
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,390
But for code part three, I like the codes already provided for you in the output of it is already here.

91
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,700
So you didn't need to run any code for for part three.

92
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,250
And this is something which is like a bit confusing from how sass outputs this.

93
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,780
But when I was looking for the proportion mediated or eliminated, I really just wanted these numbers down here.

94
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,430
Some of you use the formula from class to try to calculate it, and that's absolutely wonderful.

95
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,520
The one thing about this is that and this is just like a bit of background for how

96
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,030
people think about causal inference is that they first calculate the odds ratio,

97
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,940
but the odds ratio actually isn't used to calculate the proportion mediated.

98
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,860
So here they have like total excess relative risk.

99
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:06,690
And I'm not, I'm not sure why they label it this way, but this is basically just like different risk differences.

100
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:18,990
And so this is sort of like the odds ratio. This is the the ratio values, this is the multiplicative scale and this is the additive scale.

101
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,649
So when you're calculating the proportion mediated and the person eliminated, you should be using the risk different scale.

102
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:33,990
Here again, I you know, we're not taking out huge amounts of points for people who try to use the odds

103
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,180
ratio because I understand there is a formula in the slides and whatnot, so I totally get that.

104
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,000
But this this really was supposed to be like an easy look at the last parts, last rows of the table and fill in the charts here.

105
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,510
And then for whatever reason, you know, this is in SAS, the like this 24.6 is 24.6%.

106
00:15:52,530 --> 00:16:00,260
I'm not sure why they don't like just put a percentage. Okay.

107
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,770
So, yeah, today we're going to be talking about model building.

108
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:13,910
I want to get us a refresher on what the idea of like a P value is, what a confidence interval is like, how we can build up our multivariable models.

109
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:25,080
My one ugly font reminder for you for this week is to not use stepwise selection.

110
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,440
And I, you know, in a way I don't really want to explain it because if you're not going to use it in the future,

111
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,049
then, you know, you don't really need to know about it.

112
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,230
But I do think many of you might be at positions in the future where you have colleagues who are using this,

113
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,840
or maybe you'll be tempted to use this at some point in time.

114
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:51,600
And certainly I have a couple of papers published using this typically done with a coauthor who just has a really big fan stepwise selection.

115
00:16:52,050 --> 00:17:00,600
And there are people who argue for it. But I think the article for today did a great job arguing why you should not use stepwise selection.

116
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,649
So if that is one of the takeaways you get from this class, that's great.

117
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,650
I understand in like four or five years you might not really remember that difference being a natural, direct effect in a controlled direct effect.

118
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,260
I get that. But hopefully you have this like negative sense of of not using stepwise selection.

119
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:25,170
I think that would be that would be a great takeaway. But anyone have any questions about this from the reading or from anything else?

120
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,070
Okay. So let's go back to why do we put models together in the first place?

121
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,150
And I would say that there are two different perspectives on this.

122
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:47,490
One thing that everybody epidemiologists like to do a lot is to identify the identify whether there's a significant

123
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,710
association between an exposure and outcome and then to quantify that in terms of the strength of association.

124
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,560
So again, this is what is the odds ratio for smoking on lung cancer?

125
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:06,600
That is that is what I mean. Purpose or, you know, what is the yeah, what is the odds ratio for smoking or cardiovascular disease?

126
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,550
Another thing that you can do is just predict somebody's outcome or predict their risk.

127
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,530
And so sometimes we call this like a risk score.

128
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,070
Some basic versions of this would be going to the doctor and getting like a cardiovascular risk score assessment done.

129
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,420
Um, basically you, you know, you put all of your exposure variables in your model,

130
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,440
but what you're interested in is not necessarily just the single relationship between one exposure to outcome,

131
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,950
but you're looking at developing a model so that in the future,

132
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,470
if you come across like a new patient or a new individual, you can plug their values like are they smoker or not?

133
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,920
Are they a drinker or not? What is their age?

134
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,570
Things like that. Whatever you want to consider to be risk factors, put that,

135
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,340
plug that into your equation and then you can identify like what is the percent

136
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,240
chance that they would develop cardiovascular disease over a certain period of time?

137
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,540
So those are two different things. I would say in epidemiology, we don't use this one as much.

138
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,570
But, you know, this is very, you know, similar process as what we did for coming up with the propensity score.

139
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,120
So you can think of this as kind of like the propensity score method. Okay.

140
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,050
So I want to put this out to you for your small groups.

141
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:41,980
And again, there is a document in a Google drive for you and you can access that through the canvas site for your different groups.

142
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,440
And I will call on one or two groups afterwards to discuss what they think.

143
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,420
But this is a common situation. So and again, I'm making up the exact things, but I think we hear about similar situations a lot.

144
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:04,720
So tell us about a study found a strong positive relationship between coffee consumption and type two diabetes in 2010.

145
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Another study shows a novel relationship and in 2011.

146
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,810
A third thing shows a negative relationship. Why is why could that be the case?

147
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,940
Discuss and I'll give you me 5 minutes will reconvene at like 120 613.

148
00:20:20,950 --> 00:21:18,370
So. We talk about that.

149
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,590
In September. That's how you with.

150
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:50,470
These. This.

151
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,230
17 year. Like four years.

152
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes. Yeah.

153
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:37,270
Yeah. Still.

154
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:57,700
Like. I order to.

155
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:27,720
This may sound. We're not trying to take message.

156
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:44,700
Oh, my God. I know.

157
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:16,290
Yeah. This is important.

158
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:58,720
Yeah. You have.

159
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:47,540
That's why. Okay.

160
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,670
Let us discuss this and I'll just say go around to different groups.

161
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,389
Let us start. And I think throughout this class there will be like enough time for me to get to

162
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,840
most groups that are not going to try to pick any particular groups to confront.

163
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,670
So for you, what do you think are some reasons why this could be the case?

164
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,370
We think that the first possible reason is the narrative that Cuba has declared that, for example,

165
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:24,670
some say we just have to ask ourselves because to 0.041 person sat across a level has.

166
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:34,959
Going to see for a couple years and this afternoon how we propose with the lessons of the study.

167
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,800
Sample size may be pretty small. So this conference can be driven much as you set out that will say that.

168
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:54,130
And we also think that maybe they have different definitions of its for models like how much coffee or drink can be defined as a coffee drinker.

169
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,590
And also, maybe they have different measurements of coffee drinking behavior, you know.

170
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,049
No, those are great, great, great, great.

171
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,580
And it's fantastic. What are your thoughts?

172
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,850
I'm glad you said I. The chance. You didn't.

173
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,980
We have to think more broadly a wide range of biases selective employee selection bias.

174
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,490
And. Know, married.

175
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:40,470
And I don't like that. Two investment partners reduced the amount, but quality opportunities.

176
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:48,970
Absolutely. So I think you between the two groups, those are some like the really big reasons you know,

177
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,970
sample size what you say your alpha level to how you are defining your different variables.

178
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,350
Um, I think those are all in.

179
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,360
How do you insert variables into your model? Like if this is I don't really see what this is.

180
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,010
I assume most of these are observational studies. I don't know of any randomized controlled trial of coffee drinking,

181
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:15,460
but for observational studies, like how are you controlling for other different confounders?

182
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,950
Um, certainly you could think about, you know,

183
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:26,079
is there affect modification happening in the sense that like maybe in a certain population of individuals,

184
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:36,129
like if they have certain dietary patterns, maybe coffee isn't as detrimental or protective, like maybe it kind of eliminates that effect.

185
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,920
Whereas in other populations, maybe that's not the case.

186
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,010
So you could think about like what populations you're also doing this study and then like what their other behaviors are.

187
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:51,010
So lots of different reasons. But I do want to emphasize this is like a big thing that you hear all the time.

188
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,190
And I think one of the fun things about being in public health is oftentimes

189
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,720
public health studies are presented in the news a lot like they're very catchy,

190
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,840
especially like nutrition. But, you know, nowadays with COVID 19, all sorts of studies are being reported in the popular press.

191
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:13,420
And one of the problems is that, you know, we will see one study say something and then apparently another study seems to be contradictory.

192
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,750
And there I think there can be like a lot of confusion among the public for this.

193
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,509
You know, I think from nutrition things like is is coffee like a good thing or not?

194
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,320
Is is eating eggs? Is that a good thing or not?

195
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:37,120
I feel like that kind of shifts all the time. Um, so, you know, is the keto diet or is the paleo diet, is that good or is it not?

196
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:46,180
Things like this can can shift around a lot. And so as epidemiologists, I think we need to recognize why that can be the case.

197
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,519
I think the step further is trying to think like, how do you talk to people about it?

198
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,459
Because I don't think you can. You know, if my parents came to me, you're like, I'm really confused about,

199
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,200
you know, two different studies show two different types of effects from coffee.

200
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,090
I don't think I can go back to them and say, oh, it's just because like the alpha level's different between them.

201
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:16,180
I don't think that's like something that really gets across to them. But certainly talking about like uncertainty in science can be can be important.

202
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:27,819
Okay. Another question for your small group, what does a P value mean in your groups for a frequentist interpretation?

203
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,070
For what? A P value of 0.0 points? If you do not know what frequentist is, just ignore that word for now.

204
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:42,490
Um, and this isn't me asking you to do like significance testing, so don't be like it's significant, but that's not what I'm trying to ask.

205
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,739
It's like, how would you act from your you're by the statistics teacher from last year.

206
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,860
How would you interpret like a 0.0? Like what does that number mean?

207
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:04,120
And you can think of it from I mean, you could think of it for whatever, but let's say for observational study,

208
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,540
looking at copy and logistic regression model for diabetes, we found P-value 0.04.

209
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,120
What what does that.

210
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:21,920
And it might be helpful for you to like actually write this down because it does get a bit confusing to try to, you know, just say it up and.

211
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:54,620
Stage. I do think that.

212
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,130
Yeah. I can only be happy.

213
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:43,100
There's a lot of. Minnesota has 36.

214
00:32:45,110 --> 00:33:07,390
There was a lot. Okay.

215
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,390
I will just be going around the room after.

216
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:22,020
You go after so. He was a good definition for a P-value of 0.04.

217
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,820
And. After.

218
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:59,140
Yeah. So and we'll talk about like the marginally significant stuff in a moment, but I think your interpretation is actually pretty good.

219
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:08,199
Um, and this is where I, you know, last week was all about the confusion of like the different timelines and how to think about things kind of

220
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:18,340
actually this week is maybe just to drive into your head how confusing a P value is because as you mentioned,

221
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,000
a P value operates under the assumption of the null hypothesis.

222
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,360
So we are saying there is no effect.

223
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:36,100
But in a situation where there is no effect, 4% of the time we would observe this test statistic to be this extreme or more extreme.

224
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,820
And the test statistic, you know, that's like the Chi square test or the T test, I think for a logistic regression model.

225
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,940
I actually don't know if it'd be a chi square test or test, but basically like this,

226
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:56,229
you could think of it as a proxy for the strength of association, but the p value again, so under the null hypothesis.

227
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,600
So under an assumption that there is no relationship between coffee, drinking and diabetes,

228
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:10,090
4% of the time we would observe a test statistic this strong or stronger.

229
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,700
And that's confusing because first off, we are as part of the significance testing,

230
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:22,540
we're trying to assume that there is like an actual relationship between the exposure and the outcome.

231
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,080
But like this, this P value doesn't get at that.

232
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,860
And I do want that to be like an important thing that you remember,

233
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,450
because I do think that's something that we kind of emphasize throughout the epidemiology curriculum here.

234
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,430
It's just that it's so confusing and so counterintuitive that I think students forget about it, um,

235
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,620
semester after semester, which is understandable but great for ecological fallacy for getting it.

236
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,799
Because I think many years when I ask students, they like, say, Arun, first of all, so and which is understandable,

237
00:35:50,800 --> 00:36:00,490
but any, any questions about that because it is confusing and it's happy to try to explain it in a different way or.

238
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:14,299
Okay. So oftentimes I hesitate to say like what people think it is just because like I'm worried that like stick in your brain instead.

239
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,940
But I think we do need to to say this.

240
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:26,540
So oftentimes what people think a p value is, is they think it means that there's a 5% chance that the results are due to random chance.

241
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,730
So people will say this and be like, oh, there's a 4% chance that our finding is, you know,

242
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,370
a false positive or, you know, like what we found was just, you know, randomly due to dumb luck.

243
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,770
I think that's like oftentimes what people think.

244
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:49,160
So people equate a p value as some measurement of chance or like a false positive, but that's not actually what it is.

245
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,040
So I'm including a couple of articles from, um, you know, people who are trying to explain this in more colloquial language.

246
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,439
I think if you look this up online, you get like the hardcore biostatistician for doing these really complicated proofs.

247
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,230
This equation is it for really confusing to look through. But then you'll also get a few people who write pretty good articles.

248
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,400
So one of them is here from Vox, and then another one is.

249
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,890
Hope I have a reference for. Yeah, I think it's from this blog here.

250
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:31,470
But let's, let's think about the situation in which we know that ten out of 100 cancer treatment drugs work.

251
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,610
And how do we know this? We we know we have to pretend for some higher being who has knowledge of, you know, the causal realities of our world.

252
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,660
But say that we know that ten out of 100 cancer treatment drugs do.

253
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:53,400
And, you know, this is this is kind of a lot of times what the pharmaceutical companies will do is if they're looking for novel drugs,

254
00:37:53,850 --> 00:38:00,900
they will kind of have a panel of all these different pharmaceuticals and they might try testing them out.

255
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,170
And, you know, so maybe they have 100 different things and they're doing like 100 different in vitro

256
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,629
tests and they're trying to figure out which one of those are actually effective enough.

257
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,930
But say we, for whatever reason, were able to know that tentative. The first thing we need to think about is what is our power?

258
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:26,430
And typically we have 80% power. You could do tests or you could set up samples where you have greater power.

259
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:40,140
But I think 80% power is sort of the default and 80% power means that we will find we would be able to detect eight out of ten significant results.

260
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:49,200
So if there are ten truly effective drugs with 80% power, we would only be able to find eight of them.

261
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,730
Does that make sense? Okay.

262
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:02,840
So for an alpha, an alpha has to do with kind of like the rest of the sample because an alpha is saying

263
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,740
there is a 5% chance of saying that there's a significant result under the null hypothesis.

264
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,340
So the null hypothesis was all of these white squares.

265
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,710
So the null hypothesis is saying that like there is not any relationship.

266
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:29,710
But we will observe, you know, a test statistic that is as extreme or more extreme 5% of the time.

267
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,110
So that's 5% of our of our circle.

268
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,959
I decided last year to cover this up, and I think there's 90 so 5% of nine, it would actually be 4.5.

269
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,070
So that's actually true. It, you know, I probably should add like another row of ten down here.

270
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:49,220
Um, but does that make sense overall what we're saying here for the Alpha.

271
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,420
So 5% of the time we will observe an association, which is not true.

272
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,240
But our test statistic is saying that if that we have statistical significance.

273
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,350
And that's different from power, which is saying that, you know,

274
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:12,180
finding the people who actually are finding that the the cancer drugs, which are actually significantly effective.

275
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,830
So then you know what we would find if we were to like be running the SAS or our code and TB like developing

276
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:31,330
all these samples we would have information on are these like patches here and these black cells here,

277
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:37,340
these are the ones which we would say there is significant results.

278
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,360
These other ones, we'd say there's not a significant result.

279
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:55,880
But if you like, actually add this up, basically five out of 13 of the tests are not actually are not actually truly effective.

280
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:06,860
So that's where in this one example, 38% of the situations in which somebody would say that there's statistical significance,

281
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:14,480
there's actually not any like biological reason for us to say that there is like an effective drug here.

282
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:28,550
So people you know, this is for one situation where we have like a 10%, we think 10% of the time that things would work.

283
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:36,559
People have kind of done like a number of different modeling or simulation studies, thinking about like a range of different effectiveness.

284
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:48,980
And and generally if you have a p value point of five, basically 23% to 50% of the time, you will be incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

285
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:57,650
So basically 23 to 50% of the time, you are kind of in these black boxes here where like there isn't any actually effective.

286
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:08,490
There isn't any effect. One thing we could do and I mentioned this is we could change the p value.

287
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:17,270
So if we had like a bit more of a rigorous P value of point, a one, the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

288
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,450
So saying that something is effective even though it's not, you know, does go down.

289
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:32,120
So it's like 7% to 15%. But that is also something to keep in mind when you're seeing, you know, even in your own research.

290
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:42,380
I think this should keep us humble. If we see something which is less than 0.05, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually a true effect.

291
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,140
So kind of keep this back in the mind that this could be, you know,

292
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,930
a thing that is a statistical association, but that statistically significant effect of perception.

293
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:02,520
Okay. So one thing that you'll see a lot in articles in this,

294
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:10,819
I think I write some variation of the sentence and like every article that I write is

295
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,629
I'll write something which says results were considered significant at an alpha level.

296
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:21,800
Point of fact, sometimes I might say something like the precision of results was assessed with 95% confidence intervals.

297
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:28,040
So, you know, if you're you're putting out confidence intervals, but not P values,

298
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,130
that's something that you could say is that you're looking at precision of results.

299
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:39,770
So there sort of has been for a while this idea that maybe we should change our alpha level to be something lower.

300
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,590
So this is one such idea of maybe changing it to .05.

301
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:52,940
Um, and I will say that like if you get into genetic epidemiology or there might be like

302
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,260
certain subfields where it's just natural that your level would be much lower.

303
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,570
So it could be that in your field or if you're working with an advisor in your own research project, you might have an alpha level, which is more.

304
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:16,180
Okay. So how do we interpret these, quote unquote, borderline P values?

305
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,170
So when I asked you this, this is what you said.

306
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,900
So some of you said, you know, if something came back with a P value point of seven.

307
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,510
Some of you said you can't say anything in terms of cigarets. Some of you like this were trends.

308
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:47,339
So maybe one or two of you said that you like to say that, you know, there is a trend of a relationship or maybe you could say it tends to be related,

309
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,970
but it's not significant or you can say it's marginally significant.

310
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:59,430
Okay. So this is where there is debate in the field for how you share to refer to things.

311
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:08,000
So, you know, different I think even different biostatistician, but certainly different epidemiologists would think of this in different ways.

312
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:12,570
I think the hardcore biostatistician response would be the first one,

313
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:18,060
which is that you cannot say anything in terms of significance since, say, you have a P-value .051.

314
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,290
You just like to not talk about that as being statistically significant or not.

315
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:32,840
And my instincts tends to be how I think about things just to be a bit more conservative.

316
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,300
But in my mind, just because something is not statistically significant does not mean that's not true.

317
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:46,150
It doesn't mean that it's not important, especially since, as I mentioned before, like our P values are this like confusing thing.

318
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,040
Thinking about that, they're not being any such association.

319
00:45:49,060 --> 00:46:00,799
So like a p value is just like a proxy measure, which is very confusing to interpret, but just to be conservative, I'm in like a results section.

320
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,520
I would not say that there's a significant relationship, but I still might report it.

321
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,550
I might report that P value. And then in the discussion section I would still talk about it.

322
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,220
And you can still say that, you know, this might be in line with with future research as well.

323
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,260
This also might be a point for us to do, like a meta analysis or a systematic review.

324
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:29,570
And we'll talk about how you deal with P values, which are seemingly a bit higher than point five in a systematic review in a future class.

325
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:39,950
But I think you can go overboard and I really wish I could find this article because I have such a strong recollection of me reacting to it.

326
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:47,870
So a couple of years ago, the I believe is the Journal of American of the American Medical Association, JAMA.

327
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:56,510
They put out this article which was looking at the the association between exercise and cardiovascular disease or something like that.

328
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,190
And it turns out that it was one of those things where there was like a P value of .06.

329
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:10,010
So getting more exercise was related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but it wasn't significant.

330
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,179
So then the authors had to like go out of their way to say that it wasn't significant.

331
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,270
And they I think they even spent some time in their discussion talking about

332
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,360
why their results were sort of not in line with so much previous literature,

333
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,520
which showed, you know, a protective impact of exercising.

334
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:39,830
But, you know, if you have a P value of 0.061, that doesn't that doesn't mean that like the opposite of what you're trying to look at is true.

335
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:45,530
That doesn't mean that, you know, having exercise causes you to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

336
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:52,580
So I think you can go with on it. This is all to say that I'm not going to give you a clear guidance on what you should do.

337
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,760
And if you are confused, you know, this is definitely something for you to reach out to,

338
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:04,760
like your advisor or like a professor that you're working with or collaborators on your project.

339
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,100
So for me, I again, my, my whole thing is don't say anything in terms of significance.

340
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,390
So like in the results section,

341
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:20,329
I won't mention the word statistically significant in a sentence with something which has like a p value close but above point of five.

342
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,739
But I'll still talk about it in the discussion and I might talk about it in the sense of, oh,

343
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:31,250
you know, we did find like I wouldn't say that we found a protective effect or anything,

344
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:36,290
but I would, you know, compare to other studies which may be different, and I think that would be totally valid.

345
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:42,820
So if you're wondering what to do, I think this is certainly the conservative way, which I don't think anyone will blame you for.

346
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,880
But sometimes people will use words like this. Um, you know, some of these kind of like make me cringe a bit, but, you know,

347
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:58,310
I think it's important to acknowledge that like p values have limited interpretability, limited interoperability.

348
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:05,690
Yeah, I think some people prefer just like recording with confidence intervals, you know.

349
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,400
Yeah, that's actually I think our next thing.

350
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,750
So yeah. So let's talk about that. So many people.

351
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,530
Yeah. Have have pushed for this again because people are really confusing.

352
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,219
I would argue the confidence intervals are a bit confusing but like maybe a bit more

353
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:27,680
interpretable and especially to like a layperson like we understand some degree of certainty.

354
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:37,339
Um, and I would say like most epidemiology journals at this point in time have switched to reporting, um, confidence intervals and not P-value.

355
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,290
So I think the Journal of Epidemiology, the American Journal of Epidemiology typically do not report P values.

356
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:55,459
So yeah, I think my, my one, my one thought about that is sometimes people use confidence intervals to do significance testing like, you know,

357
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,000
because the whole idea is that if you have a p value that's under point of five,

358
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,040
then your confidence interval probably will not cross, you know, one if you have an alteration or something like that.

359
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:14,420
So like a p value of 0.03 might mean that like the confidence interval for your odds ratio is like 1.02 to 2.5 or something like that.

360
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:22,790
Whereas if you had a p value above .05, like if your P value was point one or point two, then maybe your confidence interval would be like.

361
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,510
From point 8 to 3. So then it crosses that boundary of one.

362
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,870
So sometimes people will kind of like get around this significance testing idea,

363
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,540
just be like just report conference intervals, but then still do the significance testing.

364
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,770
And to me that's like, what's the point? You should just put the P values there then,

365
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:47,840
because I think the whole idea behind confidence intervals is like we just don't talk about the word statistically significant anymore.

366
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,240
Like we remove those from the vocabulary of our paper.

367
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,770
Yeah. So again, in your groups, talk about what a 95% confidence interval means.

368
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:05,730
Say that you have this study looking at the relationship between coffee, drinking and diabetes.

369
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:10,740
You have this odds ratio of 2.1, a confidence interval from 1.5 to 3.75.

370
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,430
What what does this 1.5 to 3.75 actually?

371
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,130
Definitely. Yeah.

372
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,260
And as. Different.

373
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,560
The fact that we have is that.

374
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,700
The politics of health.

375
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:56,620
I can't. People.

376
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:21,350
That's. Yeah.

377
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:36,260
Probably. Okay.

378
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:45,910
Picking on another group. The crude oil.

379
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:17,919
Yeah. So I think you're there because this is where confidence intervals, again, this idea of like precision, it seems great.

380
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,200
But essentially what we're saying is that if we conducted many studies over

381
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,070
and over again with a similar population and doing a similar analytical plan,

382
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:34,960
95% of the time the true value, the true effect would lie within the 95% confidence interval.

383
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:41,710
So then I so like the 95% confidence interval is in saying that it's like actually is in between 1.5 and 3.75.

384
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:53,559
What it's saying is that if we conducted like 100 studies that 95% of the time the true value would be between the range of those studies,

385
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,670
their confidence intervals.

386
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:06,629
Which again is like kind of a bit confusing to mention in like I don't think any paper will be like our interpretation of a confidence interval.

387
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:12,900
Is this just like in, in papers, they don't really interpret a p value in such a way.

388
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:23,640
But what I will say is that it's kind of like a good snapshot of kind of like the precision.

389
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:28,380
So that's how I describe a confidence intervals in terms of precision. That's what I say in my section.

390
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:38,389
Any questions on the confidence interval? Okay.

391
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:43,280
So I do want to talk a bit about frequentist versus Bayesian statistics.

392
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,459
Like a show of hands. How many people have heard of Bayesian statistics?

393
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:52,670
And I promise I'm not going to call you, but I just like trying them on to see has anyone, like, even heard the name?

394
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:03,440
Okay, so the easiest way to think about this is frequentist statistics is pretty much what you have been taught in your biostatistics courses so far.

395
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:09,139
And the idea behind frequentist statistics is sort of getting at this like counterfactual notion,

396
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:16,459
but the idea is like our r p values in our confidence intervals come from a thinking.

397
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,710
Like if we repeated our study over and over and over and over again, what would our results be?

398
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,510
So I guess that's what the frequentist part is. It's like the frequency of our study is really high.

399
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:32,360
Like if we did our study a bajillion times, what proportion of those times would we find a test statistic?

400
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,480
And that's what the P value is, or what proportion of the time would the true value fit within the confidence interval?

401
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,260
So that's what like the idea of like a frequentist paradigm is it is very confusing.

402
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:54,530
Like, I don't think people in reality actually think in like a frequency framework, but I think the statistics are maybe like a bit easier.

403
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:01,879
So and like the, the, historically at least the statistical programing has just been like much more, much simpler.

404
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:10,760
And that's why we tend to teach it to you. And I would say like in epidemiology, I don't I don't have like a quantified number,

405
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:20,120
but I would say probably the majority of studies use the frequentist paradigm. So Bayesian statistics is a different way of looking at the world.

406
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:31,430
And the idea of Bayesian statistics is that you have, uh, you have a prior and a posterior.

407
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:43,790
So a prior means that, you know, we are doing a study of coffee drinking and diabetes or priors, like what is our prior information that we know?

408
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,530
Because there's probably been, you know,

409
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:52,460
a couple of dozen studies already in the world which have looked at the relationship between coffee, drinking and diabetes.

410
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:01,309
What have these previous studies found? That is what the prior hits and then, you know, the Bayesian statistics.

411
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,110
We'll kind of analyze that in a very similar way.

412
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:09,259
But based on that prior it all computer posterior and the posterior is the the results of your study you

413
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:15,350
could have like a posterior in terms of the can odds ratio or like a beta estimate for a linear regression.

414
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:26,620
But the idea is that, you know, in a frequentist paradigm, we're I think we're supposed to blind ourselves to what happened in the past.

415
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:32,570
We're supposed to pretend that we're doing our analysis and we're not even like taking past studies into account,

416
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,280
whereas in a Bayesian statistic, we're much more honest about what we actually do know, that previous studies have found this relationship.

417
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:48,110
So let's use that in. That could end up let us end up with a bit more precise information in our own study.

418
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,420
And so Bayesian statistics are being used more and more.

419
00:58:54,050 --> 00:59:04,010
Um, one way that you could distinguish frequencies versus Bayesian is Bayesian statistics don't have confidence intervals,

420
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:09,680
they have credibility intervals. So if you see like a C, r I, that's an abbreviation.

421
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:17,300
Um, that is probably a sign that you have a Bayesian analysis that a frequentist analysis and Bayesian statistics don't have p values.

422
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:23,690
So that's another thing. But you know, you can also kind of combine these two together and I have some papers coming out which,

423
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,170
you know, for a part of the analysis they do some frequentist and part of it do Bayesian.

424
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:38,030
Again, we're not going to do anything crazy in this class, but I do think it's important to kind of have an idea of what it potentially could be.

425
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:47,840
But any questions on it? Yeah, the BBC is like, Yeah, how does that work?

426
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:55,009
So that's like what people will say. So that's the argument against Bayesian statistics or sometimes, you know,

427
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:02,690
people do surveys and I don't know if that's correct, but people will say that like, Oh, you're putting your bias into it.

428
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:08,390
Or maybe, you know, your prior is based on like a few cherry picked studies or something like that.

429
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:14,090
I guess the counter argument the Bayesian statisticians will say is like, you know,

430
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:18,530
in our method section will lay out what our assumptions are, we'll tell you what our prior is.

431
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,360
And so you could critique our analysis and say that like our prior thing.

432
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,770
So. So, I mean, there is like that fact. Yeah, I would agree. Yep.

433
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:39,659
So the reason why in my research I do it is there has been some leak for some of the research that I do for some analysis.

434
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,410
There's been some really nice Bayesian programs which have come out of it.

435
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,470
I would say that like from a philosophical sense, I agree a lot with what's happening.

436
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:56,150
Bayesian wise is just, you know, kind of the inertia of doing a lot of things, frequentist.

437
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:05,550
Just because I'm used to it. So for me, it's like whatever is whatever is easiest to do it fast is to do with like statistical program.

438
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:12,020
That might not be the right answer, though. I think people do like combining these in a bit more thoughtful ways.

439
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:19,430
Okay, so I will give you until 210 for a break and then we will reconvene.

440
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:11,810
First. I don't.

441
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:47,550
This. Know.

442
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:29,410
I would say. You tell?

443
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:41,450
It's been very. Just.

444
01:03:49,130 --> 01:04:20,860
Know. I know I can do.

445
01:04:41,630 --> 01:05:01,250
Until later this week. Oh, great.

446
01:05:35,130 --> 01:06:01,750
I call. You know.

447
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:20,910
Yeah. So. Yeah.

448
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:37,040
Yes. One.

449
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:46,270
So like I saw.

450
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:58,470
I swear. Yeah, I think so.

451
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:06,990
And the look? Yeah.

452
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:11,120
I heard specific case later on. But right now, like this, like.

453
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,300
I don't like that. I didn't want to be.

454
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:31,910
At that point there. The.

455
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,070
I was going to ask the question. Enough.

456
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:47,110
Enough. I've got it. Oh, yeah.

457
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:53,090
Oh. Oh. I really, really have.

458
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:38,660
It's not like. Yeah, that's.

459
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:54,070
Absolutely. Not even qualified to do that actually said this is.

460
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,320
I. So.

461
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:23,310
How about. He was a player, I think that he was going to try to cater to.

462
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:34,780
That. You know, I've got.

463
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:56,390
You to start. Yes.

464
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:01,570
And that's the. No. Yeah, but you. So I think we can go back and.

465
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:11,270
If you have not already, please see who to sign in for today.

466
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:18,920
Has everyone signed in? Okay, well, she is back there and ready to take your signature here.

467
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:26,780
So let's talk about model building, which is supposedly the point of this bus.

468
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,060
So model building for me that means what explanatory variables are you putting in?

469
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:37,730
A multivariable model could also be like how many explanatory variables?

470
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:42,440
So like, how are you constructing? What is your mean independent variable? What are your confounders?

471
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,870
So sometimes model building people will talk about variable selection.

472
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,870
Model selection, they might mean relatively synonymous things.

473
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:57,350
Um, sometimes the word model specification is also used that way, but sometimes model specification refers to like,

474
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:00,500
are you doing a logistic regression or like a possible regression?

475
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:05,149
So questions to ask yourself and I think these are good for you to think about

476
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:09,410
like your own Iili or any research project you're doing now or in the future.

477
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:14,240
First off, is this an observational or an experimental study?

478
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,890
You might have different ways of analyzing results, like generally in experimental studies,

479
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,920
you don't really control for confounders, but observational studies you do.

480
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:28,790
What is the main driver of your research? Are you interested in the explanatory variable or even for the outcome?

481
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,730
Or are you interested in like both together? What do I mean by this?

482
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:38,899
So, you know, I had somebody there is somebody who graduated around the same time as me.

483
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:44,120
I think in the cohort about me and her dissertation research was all about education and health.

484
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,569
So she was most interested in explanatory or variable education and the outcome was sort of secondary.

485
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,190
Of course, she was interested in health outcomes,

486
01:11:52,190 --> 01:12:00,500
but you know what specifically was in regards to like diabetes or cardiovascular disease or other cancers and was kind of in the air.

487
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,830
So she was, you know, really didn't like this explanatory.

488
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,980
Very. You know, you can also think about like your outcome.

489
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,869
Is that what you're interested in? So for me, a lot of the times I'm doing vaccination research, it's you know,

490
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,760
I'm trying to interested I'm interested in who is fully vaccinated in this population.

491
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,760
So the outcome is the thing that's kind of important.

492
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,069
But it could be, you know, the extent of the variable and the outcome together are really important.

493
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:32,220
Like maybe you are really interested in this idea of coffee drinking and diabetes and that's like what your research is going to be on.

494
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,590
Of course, it's important to think about like what scale is your outcome on?

495
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,160
Is this like an interval or no nominal?

496
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:48,420
Are you going to collapse it to be dichotomous for this class or kind of just assuming that your outcomes are going to be dichotomous?

497
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,440
But that's not always the case.

498
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:57,960
Um, you also want to kind of do some data cleaning and make sure there's enough people in different levels of your explanatory variable.

499
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:02,730
And for any important confounders, you're going to have to collect categories down.

500
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,970
And this isn't like a rule of thumb if it's under ten, but you know,

501
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,770
if you have few people in a certain category, you're probably not going to do a good analysis with that.

502
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:17,490
And from a previous class, are you going to do mediation analysis or interaction analysis?

503
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:21,210
If this isn't an aim, if this isn't a mean aim, then just don't do it.

504
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,550
Because any time you add in a mediation or an interaction, you are going to add complexity.

505
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:31,980
And that could be really interesting for your own specific study. But if it's not important for your research, teams, don't do.

506
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:38,480
Okay. So I'm going to also think about different approaches.

507
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:45,320
I'm calling them like an epidemiological approach and about statistical approach based on my observations of, you know,

508
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:52,760
working over ten years with other epidemiologists and with my statisticians and seeing how they approach different types of analysis.

509
01:13:53,570 --> 01:14:01,129
And I my argument for what I could have seen is that epidemiologists over time have taken a

510
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:06,410
stronger stance at developing a priori hypotheses and doing your analysis based on that.

511
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:12,830
Whereas bio statisticians have a bit more of a data driven approach, and I'll be talking about what this means over the next few slides.

512
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:15,950
So the epidemiological approach,

513
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:24,919
what we have been trying to put into your head since day one of this program is to set up a DAG and to base your analysis of the deaths.

514
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,020
So, you know, in this class we did that degree exercise.

515
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:35,240
So figure out how you different variables are directly related to each other have like in your mind ahead of time.

516
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:40,820
What is your exposure, what is your outcome? And then do analysis based on that.

517
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:49,429
So that is the epidemiological approach and we call that a priority because the idea is before you run your statistical analysis,

518
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:58,759
you should have that day put together. So you don't actually need to like be doing lots of back and forth with we're thinking about like, oh,

519
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,810
what confounders should I have in this model or not like that that should already be pre-specified.

520
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:10,780
So we often don't purely do that.

521
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:13,780
We we kind of move away from this a priority approach.

522
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:25,899
And so one thing we often do, and I think this is something that in Dr. Berlin's class for six or two, you probably thought about, like,

523
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,340
what are your tables one and table to a table three,

524
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:35,980
you probably are looking at like an exposure and outcome and you might be unsure about like what confounders to include.

525
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:41,980
And again, you could include confounders based on theoretical considerations, or you could look at what the shape of the data is.

526
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:48,970
So maybe you will run some bivariate tests to look at exposure, confounder relationships and confounder outcome relationships.

527
01:15:49,450 --> 01:16:02,080
And so you could have a table of, like, um, say our confounder was, you know, a bunch of demographic variables, so we could have like a table two,

528
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:11,380
which is looking at what is coffee consumption like across different like age groups, across different like race and ethnic groups.

529
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:17,050
That could be like a exposure confounder table. You could also have a confounder table.

530
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:22,300
And that would be kind of, you know, what our diabetes doubles like across these different demographic groups.

531
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:29,750
And then you could run some bivariate tests like Chi Square for categorical variables.

532
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:35,450
You could do crystal balls for ordinal variables, t test for interval variables which were normally distributed.

533
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,050
And then, you know, maybe based on the significance of those tests, you include them in the final model.

534
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:49,370
I personally would argue that like this, this purely theory driven diag approach is a bit better.

535
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,530
But this is this is one thing you can do. We see a lot.

536
01:16:54,450 --> 01:17:01,680
So one thing I would argue for, though, if you are doing this, is to adjust for multiple testing so you can do a bond printing correction.

537
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:06,600
And so I'm talking to you today about doing adjusted P values.

538
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,620
You can also adjust the alpha level. So there's two different ways of thinking about corrections,

539
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:18,390
like do you just the alpha level and compare your P value so that or do you just adjust your P values and have a constant alpha level?

540
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:23,190
So we're going to be addressing people. So for about for any correction,

541
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:31,050
you multiply all your p values in a bivariate analysis by the total number of comparisons for a home by for any correction.

542
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:37,800
There's a slightly more complicated way of doing it, and I think the easiest way of thinking through this is for you to do it.

543
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:43,290
So you have a Google Drive document open or available for you,

544
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:49,530
which I want you to find out what the property values are and what the home doctor values are.

545
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:55,140
And this is looking at, you know, this is just like a fake study.

546
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:59,190
It's looking at demographic differences in hypertension levels.

547
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,579
And we have three different comparisons. We're doing so we're doing both sex and hypertension.

548
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,340
We're doing it by income and hypertension. We're doing age of hypertension.

549
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:18,570
And I will just put this back on for you to reference, but your Google Drive should have the table for you to do.

550
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,300
And we'll come back in four or 5 minutes to talk to these.

551
01:18:46,390 --> 01:19:36,170
He's. That.

552
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:49,910
Oh. We have.

553
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:05,230
Poet and. So you percent.

554
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:48,010
Great. For the first.

555
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:32,740
I don't know. They are.

556
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,060
Okay. Are we getting done? Maybe, you know.

557
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:09,060
Yeah. Yeah. I just need to help.

558
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:29,040
Oh. Okay.

559
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:37,530
Let us come together and I may pull it over to senior managers at AP.

560
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:45,680
Student So what are you saying? Yeah.

561
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,200
What are your values for the. Right.

562
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,270
We figured that. Yes.

563
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:11,549
So great question. So, yeah, let's talk through this. The number of character comparisons should be three.

564
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:16,410
So I guess what you're saying is like maybe male or female, but really we're saying is like the number of key values.

565
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:25,050
So that's what we mean by comparisons. Um, so really then I don't know why I can't.

566
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:58,460
So for. So for this time we have our value for free.

567
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:09,659
Our original p value is. Okay.

568
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:13,650
So original P-value is 0.003.

569
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:22,840
And what we would do is we multiply that by three comparisons and then we end up with 0.339 and then you know,

570
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:36,800
for income is 0.08 times three and then for a it would be 0.001, five times three and that would be 0.30.

571
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:50,960
Any questions about that? Okay.

572
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:58,400
Um. So. The man running.

573
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:03,830
Did you have any thoughts on how to do the humble bathroom corrected you guys.

574
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:14,110
Yeah. So we just got. Yeah.

575
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:34,260
That. So. So.

576
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:51,650
Yeah. So this is the home bound for me. Should equal just about bumper.

577
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:04,880
Yeah. Super age you would do three minus one because the lowest p value which is the point we know.

578
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,040
Yeah. So this is 3 minutes. I'm sorry. I was getting my numbers confused, so.

579
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,180
Yeah. So this would be 0.003 times.

580
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:21,520
3 minutes. One. Everyone else's now.

581
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:26,530
But then for age this would be the same rate. So the home bank raises the bar.

582
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:30,490
So I mean, for these it's easiest, if you will,

583
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:39,370
just like what you should do is order these from smallest to highest, because obviously this is only three.

584
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,540
That's easy to think through.

585
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:46,270
Well, I have some difficulties, but it's relatively easy to think through what would be the highest and what is the middle then?

586
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:59,780
Very much the lowest number. But for if you have like five or six or ten of them, that can be a bit more difficult.

587
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:03,530
The other thing is that a lot of preschool programs will just automatically calculate this for you.

588
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,740
But I want you to get a feel for where it actually comes from.

589
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:14,270
But when we're talking about the number of comparisons that has to do with like the number of P values that your computer.

590
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:24,420
Any questions about that? Okay.

591
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:33,410
So. This is a bit of an aside, but how many statistical tests should be in one paper?

592
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:40,370
And the answer is probably just one. So say we have an aim or one one test for.

593
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:47,000
So we'll say our aim is to look at the relationship between coffee consumption and type two diabetes.

594
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:56,540
Then really, you know, for doing observational study, the only p value that we have, which is of interest for us is a multivariable model.

595
01:27:56,750 --> 01:28:02,550
Maybe it's a logistic regression model. Maybe it's positive. Or maybe it's no binomial.

596
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:07,940
And we look at the parameter for coffee in there.

597
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:13,520
If we have a randomized controlled trial, then we don't need to adjust for confounders and we can just look at a chi square test.

598
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:24,270
I think what often happens because we're, you know, excited about all of the tests we know how to do.

599
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:30,390
So usually what we'll do is we'll do like P values looking at, you know,

600
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:35,640
the bivariate relationship between copying confounders and confounders in diabetes, those might be two different tables.

601
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:41,160
We might look at P values from an unadjusted logistic or an adjusted regression model.

602
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:49,110
And then we also might be looking at other P values in our multivariable rationale for this class.

603
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:54,510
In some of the models, we've also looked at things we've looked at like ethnicity.

604
01:28:54,510 --> 01:29:02,250
We've looked at, you know, maybe we were looking at age or sex and we might be interpreting those P values.

605
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,520
But I do want to bring up something which is called the table two fallacy.

606
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:18,430
So let's just think of a hypothetical study which is looking at a few different variables.

607
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:22,240
They collected information on whether somebody has cardiovascular disease over time,

608
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:26,350
what are their levels of exercise and what is their levels of stress.

609
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:36,090
And so we could just compute a logistic regression model where the outcome is whether they have cardiovascular disease or not.

610
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:40,930
And maybe we're just dichotomous using these variables like low levels of exercise,

611
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:46,240
high levels of stress, and then we come up with these other issues.

612
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:54,430
But how do we interpret these odds ratios? Because we can think of like, what is our dad behind this?

613
01:29:55,390 --> 01:30:00,130
Are we saying that exercise and stress are just independent predictors of cardiovascular disease?

614
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:05,950
And if that's if that's the case, then you could interpret the odds ratios, as we have been doing,

615
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:16,599
saying like a lack of exercise is associated with 1.9 times higher odds of cardiovascular disease compared to those who have sufficient exercise or,

616
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:24,190
you know, high stress is associated with 2.2 times higher odds of cardiovascular disease compared to those with low levels of stress.

617
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,310
So that's like an appropriate thing for age.

618
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:37,630
But if our model is that, you know, exercise might influence people's stress levels, then all of a sudden stress.

619
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:47,720
Is mediator of this relationship. Or you could think of exercise as a confounder.

620
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:59,000
And because that gets, you know, so which is all to say that like interpreting stress is fine,

621
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:08,390
but interpreting the value of exercise in this model is not okay because stress mediates that relationship.

622
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:12,799
And exercise is just a confounder. Similarly, we could think of like,

623
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:20,330
maybe our main thing we're very interested in is exercise on cardiovascular disease and maybe people's level of stress influences,

624
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:26,540
whether they exercise or not. In which case, like exercise is a mediator of this relationship.

625
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,130
And Stress is the cofounder of the Exercise CBD relationship.

626
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:39,770
So I would just this is all to say, like when you have, you know, the output from SAS shows all the different odds ratios,

627
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:45,950
it's tempting to just go through and interpret all of them using all of the fancy language that, you know,

628
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:54,590
I've been hammering into your heads during this class, but I think it's important to think thoughtfully about, you know,

629
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:59,029
our what is the mediator of something, what is confounder something,

630
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:03,710
and does it really make sense to have an independent interpretation of a certain value?

631
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:10,120
Any questions? Okay.

632
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:18,420
If we're moving into more of a bi statistical approach, both statisticians love thinking about auto fitting goodness a bit.

633
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,950
This might be something that you have to deal with in your biostatistics courses.

634
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:29,890
And by this I mean, you know, in SAS you'll have all this information presented about goodness to fit them all fit.

635
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,370
And so what does model fit actually mean?

636
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:41,530
Basically, what your statistical program is doing is it is predicting for every value what their outcome should be,

637
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:46,930
and then it's comparing that to what their actual value is and seeing how much of a discrepancy there is.

638
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:52,660
So it's a comparison between actual and expected values still like your observed values in your model values.

639
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:56,799
And so there's, you know, different ways of doing this. There's the AC.

640
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,310
The BBC likelihood ratio has very little to show.

641
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:03,580
It kind of depends on what your outcome is, what kind of regression model you're doing.

642
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:10,090
And of course, like your model says, like how many different variables you have in your model does affects this.

643
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:22,720
But I will say that, you know, this the seems in my in my past of working with with different folks,

644
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:27,309
I think this has become like a bit more of something that both statisticians

645
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,850
look at and less so for epidemiologists because oftentimes they're optimal.

646
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:38,290
Just, you know, we're interested in the relationship between one exposure and one outcome, whereas for statisticians,

647
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:43,570
maybe they're really focused on developing the best model, which has the best predictive capacities.

648
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:50,050
And so there's different like theories and different cultures behind why we would put together models in different ways.

649
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:57,430
So like more of a data driven approach could be using stepwise regression.

650
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:01,520
You know, there's forward, backward, bi directional, stepwise progression.

651
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,930
I'm not going to talk too much about this. I just don't think you should really be doing those.

652
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:10,120
There's been a subset selection. Here's an explanation of it. I don't think it's really that important.

653
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:20,740
Basically, you limit your model size and then it sees what variables could be included in it to create the the best model fit.

654
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:27,640
So we exist on a continuum. I don't think there's very few people who are purely on one side versus another.

655
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:36,820
You know, maybe a bit more of the epidemiological or the a primary approach is to look at your DAG and then just do things solely based on the day.

656
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:42,730
That is more of a focus on the exposure and outcome and just like one relationship.

657
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:49,960
And that's if that one relationship is the primary thing that you want to talk about for more of a statistical approach.

658
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:54,999
You know, this is something that's easier to be automated. We're more interested in model fit statistics.

659
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,960
And so what the exact composition of independent variables actually holds could be up for debate.

660
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:03,620
It could be kind of based on what gives you the best model.

661
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,899
And so there's, you know, a bunch of things that we're not going to be talking about all of these.

662
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:16,790
But there are, you know, other approaches like decision trees, which also can be a bit more about statistical in nature.

663
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:23,060
Okay. So that is all I have for today. Any questions?

664
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:26,060
I will stay up here in case anybody does have any questions.

665
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:31,250
But again, no homework for this week, but there is a reading quiz next week and I will see you in.
