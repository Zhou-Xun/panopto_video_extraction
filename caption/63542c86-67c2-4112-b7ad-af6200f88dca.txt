1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:11,500
With morning, everyone. We are going to start our last leg of evolutionary nutrition.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,280
The topic for today is Paleolithic Diet and health.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:29,250
Before we start, I just wanted to, um, to wish you good luck in your last week of class, your final report.

4
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:40,680
I hope that everything going with you. Also, don't forget the final report for this class due a week from today.

5
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,360
Do you need more time for any reason? Just let me know.

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,910
They are like I am flexible with them without the due date.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,430
You know what more?

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,450
Also, don't forget, you haven't done it yet to complete the course evaluations.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,860
Done that too. Okay, great. I will appreciate that. This is the third time I teach this.

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,940
Glad to know you were I. Boy, looking for ways to improve the class.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:22,260
I will appreciate your comments. Okay, then if you don't have any questions so far about any final issues.

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,620
I will start then. As always, I will talk a little bit about that, but you'll need to rethink that yet.

13
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,150
What we know about. And then in the second part of the today's club, we will discuss as we have done before then.

14
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:46,650
Then when we talk about Paleolithic diets are on the topic of today will be how these are so.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,200
I really think that it may help us to improve health at the population level.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,650
Now, there are several assumptions when we talk about Paleolithic diet and health.

17
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:11,160
One of the assumptions that we humans adapted to an ancestral diet that was developed during the ah during the Paleolithic period,

18
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,690
then the Paleolithic period that we have see previously in glass is a very long period

19
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:27,420
of time from more or less 2.6 million years ago in the past to about 12,000 years ago.

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,190
This is I remember about 12,000 or 10,000 years ago is more or less the end of

21
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:44,940
the last Ice Age and the time when wet ancestors they started to settle in,

22
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,070
in groups and in body with the development of agriculture.

23
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,340
Now, so of this corrected characteristic of this so-called Paleolithic diet,

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,040
these are high intake of protein, fiber and essential fatty acids and no consumption of total fat and sodium.

25
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,670
We will discuss about that in this lecture,

26
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,379
although doesn't show the relationship between Paleolithic diet and have either

27
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,830
the genetic change is this low that allele frequencies change over time,

28
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,969
but it's a slow change versus consequent.

29
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,700
There is a mismatch between our genomes and our actual diets, our modern diets, diets.

30
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:43,500
As a consequence, we are going to have a burden of different chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,

31
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:54,660
etc. Then these are some of the assumptions why Paleolithic diet can be helpful, helpful in for for today.

32
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,390
Now let's discuss some of these assumptions.

33
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:11,520
Dom, first, how burial both in geography and time, what that diet of our hunter gatherer ancestor during the Paleolithic diet.

34
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,310
Then let me ask you, do you think that there was a unique diet during this period of time?

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,480
So is there actually there are unique things.

36
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,440
Yeah, but could you. Because here we are talking about a long period of time.

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,420
Then you'll see that during that period of time. Or until they thought they were eating exactly the same.

38
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,020
No. Okay. Then, then that's an important point to consider that really there was a huge geographic

39
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,390
temporal variation from the study of the white ancestors we discuss in class.

40
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:59,490
We read in some of our previous lectures about the evidence about.

41
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,580
It diluted the very ah.

42
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,130
It was acquired by the ability of the dilute.

43
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:16,750
Now other point to consider whether diet is the only or even the major evolutionary force shaping the human the human genome.

44
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:26,890
Can you tell me all the possible forces that have been shaping our genome during our Ebola region?

45
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:41,499
Um. The use of the actually a cancer gene modification is environmental and that we start

46
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,940
to have differences that expression was yes but but genome mean complete you know

47
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:55,690
means our on that sequence of our DNA sequence then they are other forces be beside

48
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,590
equal diet is an important but yeah certainly some ages that is a major factor.

49
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,180
The point is whether there are other forces that also will be active in the past to shape our genome.

50
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,860
Do you remember some of the forces that we discussed? Um hmm.

51
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,710
I mean, it's just theory in general. Mm hmm. A lot of things you referred to the things we discussed.

52
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,220
Yeah. The microbiome. Or, like, are we talking about, like, in the bigger picture?

53
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:37,540
At least somewhat. I wonder we discussed here in class the one that the more disease resistance, those those remain to be eliminated.

54
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:45,370
Exactly what is causing infections, our ability to fight infection as a major force shaping our genome.

55
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:58,719
Also, we talk about sexual selection, our ability to fight partners, to reproduce them that even enforces the Hakka that I mean, shaping our genome.

56
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,830
Not only that, you know, other question is how our genome has changed since the political period.

57
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:14,140
Our genome is more or less up, let's say, compared to now 10,000 or both.

58
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,730
Then remember when we discussed the ancestral DNA?

59
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,329
Mm hmm. That now, with the new techniques that we have, with the new technology that we have,

60
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,630
where they would be able to compare the DNA from its political remains without their humans.

61
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,179
And what we have found that even if in fact,

62
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:49,690
the difference between the genome from the 10,000 our own genome now we don't know about the genome, for example, from more in the past,

63
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:56,559
for example, Homo erectus or I mean is because our techniques that we have right now,

64
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,240
they don't allow us to to retrieve your DNA from from very long in the past.

65
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:16,840
I think the oldest I think the the the oldest DNA that we have been able from a wet ancestor to study is about half a million years ago.

66
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,710
And also, we need to consider that changes in our genome are not the only ways that we adapt to the environment.

67
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,670
The other way that we can adapt to environment, for example, behavioral changes,

68
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,320
we talk about developmental plasticity, about reaction problems of our genome.

69
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,300
Then there are different ways besides changes in our genome that we adapt.

70
00:08:49,100 --> 00:09:01,090
Professor, we didn't say about some of the the iron ore or the like upgrade, like we got recoded like part of the code deleted and put in virus.

71
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:10,550
We can do that. Yep. And we know that viruses because viruses, there are some viruses that they are able to integrate into our genome.

72
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,160
Mm hmm. And they can remain there dormant for years, even for generations.

73
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,069
And then we don't know exactly the mechanism,

74
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:25,880
but they can activate how activate our to react that way that they ever felt shaping our genome infections.

75
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,909
Okay. Then let's discuss further evidence about a single Paleolithic diet with it.

76
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,880
In fact, that was a single Paleolithic diet. No, I don't remember the Paleolithic period.

77
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,069
Usually it's considered from about 2.6 million years ago.

78
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:51,060
In the past, that is more or less the origin of our own genus, with that genus with Homo habilis,

79
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,970
more or less up to the end of the ice age, about 10,000 or 12,000 years ago.

80
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,930
And this is that down to the last ice age.

81
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,489
And this is what the time when we found affairs, evidence of some civilizations,

82
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:23,160
or at least as long more, or I will say, hierarchical human groups, the development of agriculture.

83
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,940
The writing would be more or less about 5000 years in the past.

84
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,090
But around this time when we have agriculture and also the domestication of animals,

85
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:41,280
then we have a long period of time and also a very huge geographic variation.

86
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,890
Now, let me ask you one question. Do you remember?

87
00:10:50,850 --> 00:11:00,390
When was that time when our only species or the United Hour, the homo sapiens species?

88
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,070
But yes, there are 54 million.

89
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm going to know for me, John, even when we die, we are morally from that chimpanzee.

90
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,980
But the. The world wants peace. The Homo sapiens is more reason to 1.2 million.

91
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:30,420
8000 800,000 is the building. If it is 100,000, 300, 300,000, it's about I Rolf estimates is about 200 to 3000.

92
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,130
Then it will be around this time here. I remember it was in Africa and then they left it emigration out of Africa.

93
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:48,840
But I want to point out that even I would appreciate what do you need around 3000, 200,000, you 200,000 or 300,000 years in the past.

94
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:57,060
But some of our ancestors formed the from the homo, I think, of Homo erectus.

95
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,740
They, in fact, migrated all out of Africa.

96
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:09,640
Hmm. Then not only the Homo sapiens, but also some of our ancestors.

97
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,979
Also, they they were able to migrate out of Africa.

98
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,720
And then we have remained from there, not only in Europe, but also in Asia, for example.

99
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:26,830
So humans yet. So is that just like derivatives of the Homo erectus?

100
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:39,460
He Yep. Here humans referred to in this paper with night where I took this picture are you powerful researcher consider any is

101
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:47,680
busy from the homogeneous to be humans then the Homo habilis Homo erectus is another form of they are considered humans,

102
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,060
just not Homo sapiens. Following the Homo sapiens were Homo sapiens.

103
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:06,580
In fact, that is a very provocative book from the anthropologist is called the uh, I think that first chimpanzee because the,

104
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:15,729
the argument is that we are chimpanzees because there are two species of chimpanzee.

105
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:29,170
The, um, the, the, let's say the, the common chimpanzee that Pongo bum Pongo that, that, that name.

106
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,120
But there is another chimpanzee that is called the bonobo, the bamboo Nobel.

107
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,480
And then this anthropologist made the makes the argument that, in fact, we are also chimpanzees, that we are.

108
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,580
Yes. Are defending a species from that from that time data that then from that.

109
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,940
And then he makes an argument about genetic difference behavior.

110
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,189
But, yes, there was a small discretion. But I just want to clarify here.

111
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,780
When some people consider anyone from the Homo dinos that humans.

112
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,080
So that. So what's the difference between a chimpanzee and a great ape?

113
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,220
A chimpanzee is a great ape in the text. Yes.

114
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,600
Gorilla, orangutan, chimpanzee are great apes.

115
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,290
Humans are from the chimpanzee. Yes.

116
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,910
Yes. We remember the model that evolution was.

117
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,700
We had the hominin line. Then chimpanzee, orangutan and gorilla.

118
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,650
They separated before the chimpanzee.

119
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,850
Then in between 4 to 60 million years ago, in the past, the familial and the chimpanzee diverged.

120
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,950
And Pongo is different than the bull Congo.

121
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,900
I'm looking at it now on the gorilla, the pan and the homo.

122
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,689
Yes, yes. But the Pongo is different than the pan, which is the chimpanzee and the.

123
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,760
No. Yes. Bongo, I think let me let me say, boy, that they're on the wrong button.

124
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,660
Oh, yes, yes. Sorry.

125
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,090
Yes, Bongo of sorry. Yes, I see.

126
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:21,180
Bongo, you've got the orangutan. Yes, yes, yeah.

127
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah, that. That general. So the chimpanzee is Pan? Yeah.

128
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,810
Mm hmm. But no one really is Pan.

129
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:49,850
Punishing policy. Kit Bond troglodytes that are that common chimpanzee and bonobo that is more mother one.

130
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,230
Okay. Sorry. By my confusion. Bongo, the orangutan. Okay.

131
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:08,970
Okay. Also, are we discussing in a previous lecture that the evidence that we have is that everything that we have

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,639
is that the less accurate variation of wood composition within that polarity based on the micro,

133
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,570
where remember that we are we discuss only.

134
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,870
So maybe then based on the old remains from the dental data and we saw argued

135
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,060
by the ability and that type of foods based on that there were limitations.

136
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,000
Remember, remember. So one of the limitation of this type of data that dental micro where.

137
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,740
Hmm. The. The size of the.

138
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,540
I like the job. Yeah, I mean, the sharpness.

139
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:59,890
Mm hmm. Yeah. We get. We can see that shape so that people try to infer what they were eating, but.

140
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,880
Collection? Yeah. One collection. Because that depends on what we're able to.

141
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,430
To get to retrieve. But remember that micro where that entire micro where is lost?

142
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,060
Just for a few days. We went maybe for a few weeks. Mm hmm.

143
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,930
Because change over time, depending on where we are eating. Mm hmm.

144
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:29,890
Now, the limitation with these is that these are used to collect dietary information from the last maybe weeks of life.

145
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,240
Remember, that is called the last last meal. Data.

146
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:44,800
Meal. Data. Yes. Now, also with this on data from the lower middle Paleolithic from the Middle East and the what data from Israel,

147
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,200
a site in Israel where they found also last but immediately in plant based diet rundown from the Paleolithic.

148
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,280
Then that that tells us that, in fact, there was a unique Paleolithic diet.

149
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,360
There was body aridity across time and also across geography.

150
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:23,150
Now then we can conclude from homonyms first a limitation they reconstruct it mainly from animal animate is critical remains because

151
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:32,660
we need this data then is based on what we are able to retrieve therefore is going to be biased towards protein based diet.

152
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:45,290
And we know from the evidence that results from other results suggest that in fact it was a by the ability of plant based diet.

153
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:58,010
Now, if we can maybe characterize this diet, I will say that was a diverse diet and also nutrient dense diet.

154
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,060
Then even if wild based on plant or maybe animal protein, but was not nutrient dense diet.

155
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,340
Okay. Now let's call someone the selective pressure amelioration.

156
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:24,550
Now, in fact, and this is what we discuss in class besides diet, besides what we are eating that is any strong evolutionary force.

157
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,590
They are other forces that have been shaping our genome and this infection,

158
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,280
our ability to fight infections and what is called the visceral, adipose tissue theory.

159
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,870
Also sexual sexual selection, our ability to reproduce.

160
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,370
And also we discuss all this like historic trade off with example,

161
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:56,410
why in humans we live long years why our the infant that in fact they take more time they are

162
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:04,390
more depending of of their parents why the weaning is shorter compared to other primates.

163
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:15,040
Also with this called the longevity of the human females after menopause, then we discuss all these factors that can may be affecting our genome.

164
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,930
And of course, one of our I think the last lecture we discussed that evolution with the

165
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,750
microbiome and this is very important because then all these selective forces,

166
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,870
they have been shaping not only our own genome, but also that genome from our microbiome.

167
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,060
How about in our you know, are the changes in our own genome now?

168
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,170
And that is about sunshine. Let me go back here.

169
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,580
There is an assumption that genetic changes are slow.

170
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:02,580
They usually take many, many generations to observe a significant change in frequencies over time.

171
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:14,670
However, we discuss that genetic drift can result in rapid changes of radio frequencies in just a few generations.

172
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:22,290
Can anyone remind me what is genetic drift? Remember the conflict or genetic drift?

173
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:30,170
Yeah. Is like gathering.

174
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:37,340
And then after about 20 generations that the majority become like a little mix, become a mixed model.

175
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,140
Yep. You some remember it. The random change changes.

176
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,030
Yeah. Remember that we did those simulations.

177
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:54,290
Yes. That and these is is are stronger in a smaller populations because you can mix.

178
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:01,790
Exactly. Because they are more remembered. The smaller the population, the the the bigger the affect of chance or randomness.

179
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,610
And what we know based on remains and also what we know from also from Korean of the hunter gatherer group.

180
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,890
And they are small groups. They are not Jewish groups rather than small groups.

181
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:27,590
Therefore, the opportunity for genetic drift is bigger than them, that this result from genetic drive shows that in fact,

182
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,330
genetic changes can be relatively fast over time, can take just a few generations.

183
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,550
And also, you were talking about small groups. Then the change can be fast.

184
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:48,780
And we know that even after the development of agriculture is still we have natural selection in our genome.

185
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:58,980
We discuss the duplication, the amylase gene. Remember that in population that they consume more carbohydrates, they have more copies of aging.

186
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,430
And this is way after agriculture.

187
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:14,490
And also with this called the translation of that lactase gene when populations die in Northern Europe or to the Middle East,

188
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:23,850
that in the part where where domestication of animal animal was observed and that's how you can start your dairy.

189
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,980
There is this high frequency or the ideal for the persistence of lactase in adult life.

190
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:43,110
Now remember also we discovered that there are several genes related to lactose tolerance, but this is one model and the one that important ones.

191
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:52,010
Then what I'm trying to say to to tell you is that even after agriculture, I would, you know,

192
00:23:52,020 --> 00:24:00,470
have been changing our genome is not fixing the past is not is adapting, is not acting even in these times.

193
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:10,780
Yeah. And then we are going to talk a different way that organisms in general adapt to the environment.

194
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,990
Now why genetics? By changing frequencies.

195
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,720
We discuss, for example, the I mean, a gene that I think lacked a gene.

196
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:31,210
Also, an example that I discussed with you in previous lecture was, for instance, for example, what you said is a virus.

197
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:39,129
They better a little bit infectious than people with any added protective against the viruses.

198
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:46,780
They are more able to reproduce and to survive and therefore that value is going to change in frequency over time very fast.

199
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,500
But also we can adapt changes, just our behavior.

200
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,370
We can change that. We're behavioral. We can imagine that our ancestors also, they were changing behavior to adapt.

201
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,980
Also, we can adapt by changing our life history with this called developmental plasticity.

202
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:19,210
Not any more important, no more them, I would say, but a very important phenotypic plasticity that our own genome,

203
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,310
even if we have a particular genome that can respond in different ways to different environments.

204
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:33,250
There is a whole usual battery of responses that our DNA can have, and this is called reaction arm.

205
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:41,710
Then this is important because sometimes in the mismatch theory that it is essential that I you know, we frothing at the time.

206
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,930
There is this assumption in the mismatch theory that our genome is crossing, not changing,

207
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:56,650
and then we have our mismatch with occurring environment and then we have slightly better mental disease.

208
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,879
However, I would, you know, is able to respond, is able to respond,

209
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,320
is able to adapt even without changes in the DNA sequence using these phenotypic plasticity.

210
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,780
Okay. What is the evidence now regarding the Paleolithic diet? Now, we don't know.

211
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,249
We can not go to the past and see, for example, a study, dieting.

212
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,270
I wouldn't say stone and see how they die, whether they develop some chronic disease or not.

213
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,050
We cannot do that. However, we could.

214
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,410
We could try to do something. An approximation in Korean populations.

215
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:47,780
Mm hmm. Now, I almost sure that you have read some papers about Paleolithic diet and health and what people do.

216
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:53,630
Yes. To match your diet using food questionnaires or from data from records.

217
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:01,960
They call it diet information. And then they calculate any score, a Paleolithic score.

218
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:10,390
And usually this is the way that word points are assigned to high intake of basically one fruit.

219
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:21,250
The meat I'm not and you take points the ones you don't eat you don't consume those those those are food.

220
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,610
Also points are assigned. You have a low intake of red and processed meat.

221
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:36,010
So you dairy grains, the starches are getting it are processed food, alcohol, soft drinks.

222
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:45,130
Then the idea is to have some kind of a score that is going to be an approximation to a Paleolithic diet.

223
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,290
QUESTION So maybe they ferment the fruit, make alcohol.

224
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,290
These both don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.

225
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,080
Yes. Because they don't they didn't have fridge.

226
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,899
So fermentation maybe the since get wrong like sit there for a while, it becomes possible.

227
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:14,680
Exactly. You know, it's possible that that fruit fermented in the opium, they get high.

228
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,460
And is it? Yes, I read the book. In fact, the book is called Booze.

229
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:32,740
Booze. Yes. Is about how alcohol, drinking, alcohol had the impression with humans since the beginning of civilization,

230
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,429
you saw there is evidence that the people want.

231
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,639
They settle down, develop agricultural food.

232
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,980
They were developing fermentation. Yeah. Okay.

233
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,630
Then they send out papers. I put one of the papers in the camp that you can read.

234
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,230
And this in you are the one you calculate this score.

235
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,180
Then you can just try to associate that the score with any health outcome of interest.

236
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,990
Then this is an is. On a study and what they did.

237
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,980
They looked these Paleolithic diets score from related to mortality that in general.

238
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,300
Remember this is higher hazard ratios lower than one.

239
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,230
Hmm. Okay.

240
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:29,450
Decided not to look at some of the hazard to drill the hazard ratio that we have on a scale negative to positive than lower than zero in this case,

241
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,640
because in that logarithmic scale, lower than zero means that it's protective.

242
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,370
Hmm.

243
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:46,320
And higher than zero means that it harmful that in general, the Paleolithic diet score was associated with lower mortality, overall, lower mortality.

244
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,169
They did some certifications, for example, for people with co-morbidities and people without comorbidities,

245
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:59,569
and they found females actually sold the stratify by black bears.

246
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,080
That's why they found similar results by sex. Similar results.

247
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,679
Even you'll see the point estimate they are different, but you'll see that the confidence intervals,

248
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:22,850
the overlap by age later 65 year model 55 that in general in general this Paleolithic Digest cause seems to be associated with lower mortality.

249
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,600
The earlier section was seen among current smokers smoking.

250
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:36,170
If in the in the the the completion will be you smoke that went to die down burnt

251
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,330
you know when the e-cigarette for people who just smoked for two some years.

252
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,250
Mm hmm. That there long look like they've smoked regular cigaret for 30 years.

253
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,790
This is from M.D. that they see. No.

254
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,319
Yeah, that's that's. Okay.

255
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,240
Now, but let me ask you. Okay. We have this ascorbic.

256
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:05,180
We can we can take a data from that effort with you and we can create any type of score that we want, even you can imagine.

257
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,059
And you got a new one.

258
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:17,390
And you know, then let me ask you, do you think that this score is representing a true Paleolithic diet or what do they use it to?

259
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,780
No, I will say the same. This is core.

260
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:32,800
It is not representing a Paleolithic diet. We basically just had an escort that is is correlated with high consumption of fibers.

261
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,680
All these the high consumption fibers are based.

262
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,440
Ebola not being made by the oil yet,

263
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:50,929
but by I imagine that you calculate this score and you correlate that the score with the type of body in, for example,

264
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:56,569
the Mediterranean body or why not this pattern for the American Heart Association,

265
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:06,740
they are going to be highly correlated because it does say Paolo led to look like what that means is, oh, no, dairy.

266
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,030
Yeah, no dairy stuff. Now what they did. It's just look.

267
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,990
Yeah. What they did because remember this is data from our full freedom questionnaire.

268
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,470
Then they assign points to these foods then.

269
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,480
And you see here low intake of dairy. Exactly.

270
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,410
Then this Yohannes core, I would say these underscore they correlated with these foods.

271
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
But I, I think it's not a patriotic diet.

272
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,570
Okay. Because he still allowed some of the stuff that was in there.

273
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,590
However, it is a combination with methods of training. Yep.

274
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,540
And in fact, he had also they found that Mediterranean diet itself was associated with low mortality.

275
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:59,060
Then, uh, then these score, they tend to be correlated between them because in fact, what they are measuring is that same type of food intake.

276
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,190
Now other point to consideration is that even because here they are, they are.

277
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,500
Even I will say that means that we're consuming even evenly the R limit.

278
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:24,060
The R I will take the micronutrient composition, I would say easily.

279
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:32,600
It's about exactly the same at the middle where our ancestors were because they were eating more what they were eating while man.

280
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:44,220
QUESTION Exactly. Now, another limitation of these is that, again, as we discussed before, the diversity of diet even in acquiring diabetes.

281
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:57,300
Okay. This is from this paper and this is some people have done some estimated to that we raise Paleolithic intake in three major macronutrients.

282
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:04,650
Basically, they I would say one third carbohydrate is one third fat and one third of protein.

283
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:12,120
And yet in the United States now, but by what is well,

284
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,599
the calcium that we need to have that even in current context that we can say that they are more or less more

285
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:26,880
similar to opportunistic diet is that that is actually about the ability for example that the enriched from Alaska,

286
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,720
their diet consists mostly of seal and whale meat and fat.

287
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,670
Exactly. That is in some is mainly flat on protein.

288
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:47,700
However, these other countries that are from New India, they consume about 70% of carbohydrates, but mostly from polar bear, some fruits.

289
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,290
Then here again,

290
00:34:49,290 --> 00:35:03,780
the point that I want to make is that e there was a Paleolithic diet in the past was characterized by diversity and nutrient dense foods.

291
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:17,060
Mm hmm. Now I recommend for you to read this book, this paper that is in combat, even if you don't read it before today.

292
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,810
But please take your time to read the argument.

293
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:30,950
The author the authors are making either now in the in mother population, we have this problem of region.

294
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:38,480
Then we have a problem with undernutrition. We have a deficiency of different nutrients.

295
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:46,760
But however, also in rich societies, even with we are eating more calories, but also we have the efficiency of different nutrients.

296
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,920
Hmm. Then I recommend, please to read this article.

297
00:35:52,130 --> 00:36:03,680
Then let me ask you this. Then in the Paleolithic diet, we don't have let's say what we know because there was no grains or to know dairy,

298
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,130
there was no domestication of wild animals, not everything.

299
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,210
Or if there was no agriculture, then no grains.

300
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,610
Then do you think fair weather if we were to eliminate dairy and grains?

301
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:23,210
You know, what about their diets and what are the consequences regarding a nutritional content?

302
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,200
Now and remember there and grains.

303
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:39,510
Analysts are concentrating Walgreens. They have important micronutrients.

304
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:48,569
Now then the point I want to make is that I would say that is unfeasible and impractical,

305
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:55,440
are not practical to try to reproduce a truly Paleolithic diet in our modern societies.

306
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:07,120
Now. Do you see just the percentage of per capita consumption of cereals in the world?

307
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:19,360
And you'll see that they are populations that are a major part of their diets are based on cereals, cereal, cereals, grains, grains.

308
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:25,360
Huge. Hmm. Then you were talking about Paleolithic diet.

309
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,480
Can we replace cereals that if we didn't replace?

310
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,910
And how do we feed the human populations? Mm hmm.

311
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:43,060
No. Now, there is a nice discussion there in the paper about the then all the environmental considerations also changes in agricultural policy,

312
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:56,049
because the problem that the also discussing these are sometimes is that sometimes we focus too much in judgments on particular proteins,

313
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,410
for example, located in subdivisions, or at least by the mean or deficiency of these particular amino acids.

314
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:13,090
And we try to make these are interventions with supplementation to try to just to, to supply that particular ah to remedy that particular deficiency.

315
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:21,640
However, if we learn something from the diet, from the past that they were nutrient dense,

316
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,630
then rather to focus in this particular nutrient, maybe we can need to focus in foods, whole foods.

317
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,910
Exactly. A more holistic approach rather than just one particular nutrient.

318
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:41,110
Because also that the problem with are we focusing in just even watching this on time what's the message to

319
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:49,600
the general public can be confusing for example are what is our right proportion of carbohydrate for example,

320
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:58,600
or what is the right ratio for omega six and omega three polyunsaturated fat that if in some they are still

321
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,770
not said that we don't know the they are these are questions that we don't know get the right answer.

322
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:11,560
A lot of that is somebody's ability depending on the type of carbohydrate that we're talking about or them.

323
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,219
And this is one limitation of when we focus. Yes.

324
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,860
In particular nutrient that also the message to that to the general public can be confusing as our results are changing.

325
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:33,990
Yeah. Now and also one consideration to take into account is our diet compared to Paleolithic diet is a monotonous beast.

326
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,139
You just basically see that few food items you see here.

327
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:47,680
And this is in the in a weird way like you see the 3% of our calories came from sugar cane and this is worldwide,

328
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:58,360
you see in our way average about 16% from poor rice, about 11% with about 11%.

329
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,450
And there is brother from cow cows about 10% and they are all in for that.

330
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:12,280
But you'll see that just a few foods contribute to do most of our calories.

331
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,909
I know there was a cassava. Cassava.

332
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,560
This is a good I hope we call Duka.

333
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,989
Oh, you do? Yeah. A lot in the Indian indigenous culture in the middle of South America.

334
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,270
Yeah. What we did in Costa Rica too is, is that traditionally because we do some.

335
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,530
Let's do a preview of with the Yucatan Peninsula.

336
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,589
Yeah. Mm hmm. The sugar beets, all the GMO ones.

337
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,750
Is that, like, basketball size? Okay, then.

338
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,590
Then before the break, I went for you to have this point in mind to discuss.

339
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,170
Okay. First, what is or are what ancestral diets?

340
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:03,550
How do modern diets compare to diet from our ancestors and from the public point of view?

341
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,290
But because from the point of view of public health, we want to improve health.

342
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:19,300
Um, and we know that even our genome is adapting, is changing, but we, we still have some mismatch between our genome, our mother diet.

343
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:30,850
But then we need to think about practical approaches to try to reduce this mismatch too, with the goal of improve public health questions.

344
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:39,970
Comments. Okay, then let's take a five minute break.

345
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:48,940
We will then who is going to lead that discussion in the second part of my day?

346
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:58,638
Let's meet in 5 minutes. Information.

347
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:08,575
Okay, everyone, we are going to continue with the second part of today's lecture, and she is going to to lead that discussion.

348
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:18,674
He's going to talk about what does that have to be at the heart that we have been discussing,

349
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:24,435
but also some new approaches that actually have new people working.

350
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:33,525
What exactly a more holistic approach than alchemy and double check the U.S. reporting is been reporting?

351
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:37,385
My goodness. You know both. Okay.

352
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:41,165
Then the classic just section.

353
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,995
So do I press these? Yeah, you can just move.

354
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,405
All right. These up and down? Yes, up and down.

355
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:55,635
All right. Let me see. Also with this, I get the arrows.

356
00:42:56,085 --> 00:43:04,425
Oh, okay. Okay. So everyone, I'm just I'm very glad to be here.

357
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:14,265
And today's the last class, right? Yes. I learned so much from this class, basically, because I didn't really know so much.

358
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:18,005
So I have the most improved experience.

359
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:28,245
So in comes when it comes to paleo diet, there's not a specific set pattern because as a hunter,

360
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:32,385
the percentage of bring home something is actually only 15%.

361
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:35,615
That means that you don't always have the animals.

362
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:43,364
And when you do have the animal that the tribes have to work together to finish eating it before you go as best.

363
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:50,265
So most of the time we still have to rely on grandma and the mom that had the what's what they have around the house.

364
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:57,405
So there's never been one. Some people living desert, some living next to the ocean.

365
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:01,544
They go have more fish. So we talk about this past that.

366
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:07,845
So if a diet is so good for one person, why doesn't that work for all of their part of the family?

367
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:12,764
Because there's no one way of eating that is right for everyone.

368
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:18,885
This has a lot to do with how Professor was saying about a genome or individual preference of your choice of food.

369
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:30,945
So today I'm going over the metabolic type of nutrition that first this part is of vegetable to vegetarian and that is people

370
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:41,834
who eat a lot of meat carnivore it was in between is we individually minute metabolizing differently therefore is not one we

371
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:51,675
switch between the two in eating too much or too little of something as one day that you are actually dramatic change our

372
00:44:51,735 --> 00:44:59,295
metabolic response that we're now we're bringing it will shift us to a different place and you'll take some time to come back.

373
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:06,885
So I would like to talk about the autonomic nervous system, and we've learned this about the parasympathetic division.

374
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:11,295
That is when your rest when I sit down to eat,

375
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:22,955
I'm able to create digestive enzyme in the the juice saliva us and we're high res slows down so we can digest so much better.

376
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:33,105
That's why some some places in Japan, in India, in the train station where we're standing and are alarming really quickly.

377
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:38,295
So there's really not being so good in tell me. But that's why we do interpose the periphery here.

378
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:43,485
So similarly dominance here is that you are fighting like when I.

379
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:47,744
I used to live in Boston. Yeah. Are people in the subway?

380
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:52,665
They were eating breakfast. Oh yeah. When I was driving I was eating some kind of.

381
00:45:52,915 --> 00:46:03,105
Yeah, yeah. So basically that inhibits digestion and also, you know, with all these things is not really good.

382
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:12,554
Oh, I'll fight in flight. No, I'm introducing what is 12 different type of metabolic digestion.

383
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:21,795
So basically that on the left side, we need to understand these graphics to read the well before we go on and on the left side is left.

384
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:27,705
So therefore types 11, four, one and six in these are the cooler people.

385
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:31,455
They mainly vegetables and they feel more comfortable eating vegetables.

386
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:40,634
But based on the super sided dominance, basically the one on top here is the they are sympathetic dominance.

387
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:49,244
I don't on and I'm nervous this is more focused on getting things done and they are more on the fly situation and and down here

388
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:56,865
is their more real lives to a point is almost like they are fatigued autonomic nervous system switching between the two branches

389
00:46:57,285 --> 00:47:06,525
could be fatigue just like emotional resistance that people can just they'll be so stressed up here is and if you flip into

390
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:14,685
cannot handle the these people when when you are in parasympathetic dominance to a point that you cannot get up in the morning,

391
00:47:14,895 --> 00:47:19,455
you cannot feel excited about things. So we are heading that direction as well,

392
00:47:19,725 --> 00:47:29,705
not just adrenal fatigue and we're actually getting another adrenal related to fatigue that will be sympathetic dominance and participant dominance.

393
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:39,105
We can switch. Okay. So on this side that is talking about people who like to you me remember these takes a lot more to digest.

394
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:42,975
Therefore they need to be stronger in the parasympathetic branch.

395
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:51,315
So on the top here, number 12, number 5 to 7, the 12 is the one that had the most active resting state.

396
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:59,595
So they can actually have the digestive enzyme and just facilitate the digestion of more complex food as they go down.

397
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:08,015
And these they become more simple and some people are very stressed and the most ill are the number seven on the sun.

398
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:12,485
The most ill of the best eating is the worst six.

399
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:19,085
Now, now, what's in the in between is the paleo diet.

400
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:27,365
Basically, you eat what you get. You don't really know what you're going to have was fruit, vegetable quality meat and some nuts.

401
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:38,195
So let's come back to here and let's talk about the people is LEMON These three are highly performing people.

402
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:43,535
They feel great with their diet. And the reason why right here is that they're very alert,

403
00:48:43,565 --> 00:48:52,565
very focused that you all the vegetables that they're simply and highly intelligent and, you know, the guru of a vegetarians.

404
00:48:54,305 --> 00:49:02,375
Number four, they are more balanced and they may eat a little more not so strict.

405
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:08,225
They may easily take something. And the Mediterranean diet is number four right here.

406
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:17,164
And they can burn casually, actually cocoa faster than type one, the ones that hold on to the carbohydrate for longer time.

407
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,145
So it's more sustainable in their diet.

408
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:29,254
They feel fulfilled with the car for a longer time of this one that they can diet, they can work out early, the faster there is a faster.

409
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:33,455
So they sometimes need a little eggs or some other things.

410
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,895
So. Number one, these are extreme vegetarians.

411
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:47,145
Rob, again, they came through apparently is slowly utilizing a carbohydrate, poorly maintained blood sugar.

412
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,324
So these are the people you can see the juicing, the source, vegetable, the whole table.

413
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:57,855
And they were doing it juicing. I mean, I just feel costly and they get hungry faster.

414
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:09,045
And the next one, the last one, I have many clients in this category, you know, for six than they are cannibalizing their own protein for amino acids.

415
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:16,274
And you can see that on the paper that when you look at the paper right here, this is the hair test here.

416
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:20,354
Test is actually more sophisticated than blood tests.

417
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:28,035
But you guys, we all have learned about blood test. When you look at the this chart is the chemical composition of the hair.

418
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:35,385
The last column on the top saying that phosphorous, when these number is below, let's say 16,

419
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:44,545
that means that the person is not able to break down the protein from the food and they are cannibalizing their own fish.

420
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:51,215
And you are able to categorize rice up very slowly based on this test?

421
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:59,295
Yes. Yes. And also, when we look at number, this third one, the sodium is a 4.0.

422
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:08,325
That that means that the sodium eliminated two are here so low, this person is at adrenal fatigue.

423
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:18,945
Adrenal gland is very fatigued. So. So and but when this number is all when the sodium is all the way high, then these are all high stage of fighting.

424
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:26,385
So they're fighting it. But once they can handle it anymore, adrenal gland taint, that's when you see the sodium drop down like this.

425
00:51:26,385 --> 00:51:32,355
So you can see this present cannot digest very well because it's always on the fine line.

426
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:38,205
Not just that is cannibalizing her own protein for growth and she's only nine years old.

427
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:45,735
Okay. Next, let's talk about people, highly functional meat lovers.

428
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:50,414
They are people oriented, social butterfly and right point person.

429
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:54,165
They do well organ. You don't have to eat. You don't have to eat organ meats.

430
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:59,325
But, you know, but they do one of those which is nutritional this organ meat.

431
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:02,975
Well, animal has the the prey.

432
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:06,825
The leaders will come, you know what? They eat first.

433
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:15,495
If the female lion down a deer. Why are the leaders of this tribe eat first?

434
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:22,575
You know, the liver goes first, the kidney goes second, then is the heart.

435
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:30,435
Then the rest the leader walk away and let all the other little creatures in the tribe eat.

436
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:34,065
So mostly Canadians feel part of the animal kingdom.

437
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:38,895
Liver is the prime selection. And then the heart actually kidney.

438
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:42,735
And then the heart. So many American souls.

439
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:53,565
And this here. Right here. But they don't do so well as vegetarians and they love meat.

440
00:52:56,025 --> 00:53:00,935
This was the East German extremely kind of war burns, carb very fast.

441
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,805
They need something more sustainable.

442
00:53:03,135 --> 00:53:12,935
They have a tendency to develop a high hypoglycemia, usually have a genetic background from Germans, get the name, vision and noise.

443
00:53:12,945 --> 00:53:21,945
This Europe is. So this is a little bit of the industry in the genetic mapping that they are home.

444
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:28,905
Now that you mentioned that these geographic regions are this that this type they correlate with ancestry or.

445
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:33,045
Yes. Yes. Very interesting when they profile my clients.

446
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:36,975
And and then I see this is where they are, they say, yes, they're from this.

447
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:44,265
I do not collect the ancestry information first. I just look at where they are and then they happen to follow.

448
00:53:44,325 --> 00:53:48,225
A lot of them do so statistical analysis devoted to this category a lot.

449
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:53,415
And here is the love eating meat. But they can't handle it.

450
00:53:53,445 --> 00:54:02,205
They can tell properly and they are the sickly weak and inefficient and lots of gut issues.

451
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:13,035
Parasite issue. Because once you eat the meat, the meat contains a lot of more parasites than the vegetable and they have all way over storage issue.

452
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:17,925
Yeah. So is this. Is this your research? No, this is.

453
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:28,544
Yeah, you'll see the referencing some of these are general is a generalization is actually statistical could because it's by statistic and

454
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:39,615
because we move a lot like for this person right here up here maybe feels that we need to do something so you move to the middle,

455
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:46,755
which then introduce the middle in the next place. So you move to have more room, little mean, maybe only 3 to 6 to else.

456
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:55,875
Then you move over here because you need time to adapt here in the feel better and performing I get so we're moving.

457
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,475
We're on this map. There were times I was here for six years.

458
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:08,594
I was like, There's a spectrum. Oh, yes. And then so I was here for six years until I hit adrenal fatigue, and then I had to start eating more.

459
00:55:08,595 --> 00:55:12,315
Me and I come up here and gradually move up.

460
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:17,055
There are times I feel like I need to do more for iron deficiency.

461
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:21,285
Zinc deficiency, I go is a little more meat, especially red meat.

462
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,885
Sometimes it will give me like a liver and I'll come back to here.

463
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:27,525
So we're changing all the time.

464
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:39,965
So the way in the middle are the paleo, okay, number one top performing U.S., no strong metabolic balance or whatever that meant.

465
00:55:40,695 --> 00:55:46,424
So intense metabolism. Number eight, balance.

466
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:49,425
The greatest number of people are given this type of body.

467
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:53,865
So we're right here. Many people are given this party.

468
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,635
But then you go, you have a choice.

469
00:55:55,635 --> 00:56:04,065
You want to go here, maybe due to the trend of eating well, sometimes with your family, cook more meat, or you marry someone who will cook for me.

470
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:12,615
So you may go there. So from these choices we're giving this body we have known as a lot of people,

471
00:56:12,945 --> 00:56:19,815
they go if if they are exposed to environmental toxicity and malnutrition,

472
00:56:19,815 --> 00:56:29,045
they often drop down to three, six or seven from eight they'll go to three, six or seven.

473
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:32,925
That means they can go this direction. This is the worst.

474
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:38,205
And so you may know this meat either this way or die or in between.

475
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,065
Annex is the poor balance type. They prefer cooked food.

476
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:49,235
Their function best if they eat a little bit of everything.

477
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:56,975
The last one, I don't know why James is the most sickening is the one that don't go into the porterhouse of oil.

478
00:56:56,975 --> 00:57:02,485
They cannot metabolizing the vegetable or that meat or anything in between.

479
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:10,745
So I want to just quickly focus on sympathetic of achievement type, which is on the left side.

480
00:57:11,225 --> 00:57:17,944
They have strong function of the brain, canal gland and all this pituitary gland, all that stuff,

481
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:23,485
the bone, the heart, the bones of the muscle in connective tissue, kidneys and it doesn't.

482
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:28,775
The uterus or the muscle is actually quite well-developed.

483
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:33,605
And you can show muscle tones and their heart will only be a little faster.

484
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:41,945
So. So but these are the issues the all the often constipated and frequent insomnia.

485
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:46,985
There's a reason the insomnia we learn about is the food changes in the brain

486
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:56,285
develop meat contains the nutrition for the brain development such as copper,

487
00:57:56,615 --> 00:58:04,145
zinc and iron. But manganese could be all nuts, but manganese is needed for the brain as well.

488
00:58:04,145 --> 00:58:11,495
So so a lot of people in this category, they may have a sleeping disorder and digestion.

489
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:14,645
They can only digest 10% of the intake.

490
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:21,035
So with all the vegetable, a lot of fiber in only 10% is really digest and nutrition.

491
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:26,495
And within the 10% digest, only 40% is being used.

492
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:35,195
Protein metabolism is poor, as you know. They may at some point metabolizing their own muscle.

493
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:41,065
They do best on the truth. Let's look at some of these very interesting things.

494
00:58:41,905 --> 00:58:48,505
I see some of the vegan classmates there always eating something after the chocolate bar is some other drink.

495
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:53,625
She said that and some don't eat that much.

496
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:57,135
When they eat really, really easy. They have just a little bit to eat.

497
00:58:57,145 --> 00:59:01,675
That's enough. And they don't do well with the fat or the oily food.

498
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:06,265
The eyelids open. Why are they protruding as well?

499
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:10,465
Because I intensely mean that it'll be like a goiter kind of thing.

500
00:59:11,305 --> 00:59:13,675
And fingernails as severe claws.

501
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:21,275
Ridges is an observation in the pupils usually of light that says through the light because there is the mineral deficiency.

502
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:28,545
Sensitivity to light I think is of. Potassium?

503
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:33,315
No, I don't quite remember which one. The skin is a little bit dry.

504
00:59:33,315 --> 00:59:38,265
Dry skin, skinny jeans, soft and velvety, beautiful woman, very beautiful skin.

505
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:44,264
May a woman but slightly dry. And they usually feel a little cold and jumpy.

506
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:47,555
Nervous like that is all about emotional health.

507
00:59:47,565 --> 00:59:50,714
It's not the nutrition for emotional health.

508
00:59:50,715 --> 00:59:58,335
It's really not abundant in the food. You know that the vegetarian vegetables are a lack of zinc and more copper.

509
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:05,145
A copper is a transmitter. Transmitter. So you are very sensitive to other people's energy, like something.

510
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:13,605
So here are things we don't like. I think the copper very high due to zinc deficiency.

511
01:00:14,085 --> 01:00:19,005
They make them very sensitive to the environment they have.

512
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:23,655
They don't drink that well if they dream of heart attack.

513
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:25,305
When these people have heart to cut,

514
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:33,164
you'll have a few small ones in the often have the heart burns and arrhythmia regularly that will affect the kind of headache

515
01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:41,985
they have is more the mine growing tension and and I have a double hit right there so yeah healing of the bones is very fast.

516
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:53,115
Vitamin k1k2. So for that for for them since they use too much vegetable like k one is abundant,

517
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:58,995
but the selenium in the nuts would help them to transform vitamin K one to Kate two.

518
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:03,165
So that brings a calcium into their bones. So the bones are healing really fast.

519
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:08,475
But the tissue you remember in metal, acid, you know, heal as well.

520
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:12,795
So these are the illnesses that I only put it here to ask for.

521
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:20,415
So, you know, we talk about the people who are on the right side, strong parasympathetic nervous to get low.

522
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:27,675
Actually, these are the glandular. They are great and often lose during diarrhea.

523
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:31,635
They have poor muscle tones. And you know what?

524
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:40,485
They have poor muscle tone, what they eat all the fat and the animal and the nasal mean.

525
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:46,905
That's why they look a little bit rounded. They fall asleep, they feel less sorry.

526
01:01:46,905 --> 01:01:49,605
Take this low and fall sleep easily. Why is that?

527
01:01:50,955 --> 01:02:01,365
Digestion is very complex and it takes, you know, eat a big meal of meat and stuff that people feel so that you have to sit down and relax this way.

528
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:12,375
But they have a lot of a reserve of stress and they can digest almost anything and they can utilize 80% of what they have digested.

529
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:18,315
But sometimes the issue with this group of people are storage.

530
01:02:19,095 --> 01:02:24,075
That means that they consume so they can eat everything and they can digest almost anything.

531
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:30,045
A breeze into the body and stored that away in them is some weight gain.

532
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:38,235
Or then the sad thing is that these people also have an issue of retrieving what they have stored away.

533
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:41,865
So they crave for assets,

534
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:51,135
which means that they want it to apple cider vinegar or something sour it that helps them to break down the protein and crave for alcohol to

535
01:02:51,135 --> 01:03:00,885
raise the blood pressure actually that will raise the blood sugar and have parasitic infection will also in blood bladder control is not so good.

536
01:03:01,005 --> 01:03:03,975
They do have bloating which, you know, describe what you eat.

537
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:11,445
A lot of me they have bloating and that I guess it is gone missing in gum and is in headache.

538
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:18,165
The headache is more from the eyestrain. This portion not not on the side, nothing else.

539
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:23,685
And the healing and healing the bone is lower, but the muscle healing is very fast.

540
01:03:24,315 --> 01:03:27,704
The heart attack, if they have any, is massive heart attack.

541
01:03:27,705 --> 01:03:31,995
You just take them right down right there. They crave buttery fatty meat.

542
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:38,175
They like salty food. They drink frequently. I do imprudently and vivid with color.

543
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,774
They can recall their dreams eating at bedtime,

544
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:49,035
make them feel sometimes I have to eat a little of it before I go to sleep is not so ketogenic, but I feel I can't sleep so well.

545
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,264
I came to fall asleep.

546
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:59,985
If you face any fruit, make them a little bit jiggly, a little bit too much blood sugar be balance more hard to get going in the morning.

547
01:04:00,405 --> 01:04:04,905
They are the night person. Professor, we talk about that right that morning was talk about prototypes, though.

548
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:07,075
Exactly so and more of the night person.

549
01:04:07,155 --> 01:04:20,105
It has real wily and strong hunger pain and more than one bowel movement day asking is your oily skin and oily hair and they like the lunch,

550
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:27,045
the eggs and bacon and slow breathing ways to make decision and very little fear.

551
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:31,025
So these are the issues. Okay.

552
01:04:31,025 --> 01:04:36,035
The balance type is in the middle of the which is mostly Virginia 8 to 10.

553
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:45,275
It's like dash diet. 8 to 10 servings of vegetables and fruits and only 3 to 6 ounces of quality meat twice a day.

554
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:51,635
And these people have very balanced the nervous system. So sometimes you should be alert something you should really rest.

555
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:56,525
So they're able to adjust to that based on the situation.

556
01:04:56,555 --> 01:05:05,465
Okay. And enjoy food and they burn the food not so fat and so slow is quite good in all this stuff.

557
01:05:07,205 --> 01:05:11,975
Sometimes they have a coating on the tongue due to maybe digestion imbalance,

558
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:20,765
but it's no big deal in normal reaction is not itchy, scratchy or the hive and everything they're able to do both, by the way.

559
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:33,935
And anyway so pretty good at any any given food and nutrition can have virtually opposite biochemical effect on different metabolic types.

560
01:05:35,705 --> 01:05:39,875
Sometimes you love something so much, especially in a period.

561
01:05:40,505 --> 01:05:45,155
Remember, we crave a little sweets. Maybe for period end is coming.

562
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:49,385
Discussion What factors influence metabolic types?

563
01:05:50,465 --> 01:06:01,775
The genetics, the climate. This the seasonal variations, developmental stage stress, physical activity, menstrual cycle, nutritional debt.

564
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:07,834
So if we're highly toxic and then we will have a different choices.

565
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:12,785
And sometimes I just don't feel so good to have to go on vegetable for sometimes more fish.

566
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:16,745
These are the references. That's it. Can I see?

567
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:22,595
I mean, that's. That's like number one of the types.

568
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:31,175
Yeah. I will be interested to know whether these mentality types, if they are from genetic bases,

569
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:41,065
now that we are able to do a study metabolomics, for example, epigenomics omics to see what it could be.

570
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:48,025
Hey, I would love to work with you on this. And we look at this so limit foods.

571
01:06:48,065 --> 01:06:52,325
I mean, we combine it with the forensic evidence and this goes very young.

572
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:59,645
You can see the calcium is release is leaching out of her and magnesium to matching with calcium.

573
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:04,024
That magnesium also leach out of her. She has severe calcifications.

574
01:07:04,025 --> 01:07:08,795
She will not be able to absorb nutricia at a sterile level as well.

575
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:12,754
She also have a over amount of copper that make her very emotional.

576
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:17,975
She's the one who have issues going to school like I don't want to go, I don't go.

577
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:27,485
That comes out. So to to help these people that we actually make a just our diet plan based on this evidence and we know

578
01:07:27,485 --> 01:07:34,295
which which they are and then we can smoothly add a little more this and get her back to the middle.

579
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:48,695
All right. Okay. Before we leave, just a few points before all of it again, I wanted to thank you, all of you, for taking the class.

580
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:56,914
I told you earlier, I always learn a little during these this class.

581
01:07:56,915 --> 01:08:05,045
I. I want that. Also, don't forget to to complete the course evaluations.

582
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:08,704
Your final report is due one week from today. You need more time.

583
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:16,615
Please let me know and I hope good luck with the semester.

584
01:08:17,195 --> 01:08:21,935
Thank you so much for this great day and I will see you around.

585
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:24,305
Thank you so much. You're welcome.
