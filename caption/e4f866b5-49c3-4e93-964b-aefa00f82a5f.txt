1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:16,080
I think it's really a great secret.

2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:32,010
I think that's really cool and I know it's got to be celebrated.

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:51,030
He just looked at this and I was like, I understand that.

4
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,190
It's like, you know, just like replay the three.

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,790
So that was, you know, one where you were calling shots.

6
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,290
I was like, oh, really?

7
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:20,480
I just do, I think, straight, you know, I just I guess that's how I feel.

8
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:39,120
Like I'm actually like that's like talking about something stroke or something like.

9
00:01:41,870 --> 00:02:05,510
Yeah. And then have like, oh yeah, they were my girls like about yeah.

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:29,420
So that was like I'm like, I might have something I was to try and I was like, let me, you can see the first.

11
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:48,440
You see, know you're looking for those of you who are still around us.

12
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:09,300
I know I was. Yeah, it is a shame, because you look like my cousin Joe by solving that quiz.

13
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,660
So you're going to start smoking to quit.

14
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:37,640
Smoking to quit. And I'll join you in about seven men, over 250,000 people.

15
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,340
I don't know. I have to have one.

16
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,190
Yeah, I have some.

17
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,790
I'm going to say. Yeah, I did.

18
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,730
I never used no, there's no focus. For my sophomore year of college.

19
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:06,440
I've asked the only time I ever used it was like, You can't do this stuff like that.

20
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:25,270
It's you want to all I'm like, that cool girl like in your 50%, you know, like instead of the razors side,

21
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,440
you know, or like you guys are like those hands are like pencils that were like curved.

22
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:57,270
You look like sharp. And then once it got like, yeah, it was like the cumulative sense or just funny markers on it was so good.

23
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:08,090
I was. You were so wonderful when I was in the sixth grade.

24
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,880
My aunt useful for some reason. You would like to buy a bunch of the books from classical career.

25
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,490
I like the ancient Portuguese ones, like the huge table and like, obviously he readers want to go first.

26
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:41,020
I'm the one I'm working.

27
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:14,570
And. Q Sometimes I would use faith because you don't get to write your name for depends on you.

28
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:24,000
You know, I always said it would be like, how do you start recording in progress?

29
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:47,420
She's really cute. She told me she was like, relax and stuff like that.

30
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,290
Yeah, I'm so happy for you. I just feel like the app.

31
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:08,390
So you can decide how to check the source.

32
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah, that's really interesting. You know, I got this message because you have to see when someone shoot somebody.

33
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:41,170
So I can see, though, it's like. It's like, oh, my God, it's so nice to see.

34
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:55,334
I want to know how fast we might pick it up in these documents.

35
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:17,664
I don't know what. This is an accident. It was just like how hard or so.

36
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:33,444
So I just say I'm simply refusing to learn how to answer is always.

37
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:41,134
Yes, yes. Yes, yes.

38
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:51,884
Yes. I think that's pretty much what I had.

39
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:42,984
I just, you know, listen to my sisters. I mean, if I knew the book, I was like, actually, no, I agree with you right now.

40
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:47,034
You're not supposed to do it. She was.

41
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:40,984
Says he had a lot of questions because there's a higher chance, I think.

42
00:10:47,964 --> 00:11:02,784
But. It's from.

43
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:17,214
I think.

44
00:11:32,764 --> 00:12:22,824
Okay. You know.

45
00:12:55,694 --> 00:13:04,174
You. Look.

46
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:43,694
Okay. Ready to go? Don't you think about the first problem?

47
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:49,364
Anybody can take a crack, an idea of how to start.

48
00:13:54,824 --> 00:14:04,153
So I thought that it was point out two, because you would want the weight.

49
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:12,074
One means the weight of the most recent observation and you would want to weigh the most recent observation as little as possible.

50
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:19,814
Because you can see that the pattern is every other day matches up to the exact right.

51
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:30,584
So that one observation in the past is more is closer to the observation in the future than the most recent observation.

52
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:34,934
So it goes up and down and down. So that's good.

53
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:43,754
So the idea is. If you go in, I bet the projector is not on.

54
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:54,924
Thank you. Okay.

55
00:14:56,154 --> 00:15:05,844
If you go like this, I and if you want to forecast the next period, you will then forecast the next video here.

56
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:15,954
According to the police, serious news forecast video here because is because this is exciting news, but not now.

57
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:23,594
Now. So you expect the next video here and that is closer to, you know, to observations in the past.

58
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:29,214
And so the most recent observation doesn't carry the most weight in this case.

59
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:37,134
Right. So we want w one in 2.8.

60
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:48,944
And we know that only two he's going to meet that w 1.21.

61
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:54,674
Right. And then we've we want to forecast the next period is.

62
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:12,514
I ask you to boycott? Period, 17 and 18.

63
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:22,954
So we are going to be using videos 15 and 16 on that are 15 and 18 videos 15.

64
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:35,794
Opinions, 15. And 16.

65
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:43,024
And then those people are 16 or 18.

66
00:16:48,514 --> 00:17:01,074
Right. And if you want to look at video, 17 is or 15 anything you need.

67
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:17,614
So this his 80th time and this is the observation and then video 17.

68
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:23,704
We don't have observation of the days before cars is going to be the real one.

69
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:36,153
So forecast for video 17 is going to be w 1.2 times.

70
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:49,644
The most recent observation which is 18 W eight according to that is 0.8 times 50.

71
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:54,974
Right. We know that much.

72
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:02,504
15.6. 15.6.

73
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:21,064
And their forecast for kids of 18 is going to be, well, we don't have the observation for video 1804, video 17 so we're going to take the for that.

74
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:30,774
So they won't Casper video the 18 is going to be when two times they've worked for video 17 which is basically increases.

75
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:43,324
We don't have that to the point eight. I'm 18.

76
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:48,834
Right. And that is how much?

77
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:57,824
17.3. 17.6. Something like that.

78
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:02,584
And the important thing on. That's your that's your answer.

79
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,984
Right. Any questions about these questions?

80
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:22,114
But you know this problem. All right.

81
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:26,884
So it's a girl who was, you know, went to.

82
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:41,674
And we're going to lean into a waiting period.

83
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:48,484
Moving average forecasting model was developed with the following data and the MSI was found to be zero.

84
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:55,194
Compute the forecast corresponding to video 11 using the same same weight in the venue.

85
00:19:55,324 --> 00:20:00,484
And the forecast is it must be very happy to be zero.

86
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:05,194
And any idea about how people react?

87
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:08,334
This is why we are computing that with a calculator.

88
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:13,024
Am I right? What will we do first?

89
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:31,284
Well, you know, I told you that. I know. Well, I developed a forecasting weight and moving average model and that they may see 000.

90
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:33,894
So they were forecasting model is already developing.

91
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:41,094
So what do we need to implement them for coupling a model with that to be a weighted weighted moving average?

92
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:50,764
The first thing we need to. Ladies, we need to wait.

93
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:55,923
I already know the weights I used to weight, but we don't know the ways.

94
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:57,904
We need to find out what weights I use.

95
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:10,504
We're not going to compute any weights because they already develop the model and set a forecast that they may see with how big the leaves.

96
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:15,304
So what does it mean that the MSA happens to be here?

97
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:20,944
With these forecast models. I mean, it's accurate 100%.

98
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:24,894
I mean, it's accurate. Accurate, 100%.

99
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:33,034
So anything I've really copied and so we got can we find a way with that information?

100
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:52,574
So with that information, we can find that way because they say that the last two observations here really is the first tool.

101
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:58,684
It doesn't matter which one, but the first two, the first three might be easier to compute.

102
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,844
It doesn't matter which ones you pick, right? I can.

103
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:32,154
Right. So we have period one, two, three and three, 12.

104
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:46,774
One, two, three and three.

105
00:22:48,074 --> 00:23:02,184
And what? I so what happened with these two period moving averages is that then first, this is the observation.

106
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:07,114
These these are the observational right. And these are the four gas.

107
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:17,524
What is the first period for which they can have it if August in year three.

108
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:28,714
Right. So you have things that I observe video and I observe period three and then I use my forecasting model to predict.

109
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:35,904
Video three What number do they predict? Well, I won't.

110
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,524
Well, let me see. Zero, because they may see zero.

111
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:47,014
Right, exactly. So I I'm totally accurate with my prediction.

112
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:52,024
So I predict that 12 and I got 12.

113
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:57,534
Right? So they aim in the end or we are a zero because we have to be zero.

114
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:11,554
They may be right. Okay. So with that, I think you said not to, you know, find the weights that we need because we know that w one.

115
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:18,454
Let's start with W-2. W-2.

116
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:33,784
Times. And W one time 30 is equal to what?

117
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:41,074
That's if we're Casper video three. Right. Well.

118
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:56,244
We also know that w one. And Lord W to bury the one.

119
00:24:56,544 --> 00:25:03,354
Right. So I can substitute w two.

120
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:08,724
I can substitute one line of w in in instead of going into.

121
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:28,104
So there you go on CCS, one minus W 1 to 10, one 130.

122
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:45,144
You think of the 12 and then we get ten minus W one plus minus ten W one plus 30 W one is 20.

123
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:54,084
Right, so plus 20. W one 3012.

124
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:23,034
Or w one. Is equal to two divided by 21 and 4.18 and then w two and is equal to one minus w 1.9.

125
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:29,994
I. Okay.

126
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:36,413
So when we have that, we can forecast for period for the next period, right.

127
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:43,764
So what they don't need us to forecast period 11.

128
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:48,564
So is 1599 and 2460.

129
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:57,054
So we go you're. 1599.

130
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:07,464
And I multiply that times W to two is 29.

131
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:20,024
But. 24 of 60.

132
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:36,854
Times point one that's important to.

133
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:52,774
And I wonder, what do you think of these 1549 and 49?

134
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:03,814
One two for 16. I'm just going with.

135
00:28:07,714 --> 00:28:21,954
We as equal to 16 point in 16.9 using 16.85.

136
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:31,944
Right. You get that perfect.

137
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,414
Those are does does equate. Right.

138
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:46,634
So I developed the quiz to make sure that, you know, there's done what you're doing in terms of the mechanics of producing a weighted moving average.

139
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:51,104
So you have to remember the weights. I don't do one.

140
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:56,474
I you you need to remember what an MSE is.

141
00:28:56,594 --> 00:29:02,173
The only way they can be zero is is the all that works out perfect because what we're

142
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:07,314
doing is adding all the errors squared so there's no way that they will get canceled.

143
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:17,234
So the only way that you have a sum of positive numbers equal to zero is if everybody agrees on everyone is equal to zero.

144
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:24,494
And so that means that you for your four guys were perfect, right?

145
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:33,254
You for cost in this case. Well, you get one and then you put whatever number here to remember and then you get the same number.

146
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:36,974
So you don't miss it with this forecast.

147
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:42,524
How do you find those weights? I don't know, but we already have it.

148
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:52,024
So remember, sometimes I can, you know, I can ask questions like that not to freak you about you,

149
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:59,294
but to understand this one thing is developing the model and calibrating the model and finding the weights and then forecasting.

150
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:05,204
And sometimes I'm just going to say, you already know that way, but I'm not I'm not going to tell you.

151
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,094
Right. If I if you know the procedure, I'm those weights and forecast.

152
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,694
And so that's that's the.

153
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:32,244
That's why we do some small algebra exercises the other day to make sure that you don't get to manipulate the variables to solve.

154
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:46,984
Okay. All right. So we are in the middle of homework number two, and I'm going to continue working on homework number two.

155
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:53,024
We are going to continue working on this issue before I proceed.

156
00:30:53,024 --> 00:31:11,034
Any questions? Oh, I need to save one relative for one of you.

157
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:14,564
See, I certainly I have any copayments.

158
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:24,774
I think if you the brownie now and then, by all means, we get over it.

159
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:37,464
These brownies are for people, by the way, to the convenience store being who would send me a note saying,

160
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:41,064
you know, that's too much sugar, we are in public health.

161
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:49,523
So next time it's going to be carrots. I'm just kidding.

162
00:31:49,524 --> 00:32:03,344
Nobody. It's so he's about ten years ago.

163
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:14,843
I don't know who did this, but in the HP kitchen, I don't know when the event we had, but someone, you know, it was in the leftovers.

164
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:18,254
It was full of bacon. Yes.

165
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:25,614
This I it was so strange to see in the school of Public Health.

166
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:41,804
But it a of baking this I think a lot to in my memory are like high school.

167
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:05,914
We? Which.

168
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:23,464
Yes. Till last time we did 11.9, which is HALTZMAN.

169
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:27,763
And today, I want to do another matter.

170
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:32,414
So I added a couple more questions to your phone mark.

171
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:39,264
And if we go to the homework assignment in Canada.

172
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:48,424
Was your assignment. And number two.

173
00:33:50,614 --> 00:34:02,764
So it's let's we have to here 11.40 and 11.42 11.42 is another call to make them.

174
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:06,724
And given that we have practiced practice points, let's do that.

175
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:11,224
And that's going into the mortgage rates data.

176
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:37,944
So I'm going to download the mortgage rates data set. We get more.

177
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:54,424
Just. Which brings.

178
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,964
I like that. I'm going to zoom in.

179
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:08,714
I'll be more so if you go on to the problem.

180
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:19,024
It's 11.40.

181
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:41,913
So we have mortgage rates and I know that we have to put a better line grab and then do it between 40 and 11.42.

182
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:48,364
So why don't we just bury the line and go into the whole problem?

183
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:54,694
That's 11.42, and then we can use solving the ones that are left.

184
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:07,424
I don't. Even to.

185
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:21,054
All right. So we have our Morgan mortgage rates.

186
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:31,674
I am going to, you know, first created a line graph with the time and rate.

187
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:39,504
So this is going to be on control sheet and down arrow.

188
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:51,054
I'm then going to select a range of control and click on grade, keep that arrows.

189
00:36:51,054 --> 00:37:04,334
So I have the two columns selected and then I am going to insert which I am going to insert for every X, y, right.

190
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:12,244
And. The.

191
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:24,484
It is easier copying and pasting a bit of the dragging narrative.

192
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:37,964
And so. Let's change the scale, right?

193
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:42,694
So the scales can just go from 5 to 9.

194
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:52,984
So I tell them, please, I and this is going to be five for my.

195
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:59,854
It seems like it has. It's somewhat of a trend.

196
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:04,164
Another thing that it seems to have is seasonality.

197
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:08,344
Right. And so it goes down or down.

198
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:13,593
We have a little bit of a trend and also a little bit of seasonality.

199
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:19,384
We haven't done seasonality yet. So the best we can do is forecast this trend.

200
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:44,014
So I'm going to use the whole midterm 1140 to simply call these to the right.

201
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:48,574
And I'm going to that problem. Have to.

202
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:09,224
And what I want to do now is inform you that you see well in the back.

203
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:17,474
So I'm going to do holds mental. So what column do I need my access?

204
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:26,504
I need that base, right? I need a column and I need to form part of the three base.

205
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:34,004
Remember, where the base is, is the field to where we think the termination is at a given time.

206
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:41,594
We, you know, we can do observation and it has noise and we have a forecast for that observation.

207
00:39:41,984 --> 00:39:49,284
And we know that that has occurred. And then we think of the weighted average between the two weighted by parameter.

208
00:39:49,314 --> 00:40:01,814
All of that being pointed out says this is my best estimate of if I think the error of the forecast and I think the error of my observation,

209
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:15,764
then this is what I think that my best estimate of where the observation is and that's the base and the trend is a similar concept,

210
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:22,674
but the growth of a one medium within that growth can be changing, right?

211
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:34,314
So we are recalculating that general growth. For one thing, you do that every time and sometimes in various if there is a steady trend, you know,

212
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:43,664
we wait in all the observations every year because we don't want to be changing transitivity, just noise.

213
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:51,764
Obviously this trend is not the only one that actually changes and has been for a while and can and stay for a while.

214
00:40:52,244 --> 00:41:00,344
Then we will wait for the most recent trends in order to forecast the future.

215
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:02,264
So we got trained.

216
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:14,324
But you don't have to worry about that because the weights will drop before bedtime are going to appear by minimizing these means, wherever.

217
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:26,174
Then this is the forecast. This would be kind of the middle of foreign guys is going to be a good time for cars toward,

218
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:35,114
you know, when the level of the series is going to be without taking into account seasonality.

219
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:41,654
So you will be able to pick these are each are in these parts,

220
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:49,774
but not as precisely as if you know for sure that every so often these periods of some doubt are gone.

221
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:58,064
All right. So let's do as we did before we need to come up with.

222
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:32,124
We need to come up with a better. The use of bank deposits, driving drug cheats, and that is what those are.

223
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:38,304
But I've often wondered what kind of debates they are, I'm betting, is the parameters applied to the trend.

224
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:43,794
They are numbers between zero and one, and they don't have to add only to one.

225
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,974
They're independent. And one is for the brand, one is for database.

226
00:42:49,044 --> 00:43:01,314
It is 2.3. One of the things I think those numbers tend to rather than any other numbers.

227
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:07,524
See, we got to come on with a closer look.

228
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:14,004
We should we should come to the same parameters, you know, no matter what you would hear initially.

229
00:43:14,544 --> 00:43:23,273
And now we get the base and we said that the base in the first month or the first

230
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:28,853
period is going to be equal to the observation that we had for that period,

231
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:40,764
because we don't have anything to get we don't have anything to filter or have an idea of how noisy the CBC and the trend we are going to

232
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:53,994
we made the decision this the convention is not that we would have started trend with zero eight at the level of zero we can make another.

233
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:57,954
Well there are some things, but as I told you last time,

234
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:06,714
if you have a sufficient observation like more than a few survey shows that they it work stuff that you can

235
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:14,664
calibrate are going to be in the event of selecting at random zero here is one that these have been pretty rapid.

236
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:19,614
So I'm going to get to those we're minimizing really.

237
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:27,434
In no time. I am going to.

238
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:42,154
Let me let me name I'll be an emcee with those later in the year.

239
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:46,174
That's going to be emcee to the right.

240
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:56,254
And then I'm going to highlight this block and I'm going to inform you that I'm going to create a name from the selection.

241
00:44:57,304 --> 00:45:12,213
And then there's selection. The names that I'm going to use for the sales on the right are going to be the let's call the eight names or values or so.

242
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:19,714
Now, if you say yes, when you when you hit point three, that sound is going to be filled out.

243
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:24,394
But when you hit point six, that's going to be called that.

244
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:27,994
And this one is amazing.

245
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:32,884
So now let's do the forecast.

246
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:42,064
So we are dealing with one time I had four cats, so we are fourth reporting calibration.

247
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:52,434
What we do is we forecast the next period and we compare that to the observation that we get for competing, and that's how we're there.

248
00:45:53,224 --> 00:46:03,924
And then we forecast that next period and wait for information that there is one, you know, one time ahead or one time forward or.

249
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:20,324
Now, let's let's go through the forecast and the forecast for period number two is going to be the base rate in the imperial number one,

250
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:21,994
the training period.

251
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:31,754
Number one, this is what I was, number one, where I'm paying once again, this is what I think I'm going to grow through the 2 billion number.

252
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:37,904
So that would be my forecast. So I would say this is equal to the sum.

253
00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:47,754
The previous based on the previous three is in close parenthesis.

254
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:52,224
And that I get seven for three which is.

255
00:46:53,904 --> 00:47:02,154
It was the first the first observation. Now, what we're going to do is filter these.

256
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:11,854
You know, we we got this observation in video two, seven or eight, and we had four cases, seven or three, where when I use the filter with Alpha,

257
00:47:12,054 --> 00:47:22,104
we're going to adjust it and and estimate the base somewhere in between these two numbers that we're going to get,

258
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:29,124
give more emphasis to the previous observation that the most recent observation.

259
00:47:29,124 --> 00:47:32,274
Right. And goes out here is point three.

260
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:39,774
So point seven is what we when we came to the forecast and the way that we give to the forecast,

261
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:44,384
that phrase that is comprised by all of the previous observations.

262
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:51,214
So we are saying maybe these forecasts had been made, maybe this time of series,

263
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:55,584
that's a lot of noise and we just don't want to be following the noise.

264
00:47:55,584 --> 00:48:06,424
We want to be more stable. We don't know that that's a good way to go with this type of series, because these waves were not random either.

265
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:13,374
No. So when we get when we minimize the MSE, that will normally be about that.

266
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:19,974
But in this case, this applying that filter, that is going to be equal to Alpha.

267
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:34,844
This model that I use has not the case, since it uses a label that names in itself.

268
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:41,324
I'll put times the observation last open for it.

269
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:44,464
This is one minus alpha.

270
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:54,394
I made my forecasts at the time.

271
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:02,644
And the forecast. Let's see. So. So that's my.

272
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:12,644
I've heard that observation one minus other times of August.

273
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:28,294
Like. Really? With me.

274
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:37,754
Do to through this.

275
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:51,894
It is for good.

276
00:49:53,104 --> 00:50:04,683
Right. What about the trend? Well, the trend what we're going to do is get another filter weighted average between what I see now,

277
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:09,334
that series, the advance of that series, we want people to delay.

278
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:15,844
So right now I'm looking at the that that series went from seven those 3 to 7 on five.

279
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:27,544
Right. But I don't know if that is that's noise, if that's an exaggeration, the more of a deflating of the real trend.

280
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:34,454
So I'm going to use also what I know about the previews, trying to see if I can find the too.

281
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:36,154
So it's a weighted average for me.

282
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:48,394
Between the information I got from the previous trends and the information that I'm getting right now that I'm looking at in last in the last year,

283
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:55,264
I'm sitting through low point only one or two, right?

284
00:50:56,134 --> 00:51:06,564
So I'm going to wait. The most recent trend within parameters in the previous trends with the filing.

285
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:20,264
So this is going to be 1 to 8 times in most current trends, which is the difference in the days.

286
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:24,994
This is six. My nose is five.

287
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:43,534
Then applause. Then one line that and they then multiply that times the previous trend which is zero.

288
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:50,794
That wasn't in enough of this.

289
00:51:52,564 --> 00:52:03,804
And then we got 101. That's going to be like my my projected trend next to the right is five.

290
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:11,404
Yes. So we've got the same we got we got the proper formula.

291
00:52:11,764 --> 00:52:19,894
And now I can use 705.01 to forecast period over three.

292
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,553
That was going to be seven or C.

293
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:29,254
And then I computed, I get this observation that I compute the base of the trend again and then they calculate for that.

294
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:37,654
But I don't have to do that manually because I can drag all these formulas that are prepared.

295
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:52,194
I have my kids. I have my four guys now.

296
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:58,404
Let's see how how those forecasts look. Right. First, I'm going to compute them and see.

297
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:03,914
And secondly, I'm going to look at these receipts for clues.

298
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:14,594
The sum of X minus Y in the open parentheses.

299
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:40,374
And I am going to compare the observations this rate with the forecast of eight points where the road to the arrow comma and all the these is in here.

300
00:53:41,334 --> 00:54:12,714
He arrow is all parentheses and I'm doing my first numbers I'm averaging in 1686 because he entered I got only on I think that's my means.

301
00:54:12,714 --> 00:54:36,114
Wherever good or bad, I have no right because when I try to minimize these as much as possible and just keep it in two, but so now let's let me plot.

302
00:54:36,654 --> 00:54:42,644
So I'm going to use the key. I'm highlighting the best.

303
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:55,774
This is going to be the x axis here and therefore could roll into or cast and

304
00:54:55,984 --> 00:55:04,494
even an arrow to make it easier to get to the bottom and then on to something.

305
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:13,634
And I'm going to activate the graph and then I'm going to a special.

306
00:55:13,764 --> 00:55:17,724
Right? So a special.

307
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:23,794
It's theories or names on the first?

308
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:27,964
That's correct. This is a new series that you see.

309
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:32,464
These are forums and the X values are in the first column.

310
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:44,704
And then okay and I get my forecast, but they are not that cool.

311
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:51,073
Right. So laterally you don't you don't care a lot about laterally.

312
00:55:51,074 --> 00:55:56,914
You think they are similar to one Z to the X is vertically, right.

313
00:55:56,914 --> 00:56:09,424
Because what you are doing is trying to forecast these number with these number here and then you are trying to forecast this number here.

314
00:56:10,274 --> 00:56:23,554
And so even though you may look very close, if you forecast one way or the other, pretty far apart, none of them.

315
00:56:23,854 --> 00:56:31,234
So let's make this a piece that is as small as possible by minimizing the image.

316
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:38,504
See, so we go into the over.

317
00:56:38,824 --> 00:56:50,744
It has to be based. And then I'm going to minimize it, Missy.

318
00:56:54,254 --> 00:57:12,294
And then I want to change all of that and all these things that we do.

319
00:57:13,994 --> 00:57:27,054
And in this case, it's probably easier for me to highlight both instead of making a name that I'll find to be independently established.

320
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:30,654
One. Okay.

321
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:35,384
Right. And they don't. Unconstrained variables going negative.

322
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:41,264
So it's a minimize they may see by changing the variables.

323
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:50,084
I'll find that subject to the constraints of is less than one bit less than or equal to one.

324
00:57:50,624 --> 00:57:54,404
And the both of them are greater than or equal to zero.

325
00:57:55,184 --> 00:58:03,844
This is a nonlinear problem and the decisions of when to stay in your data for so long.

326
00:58:05,084 --> 00:58:21,614
And I could even run down more than half the more than 50% in C and I get alpha data when I'm very close to my ground saying,

327
00:58:21,614 --> 00:58:29,694
you know, I cannot get my my best guess is the observations that I'm looking at.

328
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,194
So I'm not going to even follow any trend.

329
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:45,434
So my best guess it will be if I see one observation, you know, one time, that is my best forecast for the next.

330
00:58:45,434 --> 00:59:01,904
We see that and and and the reason is that these strong seasonality is best of is that a method to follow the trends

331
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:15,434
is very high in say I don't understand these ups and downs and how you know there is no seems to be a mood pods.

332
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:20,234
I just feel strange would be high and then follow.

333
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:26,674
Sure. So. A bed.

334
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:31,024
These has multiple optimal solutions that you have.

335
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:36,754
You have different cell phones made with the same ABC depending on where you are.

336
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:45,844
But, you know, these model minimizes the disease, so we can use that to work.

337
00:59:49,474 --> 01:00:15,844
And do it next to more or less forecast for the next period, 11 and 12 months.

338
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:25,644
It's just so much.

339
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:40,534
The first one is just simply going to be divided over the next six months and then in six, 11 months, effective formula.

340
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:53,594
The second one, I remember how we just project the, you know, how we we compute the forecasts they hold.

341
01:00:54,004 --> 01:00:58,974
You take the last the phase and the last trend and add them.

342
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:02,074
And that's one time for forecast.

343
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:09,063
If you add the trend again, then as they do, that's your forecast period.

344
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:18,114
And then you can determine the gain. So we keep adding the trend as long as we don't have extra observations.

345
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:28,804
So this is going to be equal to the base on two times to the base, plus twice the trend to zero.

346
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:40,024
It's going to be 611. Or you can say that, you know, easier is going to be equal to the previous forecast lost in last trend.

347
01:01:40,714 --> 01:01:48,994
Just adding the trend to the previous year with that 611, so it's going to be 611.

348
01:01:49,804 --> 01:01:53,314
All your forecast for that time series.

349
01:01:55,104 --> 01:02:10,394
It's. So I think what she was later.

350
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:18,514
Either this month or our beginning of somewhere in October.

351
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:26,004
We are going to have to guess because you're from think again.

352
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:35,793
No one means to think it be for analytics in 3D and the other one is things in 3-D.

353
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:42,843
So we're going to talk about how, you know, what's the importance of this method in general operations,

354
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:51,664
research, how they're used and how they are how they're implementing those procedures in some real.

355
01:02:55,074 --> 01:03:02,994
So some have some idea about how useful both of these methods are we don't like.

356
01:03:03,354 --> 01:03:16,974
Okay, so I am going to add these 2.4% flat and then copy.

357
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:24,594
And those two values are graduated from the images program.

358
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:38,444
They? You can.

359
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:44,484
And you points in columns as values.

360
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:53,424
So I think you instead of periods, 11, 12 periods, 83 innings.

361
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:57,834
Yeah. Thank you. That is true.

362
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:03,344
It was highlighted the wrong thing to extend the liberal.

363
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:12,054
We are fighting, and that's what I'm using to do.

364
01:04:14,814 --> 01:04:56,154
The highlighting role in Hopi be based on the viewpoint and values in the first column, and that is our forecast.

365
01:04:56,634 --> 01:05:01,404
Our people are in the three.

366
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:08,934
And you know, if we leave our cars long enough, you know,

367
01:05:08,934 --> 01:05:16,664
that we're been off because because that time series is going to go up and down because of seasonality.

368
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:24,754
So I think by next week we are going to incorporate these items that are consistent,

369
01:05:24,774 --> 01:05:35,304
that are some periods in a cycle are above others, above that trend or below that trend.

370
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:39,604
So we can have a better forecast with those.

371
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:47,214
This is this is my problem. 11.42, I think.

372
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:14,244
These are 38 and 29. Within within 11.39, it's 11%, 39, 41, 42.

373
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:20,194
So 11.39 is just below the graph. Right. So let's see if we can do this.

374
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:23,753
The any.

375
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:28,574
940 over 42. Those are those three.

376
01:06:43,874 --> 01:07:02,084
Do. Has.

377
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:31,174
You know, 39, 41, 42 minutes to reach it has waited what idiot will be an average 40 exponential moving 42 weeks

378
01:07:31,174 --> 01:07:38,964
of the so 3940 or 40 to 1 is going to be a weight for any of the weight and moving average.

379
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:57,194
Let's do that. We could have interpreted the data next to an open.

380
01:08:03,274 --> 01:08:07,504
Let me just copy simply the mortgage rate.

381
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:22,764
Look. Look.

382
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:36,634
Look, we both know.

383
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:49,974
Okay. So I have my mortgage rates again and I'm going to go I'm going to pull that.

384
01:08:50,224 --> 01:09:09,414
Okay. 1138.

385
01:09:17,064 --> 01:09:32,314
What people need to know, I think, is that he is 39, 48, 42 and 38, 33, 38, 39, 48, 41, 42, 41.

386
01:09:33,724 --> 01:09:40,834
So in this list, this film is 38 and then 38 is two, and hopefully it will be an average.

387
01:09:52,134 --> 01:10:08,494
TV and movie reviews for video in the superior moving averages.

388
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:12,774
Star 83. That's the average.

389
01:10:18,634 --> 01:10:25,204
You never want to. The.

390
01:10:32,964 --> 01:10:46,474
At the 4 billion moving average used for recasting five is equal to the average of the city of four.

391
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:57,374
Isn't willing to do that.

392
01:11:05,504 --> 01:11:11,174
So I'm not going to talk about these and which.

393
01:11:11,174 --> 01:11:30,054
No. It's called the Computer Weekly, which appears produce the computer forecast for the next two months for people going to read the book.

394
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:34,014
So it's so close.

395
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:39,804
Here it is. And used it for August 1st three to.

396
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:56,894
The American average is going to be 1 to 1 first place and then is one.

397
01:11:57,014 --> 01:12:04,014
The next one is going to be the average. Of the.

398
01:12:07,954 --> 01:12:20,864
Observation in the video leading to the observation in the city.

399
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:28,294
We don't have observation in 3D, so we're going to use that for the 83 day work.

400
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:33,424
Is going to need an E 88.

401
01:12:37,504 --> 01:12:47,004
No, it is indeed. It is an. So instead of 611.

402
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:59,384
And then the next one was dragging 44 people.

403
01:12:59,394 --> 01:13:06,434
The average for the middle of 84 is going to be the forecast.

404
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:19,654
And the average of these three large cities, 25, I would call.

405
01:13:22,554 --> 01:13:25,644
The three mediums to zoom in a little bit, please.

406
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:26,754
Sure. Thank you.

407
01:13:35,004 --> 01:13:51,624
Equal to the average of the last three opinions on the last forecast, because we don't have observations or have any of that seen if it is right.

408
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:11,094
Is that? Is that. To personally destroy the.

409
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:26,974
Sitting on the 18th floor do the same things that you said.

410
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:32,264
So I got my forecast six weeks.

411
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:52,654
I just this one ones I guess my forecast let me block the whole thing with the computer that seemed to be missing and then see.

412
01:14:57,054 --> 01:15:02,734
Or to a period where you never see.

413
01:15:04,664 --> 01:15:15,394
Yeah. Or there's going to is some.

414
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:39,604
It was clear and this is still starvation compared to many of the early years of the so.

415
01:15:42,884 --> 01:15:53,834
Dr. Stone. And we hope this is the people from.

416
01:15:55,934 --> 01:16:05,534
And these seven people.

417
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:14,354
It's been seven years. He doesn't think it'll have to.

418
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:26,754
He's sitting in the 86, 86.

419
01:16:31,974 --> 01:16:37,604
We need. And divided by the count.

420
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:53,744
When I use the observation column, so I didn't have to delete any.

421
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:13,854
So I will on 053 and 44 billion moving average against some eight miners by square with the open parentheses.

422
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:57,774
Now I'll start with the mining world will want you to 80 CFA these things the anticipated my account of observations that amusing in the average.

423
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:14,404
There's going to be the way this is going zero eight So, you know, so that'll be a moving average.

424
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:23,264
It's better than it is for period moving averages that are in closer than four of that is.

425
01:18:27,384 --> 01:18:36,983
Looking at both of these local trends here, which are part of the seasonality and local trends,

426
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:49,374
but in each of these averages, only in this case overestimating the forecast or underestimating forecast.

427
01:18:49,764 --> 01:18:54,144
So in more accurately, more observation you get in the future.

428
01:18:54,564 --> 01:19:00,804
So that's why I tend to be improving out closer to them.

429
01:19:01,374 --> 01:19:12,324
The most recent observation is where you remember with holds we just get the out of the one year follow the last one.

430
01:19:18,794 --> 01:19:22,453
And we're going to plant the vineyard.

431
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:28,864
The vineyard? You.

432
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:41,404
Belief that. As.

433
01:19:50,724 --> 01:19:55,184
To me.

434
01:20:07,954 --> 01:20:24,274
Who do you think to control to with a huge debt load and do the right thing?

435
01:20:26,914 --> 01:20:34,924
On The A.V. Club and the special.

436
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:55,044
Newborns look her new new series of column names in the first row and values in the first column or

437
01:20:55,704 --> 01:21:10,374
two opinion only narratives of the four tests will look gas or gas over the 14 year moving average.

438
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:21,624
So it it's not like it is going to be flat because you have to have the average of four periods in the past three years compared with the averages.

439
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:29,503
You just must have. Six, ten and six.

440
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:33,794
11 year is what this is coming down from the.

441
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:45,294
I think we're out of time. So you have to do I think we solved most of the problem.

442
01:21:47,244 --> 01:21:52,974
You have a 21 exponential moving, maybe a moving average to move.

443
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:56,314
What is the same thing that we are doing?

444
01:21:56,334 --> 01:22:01,854
So it's good that you practice by yourself again.

445
01:22:01,854 --> 01:22:07,434
You can communicate with each other and keep your answers.

446
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,914
You do your homework and I'll be back in an hour.

447
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:16,134
We'll see you next week.

448
01:22:17,094 --> 01:22:37,684
I know all these office hours today when I complain to people and I'll leave the e-mail to the whole week in which I'll be back on campus on Monday.

449
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:50,754
One, there are two brownies, you know, surgical procedure he needed to keep.

450
01:22:55,764 --> 01:23:01,394
I know for sure he's my friend.

451
01:23:09,244 --> 01:23:20,174
And I was like, okay, that that was like me.

452
01:23:20,474 --> 01:23:26,114
Look, I've got to bring you food.

453
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:30,644
Yeah, here. It's that. It almost ours.

454
01:23:31,434 --> 01:23:36,394
So we'll see you guys eventually going.

455
01:23:36,484 --> 01:23:42,734
Yeah, yeah. That. That's not even a great.

456
01:23:43,124 --> 01:23:50,464
Oh, my God. Told you like your friends do that for drinks.

457
01:23:51,154 --> 01:24:00,124
Yes. I mean, you got you take a little break tomorrow.

458
01:24:00,224 --> 01:24:09,084
The same thing similar to the way you look at myself, you know?

459
01:24:12,404 --> 01:24:16,274
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I know.

460
01:24:16,274 --> 01:24:20,124
But I do feel like.

461
01:24:21,274 --> 01:24:24,614
Really? Are you going to like. Yeah, are you? Yeah. Yeah.

462
01:24:24,754 --> 01:24:51,344
So it's like, you know, it's just like, oh, my gosh, speaking about it, I was like, I guess it would be like maybe like that's what it would be.
